## Question

Are blood tests accurate for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether blood tests are accurate for diagnosing chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current gold-standard diagnostic methods and which specimen types they require. Then, I should verify the performance characteristics of those tests across urogenital and extragenital sites. Next, I will examine whether any evidence supports blood-based testing for these infections and why it might or might not make biological sense. After that, I should check guideline statements that implicitly or explicitly exclude blood as a specimen for routine diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and clinical implications with proper citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic standard. NAATs are the gold standard for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from mucosal specimens, and FDA clearance has expanded to include rectal and pharyngeal sites in addition to urogenital sampling, which aligns with longstanding CDC practice and multicenter validation work using composite reference standards for extragenital testing. For Trichomonas vaginalis, molecular methods similarly outperform older techniques, reinforcing NAATs as the preferred laboratory approach when available [^111ve1V8].

> I need to ensure the specimen types are correct for clinical practice. In women, vulvovaginal swabs, whether self-collected or clinician-collected, are recommended as first-line for chlamydia and gonorrhea NAATs, and in men, first-void urine is preferred for urogenital screening and diagnosis, with extragenital rectal and oropharyngeal swabs added based on exposure history and risk, given the substantial yield from these sites that would be missed if only urogenital specimens are tested [^112popfL]. Hold on, I should verify the strength of extragenital evidence; pooled multicenter studies consistently demonstrate robust performance at anorectal and oropharyngeal sites with high specificity, supporting routine use where indicated [^117UYHRj].

> Next, I should review performance characteristics so I don't overstate the case. Across validated platforms, NAAT sensitivity for CT and NG in extragenital sites generally ranges from the low 80s to near 100% with specificity typically above 98–99%, and NAATs for TV markedly outperform microscopy, which has notable false negatives, confirming the superiority of molecular methods at the site of infection compared with culture and wet mount techniques [^117UYHRj] [^117UYHRj]. Wait, let me verify urine performance as well; pooled analyses show high specificity for urine-based NAATs and good sensitivity, though in women vaginal swabs often perform slightly better than urine for CT/NG, which supports the vaginal swab as the optimal sample in many settings [^111EWsXG] [^117HQSQo].

> Now I will examine whether blood-based tests are supported. I should double-check the corpus for any mention of blood NAATs or serology for CT, NG, or TV diagnosis; I find none, and one high-quality cohort explicitly drew blood only for HIV and HSV-2 serology while conducting STI diagnosis via multiplex PCR on vulvovaginal swabs, indicating that blood was not used for CT/NG/TV diagnostics in that study design [^116vmsyy]. Hold on, I should verify guidelines as well; European BASHH/IUSTI guidance details urine and vaginal swabs and does not include blood as a diagnostic specimen for chlamydia, and USPSTF recommendations focus on urine and swabs for CT/NG screening rather than any blood test modality, further reinforcing the point [^112XdQk4] [^1165mEsB].

> But wait, what if pathophysiology suggests a role for blood detection? Let me think about the biology. These organisms are largely localized to mucosal epithelia at urogenital, rectal, or oropharyngeal sites; bloodstream invasion is atypical for chlamydia and trichomonas, and even with gonorrhea, systemic dissemination is diagnosed by culture or NAATs from sterile site fluids like synovial fluid rather than from blood, with recent work showing NAAT in joint fluid can exceed culture sensitivity for gonococcal arthritis, which is distinct from blood-based diagnosis and does not validate blood testing for routine CT/NG detection [^113zvuoW]. I should confirm that no validation studies in the corpus evaluate blood assays against composite NAAT standards for mucosal disease; indeed, such data are absent here, arguing against blood-based diagnosis in typical presentations.

> Hmm, wait a minute, could serology play a role similar to syphilis or HIV screening? Initially, I thought perhaps there were blood-based rapid tests for these pathogens, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; contemporary POC test development has yielded reliable serologic POC approaches for syphilis and HIV, whereas for CT, NG, and TV, accurate diagnosis relies on detecting organism nucleic acid at the infected mucosal site, and no guideline in this corpus recommends serology for routine diagnosis of CT/NG/TV [^113eBaLW] [^11766PzQ]. Let me reconsider my earlier thought; I should correct myself to emphasize that serology is not validated for diagnosing active mucosal CT/NG/TV infection and is not recommended in the cited guidance or multicenter validation frameworks in this set of sources [^112XdQk4] [^1165mEsB] [^111ve1V8].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications if one were to use blood tests anyway. I need to ensure the argument is quantitatively grounded; extragenital NAATs identify a large fraction of infections that urogenital-only strategies miss, on the order of 60–80% for some populations, which highlights that even within mucosal testing, sampling the correct site materially affects sensitivity, and it follows that a systemic sample like blood would perform worse given the mucosal localization of these pathogens in typical disease [^113vLAtF] [^112popfL]. I should confirm that the recommended approach remains site-specific NAAT sampling tailored to exposure history and symptoms to avoid underdiagnosis [^111ve1V8] [^117UYHRj].

> I will now examine specimen optimization to solidify best practice. Vaginal swabs in women tend to yield higher sensitivity than urine for multiple STIs including CT/NG/TV, and in men first-void urine is the preferred noninvasive option; these choices reflect both analytic performance and feasibility, and again, none of these pathways include blood as a diagnostic sample for these infections [^117HQSQo] [^1165mEsB]. Let me verify consistency with older comparative work; earlier analyses also support high specificity for urine NAATs while underscoring that cervical or vaginal sampling can optimize sensitivity, aligning with current guidance and further distancing blood from any diagnostic role here [^111EWsXG] [^111MeKAW].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm there is no contradictory evidence before concluding. Across guidelines and multicenter NAAT validation studies, accurate diagnosis of CT, NG, and TV requires NAATs on mucosal site specimens, with strong sensitivity and specificity, while no evaluated or recommended role exists for blood-based assays in routine diagnosis; exceptions like disseminated gonococcal infection rely on sterile site specimens rather than blood NAAT and do not generalize to typical mucosal disease [^111ve1V8] [^112XdQk4] [^113zvuoW]. Therefore, blood tests are not considered accurate or appropriate for diagnosing chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas in routine care; clinicians should use NAATs on urine, vulvovaginal or endocervical swabs, and rectal or oropharyngeal swabs as indicated by exposure and symptoms to avoid missed infections and ensure timely treatment [^1165mEsB] [^113vLAtF] [^117UYHRj].

No. Blood tests are not accurate for routine diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis [^112XdQk4] because these infections localize to mucosal sites [^1165mEsB] and are not reliably detected in blood. The recommended diagnostic method is **NAATs on urine or swabs** [^112XdQk4] from the relevant anatomical site [^114oCqv3], which provide high sensitivity and specificity [^117UYHRj]. Blood tests are only used for complications [^113zvuoW] or serologic surveillance, not for routine diagnosis.

## Diagnostic accuracy of blood tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis

Blood tests are **not recommended** for routine diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis [^112XdQk4] because these infections localize to mucosal surfaces and are not typically present in the bloodstream. These pathogens infect the genital, rectal, and pharyngeal mucosa, making blood-based detection unreliable [^117UYHRj].

---

### Chlamydia trachomatis

For Chlamydia trachomatis, **blood test limitations** arise because it primarily infects mucosal surfaces; bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the bloodstream) is rare, so blood tests are not reliable for detecting active infection. The **recommended diagnostic method** is nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) [^112XdQk4] on urine or cervical, urethral, rectal, or pharyngeal swabs — the gold standard with high sensitivity and specificity [^111EWsXG] [^116tJSpU].

---

### Neisseria gonorrhoeae

For Neisseria gonorrhoeae, **blood test limitations** mirror those for chlamydia: infection primarily involves mucosal surfaces, and bacteremia is uncommon; therefore, blood tests are not recommended for routine diagnosis. The **recommended diagnostic method** is NAATs [^111EWsXG] on urine or cervical, urethral, rectal, or pharyngeal swabs, offering high accuracy [^111ve1V8].

---

### Trichomonas vaginalis

For Trichomonas vaginalis, **blood test limitations** reflect that this protozoan infects the genital tract mucosa and does not typically enter the bloodstream, making blood tests ineffective for diagnosis. The **recommended diagnostic method** is NAATs on vaginal swabs or urine, which are the most accurate and have significantly higher sensitivity than traditional wet mount microscopy or culture [^113aefUz].

---

## Comparison of blood tests with other diagnostic methods

| **Infection** | **Blood test accuracy** | **NAAT accuracy** | **Recommended sample type** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Chlamydia | Low | High | Urine, cervical, urethral, rectal, pharyngeal swabs |
| Gonorrhea | Low | High | Urine, cervical, urethral, rectal, pharyngeal swabs |
| Trichomoniasis | Low | High | Vaginal swabs, urine samples |

---

Blood tests are significantly less accurate than NAATs for diagnosing chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. NAATs are the **gold standard** due to their high sensitivity and specificity [^116tJSpU] and are recommended by clinical guidelines for routine screening and diagnosis [^112XdQk4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines from organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [^111ve1V8] and European guidelines [^112XdQk4] consistently **recommend NAATs as the preferred diagnostic method** for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. Blood tests are not recommended for routine diagnosis of these infections due to their low accuracy and inability to detect localized mucosal infections [^1165mEsB].

---

## Situations where blood tests may be useful

Although blood tests are not recommended for routine diagnosis, they may be useful in specific clinical scenarios, including evaluating **complications** — such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) [^113zvuoW], where bacteremia may occur — and conducting **serologic surveillance** or epidemiologic studies to assess past exposure or immune response. They are not used to diagnose active infection.

---

## Limitations and challenges of blood tests

Blood tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis have several limitations:

- **Low sensitivity**: Blood tests have low sensitivity for detecting active infections, leading to false-negative results.

- **Low specificity**: Blood tests may cross-react with other pathogens, resulting in false-positive results.

- **Limited clinical utility**: Blood tests cannot accurately detect localized mucosal infections, limiting their clinical usefulness.

Blood tests are **not accurate** for diagnosing chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis. NAATs performed on urine or swab samples from the relevant anatomical site are the gold standard for diagnosis [^116tJSpU]. Blood tests are only useful in specific clinical scenarios, such as detecting complications or conducting serologic surveillance, and are not used for routine diagnosis [^112XdQk4].

### Clinical and laboratory testing for Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^111ZyVe6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is highly prevalent in the United States and worldwide. Traditional clinical diagnostic methods fail to identify more than half of these infections, which, if left untreated, can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and an increased risk of both acquiring and transmitting HIV. Women bear a disproportionate burden of these infections, and testing among populations at risk for this disease should be prioritized. Molecular technologies have expanded our capacity for laboratory-based detection of infection and can be used on samples already collected for chlamydia/gonorrhea screening.

Molecular diagnostic assays have transformed the field of infectious diseases, allowing for swift and highly sensitive detection of organisms previously challenging to diagnose, including infections due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). Extragenital sites such as the pharynx and rectum are important reservoirs for disease transmission. Pharyngeal NG infection may serve as an important source of NG antimicrobial resistance. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of infection interrupts transmission pathways, thus decreasing the risk for further spread to sex partners, acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and the spread of NG resistance.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have become the gold standard for detecting NG and CT infections in the urogenital tract. However, prior to this study, none were cleared for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in pharyngeal or rectal sites, despite widespread use and recommendation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Therefore, such testing was only available in select clinical laboratories and reference laboratories that have completed verification studies according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. FDA clearance will extend availability of those assays to laboratories serving public health and clinical settings, thus filling an important gap in the prevention and control of these infections.

Demonstrating the performance of new NAATs that have greater analytic sensitivity than the traditional culture-based reference.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^1162twaZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

BV has long been considered a nuisance condition. This attitude is reflected in the lack of attention afforded to the condition by some care providers, leading to persistence in the employment of empiric diagnosis for vaginal disorders, encompassing methods which are often inaccurate and lead to incorrect therapy. Just as STIs and HIV were once described as having "epidemiological synergy", our study supports the concept that STIs and BV are intersecting clinical states with commonalities in disturbance of the vaginal microbiome that ultimately are inconsistent with optimal sexual and reproductive health. Given the rising rates of STIs in the United States and elsewhere, and the established adverse health outcomes associated with lack of diagnosis and treatment of them, every strategy should be pursued to decrease their prevalence.

To this end, the CDC recommends that all women diagnosed with BV be tested for STIs. Routine NAAT testing for women with vaginal complaints provides the opportunity for increased accuracy in diagnosis and treatment for both the underlying cause of vaginal symptoms and for the presence of STIs. A possible scenario for risk-based screening for STIs using NAATs for the diagnosis of vaginitis instead of Gram stain and culture could entail reflex STI NAAT testing in the laboratory for women who are NAAT-positive for BV. This approach has the potential to positively impact STI control; however, implementation of such a scheme is dependent on outcomes of investigations into the accuracy of identifying the risk of concomitant STI by relying on a NAAT-based approach.

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^112UPXgz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Each specimen was tested by four NAATs to minimize potential bias. When using only three tests that compare a single test to results from only two other assays, bias is related to the variability in performance of the two comparator tests when these two results are not concordant. Furthermore, the use of only two comparators could potentially generate skewed results if either of the comparators performed very well or very poorly. In these circumstances, sensitivity and specificity cannot be estimated, and performance is measured in percent positive and negative agreement.

In our study, the performance of each assay was calculated by comparison to a composite reference standard (CRS) where infection was defined by results from three other assays. Thus, for each assay, a specimen was considered positive if at least two of the other three comparator results were positive, and negative if at least two of the other three assay results were negative. Since at least two concordant results were required to classify samples as positive or negative, samples that generated 1) a single positive result, 2) a single negative result, and 3) an unresolvable invalid result were unevaluable for the comparison.

It is important to note that while four assay results were generated for each sample, the CRS comprised only the three results for which an estimate was not being calculated. Thus, when estimating the sensitivity of the m2000, results generated by that assay were not included in the CRS; only results from the MAX, cobas, and AC2 contributed to defining infection status.

### Successful combination of nucleic acid amplification test diagnostics and targeted deferred Neisseria gonorrhoeae culture [^111DkMDt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are recommended for the diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infections due to their superior sensitivity. However, increasing NAAT use reduces crucial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance data, which rely on culture. We analyzed the suitability of the ESwab system for NAAT diagnostics and deferred targeted N. gonorrhoeae culture to allow for selective and efficient culture based on NAAT results.

This study included patients visiting the STI Clinic Amsterdam, The Netherlands, in 2013. Patient characteristics and urogenital and rectal samples for direct N. gonorrhoeae culture, standard NAAT, and ESwab were collected. Standard NAAT and NAAT on ESwab samples were performed using the Aptima Combo 2 assay for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Two deferred N. gonorrhoeae cultures were carried out on NAAT-positive ESwab samples after storage at 4°C for 1 to 3 days.

We included 2,452 samples from 1,893 patients. In the standard NAAT, 107 samples were N. gonorrhoeae positive, and 284 were C. trachomatis positive. The sensitivities of NAAT on ESwab samples were 83% (95% confidence interval, 75 to 90%) and 87% (95% CI, 82 to 90%), respectively. ESwab samples were available for 98 of the gonorrhea-positive samples. Of these, 82% were positive in direct culture, and 69% and 56% were positive in the 1st and 2nd deferred cultures, respectively, with median storage times of 27 and 48 hours, respectively. Deferred culture was more often successful in urogenital samples or when the patient had symptoms at the sampling site.

### A new strategy for trichomonas testing female adolescents in the emergency department [^116xDtRe]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Sensitive trichomonas diagnostic testing, including nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and a rapid antigen test, has become available. The study aimed to determine if adding sensitive trichomonas testing to routine female sexually transmitted infection (STI) evaluations would increase trichomonas identification and treatment.

- **Design**: Two study time periods were used. Study Time 1 (T1) was a retrospective review, while Study Time 2 (T2) was a prospective study.

- **Setting**: Emergency Department.

- **Participants**: Symptomatic female patients aged 13–20 years (N = 447).

- **Interventions**: Implementation of routine trichomonas testing in the Emergency Department during T2.

- **Main outcome measures**: Trichomonas diagnosis and treatment rates were compared during T1 and T2.

- **Results**: During T1, 31 of 234 eligible patients (13%) were tested for trichomonas. Laboratory-confirmed trichomonas was identified in 3 of 234 patients (1.3%). During T2, 212 of 213 eligible patients (99.5%) were tested for trichomonas. Of these, 39 of 212 tested trichomonas-positive (18.4%). The rapid trichomonas antigen test was positive in 29 of 212 patients (13.6%; P < .001), and 33 of 188 tested trichomonas NAAT-positive (15.5%; P < .001). Trichomonas treatment was administered to 3 of 3 laboratory-confirmed cases during T1 (100%), compared with 37 of 39 during T2 (95%; p = 0.688). During T1, 14 of 17 women who received trichomonas treatment (82.4%) did not have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, whereas during T2, 13 of 52 women without a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (25%) were treated for trichomonas.

### Confirming positive results of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for Chlamydia trachomatis: All NAATs are not created equal [^111KSsf4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended confirming positive screening tests for Chlamydia trachomatis when positive predictive values are less than 90%. It is accepted that less sensitive tests, such as culture and immunoassays, should not be used to confirm the results of more sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). We show that the same principle applies when NAATs are used for confirmation.

### Simultaneous evaluation of diagnostic assays for pharyngeal and rectal Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis using a master protocol [^111ve1V8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Using a master protocol to evaluate multiple assays in a single study population, we generated diagnostic performance data for three assays at two anatomic sites, which supported regulatory submission for two of the manufacturers. The FDA cleared the Aptima Combo 2 Assay and the Xpert CT/NG assay for marketing on 23 May 2019, an important step for public health that is expected to expand testing reach, thereby improving control of these infections and their attendant complications.

A unique strength of this study included collaboration between device manufacturers, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, and the FDA to develop a composite reference method to use as a comparator. That composite reference method allowed for the efficient evaluation of multiple assays with higher analytic sensitivity than the traditional culture-based standard. This feasible and efficient master protocol study design can and should be replicated for the evaluation of other infectious diseases diagnostics. Given the rapidly developing and widespread problems with antimicrobial resistance in NG, future studies may include testing of diagnostics that can rapidly identify antimicrobial-resistant strains, allowing for more appropriate and targeted treatment.

### Nucleic acid amplification tests for diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis rectal infections [^113vLAtF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

It is uncertain which methods for the diagnosis of rectal gonococcal and chlamydial infection are optimal. This study evaluated the performance of culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for rectal chlamydial and gonococcal diagnosis. From July 2003 until February 2007, 441 rectal test sets were collected from individuals attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and three HIV clinics who gave a history of anal intercourse or were women at high risk for Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Rectal swab specimens were tested using culture and commercial NAATs employing transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), and PCR amplification.

Test performance was evaluated using a rotating standard by which patients were classified as infected if either two or three comparator tests were positive. Test sensitivities for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae ranged from 66.7% to 71.9% for culture to 100% for TMA. Specificities were 99.7% to 100% for culture and greater than 95.5% for all three NAATs. Test sensitivities for C. trachomatis ranged from 36.1% to 45.7% for culture and among NAATs from 91.4% to 95.8% for PCR to 100% for TMA. Specificities of the NAATs ranged from 95.6% to 98.5% (two-of-three standard) and from 88.8% to 91.8% (three-of-three standard).

Over 60% and 80% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections, respectively, among men who have sex with men and over 20% of chlamydial infections in women would have been missed if the rectal site had not been tested. Currently available NAATs are more sensitive and specific than culture methods for these infections.

### Evaluation of the Hologic Aptima Combo 2 assay for detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from joint fluid specimens [^113zvuoW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. Nucleic acid amplification testing is the preferred method for routine diagnosis of gonorrhea from urogenital specimens, although culture is commonly used for diagnosing disseminated infections, including gonococcal arthritis. The Hologic Aptima Combo 2 (AC2), a transcription-mediated amplification assay, is FDA and Health Canada licensed for detection of *N. gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis* from urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal specimens, but not joint fluid. In the study, we compared the performance of microscopy, culture, and the AC2 for detection of *N. gonorrhoeae* from 170 joint fluid specimens.

A total of five specimens were culture-positive, whereas 14 were AC2-positive. Gram-negative diplococci, characteristic of *Neisseria*, were observed in only two joint fluid specimens. Complementary testing confirmed the presence of *N. gonorrhoeae* in seven discordant (i.e. culture-negative/AC2-positive) specimens. These results indicate that the AC2 is more sensitive than culture for the diagnosis of gonococcal arthritis.

### Comparing first-void urine specimens, self-collected vaginal swabs, and endocervical specimens to detect Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae by a nucleic acid amplification test [^116NBhyS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

We set out to determine the prevalences of *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* by ligase chain reaction, as well as to assess the prevalence of *Trichomonas vaginalis* by culture in a large and diverse national sample of non-health-care-seeking young women entering the military. We also sought to compare the effectiveness of three different specimen collection techniques: first-void urine, self-collected vaginal swab, and clinician-collected endocervical swab, in identifying a positive specimen.

A cross-sectional sample of young women was voluntarily recruited. As part of their routine entry pelvic examination, they completed a self-administered reproductive health questionnaire and provided first-void urine samples (used to detect *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae*) and self-collected vaginal swabs (used to detect *C. trachomatis*, *N. gonorrhoeae*, and *T. vaginalis*). The number of positive tests divided by the number of sexually active women screened by each sampling method determined the rates of prevalence.

The overall rate of infection with any of the three sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) tested was 14.1%. The total positive rates for each STD (identified by one or more specimens) were as follows: for *C. trachomatis*, 11.6%; for *N. gonorrhoeae*, 2.4%; and for *T. vaginalis*, 1.7%. The proportions of positives identified by specimen type for *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* were, respectively: endocervix, 65% and 40%; urine, 72% and 24%; and vagina, 81% and 72%.

The proportions of positives when specimen results were combined were, for *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae*, respectively [text appears incomplete].

### Assessment of self-taken swabs versus clinician-taken swab cultures for diagnosing gonorrhoea in women: Single centre, diagnostic accuracy study [^117XZy2B]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of STIs is increasing in the UK, and accessible testing needs to be made available. Culture for gonorrhoea has historically been problematic in clinical areas outside of hospitals due to reduced sensitivity associated with delays in specimen transportation to the laboratory. With NAATs, such delays do not affect the sensitivity of gonorrhoea detection. This, in addition to our finding of increased sensitivity and excellent specificity, supports the more widespread use of NAATs for gonorrhoea detection in women. Self-taken vulvovaginal swabs analyzed for gonorrhoea using AC2 were superior to culture and equivalent to clinician-taken endocervical samples analyzed by AC2. Vulvovaginal swabs can be a non-invasive way to screen for both chlamydia and gonorrhoea in women with no symptoms for whom examination is unnecessary. This means that women will not need to have a genital examination for gonorrhoea detection, reducing health economic costs in clinician time and equipment use.

However, the antibiotic resistance to N. gonorrhoeae is increasing, which has led to a recent change in the UK's recommended antibiotic treatment of gonorrhoea to high-dose intramuscular ceftriaxone with azithromycin. Gonococcal cultures are currently the only routine method of assessing antibiotic sensitivity, which is important for optimizing the clinical care of patients and for antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Ideally, women found to have gonorrhoea on NAATs should be referred to centers where gonorrhoea cultures can be performed.

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^117UYHRj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Research using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has repeatedly found rectal and oropharyngeal infections with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to be common and potentially more difficult to treat than genital infections. Unfortunately, public health and patient care efforts have been hampered by the lack of FDA-cleared NAATs with claims for anorectal or oropharyngeal samples. At the time of the initiation of this study, no commercially available assays had these claims.

We formed a novel partnership among academic institutions and diagnostic manufacturers to address this public health need. From May 2018 through August 2019, we recruited 1108 women, 1256 men, and 26 transgender persons, each of whom provided three anal and three oropharyngeal swab specimens. The three anal swabs were pooled into a single transport tube, as were the three oropharyngeal swabs. The performance of each of the three study assays was estimated by comparison to the composite result and relative to one another.

- **Results**
- **Chlamydia detection**: Percent positivity was 5.9% from anal and 1.2% from oropharyngeal specimens compared to 4.2% and 4.1% for gonorrhea. Sensitivity for chlamydia detection ranged from 81.0% to 95.1% and 82.8% to 100% for anal and oropharyngeal specimens, respectively.
- **Gonorrhea detection**: Sensitivity ranged from 85.9% to 99.0% and 74.0% to 100% for anal and oropharyngeal samples, respectively. Specificity estimates were ≥ 98.9% for all assays, organisms, and sample types.

Although there was heterogeneity between sensitivity estimates, these assays offer a better ability to detect extragenital infections.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^114U3yGt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginal symptoms are a leading cause of primary care visits for women. Individuals exhibiting symptoms often receive laboratory testing based on clinic-specific standards of care. Women seen at a family practice clinic might only receive a vaginitis workup, whereas those at a sexually transmitted diseases clinic could be more likely to receive only sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing.

The likelihood of STIs was assessed in women from whom samples were tested for vaginitis using a molecular diagnostic assay. Positivity rates for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis DNA were detected using the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay, and concordance between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay for detection of T. vaginalis was determined.

Women with bacterial vaginosis, alone or with co-infections of Candida spp, had high rates of coinfection with sexually transmitted infections (24.4%–25.7%); samples from women who were negative for vaginitis had significantly lower positivity rates (7.9%; P < 0.001). Trichomonas vaginalis results were concordant between the BD MAX Vaginal Panel and the BD MAX CT/GC/TV assay in 559 of 560 samples tested.

These data suggest, as have other studies, that women with vaginitis symptoms may be at risk for an STI. Molecular testing could provide broad diagnostic coverage for symptomatic women and improve patient management, regardless of the type of clinic in which patients are treated.

### Evaluation of the specificities of five DNA amplification methods for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^113G19UT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

The intragenus specificities of five molecular diagnostic methods for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* were determined. Three assays were considered suboptimal. Molecular detection of *N. gonorrhoeae* from sites where other *Neisseria* spp. commonly occur or from any site in low-prevalence settings should be confirmed by a test targeting a different genetic locus.

### Comparison of the cobas 4800 CT/NG test with culture for detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae in genital and nongenital specimens in a low-prevalence population in New Zealand [^113xqVHY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the clinical utility of replacing microbial culture for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), we compared *N. gonorrhoeae* culture with the cobas 4800 CT/NG test for 18,247 urogenital and 666 nongenital samples. For urogenital specimens, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the cobas *N. gonorrhoeae* PCR were 98.7%, 100%, 95.6%, and 100%, respectively, and for nongenital specimens, the values were 100%, 99.8%, 92.9%, and 100%, respectively. In our test population, 37% (10,185) of patients tested over the study period were screened for *C. trachomatis* by PCR but were not screened for gonorrhea by culture. Of these, 43 were *N. gonorrhoeae* positive by PCR and therefore went undiagnosed. The cobas 4800 CT/NG test diagnosed 33% (n = 30) more urogenital and 25% (n = 3) more rectal gonorrhea infections than culture did and, based on the above performance indicators, does not require supplementary testing for urogenital or rectal specimens. The ability to test noninvasive specimens (such as urine and self-taken vulvovaginal swabs) for *N. gonorrhoeae* will enable more patients to be screened for infection, thus offering significant positive public health benefits.

### Performance of point-of-care tests for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111BE3YA]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 127.2 million new cases of CT occur globally every year, with most cases originating from resource-limited countries. Untreated CT infection in women can lead to serious complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. Among men, CT infection is associated with non-gonococcal urethritis and epididymitis.

CT infection in pregnant women can contribute to adverse obstetric outcomes such as preterm birth and low birthweight. In addition, genital CT infection significantly increases the risk of HIV transmission and human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical carcinoma development. Because over 70% of CT infections in women and 50% in men are asymptomatic, effective control often relies on screening and treating infected cases.

Benefits of CT screening have been demonstrated through reduced rates of PID and prevention of adverse obstetric outcomes among pregnant women. Screening for CT is largely dependent on the availability and accessibility of tests to target populations. Laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provide highly accurate diagnoses but are usually neither affordable nor accessible in developing countries, as they require laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel, and incur high costs. Additionally, there is often a delay in reporting test results.

Across study populations, there was no evidence that the prevalence of any infection differed compared to ANC attendees, except for lower trichomoniasis prevalence among family planning clinic attendees (aPR TV: 0.54 [0.32–0.90]). Studies diagnosing chlamydia with a rapid antigen test (aPR CT: 2.94 [1.76–4.92]), gonorrhoea with culture (aPR NG: 1.60 [1.00–2.54]), and trichomoniasis with wet mount (aPR TV: 1.61 [1.14–2.29]) had higher prevalence than those that used NAAT, after accounting for diagnostic test performance. Study observations were heterogeneous for all three infections, with observation-level random effect variance comprising 36.4%, 60.8%, and 50.9% of total variance for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis, respectively.

### 2015 European guideline on the management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^114dek1X]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, particularly concerning nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), the BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend not testing semen specimens. This is due to the strong correlation between the positivity of first-void urine and semen, the convenience of obtaining first-void urine, and the difficulty in determining if C. trachomatis detected in semen originates exclusively from the urethra.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pooling urine, anorectal, and oropharyngeal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VyKCa]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Data from the 2021 WHO global progress report on HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections indicate a global incidence of 128 million new chlamydia and 82 million new gonorrhoea cases in 2020. Representing neglected pandemics, these infections cause a significant global disease burden.

There are population groups disproportionately affected by STIs, including men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers (SW) and their clients, transgender people (TG), adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), and pregnant women. There is a high prevalence and incidence of STIs among people taking pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) and young women attending contraceptive services in East and Southern Africa, many of which would have been missed if syndromic STI management had been used. This has led to a push for greater access to aetiological testing in PrEP programmes.

Major gaps persist in the availability of diagnosis and treatment for CT/NG, with STI programmes and services generally underfunded despite high levels of morbidity and mortality.

### Evidence against the "booty pack": Trichomonas not associated with gonorrhea or chlamydia [^113zzMKy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Many emergency physicians, armed with a positive Trichomonas wet mount, will also treat for Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). This study estimates the association between Trichomonas microscopy results and a DNA test result for GC or CT. Using laboratory records from patients who had simultaneous sampling for all three infections, we calculated an odds ratio for the association between the Trichomonas result and a positive test for either GC or CT. Among 795 eligible females, 105 (13%) had Trichomonas, 74 (9%) had CT, and 35 (4%) had GC. While CT and GC were strongly associated with each other (odds ratio 5.9, 95% confidence interval 2.8–12.4, p < 0.0001), Trichomonas infection was unrelated to infection with either GC or CT (odds ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.6–2, p = 0.9). Trichomonas results do not predict results for GC and CT; they should not influence the decision to treat for GC and CT.

### Identifying a consensus sample type to test for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and human papillomavirus [^117HQSQo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global cause of acute illness. Early detection plays a crucial role in interrupting transmission and preventing complications. However, the accessibility of STI testing is limited by the lack of an overall preferred sample type. By means of a prospective study in female sex workers (FSW), we compared the sensitivity of samples from different anatomical sites in detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and human papillomavirus. Additionally, we documented the prevalence of each STI in this high-risk population.

- **Methods**: We selected 303 FSW and tested them for each STI by nucleic acid amplification testing on two vaginal and cervical swabs from different manufacturers, cervical smear, and first-void urine. The sensitivity of each sample type was compared for each infectious agent to identify a consensus sample type.

- **Results**: Vaginal swabs were superior to all other sample types, with an overall sensitivity of 86%. The sensitivity was the lowest for first-void urine, detecting only 63% of positive cases. The prevalence was 3.3% (10/299) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae; 9.0% (27/299) for Chlamydia trachomatis; 7.4% (22/298) for Trichomonas vaginalis; 10.8% (32/296) for Mycoplasma genitalium, and 55.6% (158/284) for human papillomavirus.

- **Conclusions**: When testing for STIs, vaginal swabs are the sample of choice, and first-void urine should be avoided. Designating self-sampled vaginal swabs as a consensus sample type enables harmonization of STI testing and extension.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a prototype rapid chlamydia and gonorrhoea recombinase polymerase amplification assay: A multicentre cross-sectional preclinical evaluation [^116DKZ3g]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Low credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are significant contributors to the burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in England as well as elsewhere. They are frequently asymptomatic, especially in women, commonly remaining undiagnosed, and, if untreated, they can lead to serious complications.

Currently, it can take up to two weeks to obtain CT and NG results and treatment after STI testing in sexual health clinics (SHCs) in the UK, but delays may be considerably longer in other settings. During this period, sexual risk-taking may continue, including the acquisition of new partners. Rapid and accurate CT/NG point-of-care tests (POCTs), enabling diagnosis and treatment of infected patients within the same clinical visit (a 'test and treat' strategy), could potentially reduce rates of inappropriate presumptive treatment, shorten time to treatment, decrease rates of untreated CT and NG for patients lost to follow-up, limit onward transmission, and reduce rates of sequelae.

British Association for Sexual Health and HIV guidelines state that CT and NG detection must use nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and/or culture for NG. A number of rapid and point-of-care NAAT-based tests for CT and NG are being or have recently been developed. Newer NAAT technologies that use isothermal amplification, avoiding the need for thermal cycling, have the potential to enable fast turnaround times from sample to result. TwistDx (Cambridge, UK) has developed an isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) method, which can detect CT/NG infection.

### Multiplexed technologies for sexually transmitted infections: Global evidence on patient-centered and clinical health outcomes [^116M17dy]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosing, treating, and managing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) represent key pillars to reduce STI transmission and significant morbidity, making them crucial targets across the spectrum of STI management. Approximately 1 million curable STIs are acquired globally each day, leading to an average of 376 million STIs acquired annually worldwide, primarily in resource-limited settings. While a vast majority of these infections are asymptomatic, if left untreated, they can cause lifelong and often serious complications. Evidence from epidemiological studies has shown that commonly occurring STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis increase the transmission of HIV. Moreover, behaviors associated with acquiring HIV infection increase the risk of acquiring additional STIs and worsening severity among those with existing infections.

STIs are conventionally diagnosed and confirmed using laboratory-based tests, which are considered the reference (gold standard) on account of their high diagnostic accuracy. However, they include culture and often entail multiple patient visits due to the longer turnaround time to test results, requiring at minimum two visits: one to collect samples and another to communicate test results to individuals. Additionally, sample transportation adds to the challenges, leading to inaction and consequent losses to follow-up. Furthermore, these tests often require substantial laboratory infrastructure operated by trained personnel, making them difficult to carry out in remote settings. This situation adversely affects rural communities.

### Supplementary testing is not required in the cobas 4800 CT/NG test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae weak-positive urogenital samples [^111qtWPa]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Weak-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic acid amplification test results are difficult to interpret. We show that the frequency of unconfirmed N. gonorrhoeae results from the cobas 4800 test rises exponentially after 38.0 cycles, where the likelihood of an unconfirmed result exceeds 29%. Supplementary testing of such samples should be avoided; instead, treatment should be based on clinical pretest probability.

### Prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis among male and female general populations in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2024: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^115LNKno]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

Our analysis was primarily limited by sparse and heterogeneous data. Our systematic search identified only 211 studies in 28 of 48 sub-Saharan African countries. There were particularly few studies in Central Africa (12 studies in 6 countries) and among men (37 studies in 15 countries). We were therefore unable to generate estimates specific to Central Africa or determine whether temporal prevalence trends differed by sex. Our estimates for Southern Africa relied predominantly on studies conducted in South Africa (51 of 59 studies in the sub-region), which limited our ability to assess the representativeness of both these studies and our estimates for the broader sub-region.

Limitations related to study representativeness and reporting, and adjustments made in our analysis, may have influenced our estimates. Given the lack of population-representative studies, we used ANC attendees as the reference category for our prevalence estimates. At least 65% of studies focused exclusively on sexually active individuals, including antenatal, family planning, and gynecology clinic attendees, and HIV/STI prevention trial participants. We considered these groups to be representative of the general population, which may result in overestimating STI prevalence compared to the total adult population. Variability in reporting across studies hindered our adjustment of estimates for HIV prevalence, granular and mutually exclusive age groups, or urban/rural location, which likely influenced sub-regional heterogeneities. Furthermore, our adjustments for diagnostic test performance may have been affected by the available data.

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^114XdK8L]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Specimen handling and testing: Four collection-only trial sites did not process or test samples. These sites shipped specimens in PreservCyt weekly to one of four pre-assigned laboratories responsible for specimen aliquoting and testing. Samples were aliquoted into each of four manufacturer's transport tubes, and NAATs were performed using platforms available in each laboratory. Specimens were shipped to other testing labs for analysis using platforms that were not supported at their laboratory. No single laboratory performed all four NAATs used in this study, so aliquoted samples were shipped weekly to a second laboratory performing NAATs not covered by the first laboratory.

For aliquoting, specimens in PreservCyt were vortexed for 10 seconds, and 0.5 mL was transferred to each of the transport tubes used for the following assays: m 2000 RealTime CT/NG assay (m2000; Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) and the MAX CT/GC/TV (MAX; BD Integrated Diagnostic Solutions, Sparks, MD). The Roche cobas 6800/8800 CT/NG (cobas; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) assay uses PreservCyt directly and, therefore, a 4 mL sterile cryovial received 0.75 mL of the PreservCyt sample for shipment to a cobas testing site. At laboratories performing testing using the cobas assay, 0.5 mL of the sample was transferred to 1.0 mL PreservCyt in a transport tube used on the cobas 6800 instrument. In order to have three results to compare to each assay, a 0.5 mL aliquot was also prepared for a fourth assay (Aptima Combo 2 CT/GC assay (AC2), Hologic, San Diego, CA).

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^115PEGzH]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

One point of concern about molecular testing for NG is related to cross-reactivity with closely related species, which is particularly concerning for oropharyngeal sampling since many of these species are commensal organisms in that compartment. Assays have continued to address this issue for testing with genital sample types, and the list of closely related organisms included by each manufacturer in their exclusivity analyses (to verify no reactivity with these species) is extensive. Furthermore, the use of three comparator tests to determine the specificity of each assay is a strength of the study that gives us confidence that the positive results are indeed a reflection of infection with NG.

It is important to note that for any sample that generated two positive and two negative results (of which we saw only 10/2,390, or 0.4%, results in this study), the assay being evaluated was always classified as incorrect (i.e. false negative or false positive), so the bias would be to underestimate performance. We feel confident that the use of molecular testing alone, without culture or other less sensitive detection methods, was an appropriate strategy for estimating performance for NG, even from oropharyngeal specimens.

This novel study design and unique collaboration may provide a model for future studies of diagnostic tests where emergency use is important (COVID-19 pandemic is an example) or where public health needs do not provide corporations with sufficient incentives to offset the substantial commitments required for clinical studies. One example might be seeking FDA clearance.

### Prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis among male and female general populations in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000 to 2024: A systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^113ctWpE]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

We systematically searched Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), Global Health (Ovid), PubMed, and African Index Medicus from January 1, 2000, to September 17, 2024, for studies assessing the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomoniasis in sub-Saharan Africa. Search term domains included relevant terms and synonyms for "sexually transmitted infections" and "sub-Saharan Africa" (see Supplementary Table S1). We also searched citations from relevant published systematic reviews.

We included studies reporting sex-stratified empirical data on the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, or trichomoniasis among adults from the general population in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2024. Studies were considered representative of the general population if they enrolled participants from antenatal care (ANC), family planning, or gynaecology clinics; primary healthcare or other outpatient services; educational institutions; or community venues (e.g. social spaces or places of worship); or recruited participants for HIV or STI prevention trials (baseline data only) or population-representative surveys. Studies were eligible regardless of participants' symptom status. However, we excluded studies that exclusively enrolled symptomatic individuals or those seeking treatment for STIs or infertility. We also excluded studies with participants solely from populations living with HIV or key populations.

We included studies with participants aged 12 years or older who were tested using internationally recognized standards.

### Systematic review: Noninvasive testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^111EWsXG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Testing of urine samples is noninvasive and could overcome several barriers to screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, but most test samples are obtained directly from the cervix or urethra.

- **Purpose**: To systematically review studies that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid amplification tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urine specimens and to compare test characteristics according to type of assay, site of sample collection, presence of symptoms, disease prevalence, and characteristics of the reference standard.

- **Data sources**: Relevant studies in all languages were identified by searching the MEDLINE database (January 1991 to December 2004) and by hand-searching the references of identified articles and relevant journals.

- **Study selection**: Studies were selected that evaluated one of three commercially available nucleic acid amplification tests, included data from tests of both a urine sample and a traditional sample (obtained from the cervix or urethra), and used an appropriate reference standard.

- **Data extraction**: From 29 eligible studies, two investigators independently abstracted data on sample characteristics, reference standard, sensitivity, and specificity.

- **Data synthesis**: Articles were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Summary estimates for men and women were calculated separately for chlamydial and gonococcal infections and were stratified by assay and presence of symptoms. The pooled study specificities of each of the three assays exceeded 97% when urine samples were tested for both chlamydial and gonococcal infections.

### False-positive gonorrhea test results with a nucleic acid amplification test: The impact of low prevalence on positive predictive value [^111qY4zM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Five false-positive gonorrhea test results from a private laboratory using a nucleic acid amplification test led to an investigation by the Hawaii State Department of Health. No unexplained increase or variation in the laboratory's positive gonorrhea test results was detected. The proportion of positive gonorrhea test results among tests performed in the population was 1.06%. The calculated positive predictive value (PPV) of the test in this setting was 60%.

Documentation of sexual histories was lacking for all cases. It is imperative to obtain a sexual history for both assessing sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk and interpreting STD test results. The possibility that positive test results may be false should be considered when patients have unanticipated positive test results. Clinicians who perform STD screening tests should know the approximate prevalence of STDs in the population being screened and have a conceptual understanding of PPV and the impact of low prevalence on screening tests with imperfect specificity.

### Point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections: A review of recent developments [^113eBaLW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common communicable diseases globally and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Point-of-care tests have the potential to revolutionize the prevention and control of STIs by enabling rapid diagnosis and early treatment of infections, thus interrupting transmission and preventing the sequelae of untreated infections. Currently, there are several point-of-care (POC) tests available for the diagnosis of Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections, although these tests differ with regard to their performance, turnaround time, and cost.

- **Objective**: To provide an updated review of the POC tests available and under development for the diagnosis of T. pallidum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis infections. The review also aims to discuss the context for which these tests might be used and to highlight future directions for test development.

- **Data sources**: We reviewed the literature pertaining to the recent development and performance evaluations of POC tests for the diagnosis of syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas.

- **Conclusions**: Recently, there has been rapid development of new POC tests for STIs. Although there are inexpensive, rapid, and accurate POC tests available for syphilis, there are few such tests available for the diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomonas, and currently none with the ability to detect antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae.

### Sexually transmitted infections: Challenges ahead [^112Aq4t9]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization estimated that nearly 1 million people become infected every day with any of four curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs): chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Despite their high global incidence, STIs remain a neglected area of research. In this Commission, we have prioritized five areas that represent particular challenges in STI treatment and control.

- **Chlamydia remains the most commonly diagnosed bacterial STI in high-income countries**: Despite widespread testing recommendations, sensitive and specific non-invasive testing techniques, and cheap effective therapy, chlamydia continues to be prevalent. We discuss the challenges for chlamydia control and evidence supporting a shift from focusing on infection-based screening to improved management of diagnosed cases and chlamydial morbidity, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.

- **Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae**: The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is globally recognized. We review potential future control and treatment strategies, with a focus on novel antimicrobials.

- **Bacterial vaginosis as the most common vaginal disorder in women**: Treatments are associated with frequent recurrence. Recurrence after treatment might relate to evidence suggesting that sexual transmission is integral to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. This has substantial implications for the development of effective management approaches.

STIs disproportionately affect low-income and middle-income countries. We review strategies for case management, focusing on point-of-care tests that hold considerable potential for improving outcomes.

### Vaginitis and risk of sexually transmitted infections: Results of a multi-center U.S. clinical study using STI nucleic acid amplification testing [^114JQ6ZE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

A strength of this study is the assessment of specimens collected prospectively from a large cohort of women enrolled from 21 geographic sites and a variety of clinical practice types across the United States. Also important are the employment of consensus Nugent score and a standardized methodology for obtaining Amsel criteria results for BV diagnosis, the use of dual media culture for the diagnosis of candidiasis, and the use of highly sensitive FDA-cleared NAATs for STI diagnosis.

Limitations of the study include the lack of comparative analyses for the 317 women in the cohort with signs and symptoms of vaginitis/vaginosis who were negative for BV, candidiasis, and all four STIs; some of the women enrolled in this category were originally diagnosed with non-infectious causes of irritation/itching/burning, such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, irritant dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. We also did not include HIV infection status in the analysis of the women enrolled in the study, although most (99%) women in the cohort were categorized as HIV-negative. Finally, the number of CT and NG infections in the cohort studied was relatively small, which may have led to inaccuracies in estimating the significance of the association of these STIs with clinical and laboratory diagnoses. In spite of this, we did find that, similar to previous studies, women with only CT infections had an OR of 2.44 for infection in BV+ vs BV− (adjusting for VVC), although this increase in risk was not significantly different from controls.

### Hormonal contraception alters vaginal microbiota and cytokines in South African adolescents in a randomized trial [^116vmsyy]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Molecular testing was conducted for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Mycoplasma genitalium using multiplex PCR at each visit as described. If any of these laboratory-based tests were positive, appropriate targeted therapy was prescribed and recorded.

Blood samples were obtained for HIV rapid testing and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) serology. A vulvo-vaginal swab was collected for bacterial vaginosis (BV) testing, which involved Gram staining and Nugent scoring. The scoring categories were BV negative (Nugent 0–3), intermediate (Nugent 4–6), or positive (Nugent 7–10). Additionally, microscopy was performed to detect Candida hyphae and spores. Treatment for BV was only offered to participants presenting with clinical symptoms in accordance with South African syndromic management guidelines.

Vaginal pH was measured using color-fixed indicator strips provided by Macherey-Nagel in Düren, Germany.

### Rapid point of care test for detecting urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in nonpregnant women and men at reproductive age [^116tJSpU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chlamydia trachomatis (C trachomatis) is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections, causing significant reproductive health issues for both men and women. Given that this infection is often asymptomatic and linked to complications such as subfertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pain, confirming its presence is crucial. Diagnostic technologies for C trachomatis are categorized into laboratory-based tests and rapid point-of-care (POC) tests. Laboratory tests include culture, nucleic acid amplification tests, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), direct fluorescent antibody, nucleic acid hybridization, and transformation tests. Rapid tests encompass solid-phase EIA and solid-phase optical immunoassay. POC tests are beneficial as they can be completed within 30 minutes without needing costly or complex equipment, allowing immediate results presentation and the potential for prompt treatment of infected patients.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point-of-care (POC) testing for detecting urogenital C trachomatis infection in nonpregnant women and men of reproductive age, verified using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) as the reference standard.

- **Search methods**: In November 2019, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. Additionally, we explored Web of Science, two trial registries, and an abstract database, and we screened reference lists of included studies for additional references.

### Point-of-care testing for sexually transmitted infections: Recent advances and implications for disease control [^11766PzQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a major global public health issue, with more than 448 million incident bacterial infections each year. This paper reviews recent advances in STI point-of-care (POC) testing and implications for STI prevention and control.

- **Recent findings**: Accurate immunochromatographic assays to detect HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis antibodies have made home or supervised self-testing possible. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and excellent test characteristics for HIV, HCV, and syphilis POC tests. Rapid oral HIV tests are now available for purchase at retail sites across the United States. Combined HIV and syphilis tests using a single finger prick blood sample are under evaluation.

- **Summary**: Oral POC STI tests with comparable performance to blood-based POC tests are available for self-testing. POC tests can expand screening, improve syndromic management, and reduce the loss to follow-up. They have the potential to facilitate prompt treatment and partner services. Moreover, POC STI tests create opportunities for new social and financial models of community-based testing services. Increasing equity and access to testing will present challenges in linkage to care, quality assurance, partner services, and surveillance. These important developments warrant research to understand appropriate contexts for implementation.

### Correlation of leukorrhea and Trichomonas vaginalis infection [^1158WvBp]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) causing vaginitis. Although microscopy has poor sensitivity, it is often used for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in resource-poor settings. Our study aimed to provide a more reliable diagnosis of trichomoniasis by investigating its association with leukorrhea.

Women presenting for evaluation of vaginal discharge, STI exposure, or preventive gynecologic examination were evaluated for Trichomonas infection. Vaginal pH was determined, and microscopy was performed by the provider, who recorded the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per epithelial cell and the presence of clue cells, yeast, and/or motile trichomonads. Leukorrhea was defined as greater than one PMNL per epithelial cell.

Culture and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) were used to detect T. vaginalis. Patients were also evaluated for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using NAATs, and for bacterial vaginosis using Gram stains. A total of 294 women were enrolled in the study, and 16% were found to have Trichomonas (46/294).

Trichomonas infection was more common in parous non-Hispanic, black women who reported low rates of contraceptive use (33% versus 17%; P = 0.02) and a history of STIs (85% versus 55%; P = 0.002). These women were more likely to report vaginal discharge (76% versus 59%; P = 0.02) and have an elevated vaginal pH (87% versus 48%; P < 0.001) as well as gonorrhea infection (15% versus 4%; P = 0.002). Leukorrhea was associated with a four-fold increased risk of Trichomonas infection. Leukorrhea on microscopy was associated with Trichomonas vaginitis.

### Gonorrhea and chlamydia in the emergency department: Continued need for more focused treatment for men, women and pregnant women [^111EPs27]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Delay in nucleic acid amplification testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis has led to recommendations for presumptive treatment for patients with suspected infections and unreliable follow-up. In urban settings, it is assumed many patients have unreliable follow-up; therefore, presumptive therapy is frequently used. This study sought to measure the frequency of disease and the accuracy of presumptive treatment for these infections.

- **Methods**: This observational cohort study was performed at an urban academic Level 1 trauma center ED, with an annual census of 95,000 visits per year. Testing was conducted using the APTIMA Unisex swab assay (Gen-Probe Incorporated, San Diego, CA). Presumptive therapy was defined as receiving treatment for both infections during the initial encounter without confirmation of diagnosis.

- **Results**: A total of 1162 patients were enrolled. Infection was present in 26% of men, 14% of all women, and 11% of pregnant women. Despite the high frequency of presumptive treatment, more than 4% of infected patients in each category went untreated.

- **Conclusion**: Inaccuracy in presumptive treatment was common for these sexually transmitted infections. There is an opportunity to improve diagnostic accuracy for treatment.

### Molecular-based testing for sexually transmitted infections using samples previously collected for vaginitis diagnosis [^116ZcbgY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Vaginitis, which most often manifests clinically as abnormal discharge, dysuria, odor, or itching, is one of the most common causes of primary care office visits for women in the United States. Women seek care from a variety of provider types or clinical settings, including obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYN), family planning, family practice, internal medicine, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. For symptomatic women, diagnostic testing often depends on the clinic type, available diagnostic services, and provider assumptions about their clientele. These real-world factors could result in restricted diagnostic testing of some causes of vaginitis, to the exclusion of others.

In addition, comprehensive diagnostic testing for women in primary care settings can be hampered by a reliance on clinical methods (e.g. wet prep microscopy and visual assessment of discharge) that are subjective and/or require specialized equipment and training. In other cases, testing may carry stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). As public funds continue to be withdrawn from STD-specific clinical services, primary care providers must take on the additional responsibility of providing these services for their clients. Making this type of testing both simple (e.g. through the use of a single sample) and normative (i.e. it is provided for everyone with these symptoms) will both improve services for women and reduce the stigma associated with STI testing.

A distinction is often drawn by providers between vaginitis (which is generally not perceived as an STI) and STIs.

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^113kjw3C]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

One of the difficulties of comparative analyses is the collection of multiple swabs per site. While this is not generally a major barrier for vaginal swabs, when considering anorectal swabs, it becomes a more significant issue. For oropharyngeal sample collection, which, if done correctly, sometimes induces a gag response in patients, it is a substantial barrier. Based on the clinical experience of the team, we targeted the collection of three swabs per site as feasible for most patients. The use of three swabs rather than a single sample ensured that we would have a sufficient concentration of the organisms (if present) in the 10 mL of pooled sample to mimic a single swab collected in an assay transport device.

Thus, each anatomic site (oropharyngeal and anorectal) was sampled using three Dacron swabs from the Abbott multi-collect specimen collection kit (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). These swabs were validated for use with each of the assays prior to study initiation. Immediately following specimen collection, each of the three swabs was broken off at a score mark and placed in a single vial containing 10 mL of PreservCyt (Hologic, Foxborough, MA) medium. This strategy, which was arrived at in consultation with the FDA, was designed to avoid sample collection variation by pooling three samples into a single vial that could then be aliquoted for testing by each of the assays. PreservCyt was chosen as a universal medium because each assay had been previously demonstrated to be compatible with this medium. Swabs were neither lubricated nor pre-moistened before specimen collection.

### Prospective comparison of cell cultures and nucleic acid amplification tests for laboratory diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections [^116o6Eiw]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Specimens submitted in M5 medium for cell culture detection of Chlamydia trachomatis were tested by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and in cell cultures. Of 35 genital and 26 nongenital specimens positive for C. trachomatis, 21 and 14 specimens, respectively, were detected exclusively by NAAT. NAAT is significantly more sensitive than cell culture (P < 0.0001) and should be considered the new "gold standard" for the laboratory diagnosis of C. trachomatis infections.

### Evaluation of Gen-Probe APTIMA-based Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis confirmatory testing in a metropolitan setting of high disease prevalence [^116Aehj9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Prompted by reports challenging the validity of the low-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis results generated by the APTIMA Combo 2 assay (Gen-Probe, Incorporated) and by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to confirm N. gonorrhoeae- or C. trachomatis-positive screens by using an alternative amplification target, we report on a comparison of this means of confirmation with an in-house algorithm of repeat testing.

Primary clinical specimens yielding N. gonorrhoeae- or C. trachomatis-specific luminescent values between 100,000 and 1,000,000 were repeat tested in duplicate. A subset of specimens was forwarded for confirmatory assays (Gen-Probe) individualized for alternative N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis targets.

An 18-month audit revealed that 230 of 29,977 C. trachomatis screens (0.8%) and 41 of 29,064 N. gonorrhoeae assays (0.1%) yielded low-positive data. When a subset of 40 low-positive N. gonorrhoeae screens was repeat tested, 20 (50.0%) remained positive; 22 (55.0%) of the screens remained positive following performance of the confirmatory assay.

In contrast, repeat testing of 153 low-positive C. trachomatis screens yielded a positive result for fewer specimens (n = 97; 63.4%) than when commercial confirmatory testing was used (n = 124; 81.0%). However, confirmation of the results for additional C. trachomatis screens by use of an alternative target did not translate into significant differences in the calculated overall C. trachomatis-positive screen rates (7.39% by repeat testing versus 7.52% by the confirmatory assay).

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^112popfL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

For decades, it has been appreciated that Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) could infect the oropharynx and rectum. In the field of sexually transmitted infections (STI), these are commonly referred to as extragenital infections, despite the fact that ocular and other infections are also non-genital in nature, and we will use that nomenclature throughout this report. Interest in extragenital infections increased when Kent and colleagues reported that nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of oropharyngeal or anorectal swab specimens showed that these infections were far more common than previously thought.

The number of infections identified among men who have sex with men (MSM) from whom samples were collected from all mucosal sites was often as high as double the number identified using the standard practice of testing only for urethral infection. In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended annual CT and NG screening of rectal and oropharyngeal sites among MSM. This recommendation was included in the 2010 Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines and during the same meetings, the optimal method for detecting these infections was determined to be NAAT, which was described in the recommendations for laboratory diagnosis of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Both of these recommendations were made despite the fact that no assays were cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use with anorectal or oropharyngeal specimens at that time. Further research has shown that oropharyngeal CT and NG infections are more common than previously believed.

### Utility of pooled urine specimens for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in men attending public sexually transmitted infection clinics in Mumbai, India, by PCR [^1153HoLA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Pooling urogenital specimens for the detection of *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* by nucleic acid amplification tests is an attractive alternative to individual testing. Pooling can reduce the costs of testing as well as labor, making it suitable for resource-poor settings. However, it has neither been widely adopted nor thoroughly evaluated in developing countries. We evaluated the practical use of pooling first-catch urine (FCU) specimens for the detection of *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* from 690 men in Mumbai, India, by PCR. FCU, urethral smears, and swabs were collected from men seen at two sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. All laboratory testing was conducted at the Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital.

- **Testing methods**: Gram stain smears and culture isolation for *N. gonorrhoeae* were performed. Each FCU was tested individually and in pools using the Roche Amplicor PCR for *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* with an internal control for inhibition. Specimen pools consisted of aliquots from five consecutively processed FCUs combined into an amplification tube. An optical density reading of ≥ 0.20 indicated a pool for which subsequent testing of individual samples was required.

- **Results**: Prevalence by PCR on single specimens was 2.2% (15/690) for *C. trachomatis* and 5.4% (37/690) for *N. gonorrhoeae*. Compared to individual FCU results, pooling for *C. trachomatis* and *N. gonorrhoeae* had an overall sensitivity of 96.1% (50/52). Specificity was 96.5% (83/86) as three pools required single testing that failed to identify a positive specimen. Pooling missed two positive cases.

### Multicenter comparison of nucleic acid amplification tests for the diagnosis of rectal and oropharyngeal Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections [^112cfKEd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Low credibility.

Research using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) has repeatedly found rectal and oropharyngeal infections with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to be common and potentially more difficult to treat than genital infections. Unfortunately, public health and patient care efforts have been hampered by the lack of FDA-cleared NAATs with claims for anorectal or oropharyngeal samples. At the time of the initiation of this study, no commercially available assays had these claims.

We formed a novel partnership among academic institutions and diagnostic manufacturers to address this public health need. From May 2018 through August 2019, we recruited 1,108 women, 1,256 men, and 26 transgender persons, each of whom provided 3 anal and 3 oropharyngeal swab specimens. The 3 anal swabs were pooled into a single transport tube, as were the 3 oropharyngeal swabs. The performance of each of the three study assays was estimated by comparison to the composite result and relative to one another.

- **Percent positivity for infections**: Percent positivity for chlamydia was 5.9% and 1.2% from anal and oropharyngeal specimens, respectively, compared to 4.2% and 4.1% for gonorrhea.

- **Sensitivity estimates**: Sensitivity for chlamydia detection ranged from 81.0% to 95.1% and 82.8% to 100% for anal and oropharyngeal specimens, respectively. Gonorrhea sensitivity ranged from 85.9% to 99.0% and 74.0% to 100% for anal and oropharyngeal samples, respectively.

- **Specificity estimates**: Specificity estimates were ≥ 98.9% for all assays, organisms, and sample types.

Although there was heterogeneity between sensitivity estimates, these assays offer better ability to detect extragenital infections than culture and potential solutions for public health screening efforts.

### Assessment of self taken swabs versus clinician taken swab cultures for diagnosing gonorrhoea in women: Single centre, diagnostic accuracy study [^11255cws]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To compare gonorrhoea detection, self-taken vulvovaginal swabs were tested with nucleic acid amplification tests and compared to the culture of urethral and endocervical samples taken by clinicians.

- **Design**: Prospective study of diagnostic accuracy.

- **Setting**: One sexual health clinic in an urban setting (Leeds Centre for Sexual Health, United Kingdom), between March 2009 and January 2010.

- **Participants**: Women aged 16 years or older, attending the clinic for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, who consented to perform a vulvovaginal swab themselves before routine examination. During examination, clinicians took urethral and endocervical samples for culture and an endocervical swab for nucleic acid amplification testing.

- **Interventions**: Urethra and endocervix samples were analysed by gonococcal culture. Vulvovaginal swabs and endocervical swabs were analysed by the Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) assay; positive results from this assay were confirmed with a second nucleic acid amplification test.

- **Main outcome measures**: Positive confirmation of gonorrhoea.

Of 3,859 women with complete data and test results, 96 (2.5%) were infected with gonorrhoea. Overall test sensitivities were as follows: culture 81%, endocervical swabs with AC2 96%, and vulvovaginal swabs with AC2 99%. The AC2 assays were more sensitive than culture (P < 0.001), but the endocervical and vulvovaginal assays did not differ significantly (P = 0.375). Specificity of all Aptima Combo 2 tests was 100%. Of 1,625 women who had symptoms suggestive of a bacterial STI, 56 (3.4%) had gonorrhoea (culture 84%, endocervical AC2 100%, vulvovaginal AC2 not provided).

### Predictive value of the clinical diagnosis of lower genital tract infection in women [^116xdHLR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that diagnostic approaches to lower genital tract infections are inaccurate and proposed this study to evaluate typical approaches.

- **Study design**: Clinical diagnoses were made with symptoms, direct observation, wet mount, vaginal pH, and amines in 598 women with genital complaints. Laboratory testing for *N. gonorrhoeae, yeast, T. vaginalis, C. trachomatis*, and bacterial vaginosis were conducted by Gram stain.

- **Results**: The most frequent symptoms were vaginal discharge (64%), change in discharge (53%), malodor (48%), and pruritus (32%). The infection rates were 46% bacterial vaginosis, 29% yeast, 12% trichomoniasis, 11% chlamydia or gonorrhea; 21% of the patients had no infection. The symptoms did not predict laboratory diagnosis. Clinical signs and symptoms with office-based tests and microscopy improved the accuracy of diagnoses. Amsel's clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was the most sensitive at 92%. The sensitivity of wet mount diagnosis of trichomoniasis was 62%, of yeast by microscopy was 22%, and of mucopus for the prediction of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia was 30%.

- **Conclusion**: Symptoms alone should not be used to direct treatment in instances in which resources permit more complete evaluation with office-based testing that includes microscopy. Treatment failures or diagnostic uncertainty should prompt specific laboratory testing.

### Assessment of self taken swabs versus clinician taken swab cultures for diagnosing gonorrhoea in women: Single centre, diagnostic accuracy study [^111MeKAW]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We found that vulvovaginal and endocervical samples analyzed by the AC2 assay for gonorrhoea are significantly more sensitive than standard gonorrhoea culture. The culture method missed nearly 20% of gonorrhoea cases. The specificity of AC2 for gonorrhoea detection was excellent; however, in low prevalence settings, it is prudent to confirm a positive NAAT with a second test using a different target.

In women without symptoms, the vulvovaginal swab is the sample of choice and has the advantage of allowing non-invasive sampling. For women who need a clinical examination, we recommend vulvovaginal swabs either taken themselves or by a clinician. Although the sensitivity of vulvovaginal and endocervical samples were identical for gonorrhoea detection in women with symptoms, we found that vulvovaginal swabs were superior to the endocervical sample for chlamydia detection. In view of the excellent results of vulvovaginal swabs evaluated by nucleic acid amplification, women and clinicians can be confident that such tests are as accurate as those performed by clinicians for the detection of gonorrhoea.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, specifically with respect to NAATs, BASHH/IUSTI 2016 guidelines recommend using first-void urine specimens for men (up to 20 mL sampled ≥ 1 hour after previous micturition) and vulvo-vaginal swabs for women (either healthcare worker- or self-collected) as the first choice for diagnosis of urogenital chlamydial infections with NAATs.

### Nucleic acid amplification testing compared with cultures, gram stain, and microscopy in the diagnosis of vaginitis [^113aefUz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for the diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis, and *Trichomonas vaginalis*.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted involving women with (n = 200) and without (n = 100) vulvovaginal symptoms. Participants were enrolled from outpatient gynecology offices and a vulvovaginal referral clinic. Vaginal swabs were analyzed using wet mount microscopy, yeast culture, gram stain, *T. vaginalis* culture, and NAAT. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed.

- **Results**: Among symptomatic women, the sensitivity of microscopy was 48.5% for VVC and 75% for *T. vaginalis*. Sensitivities of NAAT and culture for diagnosing VVC were 92.4% and 83.3%, respectively, whereas these methods demonstrated 100% and 93.8% sensitivity for *T. vaginalis*. The sensitivity for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis by clinical criteria ("Amsel criteria"), gram stain, and NAAT were 98.7%, 82.7%, and 78.7%, respectively. Test concordance rates were high between culture and NAAT for *Candida* species (91%) and between gram stain and NAAT for the detection of bacterial vaginosis (88%). Among asymptomatic women, 20%-21% tested positive for bacterial vaginosis by gram stain or NAAT, and 8%-13% were colonized with *Candida* species based on culture or NAAT.

- **Conclusions**: Given the limitations of wet mount sensitivity for VVC and *T. vaginalis*, culture or NAAT testing should be considered when evaluating women with symptoms of vaginitis who test negative by microscopy. Although Amsel criteria accurately diagnosed bacterial vaginosis, NAAT is preferred in some scenarios.
