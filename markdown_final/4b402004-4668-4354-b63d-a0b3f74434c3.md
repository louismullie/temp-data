## Question

a patient with aspiration pneumonia perioperatively, treated with ceftriaxone, what is an appropriate antibiotic to deescalate to, and for how long

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to de-escalate antibiotic therapy for perioperative aspiration pneumonia in a patient already receiving ceftriaxone, and for how long the treatment should continue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is aspiration pneumonitis versus true aspiration pneumonia. Then, I should verify whether anaerobic coverage is necessary or harmful. Next, I will review microbiology data and clinical stability to decide if de-escalation is safe. After that, I will choose the narrowest effective agent and confirm dosing. Finally, I will determine the shortest evidence-based duration and outline a reassessment plan if the patient is not improving as expected.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the initial therapy choice. Perioperative aspiration often presents as chemical pneumonitis that resolves with supportive care, but if there is radiographic pneumonia with fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum, antibiotics are indicated; ceftriaxone is a reasonable empiric choice for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia because it covers typical CAP pathogens and some oral anaerobes, aligning with guideline-concordant CAP therapy rather than routine extended anaerobic coverage [^1168zSU9] [^117QEo5G].

> Wait, let me verify the role of anaerobes before I consider de-escalation. Contemporary data show anaerobes are infrequently isolated in aspiration pneumonia, and extended anaerobic coverage does not improve mortality but increases C. difficile risk. The 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommends not routinely adding anaerobic coverage unless lung abscess or empyema is suspected, so ceftriaxone's limited anaerobic activity is generally sufficient for uncomplicated cases [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8] [^1158a3Gy].

> I need to check the microbiology and clinical trajectory before changing therapy. If cultures are negative and the patient is clinically improving at 48–72 hours, de-escalation to monotherapy is appropriate. If cultures are positive, I should narrow to the narrowest active agent. If cultures are negative but the patient is not improving, I should reassess for complications or alternative diagnoses rather than automatically escalating anaerobic coverage [^112yzFRx] [^111Ewmrk].

> Hold on, I should verify the de-escalation target. Given ceftriaxone already provides limited anaerobic coverage and covers typical CAP pathogens, the most straightforward de-escalation is continuation of ceftriaxone monotherapy if the patient is improving and there is no evidence of abscess or empyema; alternatives like amoxicillin or doxycycline are reasonable if the patient stabilizes and can transition to oral therapy, but switching from IV ceftriaxone to another IV agent solely to "add anaerobic coverage" is not supported and may increase harm [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8].

> Let me consider dosing to ensure pharmacokinetic adequacy. Standard adult dosing for ceftriaxone is 1–2 g IV every 24 hours; in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance or severe infection, higher dosing such as 2 g every 12 hours may be warranted to achieve pharmacodynamic targets, but I should confirm local protocols and patient-specific factors before escalating [^116MBhxR] [^1132XXKh].

> Next, I should review duration. I initially thought 7–10 days might be needed, but wait, I should double-check guideline shifts toward shorter courses. The BTS 2023 statement supports a 5-day total course for aspiration pneumonia if the patient is improving, and the 2019 ATS/IDSA CAP guideline recommends duration guided by clinical stability with a minimum of 5 total days, so a 5-day total course is appropriate if the patient achieves stability and responds clinically [^1121NzV4] [^112RuRoF].

> I will now examine the reassessment checkpoints to ensure safe de-escalation. At 48–72 hours, I should confirm clinical stability (afebrile for ≥ 48 hours, heart rate ≤ 100, respiratory rate ≤ 24, systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air or baseline oxygen, and normal mentation), review culture results, and assess for complications such as abscess or empyema; if the patient is not improving, I should broaden the differential, obtain chest CT if indicated, and consider bronchoscopy rather than reflexively adding anaerobic coverage [^111Ewmrk].

> But wait, what if the presentation is aspiration pneumonitis rather than pneumonia. I should confirm that antibiotics are truly indicated. Early antibiotics for sterile chemical pneumonitis do not improve outcomes and may increase downstream antibiotic exposure, so supportive care and observation are preferred unless secondary infection is evident, which reinforces the importance of distinguishing pneumonitis from pneumonia at the bedside [^114UiLH5] [^1168zSU9].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: if the patient with perioperative aspiration pneumonia is clinically improving on ceftriaxone and there is no evidence of lung abscess or empyema, de-escalate to ceftriaxone monotherapy and complete a total of 5 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical stability. If cultures identify a specific pathogen, tailor to the narrowest active agent. If the patient is not improving by 48–72 hours, reassess for complications or alternative diagnoses before expanding coverage [^113bfzA8] [^1121NzV4] [^111Ewmrk].

---

For perioperative aspiration pneumonia treated with ceftriaxone, **no de-escalation is needed** if the patient is clinically improving, because ceftriaxone already provides limited anaerobic coverage and is appropriate for uncomplicated cases [^1168zSU9] [^117QEo5G]. If anaerobic coverage was added empirically (e.g. metronidazole or clindamycin), **stop the anaerobic agent once the patient stabilizes and there is no abscess or empyema** [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8]. Treat for a total of **5 days**, ensuring at least 48 hours of clinical stability before discontinuation [^1121NzV4] [^112RuRoF].

---

## Indications for de-escalation

De-escalation is guided by clinical improvement, microbiological data, and the absence of complications. In ceftriaxone-treated aspiration pneumonia, **de-escalation is generally unnecessary** because ceftriaxone already provides limited anaerobic coverage and is appropriate for uncomplicated cases [^1168zSU9] [^117QEo5G]. De-escalation is considered if:

- **Anaerobic coverage was added empirically**: If metronidazole or clindamycin was added, it can be stopped once the patient stabilizes and there is no evidence of abscess or empyema [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8].

- **Microbiological data supports narrowing**: If cultures identify a specific pathogen with narrower active agents, therapy can be tailored accordingly [^112vfNNp].

- **Clinical stability is achieved**: The patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and improving clinically [^112RuRoF].

---

## Recommended de-escalation strategy

Based on current guidelines and evidence, the following **de-escalation strategy** is recommended:

| **Initial therapy** | **De-escalation strategy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone monotherapy | No de-escalation required | Ceftriaxone provides appropriate coverage for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia [^113bfzA8] [^1158a3Gy] |
| Ceftriaxone + metronidazole or clindamycin | Stop metronidazole or clindamazole once clinically stable and no abscess/empyema | Extended anaerobic coverage is unnecessary and increases C. difficile risk [^113bfzA8] [^1158a3Gy] |
| Ceftriaxone + MRSA coverage (e.g. vancomycin) | Discontinue MRSA coverage if cultures are negative and patient is improving | Avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy and reduce adverse effects [^112yzFRx] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **recommended duration** of antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia is **5 days**, ensuring at least 48 hours of clinical stability before discontinuation [^1121NzV4] [^116N89Kk]. This approach balances efficacy with minimizing adverse effects and resistance.

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with de-escalation

De-escalation is associated with several positive outcomes, including **reduced antibiotic resistance** — narrowing therapy reduces selective pressure and resistance development [^112vfNNp] — and **fewer adverse effects**, including a lower risk of C. difficile infection and other antibiotic-related complications [^113bfzA8]. Shorter antibiotic courses and narrower spectra can also reduce treatment costs and resource utilization [^111GRV5a].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

While de-escalation is generally safe, clinicians should remain vigilant for:

- **Clinical deterioration**: If the patient worsens, reassess for complications (e.g. abscess, empyema) and adjust therapy accordingly [^111Ewmrk].

- **Inadequate initial coverage**: Ensure initial therapy was appropriate for the clinical context and local epidemiology [^113BLNdp].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider immunocompromised status, severe illness, or other factors that may necessitate broader coverage [^1169m5ie].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Ceftriaxone monotherapy**: Appropriate for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia; no de-escalation required [^113bfzA8] [^1158a3Gy].

- **Added anaerobic coverage**: Stop metronidazole or clindamycin once clinically stable and no abscess/empyema [^1168zSU9] [^113bfzA8].

- **Duration**: Total of 5 days, ensuring at least 48 hours of clinical stability [^1121NzV4] [^112RuRoF].

- **Monitoring**: Reassess clinically at 48–72 hours; adjust therapy if deterioration occurs [^111Ewmrk].

---

Ceftriaxone alone is appropriate for uncomplicated perioperative aspiration pneumonia; **stop added anaerobic agents once stable** and treat for a total of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability before discontinuation.

### Effectiveness of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [^1138oByX]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist on the effectiveness of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline in the treatment of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults hospitalized for pneumonia between January 1999 and July 2001 at an academic medical center. Outcomes were compared for patients with CAP treated with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline versus other appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapies. Outcomes were adjusted with the use of a propensity score to account for differences in patient characteristics and illness severity between groups.

Results

A total of 216 patients were treated with ceftriaxone plus doxycycline and 125 received other appropriate initial empiric antibiotic therapies. After adjustment, use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline was associated with reduced inpatient mortality (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08–0.81) and 30-day mortality (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17–0.81), but not with length of stay or readmission rates. Analysis of a subset of the sample that excluded patients admitted from nursing homes, patients admitted to the ICU, and patients diagnosed with aspiration also showed reduced inpatient mortality with the use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline.

Conclusions

The use of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline as an initial empiric therapy for patients hospitalized with CAP appears safe and effective, and its potential superiority should be evaluated prospectively.

Interpretation

In conclusion, our study adds to the existing evidence that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia and is associated with a greater risk of C difficile colitis. It is reasonable to treat these patients with a first-line antibiotic therapy for CAP such as ceftriaxone without adding clindamycin or metronidazole.

### Qualitative cultures in ventilator-associated pneumonia-can they be used with confidence? [^112yiuKx]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic and clinical evidence used to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia vary depending on the number of clinical criteria present. Bacteriological confirmation that rules out other diseases can be achieved by quantitative or qualitative cultures of tracheal aspirate. The rate of tracheal colonization in ventilated patients reduces the usefulness of qualitative cultures, but the absence of multiresistant micro-organisms in cultures from patients on prior antibiotics or a sterile culture in patients without prior antimicrobials may provide sufficient justification to stop or de-escalate antibiotics. However, more accurate guidance regarding whether antibiotics are unnecessary and should be stopped is provided by quantitative culture.

### Principles of antibiotic therapy in severe infections: optimizing the therapeutic approach by use of laboratory and clinical data [^116Jb9KK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasingly daunting problem of antimicrobial resistance has led to an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, as well as on the bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrum empirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves de-escalation of therapy or even its discontinuation.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^111UKZ2s]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Three patients did not receive anti-MRSA antimicrobial agents, even though MRSA infection was identified, because the patients were improving with initial antibiotics. All three patients survived. The MRSA isolated from quantitative tracheal aspirate might not be true pathogens. If the bacteria were merely colonizing pathogens, but not the cause of infection, then the initial antimicrobial therapy would be inappropriate. Quantitative TA allows the identification of pathogens in the great majority (90%) of cases. The antibiotic regimen of three other patients with S. maltophilia was changed to include TMP/SMX and the broad-spectrum antibiotics were switched to narrow-spectrum antibiotics.

The pneumonia-related mortality rate was not significantly different in the de-escalation group compared to the non-de-escalation group at day 14 (P = 0.08). The pneumonia-related mortality and overall mortality at day 30, however, was significantly lower in the de-escalation group (P = 0.03). This finding is consistent with the results reported by Kollef et al. The pneumonia-related mortality was associated with the 5-day APACHE II score and the 5-day CPIS, even with the adjustment for other factors in addition to the scores at baseline in this study.

The 5-day APACHE II score and the 5-day CPIS were significantly lower in the de-escalation group compared to the non-de-escalation group. The cause of high mortality in the non-de-escalation group was probably related to the high APACHE II score and modified CPIS on day 5, as well as the timing of de-escalation (Table 2). This suggests that de-escalation is effective in patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia who have a more stable severity-of-illness index on days 3 to 5 after the diagnosis of pneumonia. The mean changes in CPIS in the de-escalation group were higher, although this result was statistically insignificant, than in the non-de-escalation group. De-escalation was not performed in patients with a category 3 APACHE II score and CPIS at the time of de-escalation. However, patients in category 1 can be safely de-escalated, and those in category 2 can be considered for de-escalation on the basis of the clinical response of the pneumonia.

### Treatment of aspiration in intensive care unit patients [^1167XRej]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Aspiration is a common event, but the clinical consequences are variable. The primary determinants are the nature of the aspirated material and the host response to it. The purpose of this paper is to present treatment algorithms that should be employed in critically ill patients who experience aspiration.

Methods

Expert review of the available literature was done to provide background information to support the logic of 3 treatment algorithms: (1) treatment of acute aspiration pneumonitis; (2) pulmonary care for acute aspiration; and (3) treatment of aspiration pneumonia.

Results

The discussion of aspirations is separated into 2 clinical scenarios: (1) aspiration pneumonitis (sterile inflammation) versus (2) aspiration pneumonia (an infectious process). Aspiration pneumonitis should be treated by aggressive pulmonary care to enhance lung volume and clear secretions. Intubation should be used selectively. Early corticosteroids and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated. Treatment of aspiration pneumonia requires diligent surveillance for the clinical signs of pneumonia. Treatment decisions are based on 3 factors: (1) clinical diagnostic certainly (definite versus probable), (2) time of onset [early (< 5 days) versus late (≥ 5 days)], and (3) host factors (high risk versus low risk). There is no ideal antibiotic regimen. Unit-specific resistance patterns and known frequency pathogens should direct broad spectrum empiric therapy. Invasive diagnostic techniques (such as bronchoalveolar lavage) should be used when the diagnosis is not certain. Antibiotic coverage should be narrowed once sputum culture results become available.

Conclusions

Aspiration is common in critically ill patients and should be aggressively treated by these treatment algorithms.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^114UfuF4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the clinical effectiveness rates of CTRX and ABPC/SBT were compared in patients with CAP without risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, this comparison has not been investigated in previous studies. Both antibiotics showed a high clinical effectiveness rate, and no significant differences were found between CTRX and ABPC/SBT at EOT (p = 0.072) in the VPP population. However, at day 7, the clinical effectiveness rate was higher for ABPC/SBT than for CTRX (p = 0.047). A similar result was obtained on days 4 and 7 in the MITT population (p = 0.018, 0.007).

It has been reported that there is no significant difference between β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins in the treatment of CAP. However, most of those previous reports were retrospective studies, except for one that, unfortunately, did not undertake a direct comparison between β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and third-generation cephalosporins. Those studies included cases of aspiration pneumonia. For aspiration pneumonia, Hasegawa reported in a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis that mortality was not significantly different between ABPC/SBT and CTRX groups. However, whether the two drugs show equivalent effectiveness in the treatment of pneumonia without aspiration risk remains unclear. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the efficacy of CTRX and ABPC/SBT in the treatment of patients with CAP without risk factors for aspiration pneumonia.

The differences in efficacy between CTRX and ABPC/SBT in CAP treatment would be due to anaerobic bacteria, which are common causes of aspiration pneumonia. However, anaerobic bacteria can also cause pneumonia in patients without apparent risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. In a previous study that carried out a bacterial floral analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in patients with CAP, 17.9% of detected bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were anaerobic, even in patients without risk factors for aspiration. Although the authors stated that it was unclear whether anaerobic bacteria were the primary cause, their results suggest that anaerobic bacteria may cause pneumonia in some patients without risk factors for aspiration. These reasons might explain the difference in effectiveness rate in the early phase between CTRX and ABPC/SBT in the present study, because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to third-generation cephalosporins is lower than that to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Criteria for evaluation

The primary outcome was the clinical response at EOT in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population. The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment (at days 4 and 7) and at EOS in the VPP population, and the mortality rate at 30 days of admission in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population. The VPP population was defined as patients who received treatment with the study drug for ≥ 4 days in cases of clinical cure, or ≥ 3 days in cases of clinical failure without a protocol violation or missing data. The following patients were excluded: those lacking information or clinical data; those treated with other antibiotics in addition to the study drug; and those treated with systemic corticosteroids affecting the judgment of the effectiveness of treatment in the VPP population. All patients treated with one or more doses of the study drug were included in the MITT population.

The effectiveness of treatment was assessed by blinded investigators. The assessment was based on clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, serum CRP, and chest radiography. Serum CRP and chest radiography were not used for the assessment on day 4, because the findings might appear to be worse than those on day 1 despite an improvement in patient condition. The clinical response was classified into three categories: improving, indeterminate, or worsening. The test drugs were discontinued and changed to other antibiotics when the clinical response was judged to fall in the latter two categories. "Effective" on days 4, 7 and EOT was defined as a case in which the clinical response was judged as improving at the respective time point. Late response at EOS was classified into three categories: cure, relapse, and failure. Patients with resolution of signs and symptoms of pneumonia were classified as "cure", whereas those with recurrent fever related to pneumonia after day 7, after being primarily judged as improving by EOT, were classified as "relapse", and those without improvement of signs and symptoms of pneumonia or with need for alteration of antibiotics were classified as "failure".

### The clinical diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1137fRdi]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

There has long been a controversy about whether to use a clinical or microbiologic approach to diagnose ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and about which approach to use in managing patients. Although the clinical approach has often been criticized, a number of recent studies have shown that it is possible to use such an approach to effectively manage patients. This approach involves using all available clinical data to define the presence of pneumonia and then to initiate empiric therapy in a timely fashion, based on therapy guidelines, modified by local microbiologic data. Often the clinical diagnosis is made using the clinical pulmonary infection score, and this tool can be very accurate, especially if it incorporates a Gram stain of a lower-respiratory-tract sample. Once the clinical diagnosis of VAP is made, all patients should have a tracheal aspirate collected for culture, followed by prompt initiation of therapy. Using a clinical approach to management, the key decision point is not whether to start antibiotics, but whether to continue them at day 2–3. This requires serial clinical evaluation to define whether a response to empiric therapy has occurred. Based on this assessment, in conjunction with the results of tracheal aspirate cultures, therapy can be either modified or continued. A number of studies have shown that the clinical approach leads to a large number of patients receiving adequate empiric therapy, while still permitting de-escalation of antibiotic regimens, along with short durations of therapy. Thus a clinical approach to management can be successful in allowing for effective management of VAP, without promoting the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.

### Increased β-lactams dosing regimens improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients with augmented renal clearance treated for a first episode of hospital or ventilator-acquired pneumonia: a before and after study [^1132XXKh]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Standard dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy were cefazolin (100 mg/kg/day continuously after a loading dose of 2 g), amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2 g q 8 h), or third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone [2 g q 24 h] or cefotaxime [2 g q 8 h]). In the treatment period, patients who remained in ARC benefited from increased dosing regimens of documented β-lactam antibiotic therapy (cefazolin 150 mg/kg/day, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2 g q 6 h, ceftriaxone 2 g q 12 h, or cefotaxime 2 g q 6 h). A 7-day course was considered sufficient unless inadequate initial antibiotic therapy, bacteremia, immunosuppressive disease, or MDR pathogen.

The overall treatment of patients with HAP-VAP during the control and treatment periods was similar except for the antimicrobial dosing regimens. There were no known significant changes to our ICU protocols, ventilation or weaning procedures, or patient population during the study period.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was a composite criterion defined as a poor clinical outcome of the antimicrobial therapy, including therapeutic failure and HAP-VAP recurrence within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization.
Therapeutic failure was defined as an impaired clinical response (persistent or worsening symptoms of HAP-VAP) with the need for escalating empirical antimicrobial therapy. Inappropriate empirical treatment was not considered as therapeutic failure. De-escalation did not qualify as therapeutic failure. Superinfections due to new causative pathogens with natural resistance to the initial antimicrobial therapy were not considered as therapeutic failure.
Recurrence was defined by a second HAP-VAP with at least one of the initial causative bacterial strains growing at a significant concentration from a second sample after completing antibiotic therapy. Tracheobronchial colonization without evidence of pulmonary infection was not considered as HAP-VAP recurrence.

The primary outcome was assessed by one of the investigators (GC) based on clinical and microbiologic data. External validation was performed independently by at least two other investigators (CC, NS) blinded to the allocated period and antibiotic dosing regimen.

The secondary endpoints were the reported antibiotic side effects during treatment (cholestasis, cytolysis, delirium, seizure, renal failure), the secondary acquisition of antimicrobial resistance within 28 days and/or end-of-hospitalization, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the status (alive or dead) at discharge.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia [^113CBBcC]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To evaluate clinical characteristics and treatment patterns among patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including the implementation of and outcomes associated with deescalation therapy.

Design

Prospective, observational, cohort study.

Setting

Twenty ICUs throughout the United States.

Patients

A total of 398 ICU patients meeting predefined criteria for suspected VAP.

Interventions

Prospective, handheld, computer-based data collection regarding routine VAP management according to local institutional practices, including clinical and microbiological characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes.

Measurements and Results

The most frequent ICU admission diagnoses in patients with VAP were postoperative care (15.6%), neurologic conditions (13.3%), sepsis (13.1%), and cardiac complications (10.8%). The mean (± SD) duration of mechanical ventilation prior to VAP diagnosis was 7.3 ± 6.9 days. Major pathogens were identified in 197 patients (49.5%) through either tracheal aspirate or BAL fluid and included primarily methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (14.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.3%), and other Staphylococcus species (8.8%). More than 100 different antibiotic regimens were prescribed as initial VAP treatment, the majority of which included cefepime (30.4%) or a ureidopenicillin/monobactam combination (27.9%). The mean duration of therapy was 11.8 ± 5.9 days. In the majority of cases (61.6%), therapy was neither escalated nor deescalated. Escalation of therapy occurred in 15.3% of cases, and deescalation occurred in 22.1%. The overall mortality rate was 25.1%, with a mean time to death of 16.2 days (range, 0 to 49 days). The mortality rate was significantly lower among patients in whom therapy was deescalated (17.0%), compared with those experiencing therapy escalation (42.6%) and those in whom therapy was neither escalated nor deescalated (23.7%; χ² = 13.25; p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Treatment patterns for VAP vary widely from institution to institution, and the overall mortality rate remains unacceptably high. The deescalation of therapy in VAP patients appears to be associated with a reduction in mortality, which is an association that warrants further clinical study.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^111TSdNw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Directions for Use

Intramuscular Administration

Reconstitute ceftriaxone sodium powder with the appropriate diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose.

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized. A 350 mg/mL concentration is not recommended for the 250 mg vial since it may not be possible to withdraw the entire contents.

As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel.

Intravenous Administration

Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes, except in neonates where administration over 60 minutes is recommended to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired. Reconstitute vials with an appropriate IV diluent (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Compatibility and Stability).

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 100 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone. Withdraw entire contents and dilute to the desired concentration with the appropriate IV diluent.

Conclusions

As part of a global management of empiric antibiotherapy in an ICU, de-escalation might be safe and feasible in a large proportion of patients and infections. De-escalation is not realized in more than 50% of the antibiotherapy. Identification of the reasons that impair the decision towards de-escalation could eventually help to curb the clinician's reluctance to generalize this strategy.

Outcomes

The median length of stay was 6.7 days (IQR, 3.4–12.7 days) and 7.6 days (IQR, 4.0–15.4 days) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. Eight hundred fourteen patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) died in the hospital in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. The in-hospital mortality based on antibiotic classes and CURB-65 score are shown in e-Table 3 and e-Figure 1, respectively. The cumulative incidence curves for being discharged alive and dying in hospital are shown in Figure 2. In a competing risk model, EAC showed an sHR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85–0.99) for being discharged alive. Kaplan-Meier survival curve for 30-day attributable mortality is shown in e-Figure 2. The outcomes are described in Table 2. Of those discharged alive, 345 of 1,869 patients (18.5%) and 164 of 894 patients (18.3%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively, were readmitted within 30 days.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

NMBAs could be used in the appropriate setting for trauma patients, but should be limited to bolus dosing for a maximum of 48 h duration. All patients should have BIS monitoring, if available, when paralyzed to ensure adequate depth of sedation.

Aspiration Pneumonia

Aspiration of gastric contents, due to regurgitation and vomiting, the presence of nasoenteric tubes or loss of airway reflexes (resulting from low level of consciousness) is a distinct risk during the initial assessment phase, operative induction phase, and during ICU care. Brain trauma is a particular risk factor over and above the other risk factors in trauma ICU patients. Furthermore, patients with acute abdomen, major truncal trauma, and those who require emergency surgical intervention have a higher risk. Aspiration is common with an incidence between 30% and 40%, much of which is subclinical. Early antibiotic therapy for simple gastric aspiration is unnecessary, with no benefit shown and the potential for generating resistant organisms. Early bronchoscopy will allow for correct classification between fluid and particulate aspiration, allowing removal of particulate matter and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures can guide therapy, both for aspiration and unexpected early (non‐VAP) pneumonia. Early antibiotic therapy for "sterile" gastric aspiration is not advocated, and selective antibiotics should be deescalated within 72 h if cultures are negative. It remains challenging to distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia. When managed acutely, the morbidity and mortality are lower than other pneumonias in ICU. Where antimicrobials are used, there does not seem to be an outcome difference between baseline first choice and escalated level of antibiotic therapy in this pathology. Short courses of antibiotics, covering community acquired organisms but not anaerobes, may be indicated in cases with aspiration of stasis‐type enteric contents from beyond the stomach or where the aspiration occurs in the fed ICU patient.

Results

Of 3,999 patients included in the study, 2,683 patients (67.1%) and 1,316 patients (32.9%) were in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively (Fig 1). The antibiotics used in each group are described in e-Table 1. The median duration of receiving antibiotics was 5 days (IQR, 3–7 days) and 7 days (IQR, 4–8 days) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. The excluded patients treated with only oral antibiotics are described in e-Table 2. These patients were younger and showed less severe illness based on ICU admission as well as mLAPS, leading to a much lower in-hospital mortality.

### Pneumonia after cardiac surgery is predictable by tracheal aspirates but cannot be prevented by prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis [^116XoNoc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to assess the value of tracheal aspirate as a predictor of pneumonia after coronary artery bypass grafting and to evaluate the efficacy of prolonged perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.

Methods

Tracheal aspirates of 500 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were taken immediately after intubation and analyzed for microorganisms by Gram stain and semiquantitative microbiologic cultures. All patients received 2 g ceftriaxone as a single-dose perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis before operation. Results of Gram stains were available before the patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. After the results were known, both groups of patients (positive Gram stain, group 1; negative Gram stain, group 2) were randomly assigned to either conventional antibiotic prophylaxis (A), consisting of ceftriaxone 2 g on postoperative day 1, or prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis (B), with ticarcillin + clavulanic acid 3 × 5.2 g during 72 hours.

Results

From 500 patients, 91 had a positive Gram stain whereas 409 had a negative one. The incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in patients with preoperative positive tracheal aspirates (15.3%) than in patients with a negative one (3.6%; p < 0.01). However, prolonged prophylaxis did not reduce the rate of postoperative pneumonia, which was as high as 13% in untreated positive patients versus 17% in treated positive patients, and 2% in untreated negative patients versus 4% in treated patients. In patients who had pneumonia, there was a high correlation between the microorganisms found in preoperative aspirates and those observed when aspirates were repeated (100% correlation in patients with conventional antibiotic prophylaxis and 87% in those with prolonged prophylaxis).

Conclusions

Early postoperative pneumonia (< 7 days) is most likely caused by microorganisms that colonize the respiratory tract before operation. The risk of pulmonary infection after coronary artery bypass grafting can be predicted from the preoperative tracheal aspirates. Prolonged perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has no efficacy in reducing the incidence of pulmonary infections.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^112JEeE3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

De escalation approach in critically ill patients

The rise in antibiotic resistance in the ICU poses serious problems for the management of critically ill patients. The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy can have a significant impact on patient outcome when resistant pathogens may be involved. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for patients with severe sepsis or septic shock may be ineffective if the responsible organism is not susceptible to available antibiotics. Therefore, attention has been focused on the need for strategies to combat antibiotic resistance in the ICU.

In critically ill patients a de escalation approach may be recommended. For years antibiotic therapy has been started with a basic agent and only once microbiological culture results and susceptibility tests were available, more potent compounds were used. The traditional approach, however, may no longer be appropriate for critically ill patients in the current era of increasing antibiotic resistance.

Rising resistance rates and better understanding of the inflammatory process prompted some experts to advocate initial therapy with broad-spectrum, initially in severe pneumonias.

This two-stage approach of using aggressive initial therapy followed by de-escalation allows serious infection to be treated immediately and effectively avoiding antibiotic overuse, potential resistance and excessive costs.

### Gram-negative bacterial resistance: evolving patterns and treatment paradigms [^1176c291]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia depends primarily on providing adequate initial antibiotic treatment in a timely manner, because an inappropriate course is closely associated with increased mortality. Gram-negative bacteria are commonly responsible for nosocomial pneumonia, and the increasing prevalence of drug resistance among these bacteria complicates decision making with regard to treatment with antibiotics. Infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa are particularly problematic because of their intrinsic resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics and their ability to acquire adaptive resistance during a therapeutic course. Numerous strategies, including the use of combination therapy followed by de-escalation of antibiotics, have shown promise in the treatment of these serious infections. However, future success in treating nosocomial infections depends on the appropriate and responsible use of antibiotics in the intensive care unit, to ensure that the antibiotics available today maintain their effectiveness in the future.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^114fZFQu]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, and adopted a target trial methodologic approach. The Unity Health Toronto Research Ethics Board approved this study (Identifier: SMH REB 20–216). The study was reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

Data Source

This study used the GEMINI database of internal medicine inpatients that included administrative and clinical data linked at the patient level. Administrative data included demographics, diagnoses, interventions, discharge destination, and readmission during initial emergency room visit and hospital stay. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada (ICD-10-CA) was used to classify diagnoses before, during, and after hospital admission. Medication orders and blood work results were collected from hospital electronic information systems.

Eligibility Criteria

Consecutive adult patients admitted to the medical inpatient service for aspiration pneumonia at 18 acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022, were included in this study. To be eligible, the physician needed to have made a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and to have treated the patient with antibiotics used for CAP. The sample size was based on the chosen study date range, which was limited by the data available in the GEMINI database.

Physician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia was based on the most responsible discharge diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia as reported by hospitals to the Canadian Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Database using the ICD-10-CA diagnosis code J69.0. Code J69.0 refers to pneumonitis resulting from food and vomit including aspiration pneumonia not otherwise specified or resulting from food, gastric secretions, milk, or vomit.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^113TjUoK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage and extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Results: In this retrospective cohort study of 3,999 patients, the extended anaerobic coverage group showed similar in-hospital mortality and a higher risk of C difficile colitis when compared with the limited anaerobic coverage group.

Interpretation: We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no mortality benefit and an increased risk of harm.

Aspiration pneumonia is a bacterial lung infection that results from a large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents. It accounts for 5% to 15% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)cases and is associated with high mortality. In a cohort study of 4,263 hospitals, the 30-day mortality rate was 29.4% in 192,814 patients with aspiration pneumonia and 11.6% in 909,078 patients with other pneumonia. In a systematic review of 19 studies, aspiration pneumonia was associated with a relative risk of 3.62 (95% CI, 2.65–4.96) for in-hospital mortality when compared with pneumonia without aspiration risk factors.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) non-VAP — We suggest that patients with suspected HAP (non-VAP) be treated according to the results of microbiologic studies performed on respiratory samples obtained noninvasively, rather than being treated empirically (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Noninvasive methods to obtain respiratory samples include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient unable to cooperate to produce a sputum sample, and endotracheal aspiration in a patient with HAP who subsequently requires mechanical ventilation. Evidence cited includes one randomized trial in which Sixty-eight patients with HAP were randomly assigned to undergo bronchoscopy with protected specimen brushing vs noninvasive management, where expectorated sputum samples were not obtained so noninvasive management resulted in empiric therapy; there was no difference in clinical cure at 28 days or hospital length of stay, and lower 28-day mortality in the empirically treated group was not statistically significant (10% vs 21.9%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, .13–1.61), with fewer patients in the invasive group receiving antibiotics than in the noninvasive group (76% vs 100%). Despite limited evidence, the panel agreed that an attempt should be made to obtain respiratory samples for culture and that respiratory specimens should be obtained noninvasively rather than invasively, noting opportunities to de-escalate antibiotic coverage and that routine invasive sampling via bronchoscopy would be associated with increased cost and increased risks to the patient, including rarely life-threatening complications and temporary worsening of gas exchange that could result in the need for respiratory support.

### Antibiotics versus non-antibiotic in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia: analysis of the MIMIC-IV database [^113xSN8J]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Therefore, we suggest that the early treatment of patients with AP should involve the use of more adaptable broad-spectrum antibiotics based on the patient's clinical symptoms. In the later stages, as understanding of the pathogen's resistance increases, more sensitive antibiotics should be used. In clinical practice, doctors should develop a more personalized and precise drug intervention program for patients and adjust the dose and duration of antibiotics in a timely manner, in addition to the rational use of MV according to the patient's clinical indicators in order to improve the recovery of patients with aspiration pneumonia.

Inflammation-related indicators of patients can assist in diagnosing the occurrence of AP and the rational use of medications. However, the results of this study did not show a significant increase in the median and IQR values of inflammatory markers in the medication group compared to the untreated group. This could be attributed to the high sensitivity but low specificity of the inflammation response index. No significant increase was observed in the median and IQR values. This may be because the data used came from the first ICU admission of patients with AP, where the inflammatory response was still in its initial stage. Although there was a statistically significant difference between the groups, there was no significant change in the values of the inflammatory markers.

### Fever and infections in surgical intensive care: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^111abrfR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pulmonary infections are one of the most common causes of fever in critically ill patients, affecting an estimated 25%–33% of ICU patients, this is more common in trauma and the risk is increased in certain injury patterns and with increased injury severity. Neither fever nor leukocytosis, nor the combination are associated with positive respiratory cultures, but they are frequently obtained even in the absence of X-ray findings or clinical evidence of pneumonia. Respiratory cultures may help support the diagnosis, but the presence of bacteria on culture is not diagnostic of a pneumonia because a majority of intubated patients will have colonization of the endotracheal tube — this is especially true if tracheal aspirates are used, although the use of bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) does not eliminate false positives or false negatives. Unfortunately, a positive culture is often routinely managed with antibiotics regardless of the diagnostic impression.

The clinical determination or strong suspicion of the syndrome of pneumonia should guide whether or not cultures are initiated. Information for this determination includes imaging findings (chest X-ray, ultrasound or CT), new or acutely worsened oxygenation deficit, the onset of purulent secretions, with concomitant new fever or white count that is not otherwise explained. We find that the clustering of factors in the correct clinical setting is more useful than a single score or numerical cut-off.

There is no strong data to support BAL, mini-BAL, or protected specimen brushing over non-invasive methods of tracheal aspiration or for semi-quantitative over qualitative cultures. An argument can be made for or against either. The joint guideline from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) weakly recommends non-invasive sampling based on low-quality evidence, while in trauma patients the utility of mini-BAL has been demonstrated specifically in its ability to parse the diagnosis of pneumonia from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We recommend institutional multidisciplinary review of accepted practices and verification of correct interpretation based on techniques used.

Question

When is it appropriate to hold antibiotics in cases of fever in the ICU?

Recommendation

Due to significant harm associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, it is important to evaluate the likelihood of infection when deciding for or against empiric antibiotic initiation. Once started, de-escalation or stoppage should occur in a timely manner with decision-support by multidisciplinary evaluation and local protocols. Procalcitonin can be used in the context of a multidisciplinary institutional protocol, however, the utility is limited in critically injured patients and certain surgical populations.

### Enhanced antimicrobial de-escalation for pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients: a cross-over study [^116igTYz]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

One major area of continuing uncertainty for ICUs implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs is the concept of antimicrobial de-escalation. Further research must be done to determine what defines antimicrobial de-escalation, when it is appropriate, how to integrate infectious disease consultation into the ICU, when to "re-escalate" therapy, and how to transition antimicrobial decision-making when patients move from the ICU to the hospital ward. At present there are no established guidelines or benchmarks for de-escalation practices in critically ill patients that could serve as a reference point for ICU clinicians. Antimicrobial de-escalation is also uncertain in pathogen-negative sepsis, particularly whether it is safe to de-escalate and the optimal duration of antimicrobials. With improving culture methods and rapid diagnostics the proportion of patients with pathogen-negative sepsis will also likely diminish over time, resulting in fewer such uncertainties. We chose to include patients with viral pneumonia in our study given that viral causes of pneumonia are increasingly recognized with the advent of new rapid diagnostics and they represent an opportunity for de-escalating traditional antibiotic therapy.

Several limitations of our study should be recognized. First, the study design did not allow the research team to supplant the ICU teams in terms of overall antibiotic decision-making. The study team could only make recommendations to the ICU teams on de-escalation. Furthermore, the EAD study team was only available during daytime hours and not during weekends or holidays. This may have had an impact on the study team's ability to influence overall antibiotic management in patients with pneumonia during the time periods the study team was not available. Second, the EAD team and the ICU teams comprised similar clinicians including intensivists and pharmacists with similar levels of training and experience. This may have contributed to our inability to detect any impact of the EAD program on antibiotic management or clinical outcomes. Based on prior experience, inclusion of an infectious disease specialist or microbiologist might have improved our ability to improve antibiotic utilization with the EAD program. Third, we had a relatively small number of patients with VAP compared to COP and HAP. However, most of the patients with COP in our study had at least one healthcare-associated risk factor (prior hospitalization, admission from a nursing facility, immune suppression, or prior antibiotic exposure) placing them at higher risk for infection with potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022. Patients were included if the physician diagnosed aspiration pneumonia and prescribed guideline-concordant first-line community-acquired pneumonia parenteral antibiotic therapy to the patient within 48 h of admission. Patients then were categorized into the LAC group if they received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin. Patients were categorized into the EAC group if they received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incident C difficile colitis occurring after admission. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance baseline prognostic factors.

Results

The LAC and EAC groups included 2,683 and 1,316 patients, respectively. In hospital, 814 patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups died, respectively. C difficile colitis occurred in five or fewer patients (≤ 0.2%) and 11 to 15 patients (0.8%-1.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. After overlap weighting of propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference of EAC minus LAC was 1.6% (95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%) for in-hospital mortality and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) for C difficile colitis.

Interpretation

We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no additional mortality benefit, only an increased risk of C difficile colitis.

Methods

Patients

We enrolled patients aged ≥ 15 years who had been hospitalized with CAP without risk factors for aspiration, as described in our previous study. The diagnostic criteria for CAP are defined as radiological findings of a new and/or progressive infiltrate(s) and two or more of the following symptoms: cough, sputum or change of sputum character (increased volume and/or purulence), dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia, documented axillary body temperature ≥ 37.5 °C within the past 24 h, rigors and/or chills, general malaise, abnormal breathing sounds, auscultatory findings consistent with the lung infiltrate on chest examination, and white blood cell (WBC) count < 3000/mm³ or ≥ 10,000/mm³. Severity of pneumonia was determined according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI).

Cases meeting any of the following criteria were excluded: suspected aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia; hospitalization within 60 days of symptom onset; active lung cancer (cases other than completely resected ones); terminal illness; immunocompromising disease (human immunodeficiency virus infection, active hematologic malignancies, neutropenia and congenital immunodeficiency) or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (use of ≥ 10 mg of prednisolone-equivalents, and/or immunosuppressants); pregnant or breastfeeding; known allergy to the indicated antibiotics; or presence of other infiltrative diseases such as organizing pneumonia, radiation pneumonitis, drug-induced pneumonia, obstructive pneumonia, tuberculosis or fungal infection, and empyema.

To judge whether a case represented suspected aspiration pneumonia, patients were evaluated for various aspiration risk factors, including the following: neurological disorders such as cerebrovascular disease, neuromuscular disease, and dementia; oral/pharyngeal/throat disorders; bedridden state; gastroesophageal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal diverticulum, esophageal cancer, achalasia, systemic sclerosis, post-gastrectomy (total or partial), and hiatal hernia; insertion of a nasogastric tube; currently taking sedatives or hypnotics; subjective or observed aspiration/choking/dysphagia; or episodes of vomiting. Patients having one or more of these risk factors were excluded.

### Ampicillin + sulbactam vs clindamycin ± cephalosporin for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia and primary lung abscess [^114UpYUo]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia, necrotising pneumonia and primary lung abscess are complications arising from the aspiration of infectious material from the oral cavity or stomach. There is limited information on optimal antibacterial therapeutic regimens. Patients with pulmonary infection following aspiration (n = 95) were included in a prospective, open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial to compare the safety, clinical and bacteriological efficacy of ampicillin + sulbactam vs. clindamycin ± cephalosporin. Treated patients (n = 70) received sequential antibiotic therapy with either ampicillin + sulbactam (n = 37) or clindamycin (n = 33), with or without a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, administered until the complete resolution of clinical and radiological abnormalities. Definite or presumptive pathogens were isolated from 58 patients. Mean duration of therapy was 22.7 days for ampicillin + sulbactam and 24.1 days for clindamycin. In patients treated with ampicillin + sulbactam, the clinical response was 73.0% at the end of therapy and 67.5% 7–14 days after therapy. For clindamycin, the rates were 66.7% and 63.5%, respectively. Bacteriological response was similar in both treatment arms. Nine patients died (12.9%), with a Simplified Acute Physiology Score of > 30 points being the only significant predictive factor for therapeutic failure. Ampicillin + sulbactam and clindamycin ± cephalosporin were both well-tolerated and proved equally effective in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess.

### Updated recommendations from the ATS and IDSA | AAFP… [^111Zef8a]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Routine blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinary antigen testing are not beneficial in patients with nonsevere CAP.
- The Pneumonia Severity Index is recommended to determine the need for hospitalization, whereas the ATS/IDSA criteria for severe CAP are recommended to predict the need for intensive care.
- Routine treatment of CAP with macrolide monotherapy is no longer recommended unless local resistance is low. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are preferred in low-risk patients.
- Five-day treatment courses are recommended for all patients with CAP, with reassessment following treatment. From the AFP Editors. Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection or if he or she is being empirically treated for these pathogens; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days.

Lower respiratory tract samples from intubated patients with severe CAP should be sent for Gram stain and culture soon after intubation because of the higher risk of MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, and because endotracheal aspirates have a higher yield than sputum samples. Blood cultures should be obtained if the patient has severe CAP; was previously or is currently being treated empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa infection, particularly respiratory infections; or if the patient was hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics within the previous 90 days. The yield of blood cultures is low in adults without severe CAP, and empiric therapy is rarely changed based on these results. CORTICOSTEROID AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPY Corticosteroids should not be routinely prescribed for patients with CAP or severe influenzal pneumonia.

Although two studies showed significant improvements in outcomes when corticosteroids were prescribed for CAP, these results are questionable because of study flaws, and subsequent studies have not shown improvement in clinically relevant outcomes. Antiviral agents should be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, regardless of the duration of illness before diagnosis or the treatment setting. Although the benefits are greatest when antivirals are started within 48 hours of symptom onset, there is evidence supporting later initiation of therapy.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^116EUJ9r]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nosocomial pneumonia accounts for almost one-half of all intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and approximately 60% of mortality due to all nosocomial infections. The initial choice of antimicrobial therapy is critical to the clinical outcome of patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Early and aggressive empirical therapy with broad-spectrum agents targeted at the likely pathogens has been associated with a reduction in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) mortality rate. Awareness of the need for early and appropriate therapy, however, may tempt the clinician to use aggressive empirical therapy at the first sign of infection. Such empirical practices could create a vicious cycle of early and aggressive broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy that may in turn lead to overuse of antibiotics and an increase in antimicrobial resistance.

De-escalation therapy is a method currently used for the management of serious infections, especially in nosocomial pneumonias. Early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been used for treatment to improve appropriate use of empirical therapy. Sequential de-escalation provides maximum benefit for the individual patient and reduces the selection pressure fueling the development of resistance. De-escalation strategies provide clinical balance between using broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial agents and delaying the initiation of targeted therapy pending the bacteriological culture results. Several studies have shown that de-escalation therapy leads to reduced antibiotic use, shorter duration of therapy and reduced mortality.

The most recent VAP treatment guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) include recommendations for early, appropriate, broad-spectrum coverage and subsequent de-escalation of antibiotic regimens when possible, based on microbiological culture findings.

ATS and IDSA VAP treatment guidelines have suggested that negative lower respiratory tract cultures can be used to discontinue antibiotic therapy in a patient who shows clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours after the diagnosis of pneumonia and has cultures obtained, in the absence of antibiotic initiation or change, over the previous 72 hours. However, the outcome of de-escalation therapy in patients with negative cultures has not previously been reported.

Studies of de-escalated antimicrobial therapy based on antimicrobial sensitivity testing of microbiological cultures have reported that de-escalation therapy is not possible in patients with negative cultures; that is, the outcome of patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia with negative cultures is unfavorable.

### Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care unit: a prospective observational study [^115mWtvd]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotic de-escalation, which consists of the initial institution of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by antibiotic streamlining driven by microbiological documentation, is thought to provide maximum benefit for the individual patient, while reducing the selection pressure for resistance.

Methods

To assess a carbapenem-based de-escalating strategy in nosocomial pneumonia (NP), a prospective observational study was conducted in critically ill patients with NP treated empirically with imipenem ± aminoglycoside/glycopeptide in 24 intensive care units of Spanish general hospitals. Overall, 244 patients were assessable (91% with late-onset NP). The primary outcome was therapeutic success 7–9 days post therapy.

Results

Microbial identification – based on cultures of tracheal aspirates in 82% of patients, cultures of protected specimen brush in 33%, and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4% – was only available for 131 (54%) patients. Initial antibiotics were inadequate for 23 (9%) patients. Of the remaining patients, antibiotics were streamlined in 56 (23%) patients and remained unchanged in 14 (6%) patients based on microbiology data, in 38 (16%) patients despite microbiology data favouring de-escalation, and in 113 (46%) patients due to unknown aetiology. Overall, de-escalation was implemented in only 23% of patients with potentially multiresistant pathogens, compared with 68% of patients with the remaining pathogens (P < 0.001). Response rates were 53% for patients continuously treated with imipenem-based regimens and 50% for the de-escalated patients. Higher Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were associated with greater mortality, whereas adequate empiric antibiotic therapy protected against fatal outcomes. No increase of superinfection rates caused by emerging pathogens was observed. The costs associated with de-escalation were mainly dependent on the duration of hospitalization.

Conclusion

This study mainly highlights the current practice of a specific algorithm of de-escalation solely based on the available microbiological data, and highlights the barriers to using it more widely. In this setting, de-escalation was less likely to occur in the presence of potentially multiresistant pathogens. Prior antibiotic administration and the low use of bronchoscopic techniques may have influenced negatively the implementation of de-escalation. Optimization of de-escalation strategies for NP should rely on a correct choice of empiric antibiotics, on appropriate microbiological investigations, and on a balanced interpretation of microbiological and clinical data.

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^1119yGN8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^111PC2Cb]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician's intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines. The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients undergoing major heart surgery: an incidence study in Europe [^113ejUSM]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Various risk factors have been associated with the development of VAP in patients undergoing MHS, including the duration of mechanical ventilation, need for reintubation, transfusion needs, empirical administration of broadspectrum antibiotics, type of surgery, age over 60 years, supine position during the first 24 hours, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NYHA score of 3 or higher and need for mechanical intravascular support. Some of these factors were confirmed in our study, in particular, transfusion needs and type of surgery. At the same time, our study underscores other risk factors such as the need for re-intervention with haemorrhage or cardiac tamponade in the immediate postoperative period. Our study was oriented to find preoperative, intraoperative and immediate postoperative factors amenable to intervention in the population undergoing MHS. Due to this, we decided not to include the variable 'days of mechanical ventilation' in the model because it completely overshadowed the importance of the other variables we specifically wanted to address.

Because of this, we decided to include the variable 'days of mechanical ventilation' in a separate model. After analysing this new model, transfusion needs lost statistical significance.

Most unfortunately, the majority of the variables that significantly predict VAP are not amenable to intervention. In our opinion the use of anticipative or pre-emptive antimicrobial therapy should be explored as one of the few potential interventions to avoid VAP in the high-risk population. It is known that inadequate empirical therapy is associated with an increase in VAP-related mortality, even if it is corrected in the following hours. Singh and colleagues demonstrated that the administration of three days of ciprofloxacin to patients with suspicion of VAP had a very favourable impact on the cost and length of antimicrobial use, and reduced the rate of superinfections and the emergence of resistance. Also, the use of oral decontamination, along with three days of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, has been demonstrated to have the potential benefit of antimicrobial pre-emptive therapy in patients at high risk of VAP. Other potential preventive measures include continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions or the use of polyurethane cuffed tubes.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults: management principles to improve outcomes [^111Vy5ui]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1). Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure".

### Enhanced antimicrobial de-escalation for pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients: a cross-over study [^113HNnDL]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Escalating rates of antibiotic resistance add substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and costs related to infection in hospitalized patients, especially those in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance impedes efforts to insure that initial appropriate antibiotic therapy (IAAT) is delivered to critically ill infected patients. IAAT is a key determinant of outcome in severe infection and the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines strongly support initiatives to promote and facilitate timely appropriate antibiotic treatment to reduce mortality. The rising rates of antibiotic resistance have likely contributed to the increase in mortality attributed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria despite the overall reduction in deaths attributed to infectious diseases in the last century.

Because not all serious infections are due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, clinicians must have a strategy for determining which patients should receive empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. The practice of antibiotic de-escalation has emerged as an antibiotic decision-making strategy in the ICU balancing the need for IAAT, in order to improve patient outcomes, with the need for avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics so as to reduce resistance emergence. De-escalation generally refers to tailoring of empirical antibiotic treatment according to the susceptibilities of the bacteria isolated, selecting the narrowest spectrum antibiotic or stopping antibiotics altogether if non-infectious etiology is established.

Given the importance of balancing IAAT with the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic exposure, we performed a clinical trial with the goal of determining whether an enhanced antimicrobial de-escalation (EAD) practice could improve antibiotic utilization and outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. Our hypothesis was that introduction of an EAD practice would increase rates of antimicrobial de-escalation in the ICU population. We also wanted to determine whether a practice of EAD impacted other outcomes including mortality and lengths of stay.

### Minimizing antibiotic exposure in the ICU: in search of the optimal strategy [^1137hKMo]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The current paradigm for antibiotic management in critically ill patients is to initiate broad-spectrum therapy followed by de-escalation based on microbiological results. Routine screening cultures may allow better targeting and reduce unnecessary exposure to antibiotics.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115dAYy6]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, we were able to capture new C difficile colitis diagnosed only in hospital, so diagnoses made after discharge were not captured. The risk of C difficile colitis is estimated to be highest within 3 to 14 days from the first antibiotic dose, and then decreases over time. Thus, our study would have captured the highest risk period during a patient's hospital stay.

Fourth, as is the case for any observational study, residual confounding may still be present. It is plausible that clinicians' empiric antibiotic choice depended on illness severity, where sicker patients were more likely to receive additional anaerobic coverage. This did not seem to be the case in this study based on baseline characteristics between the two groups with similar proportion of ICU admissions and mLAPS (Table 1). We had also balanced many prognostic factors using propensity score overlap weighting.

Fifth, a bacterial pathogen was not identified in the vast majority of study patients. ICD-10-CA codes likely are highly insensitive for specific bacterial pathogens. As well, the microbiological yield in aspiration pneumonia is low, because it is reasonable to treat moderately severe aspiration pneumonia without microbiological workup based on the current guidelines. Furthermore, even with a full microbiological workup, anaerobes are difficult to grow in cultures. Our study reflects the real-world clinical practice in which almost all cases of aspiration pneumonia are treated with antibiotics empirically without available microbiological data to tailor antibiotic therapy.

### Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis: a spectrum of infectious / noninfectious diseases affecting the lung [^117QrQ9u]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Our purpose is to describe aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis as a spectrum of infectious/noninfectious diseases affecting the lung. We summarize diagnosis, risk factors, treatment, and strategies for prevention of aspiration.

Recent Findings

Aspiration is present in normal individuals, and disease manifestation depends on the chemical characteristics, frequency, and volume of inoculum. Anaerobes, though present, are no longer the predominant microbes isolated in aspiration pneumonia. Targets for preventing aspiration including improved oral hygiene and positional feeding have had mixed results. Patients diagnosed by clinicians with aspiration pneumonia experience greater morbidity and mortality than patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis are part of the pneumonia continuum and share similarities in pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment. Modern microbiology demonstrates that the lung is not sterile, and isolates in aspiration pneumonia frequently include aerobes or mixed cultures. Treatment for aspiration pneumonia should include antibiotic coverage for oral anaerobes, aerobes associated with community-acquired pneumonia, and resistant organisms depending on appropriate clinical context. Additional studies targeting prevention of aspiration and investigating the increased morbidity and mortality associated with aspiration pneumonia are warranted.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^111Ewmrk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48–72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs — such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities — with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^117XDemK]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is an essential part of management for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been debated and changed over time. Historically, anaerobic bacteria were thought to be the predominant pathogen in aspiration pneumonia. However, in more recent prospective studies, anaerobes were isolated in only 0.5% cases of aspiration pneumoniaand 16% of isolated bacteria.

Thus, the 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on CAP recommend to not routinely add anaerobic coverage in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and to treat with first-line antibiotics for CAP such as ceftriaxone or levofloxacin. This recommendation also considered the potential harmful consequences of broader empiric antibiotic coverage that increase risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis and select for antimicrobial resistance.

Very little evidence is available on the comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotic therapy with limited or extended anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. A recent systematic review found three relevant studies (two observational studies and one randomized controlled trial). All three studies did not show a significant difference in mortality or clinical cure rate with extended anaerobic coverage. However, the small sample sizes that ranged from 117 to 637 patients led to imprecise estimates with large CIs that cannot exclude clinically important differences.

A large multicenter study of aspiration pneumonia that compares first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage is needed to conclude if any clinically important differences exist in effectiveness and adverse effects. To this end, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia to compare first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of C difficile colitis.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia? [^116L3Dg2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and promotes reduction of adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improved patient compliance.

Recent Findings

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7–14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. Since there have been few well controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, however, there has been no consensus on length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.

Summary

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure, however, reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events such as Clostridium difficile infections.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^117QEo5G]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Strategies

Patients were classified into a limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) group and extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) group based on the initial antibiotic they received within 2 days of admission. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and levofloxacin were defined as having LAC because they cover some oral anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, and clindamycin were defined as having EAC because they cover most oral and gut anaerobes including the Bacteroides fragilis group. Thus, patients in the LAC group received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin monotherapy. Patients in the EAC group received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with an EAC antibiotic such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Using a target trial approach, the index time was the time when the patient received the first dose of antibiotic regimen, which would be analogous to randomization in a trial.

Outcomes

Patients were followed up until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality that occurred after the index time. A mortality difference of 3% was considered the minimally important difference based on the noninferiority margin of 3% for mortality in published CAP antibiotic trials. Secondary outcomes included incident diagnoses of C difficile colitis after admission, time to being discharged alive, and readmission to the medical or intensive care services of participating hospitals within 30 days of discharge. Exploratory outcome included 30-day attributable mortality, which was defined as death within 30 days after initially being admitted for aspiration, pneumonia, or both. This also would include patients who were discharged and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site with aspiration, pneumonia, or both and subsequently died. This would not have captured deaths outside the hospital.

Assignment Procedures

Covariates were prognostic factors before index time, which included the following: demographics, including age, sex, and residence in a long-term care home; hospital admission, including hospital site, admission year, and admission meteorological season; comorbidities, including updated Charlson Comorbidity Index; and illness severity, including ICU admission within 48 h of admission, modified Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score (mLAPS) within 24 h of admission based on laboratory parameters (sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, hematocrit, WBC count, arterial pH, arterial Pa 2, arterial Pa 2, glucose, and bilirubin). Higher mLAPS signified higher illness severity. In a prior study, mLAPS performed as well as CURB-65 score in predicting mortality for CAP.

HAP/VAP antibiotic de-escalation — For patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), we suggest that antibiotic therapy be de-escalated rather than fixed (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Remarks clarify that de-escalation refers to changing an empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to a narrower regimen by changing the antimicrobial agent or changing from combination therapy to monotherapy, whereas fixed therapy refers to maintaining a broad-spectrum regimen until therapy is completed.

### De-escalation in lower respiratory tract infections [^117H1jGN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present article reviews recent data on the de-escalation of empirical antibiotic treatment on pneumonia, with special attention to newer strategies aimed at increasing adequacy and minimizing resistance emergence risks in ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Recent Findings

A de-escalation strategy is feasible in a large proportion of patients with pneumonia, and at least two reports have associated de-escalation with a significantly better survival. Combined with other strategies, such as using biomarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein or procalcitonin), antibiotic heterogeneity, adherence to local microbiological flora, objective clinical criteria of non-response and of clinical ventilator-associated pneumonia resolution, they contribute to rationalizing and individualizing antimicrobial therapy.

Summary

A patient-based approach with prompt adequate empirical therapy, using broad-spectrum antibiotics based on reliable local microbiological data with streamlining as soon as microbiological data become available, allow outcomes to be improved and the emergence of resistance to be minimized.

### Dynamics of microbiota during mechanical ventilation in aspiration pneumonia [^113Wmd9w]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

From the present findings, it can be deduced that antibiotics should be selected on the premise that dynamic changes in microbiota (involved in the reduction of anaerobes in the lower respiratory tract) may occur during mechanical ventilation in intubated patients with aspiration pneumonia. It was suggested that antibiotic treatment for anaerobes in these cases may not be appropriate. Additional pathogenic investigation should be conducted after over 3 h from initiating mechanical ventilation. However, because this is a single location observational study, and because the sample size was small, evaluation by larger scale interventional analysis is required for finding the most appropriate antibiotic regimen. The use of wide spectrum antibiotics (unnecessarily) leads to the emergence of drug resistant bacteria — which is now an urgent health-related problem. Needless to say, accurate identification of pathogenic bacteria and the justified usage of antibiotics are both imperative.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: breaking the vicious circle of antibiotic overuse [^114w2SeK]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the rate of appropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia, to evaluate de-escalation in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia treated according to local pathway, and to identify the bacteria responsible for recurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Prospective observational study during a 36-month period.

Setting

Medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

One hundred and fifteen patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit developing ventilator-associated pneumonia with positive cultures. The patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were treated with limited-spectrum antibiotics (i.e., without activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa) if they had no prior hospitalization (within 21 days) or prior administration of antibiotics (within 10 days). Quantitative cultures obtained by bronchoscopy or tracheal aspiration were used to reassess empirical therapy.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A limited-spectrum therapy was used in 79 patients (69%). Empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 100 patients (85%). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the patients in whom empirical therapy was inappropriate than in those in whom treatment was appropriate (47 vs. 20%, p = .04). De-escalation was done in respectively 26% and 72% of patients with early- and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia, whereas treatment was escalated in 27 patients (23%). Ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes were recurrent in 22 cases, including eight episodes due to high-risk bacteria.

Conclusions

A rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia using limited-spectrum antibiotics is possible if local ecology and patient medical history and clinical status are considered. In addition, de-escalation is feasible in 42% of patients. This integrative approach may reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria, which in turns reduces the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics, breaking the vicious circle of antibiotic overuse.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^1111UMy7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines as the first-line antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, which of these antibiotics is more effective for treating non-aspiration CAP remains unclear.

Methods

This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, quasi-randomized controlled trial. Patients with adult CAP without risk for aspiration were allocated to either a CTRX or ABPC/SBT group based on the date of hospital admission. Macrolide was added to patients in each group. The primary outcome was the clinical response in the validated per-protocol (VPP) population at end of treatment (EOT). The secondary outcomes were clinical response during treatment and at end of study (EOS) in the VPP population, and mortality rate at day 30 in the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population.

Results

Of 696 screened patients, 433 patients were excluded and 263 patients were allocated to receive either of the treatments. Males comprised 54% of patients and mean age and PSI were 62.1 ± 19.8 years and 69.3 ± 30.0, respectively, with 124 patients allocated to the CTRX group and 138 patients allocated to the ABPC/SBT group. The clinical effectiveness rate for the VPP population at EOT was 90% in the CTRX and 96% in the ABPC/SBT group (p = 0.072, 95% confidence interval [CI] of risk difference [RD]: − 12.6–0.8%). No significant difference in effectiveness at day 4 was observed between the CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups (p = 0.079, 95%CI of RD: − 12.1–0.4%), but at day 7, ABPC/SBT was significantly more effective than CTRX in the VPP population (p = 0.047, 95%CI of RD: − 13.3–-0.4%). No significant difference in late response at EOS was seen between CTRX and ABPC/SBT groups: cure (89 [86%] and 102 [94%]), relapse (5 [5%] and 1 [1%]) and failure (10 [10%] and 5 [5%]; p = 0.053). Deaths within 30 days in MITT population was higher in CTRX group (4 [3%]) than in ABPC/SBT group (0 [0%]) (p = 0.048, 95%CI of RD: 0.1–6.3%).

Conclusion

No significant difference in effectiveness was found between ABPC/SBT and CTRX at EOT. However, ABPC/SBT might be more effective in the early phase of treatment.

### Ampicillin-sulbactam versus third-generation cephalosporins in aspiration pneumonia: a nationwide retrospective cohort study [^115yJzNf]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ampicillin-sulbactam versus third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) in managing aspiration pneumonia.

Methods

We utilized the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database, a comprehensive national inpatient database in Japan, to identify patients diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia between July 2010 and March 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their treatment: those receiving ampicillin-sulbactam and those receiving third-generation cephalosporins (either ceftriaxone or cefotaxime). To mitigate confounding factors, propensity score overlap weighting analysis was employed to compare in-hospital mortality rates and the incidence of Clostridioides difficile infection between the two treatment groups.

Results

Among the 548,972 eligible patients, 424,446 received ampicillin-sulbactam, while 124,526 were treated with third-generation cephalosporins. In the third-generation cephalosporin group, 97.7% of patients were administered ceftriaxone, and 2.3% received cefotaxime. The mean treatment duration was 8.5 days (standard deviation [SD] 4.3) in the ampicillin-sulbactam group and 7.9 days (SD 4.1) in the third-generation cephalosporin group. Propensity score overlap weighting analysis revealed that patients treated with ampicillin-sulbactam had significantly lower in-hospital mortality (14.6% vs. 16.4%; risk difference [RD], -1.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.1% to -1.5%; P < 0.001) and a lower incidence of C. difficile infection (2.0% vs. 2.8%; RD, -0.8%; 95% CI, -0.9% to -0.7%; P < 0.001) compared to those treated with third-generation cephalosporins.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that ampicillin-sulbactam was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and a reduced incidence of C. difficile infection compared to third-generation cephalosporins in patients with aspiration pneumonia.

### Does enhanced antibiotic de-escalation really have no benefit in the ICU? [^112P15t5]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

In a recent issue of Critical Care, we read with interest the article by Trupka et al. who investigated the utility of an enhanced antimicrobial de-escalation (EAD) program in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia. They found that the EAD program did not affect the rate of antibiotic de-escalation or the duration of antibiotic therapy in intensive care units (ICUs). We are very interested in this research because it includes important findings for the indication of antimicrobial stewardship in ICUs.

However, several issues potentially affecting the results need to be addressed. First, the definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is unclear. In the study, 35% of the patients were classified as having pathogen-negative pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic de-escalation depends on the precise evaluation of targeted microorganisms. Invasive respiratory sampling and quantitative culture may improve antibiotic treatment protocols in patients with VAP. Giantsou et al. demonstrated that VAP patients diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were more likely to achieve antibiotic de-escalation than those diagnosed by tracheal aspiration. Further, Raman et al. showed that it was safe to discontinue antibiotic treatment in VAP patients following negative quantitative BAL culture results. Therefore, the sampling and culture methods used for respiratory microorganisms might confound the evaluation of the utility of the EAD program.

Second, the time from initial antibiotic therapy to de-escalation was not reported, although the total antibiotic days were similar between the groups. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can reduce the time to de-escalation, which may reduce antibiotic resistance and other antibiotic-related adverse events. Carratalà et al. demonstrated that stewardship of the antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia reduced the time to oral antibiotic conversion, as well as total antibiotic days. Therefore, the time to de-escalation could be an important surrogate for evaluating the usefulness of an EAD program.

Finally, the report lacked information regarding the initial antibiotic therapy regimen. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that initial inappropriate antibiotic therapy increased the risk of mortality in a hospital setting. Further, if the spectrum of the initial antibiotic was sufficiently specific and narrow, de-escalation was not always necessary, which might affect the rate of de-escalation. Therefore, the initial antibiotic therapy regimen could be associated with the main results of this study.

In conclusion, we believe that provision of additional data by the authors will help us better understand the utility of EAD programs in ICUs.

### Impact of de-escalation therapy on clinical outcomes for intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia [^113sQzp1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Definitions

ICU-acquired pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of new pulmonary infiltrates plus at least two of the following criteria: fever ≥ 38°C, blood leukocytes ≥ 10,000/mm³ or ≤ 3,000/mm³ and purulent tracheal secretions occurring more than 48 hours after admission to the ICU and within 72 hours of discharge from the ICU. Only patients with first episodes of ICU-acquired pneumonia were eligible for the study. Appropriate antibiotic coverage was considered when at least one effective drug was included in the antibiotic treatment. Pneumonia-related deaths were considered related to the pulmonary infection if they occurred before any objective response to the antimicrobial therapy or if the pulmonary infection was considered a contributing factor to death in patients with comorbidity. Each death summary was independently reviewed by two study investigators who were blinded to the use of de-escalation treatment. Mortality was classified as pneumonia-related if pneumonia was an immediate or underlying cause of death or if it played a major role in the patient's death. Mortality was defined as pneumonia-unrelated if the pneumonia was neither an immediate nor an underlying cause of death and played only a minor role, no role or an unknown role in the cause of death. The overall mortality included all deaths that occurred during hospitalization.

De-escalation therapy

De-escalation was defined as streamlined antibiotic treatment driven by microbiological documentation, clinical data and the severity-of-illness index achieved by decreasing the number and/or spectrum of antibiotics. This approach to the management of ICU-acquired pneumonia involves changing the focus from the use of multiple agents to the use of a single agent if Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not present, shortening the therapy to < 5 days if the culture is negative and there have been > 48 hours of defervescence, and changing from a broad to a narrow agent in the light of culture data. Accordingly, patients receiving carbapenem were de-escalated to piperacillin and tazobactam, and patients receiving piperacillin and tazobactam were de-escalated to cefepime or a third-generation cephalosporin. Patients receiving combination therapy were de-escalated and switched to monotherapy by withholding fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides or glycopeptides.

### How important are anaerobic bacteria in aspiration pneumonia: when should they be treated and what is optimal therapy [^112qM9Uc]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria are infrequent pulmonary pathogens, and, even then they are, they are almost never recovered due to the need for specimens uncontaminated by the upper airway flora and failure to do adequate anaerobic bacteriology. These bacteria are relatively common in selected types of lung infections including aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia and emphyema. Preferred antibiotics for these infections based on clinical experience are clindamycin and any betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor.

The present study had several limitations. First, there was uncertainty about the effect size. The difference between groups could potentially be smaller or non-existent. Second, this was a single-center trial. Because the background characteristics of patients would differ between hospitals, the severity of pneumonia would be different. Therefore, whether the clinical differences observed between the two antibiotics in the present study can be generalized needs to be investigated in a follow-up study. Third, to judge whether the patient had aspiration pneumonia, risk factors for aspiration were evaluated, but not swallowing function or silent aspiration at night. Some cases of pneumonia in the present study might thus have been caused by silent aspiration of oral bacteria. Distinguishing pneumonia caused by oral anaerobic bacteria from that caused by other bacteria by evaluating only the risk factors for aspiration was difficult. However, because it is not routine in clinical practice to evaluate swallowing function to judge whether a patient has aspiration pneumonia, the results of the present study can be considered at least somewhat reflective of actual clinical practice.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^116MBhxR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. For infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), the recommended daily dose is 2 to 4 grams, in order to achieve > 90% target attainment. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, Ceftriaxone Injection therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment.

### Aspiration pneumonia in older adults [^1169m5ie]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia refers to an infection of the lung parenchyma in an individual that has inhaled a bolus of endogenous flora that overwhelms the natural defenses of the respiratory system. While there are not universally agreed upon criteria, the diagnosis can be made in patients with the appropriate risk factors and clinical scenario, in addition to a radiographic or an ultrasonographic image of pneumonia in the typical dependent lung segment. Treatment options for aspiration pneumonia vary based on the site of acquisition (community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [CAAP] versus healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia [HCAAP]), the risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, and severity of illness. Hospitalized CAAP patients without severe illness and with no risk for MDR organisms or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) can be treated with standard inpatient community-acquired pneumonia therapy covering anaerobes. Patients with CAAP and either of the following-risk factors for MDR pathogens, septic shock, need for an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mechanical ventilation-can be considered for broader coverage against anaerobes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and PA. Severe aspiration pneumonia that originates in a long-term care facility or HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms should be considered for similar treatment. HCAAP with one or more risk factors for MDR organisms or PA, plus septic shock, need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation should receive double coverage for PA in addition to coverage for MRSA and anaerobes. Multiple gaps in current understanding and management of aspiration pneumonia require future research, with a particular focus on antibiotic stewardship.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin / sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: an open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^113zaTNU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens, and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis or viruses such as influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0% and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8, 100 and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected on the basis of presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has compared ABPC/SBT with CTRX in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia patients. However, that study was a retrospective propensity score-matching analysis and whether this result is applicable to aspiration pneumonia in clinical practice remains unclear.

Some reports have described CAP excluding aspiration pneumonia, but most previous studies of antibiotic treatments for CAP have included patients with aspiration pneumonia. To our knowledge, no reports have compared CTRX and ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP in patients without risk factors for aspiration. We therefore carried out the present study with the aim of investigating whether CTRX might be more effective than ABPC/SBT for the treatment of CAP, after excluding cases of aspiration pneumonia.

### Treatment of Gram-negative pneumonia in the critical care setting: is the β-lactam antibiotic backbone broken beyond repair? [^113cnusJ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship

Ideally, antibiotic stewardship in ICUs should include the rapid identification of bacterial etiology, optimization of treatment based on PK/PD characteristics of the antibiotic(s), avoidance of unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics, shortening of treatment duration, and reduction in the number of patients receiving antibiotic therapy for non-infectious syndromes. To achieve this, ICUs should continuously collect data and adjust prescribing of beta-lactam backbone antibiotics according to their local resistance patterns. Delayed appropriate therapy is consistently associated with worse outcomes. In contrast, early and appropriate empiric broad-spectrum therapy, followed by de-escalation, is generally associated with improved clinical outcomes for pneumonia. To achieve adequate therapy, it is necessary to select the correct antibiotic(s), an optimal dose, and the correct route of administration (oral, IV, or aerosol) to ensure antibiotic penetration to the site of infection.

Guidelines advise that de-escalation of antibiotics be considered once information is available on the results of lower respiratory tract cultures and the patient's clinical response. A meta-analysis that included three studies in patients with VAP showed that, in some patients, the use of short-course (2- to 3-day) therapy as a de-escalation approach (compared with prolonged-course therapy) was not associated with an increase in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or hospital stay, particularly in those not infected with non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. While the optimal length of antibiotic therapy for critically ill patients with VAP due to non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli remains an unsolved issue, clinicians should strive to stop therapy as soon as possible.

De-escalation of therapy may be guided by scores such as the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), 81 patients with a CPIS of less than 6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (at discretion of physician) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy, with re-evaluation at day 3; ciprofloxacin was discontinued if CPIS remained less than 6 at day 3. Mortality, length of ICU stay, and development of resistance did not differ significantly between treatments, actually favoring the ciprofloxacin monotherapy arm.

Biomarkers offer an alternative method to shorten duration of therapy. Several large randomized trials in critically ill patients of antibiotic duration based on falling procalcitonin levels have demonstrated that this approach can safely shorten duration without adverse consequences. HAP/VAP were common types of infection in these studies.

### Ceftriaxone [^112qNb4N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The usual adult daily dose is 1 to 2 grams given once a day (or in equally divided doses twice a day) depending on the type and severity of infection. The total daily dose should not exceed 4 grams.

If Chlamydia trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added, because ceftriaxone sodium has no activity against this organism.

For the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections, a single intramuscular dose of 250 mg is recommended.

For preoperative use (surgical prophylaxis), a single dose of 1 gram administered intravenously 1/2 to 2 hours before surgery is recommended.

Generally, ceftriaxone therapy should be continued for at least 2 days after the signs and symptoms of infection have disappeared. The usual duration of therapy is 4 to 14 days; in complicated infections, longer therapy may be required.

When treating infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, therapy should be continued for at least 10 days.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with impairment of renal or hepatic function (see PRECAUTIONS).

The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in elderly patients, up to 2 g per day, provided there is no severe renal and hepatic impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).

Directions for Use

Intramuscular Administration

Reconstitute ceftriaxone powder with the appropriate diluent (see COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY).

Inject diluent into vial, shake vial thoroughly to form solution. Withdraw entire contents of vial into syringe to equal total labeled dose.

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 250 mg or 350 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone according to the amount of diluent indicated below. If required, more dilute solutions could be utilized.

As with all intramuscular preparations, ceftriaxone should be injected well within the body of a relatively large muscle; aspiration helps to avoid unintentional injection into a blood vessel.

Intravenous Administration

Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously by infusion over a period of 30 minutes, except in neonates where administration over 60 minutes is recommended to reduce the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Concentrations between 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL are recommended; however, lower concentrations may be used if desired. Reconstitute vials with an appropriate IV diluent (see COMPATIBILITY AND STABILITY).

After reconstitution, each 1 mL of solution contains approximately 100 mg equivalent of ceftriaxone. Withdraw entire contents and dilute to the desired concentration with the appropriate IV diluent.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^115oRAF2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Complete case analysis was performed. For descriptive analysis of continuous variables, mean ± SD or median (interquartile range [IQR]) were used when appropriate. Counts and percentages were used to describe categorical variables. Absolute standardized difference of the mean was used to describe the balance of baseline characteristics. A meaningful difference was defined as a standardized difference of > 0.1.

In keeping with a target trial approach, a modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed. To be included in this analysis, patients must have been receiving the same antibiotic for > 1 day or until death or discharge. Because most antibiotics were dosed daily, this ensured that patients received more than a single antibiotic dose. If patients were switched to another antibiotic regimen after 2 days, then they were analyzed based on the initial antibiotic group. A per-protocol analysis also was performed that included only patients who completed the antibiotic regimen they were prescribed initially without switching to or adding on another antibiotic during hospital stay.

For outcomes other than time to discharge, a risk difference with CIwas calculated as the risk for EAC group minus risk for LAC group. For time to discharge, a competing risk model was used. Possible end points in this model included being discharged alive or dying in hospital. The Fine and Graymodel was used to estimate the subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) for being discharged alive.

Measured covariates before the index time were balanced between the two groups using a propensity score-based method. Propensity scores were estimated using a logistic regression of the covariates and then were balanced using overlap weighting. Overlap weighting calculates the average treatment effect for the overlap population, which is the population with similar covariates distribution for which clinical equipoise exists and patients would be eligible for the analogous trial. Overlap weighting for two groups will always lead to an exact balance in the means of any included covariates, leading to an absolute standardized difference of 0. The weighted difference in means for outcomes would be the average risk difference. The overlap weights were entered into the competing risk model to estimate an adjusted sHR for being discharged alive.

A sensitivity analysis was carried out that accounted for hospital sites as clusters using a generalized linear mixed-effect model. Reported CIs were all two-sided 95% CIs. R version 4.1.3 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was the statistical software used, and the PSweight package was used for overlap weighting of propensity scores.

Data Reporting

To protect patient confidentiality, all cells containing or revealing five individuals or fewer were suppressed according to GEMINI data policy.

Results

Patients

Patient recruitment ended June 30, 2008 as planned. The last patient was followed up until July 8, 2008. A total of 696 patients were hospitalized for pneumonia during the study period. Among these, 433 patients were excluded: 416 because of aspiration risks, 13 because of a protocol violation by a physician, and four because of receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, 263 patients were finally included in this study (Fig. 1), among whom, 124 were allocated to the CTRX group, and 139 to the ABPC/SBT group. In two cases from the CTRX group and three cases from the ABPC/SBT group, no macrolides were administered. Fifty-one patients were excluded from the VPP population: 30 because of misdiagnosis with non-aspiration pneumonia, 10 because of inappropriate antibiotic change, seven because of a lack of information, and four because of insufficient treatment period. No significant differences in the numbers of cases excluded from the VPP were observed between the two groups. Baseline clinical characteristics of the MITT and VPP populations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2; these characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups except for CRP, which was higher in the ABPC/SBT group than in the CTRX group in the MITT population, but did not differ significantly between the two groups in the VPP population. This study included patients with low PSI, due to the universal health-care coverage in Japan. Patients with low PSI are thus more likely to be hospitalized in Japan than in other countries.

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia, and how should it be treated? [^1179US5w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In contrast to patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia or mechanically ventilated patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia is a relatively new clinical entity that includes a spectrum of adult patients who have close association with acute care hospitals or reside in chronic care settings that increase their risk for pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Multi-drug-resistant pathogens include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter species. New guidelines for the management and prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were published in 2005 and are highlighted in this article.

Recent Findings

Recent data indicate that types of multi-drug-resistant pathogens may vary in different healthcare settings, and that individuals infected with multi-drug-resistant pathogens are more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy, which may result in poorer outcomes in terms of patient morbidity, mortality and increased length of hospital stay.

Summary

This review highlights key points in the new recommendations and principles for initiating, de-escalating and stopping antibiotic therapy in individuals with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Widespread implementation of these guidelines is needed in healthcare institutions in order to reduce patient morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

### Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for acute aspiration pneumonitis [^114UiLH5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is frequently prescribed for acute aspiration pneumonitis, with the intent of preventing the development of aspiration pneumonia. However, few clinical studies have examined the benefits and harms of this practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study design was used to compare outcomes of patients with aspiration pneumonitis who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy with those managed with supportive care only during the initial 2 days following macroaspiration. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included transfer to critical care and antimicrobial therapy received between days 3 and 14 following macroaspiration including escalation of therapy and antibiotic-free days.

Results

Among 1483 patients reviewed, 200 met the case definition for acute aspiration pneumonitis, including 76 (38%) who received prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and 124 (62%) who received supportive management only. After adjusting for patient-level predictors, antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with any improvement in mortality (odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4–1.7; p = 0.7). Patients receiving prophylactic antimicrobial therapy were no less likely to require transfer to critical care (5% vs 6%; p = 0.7) and subsequently received more frequent escalation of antibiotic therapy (8% vs 1%; p = 0.002) and fewer antibiotic-free days (7.5 vs 10.9; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for patients with acute aspiration pneumonitis does not offer clinical benefit and may generate antibiotic selective pressures that results in the need for escalation of antibiotic therapy among those who develop aspiration pneumonia.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^1142gMa4]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, the large sample size of 3,999 patients allowed for more precise estimates. Second, the study included 18 hospitals that included both academic and community hospitals, thereby increasing the generalizability of the study findings. Third, the GEMINI database was comprehensive and included detailed medication and patient data. Data on medication orders allowed accurate capture of antibiotic exposure during the entire hospital stay. Patient data allowed for adjustment of many prognostic factors in the propensity score overlap weighting analysis. All study patients underwent complete follow-up in hospital.

The study had important limitations that merit mentioning. First, ICD-10-CA codes for aspiration pneumonia have not been validated previously to capture aspiration pneumonia and may have included aspiration pneumonitis that does not require antibiotic therapy. However, we coupled the ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes with the physician's decision to treat with first-line CAP antibiotics, which reflected clinical diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia necessitating antibiotic therapy. Most aspiration pneumonitis cases resolve within 48 h. Based on the cumulative incidence curves (Fig 2), mortality continued to increase steadily after day 2, which followed the typical course for aspiration pneumonia, rather than aspiration pneumonitis. A prior study used the same method based on International Classification of Diseases codes to capture and differentiate aspiration pneumonia from other pneumonias.

Second, the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality because complete follow-up ended on discharge from hospital. We were unable to report out-of-hospital deaths or readmission to hospitals not participating in the GEMINI network. However, in-hospital mortality likely captured most of the attributable deaths resulting from aspiration pneumonia. Our in-hospital mortality rate of 30% was very close to the reported 29% 30-day all-cause mortality for aspiration pneumonia in a large nationwide cohort study of > 1 million patients, suggesting that our study did not miss a significant number of deaths. Patients who were discharged, deteriorated, and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site still were captured in our study using the exploratory outcome of 30-day attributable mortality, which was similar between the two groups. This should capture the vast majority of readmissions, because a prior study showed that > 80% of readmissions occur at the same hospitaland our database accounted for readmission to any hospital within the GEMINI network that make up roughly one-half of all acute-care hospital beds in Ontario.

### Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care unit: a prospective observational study [^111mSML6]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	Inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy contributes substantially to attributed mortality in critically ill patients with NP. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for NP continues to be a major challenge in the ICU setting.

- 	The antibiotic de-escalation strategy has recently been introduced to increase coverage against the most frequently causative pathogens, including multiresistant strains, and to reduce the selection pressure for antimicrobial resistance.

- 	In a prospective observational multicentre study, the causative organism was only identified in 54% of patients with NP. De-escalation was used in 23% of cases. In 16% of cases, despite microbiology data favouring de-escalation, it was not applied. Empirical antibiotic treatment was inadequate in 9% of patients.

- 	Response rates were 53% for patients continuously treated with imipenem-based regimens versus 50% for those patients who were de-escalated. Patients with inappropriate empirical treatment had significantly higher mortality.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^113bfzA8]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia across 18 hospital sites, in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between EAC and LAC groups (adjusted risk difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%). The lower CI limit of –1.7% excluded a clinically important difference of 3% mortality reduction. Thus, extended anaerobic coverage seemed unlikely to lead to a clinically important improvement in mortality. However, extended anaerobic coverage was associated with a significantly increased risk of C difficile colitis (adjusted risk difference, 1.0%; 95% CI 0.3%-1.7%). These findings suggest that extended anaerobic antibiotic coverage did not offer any additional benefit for aspiration pneumonia and could have increased the risk of harm.

Our study findings are consistent with those from a small randomized controlled trialand three prior observational studies. Similar to these four studies, our study did not show a significant difference between LAC and EAC groups in terms of mortality. Unlike the prior three studies, our study included only patients receiving first-line antibiotic agents for CAP. In addition, our study showed a much larger sample size that was more than four times the sample size of all four studies combined. This allowed for a more precise estimate with a narrow 95% CI to exclude a clinically important difference.

Our study findings have important implications. This study adds strong real-world clinical evidence to the ATS and IDSA 2019 CAP guidelines recommendation of not routinely adding anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. Patients with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia can be treated with ceftriaxone or levofloxacin without adding another antibiotic for anaerobic coverage. The avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic administration can decrease the risk of antibiotic adverse effects, especially C difficile colitis. On a larger scale, limiting unnecessary antibiotic use may lower antibiotic selective pressure and may result in less antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, antimicrobial stewardship programs can implement targeted interventions to de-escalate antibiotic therapy for aspiration pneumonia.

### Spectrum scores: toward a better definition of de-escalation [^115jbLDs]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Spectrum scores measure antimicrobial utilization while also quantifying the spectrum of activity. Accordingly, changes in spectrum score can be used to identify antimicrobial de-escalation. We show that spectrum-score-based de-escalation has a 95.7% positive percentage agreement and 81.6% negative percentage agreement versus de-escalation defined as stopping either antistaphylococcal or antipseudomonal agents.

### De-escalation therapy rates are significantly higher by bronchoalveolar lavage than by tracheal aspirate [^111gKmzy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess outcomes with de-escalation therapy in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Multidisciplinary intensive care unit.

Patients and Participants

VAP was diagnosed by positive quantitative cultures of both tracheal aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and treated appropriately for all significant isolates of tracheal aspirate and BAL in 143 patients who were assigned to de-escalation therapy by BAL or tracheal aspirate.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Results

Antibiotic therapy was de-escalated in 58 patients (40.5%), who had decreased mortality at day 15 (5.1% vs. 31.7%) and day 28 (12% vs. 43.5%) and shorter intensive care unit (17.2 ± 1.2 vs. 22.7 ± 6.3 days) and hospital (23.7 ± 2.8 vs. 29.8 ± 11.1 days) stay (p < 0.05). Of the 81 patients assigned to tracheal aspirate, the 17 (21%) who achieved de-escalation of therapy had reduced 15-day mortality (5.8% vs. 34.3%), reduced 28-day mortality (11.6% vs. 45.3%), and shorter intensive care unit (17.2 ± 1.6 vs. 22.4 ± 6.4 days) and hospital (23.1 ± 4.4 vs. 29.9 ± 11.1 days) stay (p < 0.05). Of the 62 patients assigned to BAL, the 41 (66.1%) who achieved de-escalation of therapy had decreased 15-day mortality (4.8% vs. 23.8%), decreased 28-day mortality (12.1% vs. 38%), and shorter intensive care unit (17.2 ± 1.1 vs. 23.2 ± 6 days) and hospital (23.8 ± 2.4 vs. 29.8 ± 11.4 days) stay (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

For patients with VAP who have had appropriate treatment and shown a favorable clinical response, mortality and duration of stay can be further improved by de-escalation therapy.
