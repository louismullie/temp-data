## Question

why does sbo cause lactic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why small-bowel obstruction (SBO) causes lactic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanical consequences of an obstruction and resultant proximal distension. Then, I should examine how distension impairs mesenteric perfusion and precipitates ischemia. Next, I will consider the metabolic shift to anaerobic glycolysis and lactate generation. After that, I need to track how lactate enters systemic circulation to produce acidosis. Finally, I should evaluate downstream complications and briefly differentiate D-lactic acidosis in short-bowel states from the L-lactic, type A pattern typical of ischemic SBO, while also double-checking the diagnostic utility and limitations of serum lactate in suspected ischemia [^113V7zqS] [^117QzUyt].

> Let me first confirm the initiating event in SBO. Mechanical obstruction causes accumulation of gas and fluid proximally, raising intraluminal pressure and producing segmental small-bowel distension; radiographically, high-grade obstruction often shows the classic triad of dilated loops, multiple air-fluid levels, and paucity of colonic gas, which reflects that distension physiology, but I should verify that sensitivity is imperfect so imaging must be contextualized with clinical data [^113V7zqS] [^111YCLJw].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic consequences of that distension. As intraluminal pressure persists, mesenteric venous outflow is compressed first and, with progression, arterial inflow may be compromised, reducing mural perfusion and causing ischemia; lab correlates that raise my suspicion for ischemia include low serum bicarbonate, low arterial pH, and elevated lactate, though none alone is definitive and must be tied to the bedside picture and CT signs of strangulation or a closed-loop mechanism [^113V7zqS] [^114K9YdH] [^113Pauff].

> I will now examine the metabolic shift that follows ischemia. Ischemic mucosa cannot sustain aerobic metabolism and shifts toward anaerobic glycolysis, producing excess L-lactate that manifests as type A (hypoxic) lactic acidosis; I need to ensure I am classifying this correctly as type A rather than type B, and the major reviews and case series support intestinal ischemia as a canonical type A cause [^117QzUyt] [^113F3PGr].

> Hold on, I should verify whether there are experimental data supporting a lactate signal from ischemic gut. In large-animal models, stepwise reductions in superior mesenteric artery flow reach a threshold below which gut luminal lactate rises, indicating mucosal anaerobic metabolism; that mechanistic signal underpins why systemic lactate can climb as ischemia worsens, although barrier function and clearance capacity also modify what we see in blood [^117PauKe].

> Next, I should review how locally produced lactate becomes systemic acidosis. Lactate generated in the ischemic segment enters the portal circulation and then the systemic circulation; when production outstrips hepatic and renal clearance, serum lactate rises, bicarbonate falls, and pH declines, yielding a high anion gap metabolic acidosis that can support the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia when integrated with clinical and imaging data, but I should double-check that lactate is neither sensitive nor specific enough to exclude early ischemia on its own [^114K9YdH] [^113Pauff] [^114w5456].

> But wait, what if the obstruction is not relieved. Ongoing ischemia can advance to transmural necrosis, bacterial translocation, peritonitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure, each of which amplifies lactate generation and further acidemia; this vicious spiral underscores why metabolic acidosis and rising lactate, together with peritoneal signs or CT features of strangulation, lower my threshold for emergent operative intervention [^113V7zqS] [^112QB3NV].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should consider the D-lactate alternative because it is easy to conflate mechanisms. In short-bowel syndrome or after bowel-shortening surgeries, malabsorbed carbohydrates can be fermented by colonic bacteria to D-lactate, causing episodic metabolic acidosis and neurocognitive symptoms; that is a type B, non-hypoxic mechanism distinct from the L-lactate, ischemia-driven pathway in uncomplicated mechanical SBO, and I need to ensure I do not misattribute D-lactate physiology to acute SBO without the short-bowel context [^116ZV7hr] [^113mJLs1] [^116WwVcK].

> I should double-check a common pitfall about lactate as a diagnostic test. Initially, I was inclined to treat lactate as an early and reliable marker of mesenteric ischemia; hold on, that overstates its performance because meta-analytic data indicate lactate should not be used to exclude acute mesenteric ischemia, as clearance and production dynamics can mask early disease, so elevated values should trigger escalation but normal values do not reassure, and I must also consider type B elevations from drugs like metformin or malignancy-related metabolic reprogramming in the right clinical context [^114w5456] [^117QzUyt] [^112s3Epc] [^113QNbRt].

> Stepping back, the causal chain is coherent: obstruction leads to proximal distension, which compromises mesenteric perfusion, producing bowel-wall ischemia; ischemic mucosa relies on anaerobic glycolysis, generating L-lactate that burdens systemic clearance and yields type A lactic acidosis; if ischemia progresses, necrosis and sepsis further elevate lactate and worsen acidosis, and at that point, clinical deterioration with metabolic acidosis becomes a key trigger for urgent operative management rather than prolonged conservative care [^113V7zqS] [^113LR616] [^112zPWLr] [^111YCLJw].

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) causes lactic acidosis primarily through **bowel wall ischemia** from increased intraluminal pressure and compromised mesenteric perfusion [^113V7zqS], leading to anaerobic glycolysis and lactate accumulation [^111YCLJw]. Additional contributors include **bacterial fermentation** of malabsorbed carbohydrates producing D-lactate [^116ZV7hr], and systemic hypoperfusion from dehydration and sepsis that further increases lactate production and impairs clearance [^113V7zqS] [^117QzUyt]. Early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent progression to necrosis, perforation, and multi-organ failure [^112QB3NV].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Bowel wall ischemia and anaerobic metabolism

- **Intraluminal pressure**: SBO increases intraluminal pressure, compressing mesenteric vessels and reducing perfusion, causing ischemia and hypoxia [^113V7zqS].

- **Anaerobic glycolysis**: Hypoxic enterocytes shift to anaerobic glycolysis, converting pyruvate to lactate and causing lactic acidosis [^1134BsJv].

- **Ischemia severity**: Strangulation or closed-loop obstruction rapidly worsens ischemia and lactate production [^1172Dmsp].

---

### Bacterial fermentation and D-lactic acidosis

In SBO, **malabsorption** allows carbohydrates to reach the colon, where bacteria ferment them to D-lactate [^113mJLs1]. Systemic **D-lactate absorption** contributes to metabolic acidosis and neurologic symptoms [^113mJLs1] [^116WwVcK].

---

### Systemic hypoperfusion and impaired lactate clearance

Hypovolemia from vomiting and third-spacing leads to shock, reducing perfusion and increasing **anaerobic metabolism** [^113V7zqS] [^1134BsJv]. Hepatic clearance is also reduced due to hypoperfusion and **hepatic dysfunction**, worsening acidosis [^117QzUyt].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Clinical signs**: Lactic acidosis in SBO presents with abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis [^113V7zqS] [^111HsoMn].

- **Diagnostic approach**: Early recognition with clinical assessment, laboratory tests (lactate, electrolytes, renal function) [^111YCLJw], and imaging (CT) is essential [^113V7zqS] [^114oJRNW].

- **Management**: Prompt resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and timely surgical intervention are critical to prevent necrosis, perforation, and multi-organ failure [^1138bjgk] [^112zPWLr].

---

Small bowel obstruction causes lactic acidosis through ischemia-induced anaerobic metabolism, bacterial D-lactate production, and systemic hypoperfusion and impaired clearance; **early detection and intervention are essential** to prevent severe complications [^117QzUyt].

### Small bowel obstruction [^113V7zqS]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.
- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

### Fecal transplantation successfully treats recurrent D-lactic acidosis in a child with short bowel syndrome [^116ZV7hr]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

D-lactic acidosis can occur in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) when excessive malabsorbed carbohydrates enter the colon and are metabolized by colonic bacteria to D-lactate. D-lactate can be absorbed systemically, and increased serum levels are associated with central nervous system toxicity manifested by confusion, ataxia, and slurred speech. Therapy, usually directed toward suppressing intestinal bacterial overgrowth and limiting ingested carbohydrates, is not always successful.

Fecal transplantation — the infusion of donor feces into a recipient's intestinal tract — has been used for decades to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Case reports document its use in the successful treatment of constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, but it is surmised that the alteration of the intestinal microbiome, as well as the reintroduction of potentially beneficial microbes, helps mediate disease. Here, we present the case of a child with SBS and recurrent, debilitating D-lactic acidosis, which was successfully treated with fecal transplantation.

The minimum required laboratory tests include blood count, lactate, electrolytes, CRP, and BUN/creatinine. Laboratory values that might indicate peritonitis are a CRP > 75 and a white blood cell count > 10,000/mm³, although the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are relatively low. Electrolytes are often disturbed in patients with a bowel obstruction; in particular, low potassium values are frequently found and need to be corrected. BUN/creatinine needs to be assessed, as patients with ASBO are frequently dehydrated, which could result in acute kidney injury.

- **Plain X-rays**: The value of plain X-rays complementary to physical examination is limited. In high-grade obstruction, a triad of multiple air-fluid levels, distention of small bowel loops, and absence of gas in the colon are pathognomonic for small bowel obstruction, but overall sensitivity and specificity of plain X-rays are low, with sensitivity approximately 70%. A large volume pneumoperitoneum secondary to bowel perforation in ASBO can also be detected on plain X-rays, preferably by an erect chest X-ray; however, plain X-rays do not detect the more early signs of peritonitis or strangulation. Furthermore, a plain abdominal X-ray does not provide anatomical information that helps differentiate between the various causes of bowel obstruction.

- **Water-soluble contrast studies**: Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the usefulness of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of ASBO. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray taken two hours after administration, surgery may be indicated.

A 39-year-old woman, who conceived following in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, presented at 12 weeks gestation with symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Subsequent investigations found small bowel obstruction secondary to ovarian torsion. Surgical management to remove a necrotic ovary and fallopian tube led to a good recovery from the acute illness. A postoperative ultrasound scan confirmed a viable pregnancy, and the patient was discharged. Her case demonstrates a rare complication of OHSS and ovarian torsion leading to small bowel obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^1177YKxY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common emergency diagnosis in elderly patients, and its occurrence tends to increase parallel to the growing number of elderly patients requiring acute medical care and emergency surgery. Approximately 10–12% of patients above 65 years presenting with abdominal pain at the emergency department (ED) are diagnosed with small bowel obstruction. In general, SBO is one of the most frequent causes of general emergency surgery. In the UK, small bowel obstruction accounts for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Adhesiolysis and small bowel resection are two of seven main causes accounting for 80% of morbidity and mortality related to emergency surgery. Any emergency surgery in the elderly is associated with high morbidity and mortality compared to elective operations.

Management of small bowel obstruction has advanced over recent years, resulting in improved treatment outcomes for the general population. Computed tomography (CT) has been a significant step forward in detecting different etiologies of bowel obstruction and the completeness of the obstruction. Adding water-soluble contrast can accurately predict the completeness of the obstruction and successful conservative treatment. These diagnostic tools have led to a more tailored approach and a reduction in immediate operations. Today, more than 70% of small bowel obstructions are treated successfully by a conservative approach, avoiding the risks of potentially complicated operations. Additionally, laparoscopic surgery for small bowel obstruction has been introduced as a treatment option.

### Radiation induced small bowel "web" formation is associated with acquired microvascular dysfunction [^11427V34]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

Radiation therapy of abdominal and pelvic solid tumors results in late intestinal toxicity of a severe nature in approximately 5% of cases. These manifestations may include ischemia and stricture formation, which may present as "webs". These webs are likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of bowel obstruction. The mechanisms of microvascular injury to the bowel in the setting of radiation have not been defined. We hypothesized that microvascular dysfunction with impaired vasodilation to acetylcholine (Ach) would be an acquired pathophysiological abnormality in radiation and "web" formation.

A 40-year-old patient treated with radiation, two years previously, for anal squamous cell cancer presented with small bowel obstruction. "Webs" in the distal ileum were detected using wireless capsule endoscopy after small bowel barium radiographs failed to demonstrate a lesion. Following resection, freshly isolated 50–150 μm diameter arterioles from the "web" and adjacent normal caliber bowel were analyzed with histology and microvessel physiological studies.

After constriction (30–50%) with endothelin, dilation to graded doses of Ach (10^-9 to 10^-4 M) was observed in vessels dissected from the stricture and the adjacent normal caliber area. Ach dilation was reduced in vessels from the "web" (mean diameter 7 ± 2%; n = 3, p < 0.01) compared with the adjacent unaffected bowel (mean diameter 85 ± 5%). Dihydroethidine and dichlorofluorescein diacetate intravital staining demonstrated increased reactive oxygen species production.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^11791jsY]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

In this study, subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic acidosis revealed that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival outcomes for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have lactic acidosis or non-lactic acidosis. However, it was observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively reduces the mortality risk of patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L) in both types of patients, while it increases the mortality risk of patients without hyperchloremia (chloride < 107 mmol/L). This indicates that the level of lactate does not influence the impact of chloride levels on sodium bicarbonate treatment.

Among non-lactic acidosis patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, there was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality risk between patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment after matching and those who did not. This is because the mortality rate of non-lactic acidosis patients themselves is relatively low, and the reduction in sample size after matching leads to a decrease in statistical power. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment was still lower. Findings of this study suggest that in pediatric metabolic acidosis, if chloride is markedly elevated, sodium bicarbonate therapy might be considered even if lactate is high. Whereas if chloride is normal, clinicians should be more cautious and ensure other treatments are prioritized.

### Small and large bowel volvulus: Clues to early recognition and complications [^117SYti2]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Small and large bowel volvulus are uncommon causes of bowel obstruction with nonspecific clinical manifestations, which may delay the diagnosis and increase morbidity. Therefore, radiologists play an important role in promptly establishing the diagnosis, recognizing underlying congenital or acquired risk factors, and detecting potentially life-threatening complications. Multidetector CT performed with intravenous contrast is currently the preferred modality for the evaluation of volvulus. It is best appreciated when imaging is perpendicular to the axis of bowel rotation, hence the benefit of multiplanar reformations.

In this pictorial essay, we review the pathophysiology of the different types of intestinal volvulus and discuss diagnostic criteria for prompt diagnosis of volvulus. We emphasize the early recognition of the complications.

### Glucovance [^116LCL76]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious metabolic complication that can occur due to the accumulation of metformin during treatment with Glucovance (glyburide and metformin HCl) tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with several pathophysiological conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. It is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases per 1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases per 1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years of exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, particularly those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis.

### Point-of-care procalcitonin may predict the need for surgical treatment in patients with small bowel obstruction [^115PRjqD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The early identification of patients with small bowel obstruction who require surgical treatment could potentially lead to improved patient outcomes. We evaluated the efficacy of point-of-care procalcitonin for predicting surgical treatment among patients with small bowel obstruction.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study. We measured serum procalcitonin levels in patients who presented to the emergency department and were diagnosed with small bowel obstruction from April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019. Patients were grouped into two groups: the elevated procalcitonin and normal procalcitonin groups. Our primary outcome was surgical treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 53 patients with small bowel obstruction were included in the study, and 11 patients (20.8%) were treated operatively. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for age, between the elevated procalcitonin (≥ 0.12 ng/ml) and normal procalcitonin groups. The elevated procalcitonin level was significantly correlated with surgical treatment and hospital length of stay (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood of procalcitonin for the former were 45.5%, 85.7%, and 5.0, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The patients with small bowel obstruction who had elevated procalcitonin levels on presentation showed a significantly higher rate of surgical treatment than those who had normal procalcitonin levels. Point-of-care procalcitonin might predict the need for surgical treatment in patients with small bowel obstruction and could be used as an additional diagnostic test. Further study is warranted.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^113LR616]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

- **Operative management vs non-operative management**: Patients without signs of strangulation, peritonitis, persistent vomiting, or a combination of CT scan signs (such as free fluid, mesenteric edema, lack of feces signs, and devascularized bowel) with partial ASBO can safely undergo non-operative management (Level of Evidence 1a, Grade of Recommendation A). In these patients, tube decompression should be attempted (Level of Evidence 1b, Grade of Recommendation A), either with a nasogastric tube (NGT) or a long tube (LT).

	- In conservatively treated patients with ASBO, the drainage volume through the long tube on day 3 (cut-off value: 500 mL) was the indicator for surgery. Additionally, in patients with repeated episodes and many prior laparotomies for adhesions, prolonged conservative treatment (including parenteral nutritional support) may be prudent and can often avoid a complex high-risk procedure. However, the use of supplementary diagnostic tools might be desirable to identify patients who will need early operative treatment.

	- Patients who had surgery within six weeks before the episode of small bowel obstruction, those with signs of strangulation or peritonitis (fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and continuous pain), patients with irreducible hernia, and those who begin to show signs of resolution at the time of admission are NOT candidates for conservative treatment, with or without water-soluble contrast agent (WSCA) administration (Level of Evidence 1a, Grade of Recommendation A).

	- Complete small bowel obstruction (SBO) characterized by the absence of air within the large bowel and increased serum creatine phosphokinase predicts failure of non-operative management (NOM) (Level of Evidence 2b, Grade of Recommendation C).

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis mimicking ischaemic bowel [^115XRgiE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare complication among patients who are diabetic. It commonly presents with non-specific findings and develops mostly among those with other risk factors for lactic acidosis. We report the development of MALA in a 67-year-old man with diabetes who presented with progressive abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea. On presentation, the patient was in shock, with signs suggestive of peritonitis, severe lactic acidosis, renal failure, and non-specific findings on abdominal CT. Neither the patient nor family could provide details of his home pharmaceuticals.

Circulatory resuscitation with intravenous crystalloids and vasopressors was commenced, along with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics. Emergent laparotomy did not show pathological findings. Emergent haemodialysis, initiated postoperatively, resulted in rapid resolution of shock and lactic acidosis. A list of the patient's medications, provided afterwards by the family, included metformin. Microbiological studies remained negative, and renal function normalized by the time of the patient's hospital discharge after 9 days.

### Abacavir and lamivudine [^114VmGSf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Abacavir and lamivudine tablets can cause serious side effects.

- **Most important information**: Refer to the section, "What is the most important information I should know about abacavir and lamivudine tablets?"

- **Lactic acidosis**: An excess of lactic acid in your blood can lead to a serious medical emergency, potentially causing death. Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience symptoms such as feeling very weak or tired, feeling cold (especially in your arms and legs), experiencing unusual muscle pain, feeling dizzy or light-headed, having trouble breathing, a fast or irregular heartbeat, or stomach pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

- **Severe liver problems**: In some cases, these can be life-threatening. Symptoms may include liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and fatty liver (steatosis). Seek medical attention if you notice your skin or the white part of your eyes turning yellow (jaundice), loss of appetite for several days or longer, dark or "tea-colored" urine, nausea, light-colored stools, or pain, aching, or tenderness on the right side of your stomach area.

You may be more prone to developing lactic acidosis or serious liver problems if you are female or significantly overweight (obese).

### Can small bowel obstruction during pregnancy be treated with conservative management? A review [^113rb3Pj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction can occur during pregnancy, which, if missed, can lead to dire consequences for both the mother and fetus. Management of this condition usually requires surgical intervention; however, only a small number of patients are treated conservatively.

- **Objective**: The objective was to review the literature to determine the feasibility of conservative management for small bowel obstruction.

- **Methods**: A systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed using the keywords [small bowel obstruction AND pregnancy]. All original articles were then reviewed and included in this review if deemed suitable.

- **Conclusion**: Conservative management of small bowel obstruction in pregnant women is feasible if the patient is clinically stable and after ruling out bowel ischemia and closed-loop obstruction.

### Lactic acidosis in the rectal lumen of patients with septic shock measured by luminal equilibrium dialysis [^1162hRrx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

Gut ischaemia may contribute to morbidity in sepsis, but little is known about the metabolic state of the gut mucosa in such patients.

- **Methods**: Nine patients with abdominal septic shock treated with norepinephrine, and ten healthy subjects, were subjected to equilibrium dialysis with a rectal balloon. Measurements of pH, PCO(2), and concentrations of L-lactate were performed using an auto-analyser.

- **Results**: In rectal dialysis fluid from patients with septic shock, acidosis was present (pH 7.23, 95% CI 7.11–7.36), and concentrations of L-lactate were approximately five times greater than those in controls (2.5–5.8 vs. 0.5–1.2 mmol litre(-1)). The lactate concentration correlated with the dose of norepinephrine (P < 0.001). In contrast, values of dialysate PCO(2) did not differ significantly between patients and controls (6.4–11.0 vs. 8.9–13.8 kPa).

- **Conclusions**: The results suggest that lactic acidosis in rectal mucosa is related either to shock severity or to norepinephrine causing mucosal ischaemia. In any case, metabolic dysfunction is present in the rectal mucosa of patients with abdominal septic shock treated with norepinephrine.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical scenarios**: Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level.

	- **Type A hyperlactatemia** includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia.

	- **Type B hyperlactatemia** broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism.

In critically ill patients encountered in the ED, septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

### Metabolic acidosis in short bowel syndrome: Think D-lactic acid acidosis [^113mJLs1]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a condition when a person's gastrointestinal function is insufficient to supply the body with essential nutrients and hydration. Patients with SBS suffer from diarrhea and symptoms of malabsorption such as weight loss, electrolyte disturbances, and vitamin deficiencies. Long-term management of this condition can be complicated by the underlying disease, the abnormal bowel function, and issues related to treatment like the administration of parenteral nutrition and the use of a central venous catheter. Here, we describe a case of D-lactic acid acidosis, a rarer complication of SBS, presenting with generalized weakness and severe metabolic acidosis.

### Lactic acidosis and colon cancer: Oncologic emergency [^116W9tXY]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented shortly after the diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer with profound lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Her acid-base disturbance was unresponsive to medical management but resolved after the initiation of systemic chemotherapy.

In addition to malignancy-associated lactic acidosis, this case illustrates several other issues, including the factors involved in choosing the initial chemotherapy regimen, sequencing subsequent therapies, and the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in following response to treatment. It is important to report this case of a rare but serious complication of malignancy in order to increase recognition and understanding of this presentation.

### Monitoring of perioperative tissue perfusion and impact on patient outcomes [^111ouMTf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The influence of metabolism and tissue perfusion on patient outcomes: Lactic acid is primarily produced in muscles, intestines, red blood cells, brain, and skin and is metabolized by the liver and kidneys. As a metabolic marker, lactic acid, along with pH value, is widely used to reflect tissue hypoperfusion, particularly in critically ill patients. In septic shock, elevated lactate levels are closely linked to disease severity and mortality. Treatment strategies targeting lactate reduction have been shown to lower mortality rates in septic shock, cardiac surgery, and other shock states. This highlights the critical relationship between lactate levels, organ perfusion, and metabolism, and their impact on patient prognosis.

Compared with central venous oxygen saturation, lactate is a more specific indicator of anaerobic metabolism and tissue perfusion, as it is not affected by perfusion shunts or disorders in tissue oxygen utilization. Lactate-directed early recovery strategies have significantly improved survival rates in sepsis patients.

- **Lactic acid versus central venous oxygen saturation**: Lactic acid can better reflect the abnormal perfusion of tissue compared with central venous oxygen saturation.

It is important to differentiate between the two main types of lactate acidosis. Type A lactate acidosis results from tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia, as seen in septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or severe trauma. Type B lactate acidosis is caused by metabolic dysfunction without hypoperfusion, as seen in liver failure, certain medications, or malignancies. This review primarily refers to type A lactate acidosis.

### Inhaling nitrous oxide or xenon does not influence bowel wall energy balance during porcine bowel obstruction [^111Rfv1v]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2002). Low credibility.

Xenon (Xe) is less soluble than nitrous oxide (N₂O) and hence may be more suitable during bowel obstruction. We compared the intestinal mechanical and biochemical effects of these two gases with those of total intravenous (IV) anesthesia in a porcine model of small-bowel obstruction. Intestinal obstruction was induced in 33 anesthetized pigs, in 18 of which segmental ileal perfusion was reduced by partial arterial occlusion.

The pigs received total IV anesthesia, Xe, or N₂O (in 30% oxygen) for 4 hours. We determined the intraluminal pressure and volume, the arterial-ileal PCO₂ gap, and the lactate and pyruvate levels in the segmental mesenteric vein. Under both experimental conditions, Xe or N₂O ventilation caused the volume to significantly increase, with a concomitant significant increase in the intraluminal pressure during N₂O ventilation. Regardless of the anesthesia technique, none of the biochemical variables was influenced in the animals with maintained ileal blood supply.

In contrast, reducing the segmental perfusion induced pronounced alterations of all variables of bowel wall energy metabolism. The type of anesthesia, however, had no further statistically significant effect. Short-term inhalation of Xe or N₂O seems to have no deleterious effects on the metabolic balance of the gut wall during intestinal obstruction.

In anesthetized pigs, short-term inhalation of xenon or nitrous oxide over 4 hours, when compared with total IV anesthesia, had no additional deleterious effects on the metabolic balance of the gut wall during intestinal obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction: who needs an operation? A multivariate prediction model [^1172Dmsp]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Proper management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) requires a methodology to prevent nontherapeutic laparotomy while minimizing the chance of overlooking strangulation obstruction causing intestinal ischemia. Our aim was to identify preoperative risk factors associated with strangulating SBO and to develop a model to predict the need for operative intervention in the presence of an SBO. Our hypothesis was that free intraperitoneal fluid on computed tomography (CT) is associated with the presence of bowel ischemia and need for exploration.

- **Methods**: We reviewed 100 consecutive patients with SBO, all of whom had undergone CT that was reviewed by a radiologist blinded to outcome. The need for operative management was confirmed retrospectively by four surgeons based on operative findings and the patient's clinical course.

- **Results**: Patients were divided into two groups: group 1, who required operative management on retrospective review, and group 2, who did not. Four patients who were treated nonoperatively had ischemia or died of malignant SBO and were then included in group 1; two patients who had a nontherapeutic exploration were included in group 2. On univariate analysis, the need for exploration (n = 48) was associated (p < 0.05) with a history of malignancy (29% vs. 12%), vomiting (85% vs. 63%), and CT findings of either free intraperitoneal fluid (67% vs. 31%), mesenteric edema (67% vs. 37%), mesenteric vascular engorgement (85% vs. 67%), small bowel wall thickening (44% vs. 25%) or absence of the "small bowel feces sign" (so-called fecalization) (10% vs. 29%).

### Small bowel obstruction [^111HsoMn]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). High credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is associated with a range of symptoms and clinical findings, including fatigue, abdominal cramps, and abdominal surgery. It can lead to small bowel dilatation, nausea, and peritoneal adhesions. Additional symptoms include abdominal distension, tenderness to palpation, dehydration, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. Patients may also experience fever, leukocytosis, periumbilical abdominal pain, and poorly localized abdominal pain. Other associated symptoms include tachycardia, right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, loss of appetite, chronic lower abdominal pain, increased white blood cell (WBC) count, increased serum amylase, bloating, diffuse abdominal pain, epigastric abdominal pain, abdominal hernia, and constipation.

### An exercise in clinical reasoning: Use of social context in diagnosing an elevated lactate [^1112J8vC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The constellation of symptoms, history, vital signs, and exam findings do not indicate systemic hypoperfusion or local ischemia; therefore, this presentation is most consistent with type B lactic acidosis. His B symptoms raise concern for subacute to chronic infection, malignancy, or another inflammatory process. Hyperviscosity syndrome as a malignant complication should also be considered given the headaches, epistaxis, and hearing loss.

The chief concern of rhinosinusitis, along with unilateral tinnitus, vertigo, and epistaxis, all localize to the head. Therefore, testing should include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the sinuses, posterior cerebral fossa, and internal auditory canal.

Here is my updated presentation: a 65-year-old man with a remote history of gastric cancer presenting with antibiotic-refractory chronic rhinosinusitis, co-localizing unilateral hearing loss and epistaxis, and subacute B symptoms, found to have type B lactic acidosis.

### An extreme and life-threatening case of recurrent D-lactate encephalopathy [^115JR1dx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

D-lactic acidosis has been reported in patients following a variety of gastrointestinal surgeries, particularly jejunoileal bypass. An insufficient length of the small intestine to metabolize ingested carbohydrates leads to an abnormal carbohydrate load in the colon. These carbohydrates are metabolized by colonic anaerobes (especially *Lactobacillus* species) into the dextrorotary isomer of lactate. Unlike its levorotary counterpart, D-lactate has neurotoxic effects, and patients suffering from a significant D-lactate burden may suffer encephalopathic symptoms. These symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting in patients with normal renal function.

We present here a case of D-lactic acidosis in a patient with end-stage renal disease who developed life-threatening respiratory failure due to severe D-lactic acid encephalopathy. To our knowledge, no previously reported case has been sufficiently severe to necessitate endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. An array of treatments, including hemodialysis, effected a prompt reversal of sensorium to baseline. We describe the potential treatments for D-lactic acidosis, which can be viewed as a paradigm of substrate, catalyst, and pathologic product, and review reports of their relative efficacy.

### Type A versus type B lactic acidosis in the context of undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma [^113F3PGr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis, characterized by an imbalance between lactate production and clearance, is classified into type A and type B. Type A is associated with tissue hypoxia and shock, while type B occurs without hypoxia, often due to metabolic disturbances, such as cancer-related metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect. This case series presents two patients with undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma who exhibited distinct forms of lactic acidosis.

The first patient, with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, developed type A lactic acidosis, with escalating lactate levels despite aggressive resuscitation. The second patient, with stable hemodynamics but persistently elevated lactate, exhibited type B lactic acidosis, likely due to the Warburg effect of lymphoma. These cases underscore the importance of differentiating between type A and type B lactic acidosis, as the underlying etiology guides treatment strategies. Early recognition of the cause is crucial for optimal management and patient outcomes, particularly in malignancy-associated metabolic disturbances.

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^114K9YdH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

A complete blood count, renal function and electrolytes (to exclude pre-renal acute renal failure), and liver function tests are suggested as the first laboratory tests. Low serum bicarbonate levels, low arterial blood pH, high lactic acid level, marked leukocytosis, and hyperamylasemia may be useful in the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia. A coagulation profile should also be tested because of the potential need for emergency surgery.

- **Initial management**: Supportive treatment must begin as soon as possible with intravenous crystalloids, anti-emetics, and bowel rest. Isotonic dextrose-saline crystalloid and balanced isotonic crystalloid replacement fluids containing supplemental potassium in an equivalent volume to the patient's losses are recommended. Nasogastric suction can be diagnostically useful to analyze gastric contents; a feculent gastric aspirate is characteristic of distal small bowel obstruction or large bowel obstruction. Nasogastric suction can also be therapeutically important to prevent aspiration pneumonia by decompressing the proximal bowel. A Foley catheter should also be inserted to monitor urine output.

- **Diagnostic evaluation**:
	- **Abdominal plain X-ray**: Abdominal plain X-ray is the first level radiologic study. In small bowel obstruction, plain abdominal radiographic findings are diagnostic in 50–60%, inconclusive in 20–30%, and misleading in 10–20% of patients.

In one study after radiography, the sensitivity of bowel obstruction was significantly higher than after other diagnostic evaluations.

### Reperfusion injury on computed tomography following endovascular revascularization of acute mesenteric ischemia: Prevalence, risk factors, and patient outcome [^1149F9Xk]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Based on these findings and after the removal of the variable of lactate due to its lower weight, the rate of reperfusion injury (RI) in the study population increased from 7% in patients with no predictive factors to 36%, 50%, and 81% in patients with 1, 2, and 3 factors, respectively (see Fig. 4). This CT score had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve to predict RI of 0.834 (95% confidence interval: 0.720–0.948). The addition of serum lactate did not improve the predictive value (AUC 0.832, 95% confidence interval: 0.714–0.951).

- **Rate of reperfusion injury**: The score includes the presence of a decreased enhancement of the bowel wall on pre-treatment CT, an embolic as the cause of the mesenteric ischemia, and complete occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (each equally graded as 1 point).

- **Patient outcomes**: Secondary bowel resection was required in 9 out of 50 patients (18%), with a greater proportion in patients with RI (7 out of 22 patients; 32%) than in those without (2 out of 28 patients; 7%, p = 0.03). Transmural necrosis on pathology was found in 2 out of 7 resected patients with RI and 1 out of 2 patients without RI and resected. The remaining 6 out of 9 patients had limited mucosal or submucosal necrosis. Mean resected bowel length was 80.0 cm (range 46–115) in patients with RI and 48 cm (range 16–80) in patients without RI (p = 0.33).

The three-month survival rate of the cohort was 76%, with 12 deaths (all in-hospital). There was no difference according to the occurrence of RI (22 out of 28 vs. 16 out of 22; log rank = 0.73).

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: Guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^113Pauff]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

There are no laboratory studies that are sufficiently accurate to identify the presence or absence of ischemic or necrotic bowel, although elevated L-lactate and D-dimer may assist. More than 90% of patients will have an abnormally elevated leukocyte count. The second most commonly encountered abnormal finding is metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate level, occurring in 88% of cases.

Patients may present with lactic acidosis due to dehydration and decreased oral intake. Differentiation of early ischemia versus irreversible bowel injury based solely on lactate levels is not reliable unless accompanied by other clinical evidence. Elevated serum lactate levels greater than 2 mmol/L are associated with irreversible intestinal ischemia (Hazard Ratio: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4–11.5; p < 0.05).

- **D-dimer levels**:
	- D-dimer levels > 0.9 mg/L have a specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of 82%, 60%, and 79%, respectively. Hence, D-dimer may be useful in the early assessment of acute mesenteric ischemia.

### Small bowel emergency surgery: Literature's review [^116NkUua]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute mechanical obstruction of the intestine is a common surgical emergency and a major cause of admission to emergency surgery departments. Small bowel obstruction occurs when there is an obstacle to the flow of luminal contents caused by an extrinsic or intrinsic encroachment on the lumen. Adynamic ileus presents the same symptoms as mechanical obstruction, but the underlying problem is disordered motility. One of the keys to management of intestinal obstruction is early diagnosis. Accurate early recognition of strangulation is crucial because this emergency causes bowel ischemia, necrosis, and perforation.

In neonates, the most common causes are atresia, midgut volvulus, and meconium ileus. In infants, causes include groin hernia, intussusception, and Meckel's diverticulum. In young adults and adults, adhesions and groin hernia are prevalent causes. In small bowel obstruction, the normal mechanisms of intestinal absorption are compromised, leading to an excess of fluid loss. Initially, symptoms such as vomiting, bowel wall edema, and transudation into the peritoneal cavity are present. In later stages, venous pressure increases with consequent bleeding into the lumen and aggravation of hypovolemia.

Diagnosis is usually clinical. The main symptoms include abdominal pain, absence of flatus or stool, nausea or vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal distention if the obstruction is not in the proximal jejunum. Moreover, the kind of pain suggests the level of the small bowel obstruction. Proximal obstructions tend to present with more frequent cramps, whereas distal obstructions cause less frequent cramping.

### Homocysteine (HCY), a novel biomarker for predicting irreversible transmural intestinal necrosis in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction: Results from a prospective observational study [^1145ZhGW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies, particularly those necessitating emergent operations. Notably, post-operative adhesions are identified as the primary cause of small bowel obstruction, accounting for 60% of cases.

Despite its high clinical prevalence, the management of ASBO remains primarily driven by surgeons' empirical judgment rather than standardized evidence-driven frameworks. This highlights the persistent gap in unified clinical guidelines. According to the two leading surgical guidelines — the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) recommendations and the Bologna guidelines — the management of ASBO has evolved from a routine immediate surgical approach to a more selective strategy, favoring nonoperative treatment when appropriate.

However, determining the optimal timing for intervention remains challenging, leading to ongoing controversy among surgeons regarding the choice between surgical and conservative management. This decision is particularly complex in frail or elderly patients, where it is crucial to carefully consider the risks and benefits of each approach. The timing of surgery plays a crucial role in determining patient outcomes, with the development of intestinal ischemia or necrosis serving as a pivotal factor in surgical decision-making. Currently, small bowel necrosis diagnosis relies on clinical peritonitis presentation and contrast-enhanced CT findings. Existing studies highlight CT's role in detecting such conditions.

### Value of dual-energy computed tomography in the diagnosis of bowel ischemia in patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction: a retrospective, dual-center study [^117J2yRz]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

To investigate the diagnostic value of rapid-kV-switching dual-energy CT (DECT) for identifying bowel ischemia in patients with mechanical small-bowel obstruction (SBO), compared to 120kVp-equivalent CT, this study was conducted retrospectively across two centers.

This included 112 patients with mechanical SBO. Clinical and surgical outcomes with histological findings were recorded as the reference standard. Three readers independently reviewed true unenhanced (TUE) and portal-venous 77-keV virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) (dataset#1), virtual unenhanced (VUE), iodine, and 50-keV VMI (dataset#2). Ischemia was defined as the presence of at least two CT features among reduced bowel-wall enhancement, diffuse mesenteric haziness, and a closed-loop mechanism. Unenhanced bowel-wall attenuation was also analyzed. Bowel-wall attenuation and iodine concentration were measured in involved loops and proximal dilated loops. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each CT feature. The association between iodine concentration and bowel ischemia was analyzed using ROC curves.

Forty-one (37%) patients underwent surgery. Twenty-four (21%) patients had findings of bowel ischemia, including 11 (10%) patients with irreversible ischemia (necrosis). Diagnostic performance for ischemia and necrosis was similar between both datasets for all readers (p > 0.49 for ischemia and p = 1 for necrosis). Increased bowel-wall attenuation on VUE or TUE images had a non-significantly different diagnostic value for all readers (p > 0.21 for ischemia and p > 0.78 for necrosis).

### Metformin hydrochloride [^112s3Epc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis has been documented in postmarketing cases, some of which were fatal. These cases typically had a subtle onset and were associated with nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence. Severe acidosis has led to hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The condition is characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis without ketonuria or ketonemia, and an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, while metformin plasma levels are generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin reduces liver uptake of lactate, elevating blood lactate levels and potentially increasing the risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in susceptible patients.

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be promptly instituted in a hospital setting, including the immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In patients treated with metformin hydrochloride who are diagnosed with or strongly suspected of having lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin, as metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with clearance rates of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Hemodialysis has frequently resulted in the reversal of symptoms and recovery.

Patients and their families should be educated about the symptoms of lactic acidosis. If these symptoms occur, they should be instructed to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report the symptoms to their healthcare provider.

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^112Ytiy5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Small and large bowel obstructions are responsible for approximately 15% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the United States and about 20% of cases requiring acute surgical care. Starting from the analysis of a common clinical problem, we aim to guide primary care physicians in the initial management of a patient presenting with acute abdominal pain associated with intestinal obstruction.

### Can serum L-lactate, D-lactate, creatine kinase and I-FABP be used as diagnostic markers in critically ill patients suspected for bowel ischemia [^114THJ54]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients occasionally develop ischemia in the splanchnic region. The incidence of clinically relevant ischemia is only known in cardiac surgery patients. The aetiology is diverse, but usually, mesenteric ischemia is categorized as obstructive or non-obstructive ischemia. The obstructive form is caused by a thrombus or embolus in one of the mesenteric arteries or veins. Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) develops due to low flow, usually as a result of severe shock. An ischemic bowel may also develop after aortic surgery due to either thrombi or a low flow state. In all cases, both the small and the large bowel may be affected. Regardless of the aetiology, diagnosing intestinal ischemia is difficult due to the non-specific clinical signs.

Biochemical markers are often used in the diagnostic workup. The use of L-lactate is ubiquitous despite its low sensitivity and specificity. D-lactate, the stereoisomer of the human L-lactate, may be a more specific marker. D-lactate is strictly a product of bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract, which includes bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus species, Klebsiella, and Bacteroides species. During intestinal ischemia, permeability increases due to decreased mucosal integrity, and D-lactate may diffuse into the portal circulation. It has been shown that serum D-lactate levels may be an early indicator for the detection of intestinal ischemia. A study by Assadian et al. showed elevated D-lactate levels in patients with histologically proven ischemic colitis after open aortic reconstruction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies, particularly those requiring emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction accounted for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that encompass 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in the United States. ASBO was identified as the most common diagnosis for the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, making up 60% of cases.

ASBO causes significant harm, resulting in an average hospitalization of 8 days and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20 and 30% of patients with ASBO require operative treatment. The length of hospitalization and morbidity are dependent on the need for surgical intervention: hospitalization averages 16 days following surgical treatment compared to 5 days with non-operative treatment. A Dutch study in 2016 estimated the associated costs at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for non-operative treatment.

Despite ASBO being a common condition, its prevention and treatment are often influenced by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. This area of medicine is characterized by a vast amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence regarding the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### Diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers to detect acute mesenteric ischaemia in adult patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114w5456]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Lactate is often used in clinical practice today; however, it clearly should not be used for exclusion of AMI. Lactate can be effectively metabolized in the liver, explaining why it does not serve as an early marker of AMI. Increased metabolism may cover increased production, whereas decreased metabolism may lead to elevated values without a relevant increase in production. However, elevated lactate should still call for our attention and perhaps trigger further investigation in patients with suspected AMI.

As one biomarker is currently insufficient to diagnose AMI, possible combinations of different biomarkers should be studied in hopes of providing additive value in diagnosis. At the same time, a rapid turnaround in laboratory analytics is an important factor necessary for any future biomarker of AMI.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The main strength of our study is the updated synthesis of evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of potential biomarkers of AMI. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first systematic review attempting separation of transmural ischaemia from earlier stages of AMI.

	- The limitations of our study are mainly related to the original studies, which are heterogeneous regarding patient populations (including control groups), types of AMI, laboratory methods, and cut-offs of biomarkers, and often do not report the time from development of symptoms to measurement of biomarkers. Thus, all the studies in our review were judged as being at risk of bias and/or having concerns regarding applicability. However, uncovering the need to set certain methodological standards for studi…

### L-lactic acidosis: Pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^117QzUyt]. Kidney International (2020). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis can arise from various conditions, including:

- **Liver-related conditions**: liver cirrhosis, liver metastasis, acute liver failure
- **Shock and ischemia**: sepsis and septic shock, hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, obstructive shock, acute limb ischemia, intestinal ischemia
- **Infections and overgrowth**: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
- **Cancer-related conditions**: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia
- **Neurological and metabolic disorders**: seizure disorders, malignant hyperthermia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, thiamine deficiency
- **Other medical conditions**: acute pancreatitis

Additionally, certain medications can induce lactic acidosis. These include:

- **Antiretrovirals**: stavudine, lamivudine, emtricitabine, didanosine DR, abacavir, zidovudine, dolutegravir, entecavir
- **Antidiabetics**: metformin, metformin ER, saxagliptin/metformin ER
- **Antibiotics**: linezolid

### Severe metabolic alkalosis and recurrent acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with Crohn's disease [^116oaLch]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Short bowel syndrome is a rare and devastating complication in chronic inflammatory bowel disease following the functional or anatomic loss of extensive segments of the small intestine. The incidence is estimated at 2–3 per million. The most common causes of short bowel syndrome in adults include Crohn's disease, mesenteric ischemia, trauma, radiation enteritis, and intestinal obstruction.

The clinical characteristics of short bowel syndrome are defined by malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition. Patients are at risk of developing short bowel syndrome if the length of viable small intestine is less than 200 cm. Under such conditions, the absorptive capacity and intestinal adaptation are profoundly compromised, often necessitating total parenteral nutrition. With the advent of new immunosuppressive regimens, intestinal transplantation has become the main therapeutic option in patients with irreversible intestinal failure. Current 1-year graft survival rates are as high as 80–90%.

### Avandamet [^113YCNAQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The onset of lactic acidosis is often subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms, and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur. Avandamet should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Avandamet, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug-related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious diseases.

Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking Avandamet do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis, such as ketonuria and ketonemia.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis presenting like acute mesenteric ischemia [^113QNbRt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is a rare but serious complication of taking metformin. Making the diagnosis in the emergency department requires vigilance because the presentation can mimic other diseases.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a patient with diabetes who presented moribund with symptoms and signs consistent with mesenteric ischemia. This diagnosis was seemingly confirmed through computed tomography and, as a result, the patient was brought to surgery for emergent exploratory laparotomy. Our patient made a remarkable recovery upon initiation of hemodialysis, demonstrating the need to initiate this life-saving procedure early.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Metformin levels are rarely available in the setting of the emergency department. Clinicians must remain alert, recognize that imaging studies may be misleading, and consider hemodialysis early in addition to surgical interventions.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^116ws9Fc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, lactate, electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, the first step in the diagnostic workup for ASBO is a supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray. The X-ray can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops, and the absence of gas in the colonic section. All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

- **Secondary evaluation**: A CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has great value for all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade SBO. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B). A CT scan often allows for confirmation of complete obstruction, helps to diagnose the cause of SBO, excludes non-adhesional pathology, and assesses the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and an NPV of nearly 100%. The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B). Ultrasound has limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with a distended bowel, as air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual ultrasound findings include distention, peristalsis (differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around the transition point, and free fluid (a sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: A retrospective study [^116Nsddx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Although lactate levels are strongly correlated with mortality, they are also an important biofuel utilized in various cellular processes and tissues throughout the body. Lactate can be appropriately produced under stress conditions and rapidly eliminated through cellular metabolism. The increase in lactate accumulation serves more as an indicator of the body's response to stress feedback. The emphasis on lactic acid itself contributing to the harm of acidosis may have been unnecessarily emphasized. Furthermore, the idea that anaerobic transport, tissue hypoxia, and resulting anaerobic glycolysis are key driving factors for lactic acidosis in sepsis has also been questioned. In this case, it can be reasonably explained to some extent why lactate levels do not affect the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate treatment.

- **Use of alkaline agents**: In addition to using alkaline agents to correct pH values, continuous renal replacement has been advocated to remove lactate. Unfortunately, in the presence of shock, lactate generation exceeds its clearance by continuous renal replacement. While no other types of alkalis have been proven to be effective and available, sodium bicarbonate remains the preferred alkali for clinicians.

- **Side effects and considerations**: Administration of sodium bicarbonate can have several side effects, including hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). It may even lead to increased lactate production. Therefore, some scholars do not advocate the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with non-toxic causes of metabolic acidosis. Some studies have observed that the staged use of sodium b…

Lactic acidosis is a common finding in neonates, where mitochondrial dysfunction is often secondary to tissue hypoperfusion, respiratory failure, and/or sepsis. Primary (non-physiological) lactic acidosis is comparatively rare and suggests the presence of an inborn error of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Optimal medical management and accurate prognostication require the correct determination of the etiology of lactic acidosis in a given patient. Unfortunately, genetic diagnoses are rare and highly variable for neonates presenting with primary lactic acidosis. Individual case reports may offer the most promise for treatment considerations.

The mitochondrion is a complex molecular machine incorporating the products of over 1000 distinct nuclear genes. Primary lactic acidoses are, therefore, characterized by high genetic heterogeneity, and a specific genetic diagnosis currently remains out of reach in most cases. Most mitochondriopathies with neonatal onset follow autosomal recessive inheritance and carry a poor prognosis. Here, we detail the case of a father and daughter with dominantly-inherited, resolving (i.e. transient) neonatal hyperlactatemia due to complex IV deficiency. We found no other published descriptions of benign transient complex IV deficiency with autosomal dominant inheritance.

- **Case presentation**: Both individuals presented as neonates with unexplained, marked lactic acidosis suggesting a primary mitochondrial disorder. Within the first weeks of life, elevated blood lactate levels normalized. Their clinical and developmental outcomes were normal.

### Glucovance [^112MKGDx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal discomfort. Hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias may be associated with more marked acidosis. Patients and their physicians must be aware of the potential significance of these symptoms. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if these symptoms occur. Glucovance should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose, and if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Glucovance, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during the initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug-related. The later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could indicate lactic acidosis or other serious diseases.

Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the normal range but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking Glucovance do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be due to other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling.

Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting.

### Small bowel obstruction in the emergency department: MDCT features of common and uncommon causes [^113me3nM]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a common condition encountered by radiologists in the emergency department. Although intestinal adhesions and obstructed hernias are the most common causes of acute small bowel obstruction, a variety of uncommon and rare conditions can also cause acute and subacute bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the workup of bowel obstruction by identifying the cause, level, and degree of obstruction. This article presents a comprehensive review of the multi-detector computed tomography features of common and uncommon causes of acute and subacute small bowel obstruction.

Regarding medical management for small bowel obstruction, particularly with respect to supportive management, the WSES 2018 guidelines recommend selecting nonoperative management as the treatment strategy of choice. This is advised in the absence of signs that require emergent surgical exploration, such as peritonitis, strangulation, or bowel ischemia.

### Consideration of alternative causes of lactic acidosis: Thiamine deficiency in malignancy [^112nzUo8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common metabolic acidosis characterized by increased serum lactate and is usually associated with decreased blood pH. Lactic acidosis has many different causes but has been differentiated into type A, hypoxic causes, and type B, non-hypoxic causes. Tissue hypoxia, type A, is the most common cause, usually secondary to processes such as sepsis and multi-organ failure. Type A must be differentiated from type B in the correct clinical setting as treatments are vastly different. Type B causes may include drug side effects, toxins, and enzymatic defects, whether inherited or acquired, which may lead to overproduction or underutilization of lactate.

However, as most clinicians are more familiar and likely more initially concerned with hypoxic etiologies, evaluation is directed toward finding the source of hypoperfusion or hypoxia, generally leading to a delay in discovering a type B cause (or mixed type A and type B). Here, we describe a case of lactic acidosis in the setting of thiamine deficiency thought to be secondary to advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the clinician to consider other causes of lactic acidosis when evaluating a patient.

### Gut luminal lactate release during gradual intestinal ischemia [^117PauKe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Gut ischemia induced by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) results in the release of lactate into the gut lumen. We studied the threshold of SMA flow reduction that leads to increased gut luminal lactate during stepwise reduction in SMA blood flow.

- **Design and setting**: A randomized, controlled animal experiment in a university experimental research laboratory.

- **Interventions**: Anesthetized, normoventilated, normovolemic domestic pigs were randomized to ischemia (n = 7) and sham groups (n = 7). SMA blood flow was reduced stepwise at 15-minute intervals by 22%, 44%, 66%, and 88% and kept constant thereafter for 60 minutes.

- **Measurements and results**: Jejunal luminal microdialysate lactate and mucosal pCO(2) were measured every 15 minutes. The luminal lactate increased over the upper normal limit of 0.2 mmol/L at a median SMA blood flow of 9.6 mL kg(-1) min(-1) (range 7.5–23.7). In five of seven animals, the increase in luminal lactate was preceded or accompanied by an increase in the mucosal-arterial pCO(2) gradient.

- **Conclusions**: There is a threshold of SMA blood flow below which gut luminal lactate increases, indicating mucosal anaerobic metabolism. Measurement of gut luminal lactate by microdialysis can be used to assess the adequacy of gut perfusion and the onset of anaerobic metabolism.

### Evaluation and management of small-bowel obstruction: An Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^114oJRNW]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small bowel obstruction, specifically with respect to abdominal CT, the EAST 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis in all patients with SBO. This is because it can provide incremental information over abdominal X-rays in differentiating grade, severity, and etiology of SBO and may lead to changes in management strategies.

### Homocysteine (HCY), a novel biomarker for predicting irreversible transmural intestinal necrosis in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction: Results from a prospective observational study [^112JtmQx]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Homocysteine (HCY) is a sulfur-containing amino acid that functions as a key intermediate in the methionine cycle, a critical pathway for protein metabolism and methylation reactions. Synthesized endogenously through the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways, HCY homeostasis is tightly regulated: remethylation (predominantly in the liver and kidneys) converts HCY back to methionine via vitamin B12 and folate-dependent enzymes, while transsulfuration (primarily in the liver and pancreas) irreversibly degrades excess HCY to cysteine, a process requiring vitamin B6 as a cofactor. In healthy adults, plasma HCY concentrations typically range from 5 to 15 µmol/L. Epidemiological and experimental studies have confirmed that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) (≥ 15 µM) is a well-established and validated independent risk factor for ischemic diseases, including stroke and myocardial infarction.

Mechanistically, homocysteine metabolism predominantly occurs in the liver, and its pathophysiological interplay with intestinal disorders can be understood within the intestine-liver axis framework. Additionally, our previous prospective cohort study revealed that preoperative serum HCY levels in small intestinal obstruction patients exhibited a significant positive correlation with CRP and PCT concentrations, suggesting HCY as a potential biomarker for intestinal obstruction severity. Furthermore, the HCY levels in the surgical cohort were significantly elevated compared to those in the non-surgical cohort, implying a threshold effect for surgical intervention. Consequently, we hypothesized that…

### Factors associated with D-lactic acidosis in pediatric intestinal failure: A case-control study [^116WwVcK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

D-lactic acidosis (DLA) is a serious complication of short bowel syndrome (SBS) in children with intestinal failure (IF). Malabsorbed carbohydrates are metabolized by bacteria in the intestine to D-lactate, which can lead to metabolic acidosis and neurologic symptoms.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed in children ≤ 18 years old with SBS who had one of the following criteria: unexplained metabolic acidosis, neurologic signs or symptoms, history of antibiotic therapy for small bowel bacterial overgrowth, or high clinical suspicion of DLA. Cases had serum D-lactate concentration > 0.25 mmol/L; controls had concentrations ≤ 0.25 mmol/L.

- **Results**: Of forty-six children, the median age was 3.16 years (interquartile range (IQR): 1.98, 5.82), and the median residual bowel length was 40 cm (IQR: 25, 59). There were 23 cases and 23 controls. Univariate analysis showed that cases had significantly lower median bicarbonate (19 vs. 24 mEq/L, p = 0.001), higher anion gap (17 vs. 14 mEq/L, p < 0.001), and were less likely to be receiving parenteral nutrition compared with children without DLA. Multivariable analysis identified midgut volvulus, history of intestinal lengthening procedure, and anion gap as significant independent risk factors. Midgut volvulus was the strongest independent factor associated with DLA (adjusted odds ratio = 17.1, 95% CI: 2.21, 133, p = 0.007).

- **Conclusion**: DLA is an important complication of pediatric IF due to SBS. Patients with IF, particularly those with a history of midgut volvulus, having undergone intestinal lengthening, or with anion gap acidosis, are at an increased risk.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^116zc9QP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with small bowel obstruction. The scarce literature available demonstrates that elderly patients have an increased risk for complications and mortality and might benefit from earlier surgical intervention. It is important to take patients' preferences into account when starting treatment in general and offering surgery specifically, because an operation may significantly affect quality of life. An assessment of frailty and a comprehensive geriatric approach to the elderly with small bowel obstruction, with multidisciplinary specialist care, is required from the start and preferably in the emergency department.

More research on the management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients is urgently needed considering the rise in this age group. We conclude that the management of small bowel obstruction requires more than just a 'copy and paste' of treatment recommendations and guidelines based on studies in younger adults. Based on knowledge about frail elderly and small bowel obstruction, a flowchart has been developed that offers an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction.

- **Algorithm with suggested diagnostic and therapeutic steps**: After assessing cognition, frailty, and patient goals according to diagnosis, the risks and benefits of surgical and conservative management should be weighed.

### Unusual causes of small bowel obstruction: A review of the literature and revisited cross-sectional imaging checklist [^113Ww9Go]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Patients presenting with features of small bowel obstruction need urgent evaluation to avoid complications such as bowel gangrene, perforation, or peritonitis. Imaging is necessary in most cases of suspected bowel obstruction to make appropriate decisions for apt patient management.

Among the common causes of small bowel obstruction, adhesions, external hernias, malignancies, and Crohn's disease top the chart. Imaging helps in determining the presence and severity of obstruction, identifying transition points, and understanding the cause of obstruction along with associated complications such as strangulation, bowel gangrene, and peritonitis. This review is based on cases with unusual causes of bowel obstruction encountered during routine practice and extensive literature searches through standard textbooks and electronic databases.

Through this review, we aim to provide readers with sound knowledge of the imaging characteristics of uncommon yet important causes of bowel obstruction. A checklist has been revisited and structured to simplify reporting suspected cases of small bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in diagnosing small bowel obstruction and determining its cause and associated complications. Awareness of uncommon causes and their imaging characteristics is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective patient management.

### Lactic acidosis as a complication of β-adrenergic aerosols [^111PPiDZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and impairs oxygen delivery. High lactate levels are associated with altered systemic hemodynamics, tissue hypoperfusion, and altered cellular metabolism. Increased lactate levels have also been reported as a complication of β-adrenergic agents administered during asthma therapy.

A 49-year-old woman with a prior diagnosis of asthma presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress. She immediately received, in 2 hours, 4 bronchodilator aerosols (ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg/2 mL and terbutaline 5 mg/2 mL) and methylprednisolone intravenous (120 mg). After these 4 aerosols, she was still dyspneic.

First, arterial blood gases (pH 7.38; PCO2, 3.92 kPa; HCO3, 19.2 mmol/L) and arterial lactate (lactate, 7.96 mmol/L) were performed with a second series of 4 aerosols. Second, arterial blood gases (pH 7.29; PCO2, 4.01 kPa; HCO3, 15.4 mmol/L) and arterial lactate (lactate, 10.47 mmol/L) were performed at the end of the second series of aerosols. There was no hypoxemia, no inadequate cardiac output state, no anemia, no sepsis, and no use of biguanides.

Previous studies have suggested that administration of β agonists can lead to lactic acidemia in the absence of hypoxia or shock, but it is the highest level of lactate that we found in the literature. In sepsis and shock, lactic acidosis is used as a marker of disease severity. In this case, it is not necessarily the sign of an immediate gravity.

### Small bowel obstruction: The role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The onus, therefore, rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted.

Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischemia and perforation, which will prompt surgical intervention. This review will discuss the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outline its impact on patient management.
