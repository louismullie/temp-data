## Question

13. If 2010! = M × 10ᵏ, where M is an integer not divisible by 10, find the value of k.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the exponent k such that 2010! equals M times 10 to the power of k, where M is an integer not divisible by 10. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what k represents in terms of prime factorization. Then, I should verify the formula for counting trailing zeros in a factorial. Next, I will compute the number of factors of 5 and 2 in 2010! and take the minimum. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of k. In the expression 2010! = M × 10ᵏ with M not divisible by 10, k is the number of trailing zeros in 2010!, which equals the number of times 10 divides 2010!. Since 10 = 2 × 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the limiting factor, which is the smaller of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of 2010!.

> Wait, let me verify the standard formula. The number of times a prime p divides n! is given by Legendre's formula: ∑ from i = 1 to ∞ ⌊[n/pⁱ]⌋. For trailing zeros, I need to compute the exponent of 5 and the exponent of 2 in 2010! and take the minimum, because there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials.

> I will now examine the exponent of 5 in 2010!. Using Legendre's formula, I should sum floor(2010/5) + floor(2010/25) + floor(2010/125) + floor(2010/625) + floor(2010/3125) and stop when the divisor exceeds 2010. Let me calculate: 2010/5 = 402, 2010/25 = 80.4 → 80, 2010/125 = 16.08 → 16, 2010/625 = 3.216 → 3, and 2010/3125 ≈ 0.6432 → 0. Adding these gives 402 + 80 + 16 + 3 = 501. So the exponent of 5 in 2010! is 501.

> Next, I should review the exponent of 2 in 2010! to ensure I'm not missing anything. Let me compute floor(2010/2) + floor(2010/4) + floor(2010/8) + floor(2010/16) + floor(2010/32) + floor(2010/64) + floor(2010/128) + floor(2010/256) + floor(2010/512) + floor(2010/1024). That is 1005 + 502 + 251 + 125 + 62 + 31 + 15 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 2002. So the exponent of 2 is 2002, which is indeed larger than 501, confirming that 5 is the limiting factor.

> Hold on, I should verify the final step. Since the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5, and 501 < 2002, the value of k is 501. Therefore, 2010! ends in 501 zeros, and M is the quotient when 2010! is divided by 10⁵⁰¹, which by construction is not divisible by 10.

---

The value of (k) is the number of trailing zeros in (2010!), which equals the number of times 10 divides (2010!). Since (10 = 2 × 5), and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, (k) is the exponent of 5 in the prime factorization of (2010!). Using Legendre's formula, (k = ⌊[2010/5]⌋ + ⌊[2010/25]⌋ + ⌊[2010/125]⌋ + ⌊[2010/625]⌋ = 402 + 80 + 16 + 3 = 501).

---

## Understanding the problem

We need to find the largest integer (k) such that (2010!) is divisible by (10ᵏ) but not by (10ᵏ⁺¹). This is equivalent to finding the number of trailing zeros in (2010!), which is determined by the number of times 10 divides (2010!). Since (10 = 2 × 5), and factorials contain more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5 in (2010!).

---

## Applying Legendre's formula

Legendre's formula gives the exponent of a prime (p) in (n!) as:

∑ from i = 1 to ∞ ⌊[n/pⁱ]⌋

For (p = 5) and (n = 2010), we compute:

⌊[2010/5]⌋ = 402

⌊[2010/25]⌋ = 80

⌊[2010/125]⌋ = 16

⌊[2010/625]⌋ = 3

⌊[2010/3125]⌋ = 0

Adding these gives the total exponent of 5 in (2010!):

402 + 80 + 16 + 3 = 501

---

## Conclusion

Therefore, (k = 501). This means (2010! = M × 10⁵⁰¹), where (M) is an integer not divisible by 10.

Explanation

The denominator included in each treatment group is an essential part of the analysis. In factorial trials, the denominator might differ by the main comparison, and so presenting this information for each main comparison can increase clarity. This information is often included in a flow diagram but could be presented in other ways as well.

For factorial trials predicated on the assumption of no interaction (2-in-1 trials) or those in which the interaction is of main interest, evaluation of interactions is essential to interpretation. The size of the estimated interaction effect should be presented along with a measure of precision, such as the 95% CI. For trials in which evaluation of interaction(s) is not deemed essential, this decision should be justified.

Item 3a. CONSORT 2010: Description of trial design (such as parallel, factorial) including randomization ratio

Extension for factorial trials: Description of the type of factorial trial (such as a full or partial, number of factors, and levels within each factor)

Most factorial trials use a "full" factorial design, whereby all participants are eligible to be randomized to all combinations of factors and factor levels. Other designs include "fractional" factorial designs (where some combinations of factors are omitted) and "partial" factorial designs (where some participants are only eligible to be randomized to certain factors), which require alternative methodology.

Item 4a. CONSORT 2010: Eligibility criteria for participants

Extension for factorial trials: Eligibility criteria for each factor, noting any differences, if applicable

Differences in eligibility criteria across factors can have implications for the design and analysis and can increase the risk of bias if not handled properly. For instance, participants who are not eligible for randomization to a specific factor should not be included in the comparison for that factor, because their inclusion means the analysis is no longer based on a randomized comparison, which can lead to confounding bias.

Item 7a. CONSORT 2010: How sample size was determined

Extension for factorial trials: How sample size was determined for each main comparison, including whether an interaction was assumed in the calculation

Sample size calculations for factorial designs are more complicated than in standard parallel-group designs. In some factorial trials, the planned main comparisons may require different sample sizes if they are expected to produce different effect sizes or if the choice of primary outcome varies for each factor. If an interaction is hypothesized, the sample size may need to be increased.,

Explanation

Presenting participant flow can increase clarity and understanding. However, in factorial trials it can be difficult to understand the relevant participant flow as information relating to adherence, completeness of outcome data collection, losses to follow-up, and post-randomisation exclusion might differ across main comparisons. Presenting participant flow for each main comparison can increase clarity and understanding of results.

Item 12a. CONSORT 2010: Statistical methods used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes

Extension for factorial trials: Statistical methods used for each main comparison for primary and secondary outcomes, including:

Whether the target treatment effect for each main comparison pertains to the effect in the presence or absence of other factors The statistical methods alone are not always sufficient to allow readers to understand the exact treatment effect (estimand) being estimated. – In factorial trials, the treatment groups used for comparison are not always the same as those in which there is interest in estimating the treatment effect. For example, many factorial trials use a factorial analysis to compare "all A" vs "all not A" for reasons of efficiency, even though interest really lies in the effect of A alone vs control (the effect of A in the absence of B) or, alternatively, the effect of A plus B vs B alone (the effect of A in the presence of B) if treatment B has been demonstrated to be effective. A clear description of the target treatment effect, including whether it pertains to the effect in the presence or absence of other factors, allows readers to understand the exact question being addressed.
Approach to analysis, such as factorial or multiarm Different statistical methods can be used to analyze a factorial trial depending on the estimand of interest. In a factorial (or "at-the-margins") analysis, all participants randomized to factor A (A alone and A plus B) are compared with all those not randomized to A (B alone and double-control). Alternatively, in a multiarm (or "inside-the-table") analysis, the trial is analyzed as if a multiarm design had been used. The 2 approaches offer different benefits and require different assumptions (Box 2).
How the approach was chosen, such as prespecified or based on estimated interaction Using a test of interaction to guide the choice of analysis can introduce bias and is not recommended. Clarification of whether the final analysis approach was prespecified based on prior knowledge or an assumption of no interaction or chosen based on the size of the estimated interaction helps alert readers to any risk of bias associated with the analysis approach.
Method(s) used to evaluate statistical interaction(s) It is recommended practice to evaluate the presence of statistical interactions, either because analyses rely on the assumption that treatments do not interact or because the interaction is itself of direct interest. The presence of an interaction may depend on the scale of analysis (eg, an interaction may be present on the risk difference scale, but not the risk ratio scale), so careful consideration should be given to the choice of scale. Reporting details of how interaction(s) were evaluated, and on what scale, enables readers to understand the appropriateness of method(s).
If factorial approach used, whether factors were adjusted for each other Factorial analyses can be adjusted for whether participants were randomized to the other factor(s) by including a term for this in the statistical model. This can increase statistical power and, in some cases, failure to adjust for the other factors can introduce bias for certain estimands.
If applicable, how nonconcurrent recruitment to factors was handled Nonconcurrent recruitment, in which certain participants are not randomized for some factors (eg, if the trial used a partial factorial design or recruitment to one factor is paused or terminated), can induce bias if not handled correctly during analysis (see item 4a).

### Guidance for protocol content and reporting of factorial randomised trials: explanation and elaboration of the CONSORT 2010 and SPIRIT 2013 extensions [^116Pi9Gb]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Explanation

For 2-in-1 factorial trials, a factorial (or at-the-margins) analysis is typically used, in which all participants allocated to factor A (A alone, and A+B) are compared with all those not allocated to A (B alone, and double control). This analysis takes advantage of the efficiency gains inherent in the factorial design, allowing investigators to evaluate multiple interventions in a single trial with minimal effect on the sample size. However, factorial analyses rely on the assumption that treatments do not interact and will be biased otherwise; the larger the interaction, the more extreme the bias.

An alternative approach is a multiarm (or inside-the-table) analysis, in which the trial is analysed as if a multiarm design had been used instead. In a 2×2 design, the treatment groups A alone, B alone, and A+B are each compared against double control. The multiarm analysis is unbiased even when treatments interact but is less efficient than the factorial analysis owing to the reduced sample size for each comparison, and thus will typically be underpowered.

For this reason, it is generally recommended that main comparisons for 2-in-1 trials are based on a factorial analysis (to take advantage of the efficiency gains inherent to the factorial design), but that multiarm analyses are routinely reported as a sensitivity analysis (see proposed framework for the analysis of 2-in-1 trials in box 7). If some evidence of an interaction exists, results from the multiarm sensitivity analyses can help identify how robust conclusions from the main factorial analyses are.

Box 7
Framework for statistical analysis of 2-in-1 trials (adapted from Kahan et al)

Specify the estimand of interest for each main comparison, including whether it pertains to the effect in the presence or absence of other factors.
Use a factorial (at-the-margins) analysis as for the primary analysis to make use of the gain inherent from the factorial design under the assumption of no interaction.
Report the size of the estimated interaction and its precision (eg, using a confidence interval) to assess the plausibility of the assumption of no interaction underpinning the factorial analysis.
Perform a sensitivity analysis using a multiarm analysis to evaluate to what extent departures from the underlying assumption of no interaction might influence results.

A detailed description of which analytical approach is used for the main comparisons provides clarity on the assumptions underpinning the analysis, as well as any implications for interpretation.

Item 14. SPIRIT 2013: Estimated number of participants needed to achieve study objectives and how it was determined

Extension for factorial trials: How sample size was determined for each main comparison, including whether an interaction was assumed in the calculation | The appropriate sample size calculation depends both on the specific rationale for using the factorial design as well as the methodology used to undertake the trial. For instance, trials designed to assess whether interventions interact typically require larger sample sizes than those aiming to assess the effect of each intervention; for 2-in-1 trials, the planned method of analysis (factorial vs multiarm) will affect the required sample size. Furthermore, for some factorial trials, the planned main comparisons may require different sample sizes; this can occur if they are expected to produce different effect sizes, or if the choice of primary outcome varies for each factor.

Item 16a. SPIRIT 2013: Method of generating the allocation and list of any factors for stratification

Extension for factorial trials: If applicable, whether participants will be allocated to factors at different time points | In some factorial trials, participants may be randomized to factors at different time points. For example, they may be randomized for factor A at diagnosis, then for factor B once treatment A is complete. The time point of randomization for each factor informs key design features, such as the baseline period, duration of follow-up, and likelihood of treatments interacting.

Investigators sometimes use an initial test of interaction to decide whether to use a factorial or multiarm analysis. This approach can introduce bias. As such, it is generally not recommended; however, if this approach is being used, it is important to report this so that readers can understand the statistical implications of the analysis approach.
Method(s) used to evaluate statistical interaction(s)

Evaluating whether treatments interact is typically required in factorial trials, either because analyses rely on the assumption that treatments do not interact, or because the interaction is itself of direct interest. Reporting details of how interactions will be evaluated enables readers to understand the appropriateness of methods.
Whether factors will be adjusted for each other

Factorial analyses can be adjusted for whether participants were allocated to the other factors by including a term for this in the statistical model. This can increase statistical power, and in some cases, failure to adjust for the other factors can introduce bias for some estimands.
How nonconcurrent recruitment to factors will be handled

Nonconcurrent recruitment, in which certain participants are not randomized for some factors (eg, if recruitment to 1 of the factors is paused or terminated), can induce bias if not handled correctly during analysis. Therefore, understanding whether participants not randomized for a factor were excluded from the analysis for that factor is necessary to understand the risk of bias.

Item 21b. SPIRIT 2013: Description of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines, including who will have access to these interim results and make the final decision to terminate the trial

Extension for factorial trials: When applicable, explanation of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines, noting any differences across main comparisons and reasons for differences | Interim analyses are often used for reasons of safety, efficacy, or futility. Stopping guidelines may be different for each factor. If 1 factor is stopped before the other, there may be implications for randomization, choice of comparator, or the analysis population.

### Two-by-two factorial cancer treatment trials: is sufficient attention being paid to possible interactions? [^111zzAjY]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Factorial 2×2 designs can be used to combine evaluation of two treatments in a single study. The standard analysis approach is based on a factorial analysis that evaluates each treatment by pooling data over the other treatment. This approach relies on the assumption that the effect of each treatment is not substantially affected by the other treatment. In many oncology settings, this no-interaction assumption cannot be adequately supported at the time the trial is designed. In this Commentary, we consider current practices for the design and analysis of factorial trials by performing a survey of factorial treatment trials published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Journal of Clinical Oncology, and the New England Journal of Medicine (2007–2016). The protocol-specified sample size was derived based on the factorial (pooled) analysis in 96.7% of the 30 identified trials, and the factorial analysis was specified as the primary analysis in 90.0% of these identified trials. An interaction complicating study interpretation was reported in 16.7% of the trials. We provide recommendations for matching the trial analysis and design to the study goals to account for possible interaction and illustrate the recommendations on the data from several published trials.

### Preventing home medication administration errors [^114LDCkF]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Impact of health care provider prescribing and pharmacy dispensing practices — prescribing can contribute to errors when orders are unclear and when unsafe formats are used. Health care provider prescribing practices contribute to medication errors; providers can prescribe in ways that can make medication administration by caregivers and patients easier or more complex. Missing or unclear information (eg, related to route, frequency, duration, indication) can affect the understandability of medication instructions. Providers may not follow safe prescribing practices recommended by The Joint Commission, whose standards recommend inclusion of leading zeros (eg, 0.X), avoidance of trailing zeros (eg, X.0), and avoidance of confusing abbreviations such as U (unit) and QD (daily) when prescriptions are ordered. Weight-based pediatric prescribing and milligram orders can yield complex converted volumes (eg, 4.8 mL) rather than simpler whole-number volumes (eg, 5 mL). Pediatric providers may also use multiple units of measurement and may believe caregivers are more comfortable with teaspoon or tablespoon terms.

### Possible eradication of wild poliovirus type 3 – worldwide, 2012 [^114cpVcB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Four of the six World Health Organization regions have been certified as polio-free: the Americas in 1994, the Western Pacific Region in 2000, the European Region in 2002, and the South-East Asia Region in 2014. The last detection of wild poliovirus type 2 was in 1999.

What is added by this report?

No type 3 wild poliovirus (WPV3) infections have been detected globally since November 2012, suggesting that transmission might have been interrupted. The number of countries reporting WPV3 isolates declined from seven in 2010 to zero in 2013. During 2010–2013, the number of WPV3 isolated globally in stool specimens collected from patients with acute flaccid paralysis declined from 87 to zero, whereas the number of acute flaccid paralysis cases with specimens tested increased from 98,788 in 2010 to 101,701 in 2013.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Transmission of WPV3 might be interrupted worldwide. Continued sensitive surveillance is needed before the evidence of WPV3 eradication is conclusive, particularly given evidence of limitations of surveillance in Pakistan, Nigeria, and elsewhere.

### Metric units and the preferred dosing of orally administered liquid medications [^114vXkTa]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Metric units and the preferred dosing of orally administered liquid medications — recommendations emphasize metric-only prescribing, labeling, devices, and counseling to reduce dosing errors. Trailing zeros after decimals "should not be included when dosing in whole number units to avoid 10-fold dosing errors". The concentration "(eg, in milligrams per milliliter [mg/mL]) should be clearly noted on prescriptions", and "the frequency of administration… should be clearly noted", with "use of 'daily'… preferred over 'qd', which could be misinterpreted as 'qid'". "Pediatricians should review milliliter-based doses with patients and families… to ensure adequate health literacy for metric dosing units". "E-health record vendors should use metric units… and eliminate the ability… to prescribe medications using non–milliliter–based dosing regimens". "Pharmacies, hospitals, and health centers should dispense… with metric dosing on the label" and "should distribute appropriate-volume milliliter-based dosing devices with all orally administered liquid medications". "Syringes… are the preferred dosing device… " with "cups and spoons… in milliliters" as acceptable alternatives; "dosing devices should not bear extraneous or unnecessary liquid measure markings" and "should not be significantly larger than the dose… to avoid twofold dosing errors". "Advanced counseling strategies… may further reduce dosing errors when combined with provision of a dosing device". Additionally, "manufacturers should eliminate labeling, instructions, and dosing devices that contain units other than metric units", and "researchers should study the effect of caregiver health literacy on dosing precision" to prevent unintended dosing errors among vulnerable groups.

### Smoking in top-grossing movies – United States, 2010 [^1112sq7g]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

The National Cancer Institute has concluded that studies indicate a causal relationship between exposure to depictions of smoking in movies and youth smoking initiation. Adolescents in the top quartile of exposures to onscreen tobacco incidents have been found to be approximately twice as likely to begin smoking as those in the bottom quartile. The 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services strategic plan to reduce tobacco use includes reducing youth exposure to onscreen smoking. To monitor tobacco use in movies, Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! (TUTD), a project of Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails, counts occurrences of tobacco incidents in U.S. top-grossing movies each year. This report updates a previous report with the latest TUTD findings. In 2010, the number of onscreen tobacco incidents in youth-rated (G, PG, or PG-13) movies continued a downward trend, decreasing 71.6% from 2,093 incidents in 2005 to 595 in 2010. Similarly, the average number of incidents per youth-rated movie decreased 66.2%, from 20.1 in 2005 to 6.8 in 2010. The degree of decline, however, varied substantially by motion picture company. The three companies with published policies designed to reduce tobacco use in their movies had an average decrease in tobacco incidents of 95.8%, compared with an average decrease of 41.7% among the three major motion picture companies and independents without policies. This finding indicates that an enforceable policy aimed at reducing tobacco use in youth-rated movies can lead to substantially fewer tobacco incidents in movies and help prevent adolescent initiation of smoking.

### Alternative clinical trial designs [^117CVRev]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Factorial designs

In the standard RCT, one intervention is assessed while maintaining similar processes of care in the control group. Randomization at the subject level balances known and unknown confounders resulting in two comparison groups for whom the only difference is the intervention. Sometimes, however, investigators want to study more than one intervention. In the setting of multiple interventions, one could perform multiple concurrent trials, perform multiple trials in succession using the winner of the previous trial compared with the next intervention, perform a parallel ≥ 2 group trial, or perform a trial using a factorial design. Assuming the multiple interventions work independently, the factorial trial is the most efficient manner to study more than one intervention within a single trial.

For example, if two interventions were being assessed for a binary outcome (present or absent), there would be four treatment groups in the trial being tested — group 1 receives neither intervention, group 2 receives both interventions, group 3 receives intervention A but not intervention B, and group 4 receives intervention B but not intervention A. In this example, the effect of intervention A is determined by comparing all patients who received intervention A (groups 2 and 3) to all those who did not (groups 1 and 4). Similarly, the effect of intervention B is determined by comparing all patients who received intervention B (groups 2 and 4) to all patients who did not (groups 1 and 3). This so-called 'at the margins' analysis assumes the independent effect of the interventions and allows for the factorial design to provide a similarly powered study with fewer patients than two separate clinical trials of the two interventions. This simple version of a factorial design is also sometimes referred to as a 'dismantling design' due to its ability to deconstruct elements of a multifactor intervention.

### Design of the trial to assess chelation therapy (TACT) [^112yA7qV]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

TACT is an National Institutes of Health-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial testing the benefits and risks of 40 infusions of a multicomponent disodium EDTA chelation solution compared with placebo and of an oral, high-dose multivitamin and mineral supplement. TACT has randomized and will follow up 1,708 patients for an average of approximately 4 years. The primary end point is a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospitalization for angina. A 900-patient substudy will examine quality-of-life outcomes. The trial is designed to have > 85% power to detect a 25% relative reduction in the primary end point for each treatment factor. Enrollment began in September 2003 and was completed in October 2010.

### Tobacco use in top-grossing movies-United States, 2010–2016 [^113HbkwX]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The Surgeon General has concluded that there is a causal relationship between depictions of smoking in the movies and the initiation of smoking among young persons (1). The more youths see smoking on screen, the more likely they are to start smoking; youths who are heavily exposed to onscreen smoking imagery are approximately two to three times as likely to begin smoking as are youths who receive less exposure (1,2). A Healthy People 2020 objective is to reduce the proportion of youths exposed to onscreen tobacco marketing in movies and television (Tobacco Use Objective 18.3) (3). To assess the recent extent of tobacco use imagery in youth-rated movies (G, PG, PG-13*), 2010–2016 data from Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! (TUTD), a project of Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails were analyzed and compared with previous reports. † In 2016, 41% of movies that were among the 10 top-grossing movies in any calendar week included tobacco use, compared with 45% in 2010. Among youth-rated movies, 26% included tobacco use in 2016 (including 35% of PG-13 movies) compared with 31% in 2010 (including 43% of PG-13 movies). The steady decline in the number of tobacco incidents in youth-rated movies from 2005–2010 stopped after 2010. The total number of individual occurrences of tobacco use in a movie (tobacco incidents) in top-grossing movies increased 72%, from 1,824 in 2010 to 3,145 in 2016, with an increase of 43% (from 564 to 809) occurring among PG-13 rated movies. Reducing tobacco use in youth-related movies could help prevent the initiation of tobacco use among young persons.

### Musculoskeletal injuries during trail sports: sex-and age-specific analyses over 20 years from a national injury database [^114FTTRj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries in US trail sports are understudied as trail sport popularity grows. This study describes MSK injury patterns among hikers, trail runners, and mountain bikers from 2002 through 2021 and investigates MSK injury trends acquired during mountain sports.

Methods

The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) was used to identify US emergency department (ED) patients from 2002–2021 (inclusive) who endured MSK injuries during hiking, trail running, or mountain biking. Injury rates and national estimates were calculated across demographics.

Results

9835 injuries were included (48.4% male, 51.6% female). Injuries increased over time, with 1213 from 2002–2005 versus 2417 from 2018–2021. No sex differences existed before 2010, after which female injury rates exceeded those of males. The following findings were statistically significant, with P < 0.05: females endured more fractures and strains/sprains; males endured more lacerations; concussions and head injuries were higher among those < 18y; dislocations and strains/sprains were higher for 18 to 65y; fractures were higher for > 65y; < 18y had high mountain-biking and low running rates; 18 to 65y had high running rates; and > 65y had low biking and running rates. Although all diagnoses increased in number over time, no significant differences existed in the proportion of any given diagnosis relative to total injuries.

Conclusions

MSK injuries during trail sports have increased since 2002. Males endured more injuries until 2009, after which females endured more. Significant sex and age differences were found regarding injury diagnosis and body parts. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and their causes.

### Routine vaccination coverage-worldwide, 2019 [^112ai4CM]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2020, the Immunization Agenda 2030 strives to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases across the life course. This report, which updates previous reports, presents global, regional, * and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends as of 2019 and describes the number of surviving infants who did not receive the first dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP1) during the first year of life (i.e. zero-dose children), which serves as a proxy for children with poor access to immunization and other health services. Global estimates of coverage with the third dose of DTP (DTP3), the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), and the third dose of polio vaccine (Pol3) ranged from 84% to 86% during 2010–2019. Worldwide, 19.7 million children (15%) were not vaccinated with DTP3 in 2019, 13.8 million (70%) of whom were zero-dose children. During 2010–2019, the number of zero-dose children increased in the African, Americas, and Western Pacific regions. Global coverage with the second MCV dose (MCV2) increased from 42% in 2010 to 71% in 2019. During 2010–2019, global coverage with underused vaccines increased for the completed series of rotavirus vaccine (rota), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), rubella-containing vaccine (RCV), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV). Achieving universal coverage with all recommended vaccines will require tailored, context-specific strategies to reach communities with substantial proportions of zero-dose and incompletely vaccinated children, particularly those in remote rural, urban poor, and conflict-affected communities.

### Adult blood lead epidemiology and surveillance – United States, 2002 [^1144whyj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

CDC's state-based Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) program tracks laboratory-reported blood lead levels (BLLs) in adults. A national health objective for 2010 is to reduce to zero the number of adults with BLLs ≥ 25 microg/dL (objective no. 20–07). A second key ABLES measurement is BLLs ≥ 40 microg/dL, the level under which the Occupational Safety and Health Administration allows workers to return to work after being removed with an elevated BLL, and the level under which an annual medical evaluation of health effects related to lead exposure is required. The most recent ABLES report provided data collected during 1994–2001. This report presents ABLES data for 2002, the first year that individual rather than summary data were collected. The 2002 data indicate that approximately 95% of adult lead exposures were occupational, 94% of those exposed were male, and 91% were aged 25–64 years. The findings also indicated that the national decline in the number of adults with elevated BLLs continued in 2002; however, even greater prevention activities, particularly in work environments, will be necessary to achieve the 2010 health objective.

### A multidimensional approach to frailty compared with physical phenotype in older Brazilian adults: data from the FIBRA-BR study [^111g6uKb]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

n number, GDS-15 geriatric depression scale with 15 items, FES-I falls efficacy scale-international

The results of the factorial analysis revealed a three-factor solution comprised of 12 variables. The final model was highly suitable based on KMO and Bartlett's sphericity test statistics (Table 5). The number of latent variables that remained in the study after the factorial analysis explained 38.6% of the variability of the model data. The vision impairment and hearing impairment variables were dropped from the physical dimension because the factorial loadings were lower than 0.40. The factorial analysis results were similar to the proposed multidimensional frailty model, except regarding self-rated health (physical dimension) and living alone (social dimension) (Fig. 1). The self-rated health variable was transferred after factorial analysis to the psychological dimension and the living alone variable to the physical dimension.

Comparisons between multidimenstional frailty model and physical phenotype

The comparisons of the mean scores of three dimensions of the multidimensional frailty model (obtained after factorial analysis) among the physical phenotype categories (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) are shown in Table 6. The ANOVA results showed a statistically significant difference in mean scores for physical, social, and psychological dimensions among three physical phenotype categories (p < 0.001). For all dimensions, the mean score increased as the frailty level in the physical phenotype increased. The Tukey post hoc test revealed that there was a significant difference in mean scores for the physical dimension between non-frail and pre-frail (p = 0.008) and between non-frail and frail (p = 0.002), but not between pre-frail and frail (p = 0.201). Moreover, there was a significant difference in mean scores for social and psychological dimensions between non-frail and pre-frail, non-frail and frail, and pre-frail and frail (p ≤ 0.001).

### Factorial design considerations [^112LmsFB]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Factorial designs may be proposed to test extra questions within a clinical trial. A common approach to sample size and analysis for factorial trials assumes no statistical interactions and does not adjust for multiple testing. This investigation considered the trade-off between potential gains from testing more questions with fewer patients versus how often a factorial trial might arrive at an incorrect conclusion.

Methods

A simulation study of a 2 × 2 design (observation v chemotherapy v radiation therapy v the combination) was performed under various conditions, including effect of one, both, or neither treatment and absence or presence of statistical interaction (effect of one treatment differed according to the presence of the other). Three analysis approaches were investigated, one assuming no interaction, a second testing first for interaction, and the third testing for interaction as well as adjusting for multiple testing. The approaches were compared with respect to the probability of selecting the correct treatment arm.

Results

No one approach was superior. Testing for interaction was beneficial in some settings but detrimental in others. Under some scenarios, the factorial design improved efficiency, but under others, all three approaches resulted in poor probability of selecting the correct treatment arm at the end of the trial.

Conclusion

Extra efficiency is possible, but it is difficult to predict when favorable conditions exist. If a factorial design is used, potential efficiency gains should be weighed against potential loss of power to arrive at the correct conclusion under possible scenarios of interest.

### Factorial experiments: efficient tools for evaluation of intervention components [^111Dc5ru]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An understanding of the individual and combined effects of a set of intervention components is important for moving the science of preventive medicine interventions forward. This understanding can often be achieved in an efficient and economical way via a factorial experiment, in which two or more independent variables are manipulated. The factorial experiment is a complement to the RCT; the two designs address different research questions.

Purpose

To offer an introduction to factorial experiments aimed at investigators trained primarily in the RCT.

Methods

The factorial experiment is compared and contrasted with other experimental designs used commonly in intervention science to highlight where each is most efficient and appropriate.

Results

Several points are made: factorial experiments make very efficient use of experimental subjects when the data are properly analyzed; a factorial experiment can have excellent statistical power even if it has relatively few subjects per experimental condition; and when conducting research to select components for inclusion in a multicomponent intervention, interactions should be studied rather than avoided.

Conclusions

Investigators in preventive medicine and related areas should begin considering factorial experiments alongside other approaches. Experimental designs should be chosen from a resource management perspective, which states that the best experimental design is the one that provides the greatest scientific benefit without exceeding available resources.

### Orthopaedic and brain injuries over last 10 seasons in the national football league (NFL): number and effect on missed playing time [^111Pgrj1]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Figure 2
Number of most serious back (spine/back/skeleton) injuries and resultant games missed (years 2010–2019). (A) shows a bar graph of the total number of players who missed at least one game because of injury to the back (ordinate) as a function of NFL season (abscissa). There are no asterisks, as there have not been any rule changes adopted in the last decade to specifically protect players from back injuries. (B) shows a bar graph of the number of weeks of game time that the injured player missed on average (ordinate) as a function of NFL season (abscissa; 2010–2019). NFL, National Football League.

In contrast, the number of players missing at least one game of the regular season owing to injury to the arm showed a small but significantly increasing trend across the last 10 NFL seasons: the slope (m = 2.279 ± 0.868) of the linear fit to the data in figure 3A was significantly greater than zero (t (8) = 2.626, p = 0.030, two-tailed). The slope (m = 0.129 ± 0.076) of the average number of weeks of game time missed over seasons 2010–2019 was not significantly different from zero, however (t (8) = 1.699, p = 0.128).

### Analysis and reporting of factorial trials: a systematic review [^115Jx1jH]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although factorial trials have become common, standards for the analysis and reporting of such trials have not been established and, despite concerns about the possibility of unrecognized interactions between therapies in factorial trials, the magnitude of this potential problem is unknown.

Objective

To examine the rationale, methods, and analysis of randomized factorial trials.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms factorial, interaction, 2 × 2, 2 by 2, and incremental to identify factorial randomized trials published from January 2000 to July 2002. To identify trials missed by the electronic search, we performed a hand search of English-language trials in a defined topic area (using the term myocardial ischemia [exp]) listed in MEDLINE (1966–2002), EMBASE (1980–2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, as well as all trials in any topic area published in December 2000, excluding trials reporting only continuous surrogate end points. The final set of 33 eligible publications described 29 unique trials.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently identified factorial trials, generated a list of items affecting validity of results, and abstracted these items from each trial.

Data Synthesis

The sensitivity of electronic searching for identifying factorial trials was 76%. Our 3-pronged search strategy identified 44 factorial trials with clinically important binary outcomes: 36 (82%) were done for reasons of efficiency (testing 2 interventions in the same patient population), and 8 (18%) were done to assess the incremental benefits of combining the 2 treatments. All but 1 of the trials reported treatment effects by comparing all patients who received treatment A (ie, those receiving either A alone or both A and B) vs all those not receiving treatment A (ie, those receiving either B alone or neither A nor B). Twenty-nine of the 44 trials (66%) reported the data from each of the treatment groups separately; 26 trials (59%) reported testing for interactions between the treatments. Only 2 of 31 (6%) comparisons demonstrated a statistically significant interaction between the 2 treatments.

Conclusions

Accurate interpretation of factorial trials depends on the transparent reporting of data for each treatment cell. Despite concerns about unrecognized interactions, our findings suggest that investigators are appropriately restricting their use of the factorial design to those situations in which 2 (or more) treatments do not have the potential for substantive interaction.

### Orthopaedic and brain injuries over last 10 seasons in the national football league (NFL): number and effect on missed playing time [^113enGH5]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Results

Figure 1A, B, respectively, shows the number of players whose leg injuries were severe enough that the injured player had to miss at least one regular season game, and the mean number of games the injured players missed for each of the last 10 NFL seasons (2010–2019). There was no noticeable trend — increase or decrease — in the number of players missing at least one game of the regular season owing to injury to the leg — the slope (m = 2.879 ± 4.852) of the linear fit did not significantly differ from zero (t (8) = 0.593, p = 0.569). In terms of the number of games the injured player missed, the slope (m = 0.091 ± 0.066) of the linear fit was not significant as well (t (8) = 1.366, p = 0.209).

Figure 1
Number of most serious leg (ankle/knee) injuries and resultant games missed (years 2010–2019). (A) shows a bar graph of the total number of players who missed at least one game because of a leg injury (ordinate) as a function of NFL season (abscissa; 2010–2019). Asterisks indicate rule changes adopted before the corresponding season to specifically protect players from leg injuries. (B) shows a bar graph of the number of weeks of game time that the injured player missed on average (ordinate) as a function of NFL season (abscissa; 2010–2019). NFL, National Football League.

The number of players who missed game time owing to injuries to the back (spine) did not vary much (slope — m = 0.109 ± 0.420) over the last decade, as confirmed by the lack of statistical significance of the trend (t (8) = 0.260, p = 0.802; figure 2A). The linear trend in game time missed (figure 2B; m = −0.034 ± 0.086) because of injury to the back was not significant either (t (8) = –0.399, p = 0.700).

### State smoke-free laws for worksites, restaurants, and bars – United States, 2000–2010 [^111CPopx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure causes lung cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in nonsmoking adults and children, resulting in an estimated 46,000 heart disease deaths and 3,400 lung cancer deaths among U.S. nonsmoking adults each year. Smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in all indoor areas of a venue fully protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to SHS indoors. A Healthy People 2010 objective (27–13) called for enacting laws eliminating smoking in public places and worksites in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC); because this objective was not met by 2010, it was retained for Healthy People 2020 (renumbered as TU-13). To assess progress toward meeting this objective, CDC reviewed state laws restricting smoking in effect as of December 31, 2010. This report summarizes the changes in state smoking restrictions for private-sector worksites, restaurants, and bars that occurred from December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2010. The number of states (including DC) with laws that prohibit smoking in indoor areas of worksites, restaurants, and bars increased from zero in 2000 to 26 in 2010. However, regional disparities remain in policy adoption, with no southern state having adopted a smoke-free law that prohibits smoking in all three venues. The Healthy People 2020 target on this topic is achievable if current activity in smoke-free policy adoption is sustained nationally and intensified in certain regions, particularly the South.

### Child immunization status according to number of siblings and birth order in 85 low-and middle-income countries: a cross-sectional study [^112DM5WN]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Identification of unvaccinated children is important for preventing deaths due to infections. Number of siblings and birth order have been postulated as risk factors for zero-dose prevalence.

Methods

We analysed nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from 85 low and middle-income countries (2010–2020) with information on immunisation status of children aged 12–35 months. Zero-dose prevalence was defined as the failure to receive any doses of DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus) vaccine. We examined associations with birth order and the number of siblings, adjusting for child's sex, maternal age and education, household wealth quintiles and place of residence. Poisson regression was used to calculate zero-dose prevalence ratios.

Findings

We studied 375,548 children, of whom 13.7% (n = 51,450) were classified as zero-dose. Prevalence increased monotonically with birth order and with the number of siblings, with prevalence increasing from 11.0% for firstborn children to 17.1% for birth order 5 or higher, and from 10.5% for children with no siblings to 17.2% for those with four or more siblings. Adjustment for confounders attenuated but did not eliminate these associations. The number of siblings remained as a strong risk factor when adjusted for confounders and birth order, but the reverse was not observed. Among children with the same number of siblings, there was no clear pattern in zero-dose prevalence by birth order; for instance, among children with two siblings, the prevalence was 13.0%, 14.7%, and 13.3% for firstborn, second, and third-born, respectively. Similar results were observed for girls and boys. 9513 families had two children aged 12–35 months. When the younger sibling was unvaccinated, 61.9% of the older siblings were also unvaccinated. On the other hand, when the younger sibling was vaccinated, only 5.9% of the older siblings were unvaccinated.

Interpretation

The number of siblings is a better predictor than birth order in identifying children to be targeted by immunization campaigns. Zero-dose children tend to be clustered within families.

### Tobacco use in top-grossing movies-United States, 2010–2018 [^11633nb9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

From 2010 to 2018, changes in the number of tobacco incidents in youth-rated movies varied by movie company. During this period, tobacco incidents dropped from 10 to zero in movies from Disney and from 115 to zero in Viacom movies and declined from 198 to 86 in Sony movies. Tobacco incidents increased approximately 2,900% in Comcast movies (from 19 to 573), 600% in Time Warner movies (from four to 29), 200% in Fox movies (from 96 to 327), and 60% in movies from independent companies (from 152 to 243).

Among the 1,239 top-grossing movies during 2010–2018, 1,110 (90%) were fictional, 114 (9%) were biographical dramas, and 15 (1%) were documentaries. During the same period, 83% of all movies with tobacco incidents were fictional, 16% were biographical dramas, and 1% were documentaries. The number of fictional PG-13 movies with tobacco incidents declined 40%, from 20 in 2010 to a low of 12 in 2018 (Figure). However, PG-13 biographical dramas with tobacco incidents increased 233% during this period, from three in 2010 (13% of PG-13 movies) to 10 in 2018 (43%). In 2018, among 1,241 tobacco incidents in PG-13 movies, biographical dramas accounted for 1,019 (82%).

### Extremes in otolaryngology resident surgical case numbers [^111xMnw3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Understand (1) significance between minimum, mean, and maximum case numbers for otolaryngology resident surgical procedures; (2) weaknesses of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) resident case log system contributing to inaccurate data/case inflation; and (3) when excessive case load may transform education into service.

Study Design

Cross-sectional survey using a national database.

Setting

Academic otolaryngology residency programs.

Subjects/Methods

Review of otolaryngology resident national data reports from ACGME resident case log system performed from 2004 to 2010. Minimum, mean, standard deviation, and maximum values for total number of resident surgeon cases and for specific surgical procedures were compared. Case unbundling, resident data entry habits, and tracked vs untracked Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were reviewed.

Results

Mean total number of resident surgeon cases remained constant (1699.5 ± 424.2 to 1772.2 ± 517). Minimum total number of cases ranged from 730 to 811 (approaching 2 standard deviations below the mean). Zero was reported as the minimum case number for some procedures. Maximum for total number of cases increased (3559 to 4857) and surpassed the mean by 4 to 5 standard deviations. Some procedures have maximums greater than 11 standard deviations above the mean. The authors identified untracked CPT codes and variations in resident case log documentation habits.

Conclusions

Large differences between the minimum, mean, and maximum resident surgeon case numbers exist. Establishing minimum case number requirements for otolaryngology residents should be considered. Educational benefit derived from excessive case load is unclear. Critical examination of the ACGME resident case log system and resident documentation habits is needed to improve accuracy of reporting.

### Workplace mistreatment and sickness absenteeism from work: results from the 2010 national health interview survey [^117QaWTh]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examined the association between workplace mistreatment and occurrence, duration, and costs of sickness absenteeism.

Methods

We used the 2010 National Health Interview Survey and considered 13,807 employed adult respondents. We used a zero-inflated negative binomial (zinb) model to examine the association between exposure to workplace mistreatment and the occurrence and number of workdays missed due to illness/injury in the preceding 12 months.

Results

In 2010, 7.6% of US workers employed at the time of the survey reported having been mistreated at their workplace. Both occurrence and duration of sickness absence were higher for mistreated than for non-mistreated workers. The zinb results showed that being mistreated was associated with a 42% increase in the number of missed workdays, controlling for covariates. The marginal effect analysis showed that lost workdays differed by 2.45 days between mistreated and non-mistreated workers. This implies that workplace mistreatment was associated with $4.1 billion, or 5.5%, of sickness absenteeism costs in 2010.

Conclusions

Workplace mistreatment is associated with sickness absence in the United States. While a causal relationship could not be established due to the cross-sectional design of the study, this study reveals the economic importance of developing workplace mistreatment prevention strategies.

### Advances in clinical trials methodology: intervention optimization approaches in emergency medicine [^113b3PRL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The classical two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is designed to test the efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention, which may consist of one or more components. However, this approach does not enable the investigator to obtain information that is important in intervention development, such as which individual components of the intervention are efficacious, which are not and possibly should be removed, and whether any components interact. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) is a new framework for development, optimization, and evaluation of interventions. MOST includes the RCT for purposes of evaluation, but inserts a phase of research before the RCT aimed at intervention optimization. The optimization phase requires one or more separate trials similar in scope to an RCT, but employing a different experimental design. The design of the optimization trial is selected strategically so as to maximize the amount of scientific information gained using the available resources. One consideration in selecting this experimental design is the type of intervention to be optimized. If a fixed intervention, i.e. one in which the same intervention content and intensity is provided to all participants, is to be optimized, a factorial experiment is often appropriate. If an adaptive intervention, i.e. one in which intervention content or intensity is varied in a principled manner, is to be optimized, a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) is often a good choice. The objective of this article is to describe MOST and the scientific rationale for its use; describe two current applications of MOST in emergency medicine research, one using a factorial experiment and the other using a SMART; and discuss funding strategies and potential future applications in studying the care of individuals with acute illness, injury, or behavioral disorders.

### Can a multi-factorial assessment and interventional programme decrease inpatient falls in an elderly care ward? [^111bgFaL]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Each year approximately 282,000 inpatient falls are reported to the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA). A significant number result in death, or moderate to severe injury. (1) Research shows that falls may be reduced by 18 to 31% through multi-factorial assessments and interventions. (4) If a fall cannot be prevented, the patient should receive a prompt and effective response to achieve the best possible recovery and avoidance of further falls. Using 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' learning cycles, our aims were to decrease the inpatient falls rate in an Elderly Care ward by 20% and to improve post-fall care. A baseline audit reviewed incident report forms to establish the number of falls per 1000 patient bed days for one calendar year; the baseline falls rate was 14.70 falls per 1000 bed days between November 2010 and October 2011. A care plan to highlight at-risk patients and allow adaptation of care, a 'walking-stick' incentive poster to encourage nursing staff, and post-fall guidelines, were introduced. Feedback sessions with ward staff and a re-audit were organised subsequent to each intervention. Completion of the care plan was monitored to improve compliance. A re-audit at one year was conducted to assess impact. Feedback was positive regarding the interventions. Monthly monitoring of care plans achieved a compliance rate of 89% and highlighted up to 81% of patients were considered high-risk. The inpatient falls rate, re-audited at one year, was 12.44 falls / 1000 patient bed days, November 2011 to October 2012; a 15.4% reduction. This study demonstrates a 15.4% reduction in falls through use of a multi-factorial assessment and care plan and an incentive poster. As we are yet to obtain our initial goal of 20%, implementation and re-audit is ongoing.

### Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and ischemic stroke: focused update of 2010 clinical practice advisory from the American academy of emergency medicine [^112wWS45]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion — benefit–risk profile and timing of intravenous rtPA in AIS indicate persistent uncertainty, variable hemorrhage risk, and mixed IST-3 outcomes. The benefits of the use of rtPA in AIS has been neither proven nor disproven for all nominally eligible patients, and more than half of those treated have no change in long-term outcome when compared to their initial prognosis. The reported sICH rate is approximately 1.8% to 7.4%, and rtPA treatment in AIS is associated with increased sICH within the first 7 to 10 days; increasing time to treatment may reduce benefit more than it increases the hazard of thrombolysis. EPs should understand the shortcomings of the existing data and have a discussion with patients about the potential benefits and harms associated with rtPA. Overall, IST-3 was a neutral trial with no statistically significant difference in the dichotomous primary outcome (proportion of patients dead or dependent), while on secondary outcome, ordinal regression showed a favorable shift in disability at 6 and 18 months. Regarding treatment windows, IST-3 posed an extended AIS treatment window with IV rtPA out to 6 hours, but treatment benefit beyond 4.5 hours did not reach statistical difference.

The number of mixtures K is selected based on choosing a parsimonious model having lower deviance information criteria. The resulting shape of the curve µ(t) can be multimodal or unimodal. For a multimodal curve, the proposed modeling identifies multiple surges (i.e. Sun Belt States, California, Florida, Texas). For unimodal curves, the proposed modeling can accommodate skewed long-tailed distributions, where the curve comprises multiple sub-curves, but is dominated by one major surge or multiple surges occurring closely spaced in time (e.g. New York, New Jersey, Michigan).

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^112pSeFT]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Treatment for inhalant dependence and abuse [^117FwwSj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inhalants are being abused by large numbers of people throughout the world, particularly socio-economically disadvantaged children and adolescents. The neuropsychological effects of acute and chronic inhalant abuse include motor impairment, alterations in spontaneous motor activity, anticonvulsant effects, anxiolytic effects, sensory effects, and effects and learning, memory and operant behaviour (e.g., response rates and discriminative stimulus effects).

Objectives

To search and determine risks, benefits and costs of a variety treatments for inhalant dependence or abuse.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966 - February 2010), EMBASE (Januray 2010) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (February 2010). We also searched for ongoing clinical trials and unpublished studies via Internet searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials and controlled clinical trails (CCTs) comparing any intervention in people with inhalant dependence or abuse.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

No studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria have been retrieved.

Implications For Practice

due to the lack of studies meeting the inclusion criteria, no conclusion can be drawn for clinical practice.

Implications For Research

as a common substance abuse with serious health consequences, treatment of inhalant dependence and abuse should be a priority area of substance abuse research.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116qAq7j]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex as biological variable (SABV) checklist for preclinical studies — investigators are prompted to ask whether available literature was reviewed for the influence of biological sex, including whether SABV modulates incidence, pathophysiology, severity, outcome, and/or response to therapy and whether there is a clear articulation of different incidence or prevalence based on sex or gender; whether the influence of sex was considered while formulating the research question, including if disease prevalence skewed by sex was taken into consideration and noting that absence of data does not justify studying only one sex; whether the influence of sex was considered in the study design by addressing effects of sex hormones, sex chromosomes, hormonal cycles, and reproductive stages, including both male and female animals and/or cells with strain- and age-matching and identical conditions and reporting donor sex and age; whether potential biological confounders were addressed and whether SABV-informed powering and factorial design were used; whether research findings were appropriately generalized, with the directive that no sex-based effect should also be reported and that researchers should report when sex differences are not detected or are statistically inconclusive, emphasizing that reporting null results is crucial for meta-analysis; and whether data were analyzed and reported disaggregated by sex, using the terms "sex" and "gender" correctly and providing sex-disaggregated data whether effects are significant or not.

### A factorial trial of six interventions for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1175dAuv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Untreated, one third of patients who undergo surgery will have postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although many trials have been conducted, the relative benefits of prophylactic antiemetic interventions given alone or in combination remain unknown.

Methods

We enrolled 5199 patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting in a randomized, controlled trial of factorial design that was powered to evaluate interactions among as many as three antiemetic interventions. Of these patients, 4123 were randomly assigned to 1 of 64 possible combinations of six prophylactic interventions: 4 mg of ondansetron or no ondansetron; 4 mg of dexamethasone or no dexamethasone; 1.25 mg of droperidol or no droperidol; propofol or a volatile anesthetic; nitrogen or nitrous oxide; and remifentanil or fentanyl. The remaining patients were randomly assigned with respect to the first four interventions. The primary outcome was nausea and vomiting within 24 hours after surgery, which was evaluated blindly.

Results

Ondansetron, dexamethasone, and droperidol each reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by about 26 percent. Propofol reduced the risk by 19 percent, and nitrogen by 12 percent; the risk reduction with both of these agents (i.e., total intravenous anesthesia) was thus similar to that observed with each of the antiemetics. All the interventions acted independently of one another and independently of the patients' baseline risk. Consequently, the relative risks associated with the combined interventions could be estimated by multiplying the relative risks associated with each intervention. Absolute risk reduction, though, was a critical function of patients' baseline risk.

Conclusions

Because antiemetic interventions are similarly effective and act independently, the safest or least expensive should be used first. Prophylaxis is rarely warranted in low-risk patients, moderate-risk patients may benefit from a single intervention, and multiple interventions should be reserved for high-risk patients.

Regression analysis of phase shift

Figure 3 presents a clear phase shift in the seasonal cycle as a function of length-scale. In order to quantify the phase shift, we need to first extract a meaningful set of (k ℓ, time) points. To that end, we extract, for each k ℓ, the (i) times corresponding to the lowest 10% (dark blue in Fig. 3), (ii) two middle-most 10% for the two zero-crossings (white in Fig. 3), and (iii) highest 10% (dark red in Fig. 3) of the normalized deviations presented in Fig. 3. This is essentially extracting the (k ℓ, time)-coordinates for the line of darkest red, darkest blue, and the two white lines, resulting in a total of four regression sets. Periodic phase adjustment to the days of the year is applied to maintain monotonicity in time, and the k ℓ grid is truncated to focus on regimes with a clear linear trend. The extracted data points are shown as the dots/vertical bars in Fig. S3 in the SM, along with their corresponding regression fits.

Figure 7 presents the linear regression slope analysis for the data shown in Fig. S3. The different regression analyses generally agree well, with 12 of the 16 regression sets indicating a 35–45 day time-lag per octave of spatial scales. From this analysis, we conclude that length-scales that differ by a factor of two (i.e. ℓ₁/ℓ₂ = 2) have seasonal cycles that are off-set by 41 ± 3 days. Scales that differ a decade (ℓ₁/ℓ₂ = 10) would correspondingly have a phase shift of 136 ± 10days, or roughly 4.5 months.

Regression analysis summary.

Regression slope estimates and confidence intervals for each of the datasets shown in Fig. S3. Vertical dashed lines separate the data sources, with the text along the top indicating the source data and hemisphere. Diamonds indicate the regression slope estimate, dark envelopes the 75% confidence interval, and light envelopes the 95% confidence interval. The r -value for each regression fit is printed alongside the corresponding slope distribution. The left-most illustration, separated by a thick black line, presents the mean (diamond) and confident intervals (envelopes) across the 16 regression analyses. In the legend, 'min' means the lowest 10% z-score, 'mid' the two middle-most 10% groups, and 'max' the highest 10%.

### Deliberately ignoring inequality to avoid rejecting unfair offers [^113GbBKR]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The first hypothesis test was based on a bivariate linear regression. We preferred a linear probability model over logit or probit for consistency with the model for the second hypothesis test focusing on an interaction effect. To calculate the required sample size, we used the pwr.t.test function in R (version 4.3.1) for a two-sided, two-sample t-test. The required sample size consisted of n₁ = 283 participants. The second power analysis focused on the identification of an interaction effect in a linear probability model. We calculated the required sample size with a specialized R program for examining interaction effects in factorial designs under variance heterogeneity. This yielded a required sample size of n₂ = 1200. The third hypothesis was tested by a bivariate linear regression on half of the sample (i.e. for participants where x = 1), since ignorance could only occur in uncertainty treatments. In the same way as for the first power analysis, we used the pwr.t.test function for a two-sided, two-sample t-test. A sample of n₃ = 80 was required. The sampling plan was most conservatively based on N = 1,230 (i.e. 300 subjects per treatment plus 30 subjects with endowments of 20¢ and 60¢ to avoid deception) to ensure that there is power of 1 − β = 0.9 even for the second hypothesis.

2.3 Neurocognitive tests

The neuropsychological test battery consisted of several tests, chosen according to the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (Nuechterlein et al. 2008). The focus in our examination was on three cognitive domains, recently shown to explain about 86% of the variance for the composed cognitive score in stable patients with schizophrenia (Georgiades et al. 2017): Speed of processing (Trail Making Test, Part A, the coding task from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale [WAIS‐IV]), working memory (Letter‐Number Span test and Corsi block‐tapping task) and visual learning (Rey Visual Design Learning Test).

2.3.1 Trail‐making test

The Trail‐Making Test (TMT) is a popular test because of its high sensitivity to the presence of cognitive impairment (Kortte, Horner, & Windham, 2002). The test is divided into two parts. In Part A, the participant is required to draw a line connecting 25 numbers consecutively as quickly as possible. In Part B, the participant must draw a line alternating between numbers and letters in consecutive order. Performance is assessed by the time taken to complete each trial correctly. The TMT reflects a combination of several cognitive functions, measuring complex visual scanning with a motor component, motor speed, and agility. Part B is particularly sensitive to cognitive flexibility and executive function. The difference score TMT(B)–TMT(A) and the ratio score TMT(B)/TMT(A) are reported to be more indicative for executive control abilities (Sanchez‐Cubillo et al. 2009) and an index of cognitive flexibility, relatively independent of manual dexterity (Vazzana et al. 2010).

2.3.2 Number‐symbol coding task

The number‐symbol coding task is a subtest of the revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WAIS‐IV; Lawrence, Saklofske, Coalson, & Raiford, 2010). Participants are asked to pair symbols to numbers and write them into blank squares as quickly as possible, referring to a digit symbol key outlined at the top of the examination sheet. Scoring is based on the number of correct substitutions made in 120 s. It primarily quantifies the speed of processing but also quantifies short‐term visual memory, learning ability, cognitive flexibility, attention, concentration, and motivation.

### Improving the self reporting of tobacco use: results of a factorial experiment [^113CgYA4]. Tobacco Control (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine divergent estimates of smoking prevalence in two random digit dial surveys for the same population. Based upon internal and external reviews of survey procedures, differences in survey introductions (general health versus tobacco specific introduction) and/or differences in the use of filter questions were identified as the most likely explanations. This prompted an experiment designed to investigate these potential sources of measurement error.

Design

A randomised 2 x 2 factorial experiment.

Setting

A random digit dial telephone survey from July to September 2000.

Subjects

3996 adult Californian respondents.

Main Outcome Measures

A series of smoking prevalence questions in the context of a tobacco or general health survey.

Results

Logistic regression analyses suggest that, among females, prior knowledge (from the survey introduction) that a survey is concerned with tobacco use may decrease self reported smoking prevalence (approximately 4% absolute prevalence difference). Differences in the use of filter questions resulted in almost no misclassification of respondents.

Conclusions

The tobacco specific survey introduction is causing some smokers to deny their tobacco use. The data suggest that these smokers tend to be women that smoked occasionally. A desire by the participants to minimise their personal time costs or a growing social disapproval of tobacco use in the USA may be contributing to the creation of previously undetected survey artefacts in the measurement of tobacco related behaviours.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^115ZnAPX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sex as a biological variable (SABV) in preclinical lung disease models — study design and reporting guidance emphasizes a 2 × 2 factorial design and explicit sex-based reporting. In a 2 × 2 factorial design, each sex is represented within the two treatment or intervention groups, and factorial designs incorporate at least two factors, with at least two levels each, enabling answers to whether outcomes differ between treated and control groups, between males and females, and whether there is an interaction between biological sex and treatment or intervention. When reporting study findings, it is essential to provide specific information to ensure reproducibility and minimize bias, and in the methods section it is crucial to state the sex of biological replicates and how that was assessed, the respective sample size, and a justification of power or otherwise the ability to detect sex-based effects; if available, researchers should include sex-specific biological variables such as estrous cycle status, developmental stage, and hormone levels. For in vitro studies, the sex of the cells used and the culturing conditions (e.g., phenol red–free and/or charcoal-stripped media) should be documented, and the figures and tables in the manuscript should display all data disaggregated by sex using distinct visual markers and including both significant and nonsignificant findings and effect sizes for sex differences. Table 3 summarizes the major recommendations for incorporating SABV in preclinical models of lung disease, and a checklist (Table 4) for the inclusion and analysis of SABV in the model, which researchers and reviewers can use, has been included in the online supplement.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^114nvBwd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.

WPV3 Cases

No WPV3 cases have been detected globally since November 2012 (Figure 1). The latest WPV3 in Asia was isolated from a child aged 1 year in the Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan who had onset of AFP on April 18, 2012, and the latest environmental WPV3 isolate in Asia was from a sample collected in Karachi, Pakistan, on October 7, 2010. The latest WPV3 in Africa was isolated from an infant aged 11 months in Yobe, Nigeria, who had onset of paralysis on November 10, 2012, and the latest environmental WPV3 isolate in Africa was from a sample collected in Lagos, Nigeria, on November 11, 2012. The number of countries reporting WPV3 cases changed from five in 2001, to 12 in 2008, to seven in 2010, and to two in 2012 (Figure 1). During 2010–2013, the number of WPV3 isolated globally in stool specimens collected from AFP patients declined from 87 to zero, whereas the number of AFP cases with specimens tested increased from 98,788 in 2010 to 101,701 in 2013.

The genetic diversity of WPV3 isolates has fallen steadily worldwide since 1988. The number of distinct WPV3 genotypes (≥ 15% nucleotide sequence divergence) detected globally declined from 17 in 1988, to five in 2001, to three in 2010, and to two in 2012 (Figure 2). In Pakistan, WPV3 clusters (approximately 5% nucleotide sequence divergence) within genotypes declined from four in 2010, to one in 2011, and to one in 2012.

### Permutation tests for factorially designed neuroimaging experiments [^115YTGgJ]. Human Brain Mapping (2004). Low credibility.

Permutation methods for analysis of functional neuroimaging data acquired as factorially designed experiments are described and validated. The F ratio was estimated for main effects and interactions at each voxel in standard space. Critical values corresponding to probability thresholds were derived from a null distribution sampled by appropriate permutation of observations. Spatially informed, cluster-level test statistics were generated by applying a preliminary probability threshold to the voxel F maps and then computing the sum of voxel statistics in each of the resulting three-dimensional clusters, i.e., cluster "mass". Using simulations comprising two between- or within-subject factors each with two or three levels, contaminated by Gaussian and non-normal noise, the voxel-wise permutation test was compared to the standard parametric F test and to the performance of the spatially informed statistic using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Validity of the permutation-testing algorithm and software is endorsed by almost identical performance of parametric and permutation tests of the voxel-level F statistic. Permutation testing of suprathreshold voxel cluster mass, however, was found to provide consistently superior sensitivity to detect simulated signals than either of the voxel-level tests. The methods are also illustrated by application to an experimental dataset designed to investigate effects of antidepressant drug treatment on brain activation by implicit sad facial affect perception in patients with major depression. Antidepressant drug effects in left amygdala and ventral striatum were detected by this software for an interaction between time (within-subject factor) and group (between-subject factor) in a representative two-way factorial design.

Table 1b — Minimum sample size for detecting geometric mean (GM) ratio k with α = 0.05 and W = 0.9 — presents required sample sizes by standard deviation (S) strata and defines parameters; α is significance level, W is power, GM is geometric mean, and S is standard deviation, noting that 1.2 is the standard deviation of national viral load (VL) data. Each jurisdiction will need to assess the standard deviation of their local VL data and then determine the appropriate sample size needed to assess VL, and if the sample size is inadequate to meet the recommended case inclusion criterion, an alternate method may need to be used, such as combining multiple years of data. For k = 3, sample sizes across S = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 are 75, 91, 108, 127, 147, 169, and Table 1b uses power = 90%; jurisdictions may also explore differences in means of viral loads, including categorical differences in the proportion with undetectable or very low VL.

Table 2 — types of viral load (VL) analyses and measures — describes mean-based metrics that average per-case results. One metric is calculated by "Determine the most recent VL for each case, total the values of those VLs, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and indicates "The average number of virus particles in a population; can be influenced by large outliers; useful for comparisons between subpopulations (e.g., disparities)". A log-transformed variant uses "Log transform the most recent VL for each case, average the log transformed values, total the average values, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and "The log transformation will provide a stable estimate by reducing the influence of outliers; tightens the association of trend between decline in CVL and new diagnoses". Another metric based on the per-case mean is computed by "Determine the mean VLs for each case, total the values of those mean VLs, and divide by the number of cases with a VL" and "Provides an average of the average number of virus particles per case; this may reflect a greater influence of those individuals with multiple measurements and those who were started on ART and trended towards suppression within 1 year". For starred metrics, " The denominator includes all viral load results, including undetectable viral load".

Statistical methods

We estimated the average treatment effect of deforested conditions on productivity using ordinary least squares regressions with indicator variables for the two experimental factors, as well as an interaction of the two indicator variables to account for the factorial design. We employed clustered robust standard errors at the individual level, which is the unit of randomization, and village fixed effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity across villages. We present fully adjusted models that include baseline covariates for age, an indicator variable for female, years of education, an indicator variable if the respondent indicated their primary occupation was farming, an indicator for regularly collecting firewood for the household which reflects familiarity with the experimental activity, an indicator for regularly working in the forest, self-assessed health status, body mass index, an indicator variable if the activity was conducted past noon to account for diurnal trends, and an indicator variable if it rained during the activity. We included these covariates to increase the precision of estimates in case baseline covariates are correlated with the outcome, as well as to correct for any imbalance in baseline covariates between the experimental groups. Doing so can increase statistical power and efficiency by subtracting explained variation for linear models. We show in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Table 4) that our findings are similar with and without these covariates. Finally, our analysis on subjective perceptions of heat on work used two questions from a post experiment survey and employed a multinomial logit model using the same specification discussed above, and then estimated marginal effects holding variables at their means.

For analysis pertaining to Fig. 1, we calculated the cumulative time lapsed in the experiment before each break is taken. If a study participant had not taken a given break, we coded them as if they had taken that break at the end of the study which means the time to each break is capped at the total study duration of 90 min. It is possible that the participant may not have taken a break until beyond the 90 min mark if the study had continued; therefore, our effects represent a lower bound on the effects of working in a forested setting on productivity. We limit our analysis to the first five breaks taken, but our analysis can easily be extended to a higher number of breaks. The coefficient reported for the effect of treatment on cumulative time to each break is estimated independently in a separate regression.

All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113SBSbn]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Statistical design, analysis, and reporting for SABV in preclinical in vitro studies emphasize power analysis and transparent sex-based planning: researchers "should determine minimum group sizes and sex allocations based on primary outcomes and effect sizes from preliminary studies". "Ideally, an equal number of male and female biological replicates should be used; at a minimum, the sex of biological replicates should be recorded a priori". "Preliminary findings can guide the two-way ANOVA to assess sex as an independent variable and its interaction with other factors", and "incorporating existing sample sizes and power analyses will aid in designing future studies focused on sex differences". Reporting expectations include that "reporting effect size, statistical power, and predicted sample sizes for each sex is essential for accurately calculating the necessary sample size to examine SABV (190)". For powering sex effects, "sample sizes must be calculated separately for each sex and then combined, accounting for sex differences in disease incidence and effect size", and "the ideal study design for evaluating sex differences should be powered to detect statistically significant sex-by-treatment interactions", noting "such a study requires a larger sample size than one designed solely to detect the main effect or sex alone (191)". When sex differences are not the primary focus and sizing is uncertain, investigators can follow "The Four C's of Studying Sex to Strengthen Science": "1) Consider — design studies that account for sex or justify its exclusion; 2) Collect — gather sex-based data; 3) Characterize — analyze sex-specific data; and 4) Communicate — report and publish".

### A computational modeling study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh [^113Gu1GQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally. Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (ɣ). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (β) and Rₜ. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.

### Increased length of stay and costs associated with weekend admissions for failure to thrive [^112wsG7y]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether admission day of the week affects the length of stay (LOS) and health care costs for failure to thrive (FTT) admissions.

Methods

Administrative data were obtained for all children aged < 2 years (N = 23332) with a primary admission diagnosis of FTT from 2003–2011 from 42 freestanding US hospitals. Demographic characteristics, day of admission, LOS, costs per stay, number of discharge diagnoses, primary discharge diagnoses, primary procedure code, number of radiologic and laboratory units billed during admission were obtained for each admission. Linear regression and zero-truncated Poisson regression were used for analysis.

Results

Weekend admission was significantly correlated with increased LOS and increased average cost (P < .002). This finding was also true for children with both admission and discharge diagnoses of FTT (P < .001). The number of procedures for children admitted on the weekend was not significantly different compared with children admitted on the weekdays (incident rate ratio [IRR]:1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99–1.09]). However, weekend admissions did have more radiologic studies (IRR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.10–1.16]) and laboratory tests (IRR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.38–1.40]) performed. If one-half of weekend admissions in 2010 with both admission and discharge diagnoses of FTT were converted to Monday admissions, total savings in health care dollars for 2010 would be $534,145.

Conclusions

Scheduled FTT admissions on weekends increased LOS and health care costs compared with weekday admissions of similar levels of complexity. Reduction in planned weekend admissions for FTT could significantly reduce health care costs.

TABLE 2
Key eligibility criteria for STEP trials

Adults are excluded from the trials if there is a self‐reported change in body weight of > 5 kg within 90 days before screening. For trials that excluded patients with T2D (STEP trails 1, 3, 4, and 5), adults are excluded if they have a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or T2D mellitus, HbA₁c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol), or previous treatment with glucose‐lowering agents or any AOM within the past 90 days before screening.

For all trials, treatment discontinuation can be decided by the investigator or participant. After discontinuation, participants are encouraged to continue to attend visits per the schedule and may be given the option to restart trial medication. Protocol‐specified discontinuation criteria include safety concerns from the investigator, calcitonin level ≥ 100 ng/L, suspicion of pancreatitis, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, and participation in another clinical trial. Participants can withdraw consent at any point and are considered lost to follow‐up if they repeatedly fail to attend scheduled visits and cannot be contacted.

The protocols allow for dose reductions in case a participant does not tolerate the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg and may stay at the lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly, if needed. This is only allowed if the participant would otherwise discontinue trial treatment completely and if it is considered safe to continue trial treatment, per the investigator's discretion. It is recommended that the participant make at least one attempt to re‐escalate to the recommended target dose of 2.4 mg once weekly. Dose is recorded at selected visits throughout the trials.

Outcome measures

The primary and confirmatory secondary end points are described in Table 1. For all trials, the primary endpoints are percentage change from baseline at randomization (note that this was from week 20 in STEP 4) to end of treatment (EOT) in body weight and ≥ 5% WL from baseline after EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Confirmatory secondary trial endpoints include the proportion of participants achieving a body weight reduction ≥ 10% or ≥ 15% from baseline to EOT (not applicable for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]). Other confirmatory secondary endpoints for all the trials are change from baseline to EOT (or change from randomization [week 20] to EOT for the sustained WM trial [STEP 4]), in waist circumference (centimeters), systolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury), and clinical outcome assessments.

### Phase 0 / microdosing approaches: time for mainstream application in drug development? [^114uansU]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2020). High credibility.

Phase 0 approaches - which include microdosing - evaluate subtherapeutic exposures of new drugs in first-in-human studies known as exploratory clinical trials. Recent progress extends phase 0 benefits beyond assessment of pharmacokinetics to include understanding of mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics. Phase 0 approaches have the potential to improve preclinical candidate selection and enable safer, cheaper, quicker and more informed developmental decisions. Here, we discuss phase 0 methods and applications, highlight their advantages over traditional strategies and address concerns related to extrapolation and developmental timelines. Although challenges remain, we propose that phase 0 approaches be at least considered for application in most drug development scenarios.

### Design of surgical randomized controlled trials involving multiple interventions [^114HGJr4]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical trials evaluating multiple interventions can be carried out by using parallel or factorial trial design. The optimal trial method has not been established.

Methods

Trials involving interventions to facilitate day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been chosen to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these two trials designs.

Results and Conclusions

The parallel trial design is simple to design and interpret, but requires multiple randomized controlled trials to assess multiple interventions. It does not detect interactions between the interventions. Factorial trial design allows reduction in overall sample size and allows for exploration of interactions. However, it is not suitable when interventions are mutually exclusive, and it is associated with a higher risk of type I and type II statistical errors. Increased sample size is required in trials in which there are group interactions, which are present in a small proportion of the interventions. Both parallel trial design and factorial trial design have their advantages and disadvantages in the assessment of multiple interventions that can be applied in conjunction. Modifications to the factorial trial design appear to overcome many of the shortcomings of factorial trial design but require further increase in sample size to decrease type I and type II errors. In practice, the choice of trial design for multiple surgical interventions depends on the potential costs of type I and type II errors and the risk of missing important antagonistic and negative interactions.

### New designs for phase 2 clinical trials [^115KagGs]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary "response" variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, "treatment effects", are confounded with differences between the trials, "trial effects". Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.

### An overview of phase 2 clinical trial designs [^115teSNB]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments in humans. Typically, these treatments are evaluated over several phases to assess their safety and efficacy. Phase 1 trials are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new treatment, typically with a small number of patients (eg, 20–80), generally spread across several dose levels. Phase 2 trials are designed to determine whether the new treatment has sufficiently promising efficacy to warrant further investigation in a large-scale randomized phase 3 trial, as well as to further assess safety. These studies usually involve a few hundred patients. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs for clinical trials and emphasizes their critical elements and considerations. Key references to some of the most commonly used phase 2 designs are given to allow the reader to explore in more detail the critical aspects when planning a phase 2 trial. A comparison of 3 potential designs in the context of the NRG-HN002 trial is presented to complement the discussion about phase 2 trials.

### Quality of life in men with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with leuprorelin and radiotherapy with or without zoledronic acid (TROG 03.04 RADAR): secondary endpoints from a randomised phase 3 factorial trial [^111tLef3]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Adjuvant androgen suppression and bisphosphonates with escalating doses of radiotherapy might improve efficacy outcomes in men with locally advanced prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated whether these treatments had a detrimental effect on patient-reported-outcome (PRO) scores.

Methods

We undertook a phase 3 trial with a 2×2 factorial design in 23 centres in Australia and New Zealand in men with non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (stage T2b-4 or T2a, Gleason score ≥ 7, and baseline prostate-specific antigen concentration [PSA] ≥ 10 μg/L), and without previous lymph node or systemic metastases or comorbidities that could reduce life expectancy to less than 5 years. The men were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 6 months of neoadjuvant (short-term) androgen suppression (STAS) with leuprorelin (22.5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) or an additional 12 months (intermediate-term androgen suppression [ITAS]) of leuprorelin with or without 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months, intravenously). Study drug administration commenced at randomisation after which radiotherapy started within the fifth month in all groups. Treatment allocation was open-label, and computer-generated randomisation, stratified by centre, baseline concentrations of PSA, clinical stage of the tumour, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost, was done by use of the minimisation technique. PRO scores were calculated from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life and prostate-specific quality-of-life module questionnaires and compared with multiple regression models at baseline, and end of radiotherapy, and 18 months and 36 months according to group and radiation dose. The trial is ongoing and the primary endpoint, prostate-cancer-specific mortality, will be reported in 2014. This study is the final report of PRO scores (a secondary endpoint). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856.

Findings

1071 men were randomly assigned to STAS (n = 268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n = 268), ITAS (n = 268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n = 267). At the end of radiotherapy, significant detrimental changes in PRO scores (p < 0.01) occurred in all groups. There were no significant differences in global health status between groups at any timepoint. At 18 months, PROs that were significantly worse in the ITAS groups when compared with STAS were hormone-treatment-related symptoms (HTRS; STAS, 10.20 [95% CI 8.66–11.75]; ITAS, 17.36 [13.63–21.08], p < 0.01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 19.14 [15.43–22.85], p < 0.01), sexual activity (STAS, 26.38 [23.50–29.27]; ITAS, 14.40 [7.44–21.36], p < 0.01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 16.34 [9.39–23.28], p < 0.01), social function (STAS, 90.31 [87.89–92.73]; ITAS, 87.35 [81.52–93.18], p = 0.09; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 83.66 [77.85–89.48], p < 0.01), fatigue (STAS, 17.05 [14.58–19.51]; ITAS 24.52 [18.58–30.46], p < 0.01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 24.26 [18.33–30.18], p < 0.01), and financial problems (STAS, 3.39 [1.29–5.48]; ITAS, 8.97 [3.92–14.02], p < 0.01; and ITAS plus zoledronic acid, 8.92 [3.89–13.96], p < 0.01). With the exception of HTRS, in which marginal differences remained, persisting significant differences disappeared by 36 months. Other factors associated with significant detrimental changes in PRO scores were a brachytherapy boost, incomplete testosterone and haemoglobin recoveries, age, and smoking.

Interpretation

Compared with 6 months of androgen suppression, 18 months of androgen suppression causes additional detrimental changes at the 18 month follow-up in some PRO scores but not in global quality-of-life scores. However, with the exception of HTRS, these differences resolved by 36 months. The use of zoledronic acid every 3 months over 18 months does not result in additional detrimental changes, but the use of a brachytherapy boost to achieve radiation dose escalation in the prostate can adversely affect emotional function and financial problems.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^1117udGe]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Guidance on community viral load — imputation for missing viral load (VL) data notes that "only 15 of 26 jurisdictions" responded to a survey and that "most jurisdictions reported missing VL information for more than 30% of their cases", and clarifies that imputation "applies to data that have been refined after completing data management processes". The page states, "We recommend that imputation of missing VL data only be attempted if < 25% of cases are missing VL AND jurisdictions are collecting supplemental clinical data". It identifies two surveillance groups with missing VL results — "in care, no VL" and "diagnosed but not in care" — and adds that jurisdictions with supplemental information "may wish to explore data imputation using published methods [9]".

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^113TEfTz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

The vulnerability of youth — smoking initiation patterns and early dependence — are characterized with specific prevalence estimates. In the United States, almost 90% of those who move on to smoking regularly have their initial experience with smoking before age 18 years and another 10% by 25 years. The most susceptible 10% lose autonomy over tobacco use within 2 days of first inhaling, and 50% of those who develop dependence do so by the time they are smoking two cigarettes a day. In 2012, the prevalence of current cigarette use among middle and high school students in the United States was 3.5 and 14.0%, respectively, whereas the prevalence of current tobacco use was 6.7 and 23.3%, respectively.

### Mammalian skull dimensions and the golden ratio (φ) [^112V6ecV]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The Golden Ratio characterizes a unique relationship in the study of integers, a branch of mathematics called Number Theory. Numerically, Φ can be calculated as a ratio within the Fibonacci series as the series approaches infinity. The Fibonacci series is a well-known, infinite series in which the next term in the series is the sum of the prior 2 terms. The Fibonacci series starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55… Initially, the ratios of consecutive terms in the Fibonacci series (Fₙ/Fₙ₋₁) fluctuate between 1 and 2, but rapidly converge on the value Φ as the series grows: 1/1 = 1, 2/1 = 2, 3/2 = 1.5, 5/3 = 1.667, 8/5 = 1.6, 13/8 = 1.625, 21/34 = 1.615, 34/21 = 1.619, 55/34 = 1.618,…

The division of the 40th Fibonacci term (102,334,155) by the 39th (63,245,986) matches Φ to 15 decimal places. For convenience, authors and mathematicians typically truncate Φ to 1.618. Interestingly, the reciprocal of Φ (1/Φ or 1/1.61803…) is 1 integer less than Φ (0.61803…) and has the same decimal extension as Φ, and the square of Φ (Φ² or 1.61803… ²) is 1 integer more than Φ (2.61803…) and also has the same decimal extension. Φ is the only number that has these 2 properties. By convention, the reciprocal of Φ is represented by the Greek lower-case letter phi (ϕ), although sometimes this convention is reversed.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^1138YogM]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Community viral load categorical measurement — additional measures and distribution guidance include examining the proportion of HIV-infected persons that meet a standardized definition of in-care, e.g., at least two lab results obtained within a calendar year that are at least 60 days apart. Categorical measures might be more informative than means, the actual distribution of VL results in surveillance populations is highly skewed with a large proportion of the population having undetectable or very low values (e.g., < 200 copies/mL), and jurisdictions should examine their data to determine the local viral load distribution and the best measures to describe it, including outlier cutoff values; such distributions can also be stratified by CD4+ T-lymphocyte count to reflect stage of illness and the U.S. HIV Treatment Guidelines recommendations on initiation of antiretroviral therapy.
