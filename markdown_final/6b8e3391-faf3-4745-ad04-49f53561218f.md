## Question

ras raf map kinase pathway - how it works

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of how the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK (MAPK) pathway works, including its normal signaling flow, regulatory mechanisms, oncogenic dysregulation, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the canonical signaling cascade from receptor to nucleus. Then, I should verify the key regulatory checkpoints, especially RAF autoinhibition and dimerization. Next, I will examine oncogenic mutations and their mechanistic consequences. After that, I need to review therapeutic targeting, including paradoxes and resistance. Finally, I will integrate these layers into a coherent narrative and highlight areas of uncertainty and evolving strategies.

> Let me first confirm the canonical flow of normal signaling. Extracellular growth factors engage receptor tyrosine kinases, which recruit adaptor proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors that load RAS with GTP, converting RAS to its active state at the plasma membrane [^11472Apq]. Active RAS then recruits RAF kinases to the membrane, where RAF undergoes conformational changes and dimerization, becoming competent to phosphorylate MEK1/2 on key serine residues in their activation segments, which in turn phosphorylate ERK1/2 on the threonine–glutamate–tyrosine motif, enabling ERK to translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcription factors and other substrates that drive proliferation, survival, and differentiation programs [^11472Apq] [^116xit4z].

> Wait, let me verify the RAF activation step because it is easy to oversimplify. RAF kinases are normally autoinhibited in the cytosol by intramolecular interactions and 14–3–3 binding to phosphorylated serine sites, which restrains the kinase domain and prevents dimerization; RAS binding to the RAS-binding domain helps relieve this autoinhibition, but full activation also requires dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites, phosphorylation of activating residues, and crucially, side-to-side dimerization of RAF kinase domains, which transactivates the partner protomer and licenses MEK phosphorylation [^11472Apq] [^1126Au5V] [^111yFndR].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of isoforms and dimer composition. BRAF generally has higher basal MEK kinase activity than ARAF or CRAF, and in RAS-driven signaling, BRAF–CRAF heterodimers predominate, which functionally amplifies signal output; this heterodimeric architecture becomes clinically important when considering RAF inhibitors and resistance mechanisms [^111yFndR] [^116zmVzz].

> Next, I should review negative feedback to ensure signal fidelity. Activated ERK phosphorylates upstream components including SOS and RAF family members, disrupting RAS binding and RAF dimerization, thereby attenuating further signaling; this negative feedback loop is a key determinant of signal duration and amplitude and helps prevent runaway pathway activation in normal cells [^113TyndA] [^116zmVzz].

> I will now examine oncogenic dysregulation, starting with RAS. Mutations such as KRAS G12D, G12V, G13D, or Q61H impair intrinsic GTPase activity and GAP-mediated hydrolysis, trapping RAS in the GTP-bound state and sustaining RAF recruitment, dimerization, and downstream signaling; these mutations collectively occur in roughly 20–30% of human cancers and are a major driver of MAPK hyperactivation [^1149RHkc] [^117Tk8ej].

> Let me consider BRAF mutations next, and I should double-check the classes. Class I V600 mutations render BRAF constitutively active as a monomer independent of RAS, directly phosphorylating MEK; Class II mutants signal as RAS-independent dimers; Class III mutants are kinase-impaired but enhance signaling by forming high-affinity complexes with RAS that recruit and transactivate CRAF, illustrating how different BRAF lesions converge on MEK/ERK activation through distinct stoichiometries and dependencies [^111DWAMJ] [^11386buJ].

> But wait, what about MEK and ERK mutations themselves. MEK1/2 mutations are less common but can confer resistance to RAF or MEK inhibitors, often by altering drug binding or bypassing upstream blockade; ERK1/2 mutations are relatively rare in untreated cancers, likely reflecting intolerance to excessive ERK activity, though they do emerge as on-target resistance in some inhibitor-treated settings, reinforcing the need for durable pathway suppression strategies [^114Yc9Ht] [^111Mdb63].

> Next, I should review therapeutic targeting and the RAF inhibitor paradox. First-generation ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors potently inhibit monomeric BRAF V600E but can promote RAF dimerization and transactivation in RAS-mutant or wild-type RAF contexts, paradoxically enhancing ERK signaling and tumor growth; this mechanistic insight led to the development of "paradox-breaker" RAF inhibitors that suppress mutant BRAF without activating the pathway in RAS-driven cells [^112hTgEr] [^114Ex2ch] [^111JqSAo].

> I need to check MEK inhibitors as a class. Non–ATP-competitive allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors such as trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib block the activating phosphorylation of MEK by RAF and reduce ERK activity; clinically, they are most active in BRAF V600–mutant tumors and are often combined with RAF inhibitors to deepen and prolong response, though resistance via pathway reactivation remains a challenge [^116YusRM] [^111gC6E2] [^1161GKUK] [^1139HxwB].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of ERK inhibitors, especially dual-mechanism agents. Catalytic ERK inhibitors can permit compensatory ERK phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation, whereas dual-mechanism ERK inhibitors that both block catalytic activity and prevent MEK-mediated phosphorylation more durably suppress ERK signaling and transcriptional programs; agents like ASTX029 and SCH772984 have shown activity in BRAF- and RAS-mutant models and in settings of acquired resistance to upstream inhibitors [^116xit4z] [^112RSWoP] [^115Nk1dK].

> Let me reconsider combination strategies and resistance. Intrinsic and acquired resistance commonly reflects feedback reactivation of upstream RTKs, emergence of RAS or BRAF amplifications or splice variants, or compensatory pathway engagement; vertical combinations targeting multiple nodes, and horizontal combinations with PI3K/AKT/mTOR or RTK inhibitors, are rational approaches to mitigate these escape routes, albeit with toxicity trade-offs that require careful management [^11779wdY] [^114ay2jk] [^116RVKp5].

> I should confirm emerging mechanistic therapies. Pan-RAF–MEK molecular glues such as NST-628 stabilize inactive RAF–MEK complexes, prevent RAF dimerization and MEK phosphorylation, and demonstrate broad preclinical activity across RAS- and RAF-driven tumors including CNS disease, offering a differentiated pharmacologic approach that may circumvent classical dimerization-driven resistance [^11478zkm] [^116zUCLM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that all RAF inhibitors universally worsen RAS-mutant tumors; let me correct that nuance. While first-generation RAF inhibitors can paradoxically activate MAPK signaling in RAS-mutant or wild-type RAF contexts, paradox-breaker RAF inhibitors and certain combination regimens have shown the ability to suppress signaling without triggering detrimental transactivation, underscoring the importance of agent selection and context-specific strategies [^111JqSAo] [^112hTgEr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical narrative ties genotype to therapy. Tumors with BRAF V600 mutations exhibit exquisite dependency on MEK/ERK signaling and respond well to BRAF plus MEK inhibition, whereas RAS-mutant tumors are more heterogeneous and often require rational combinations or next-generation agents; biomarker development beyond single-gene status, including pathway activity scores and spatial signaling features, is critical to match patients with optimal MAPK-targeted regimens and to anticipate resistance trajectories [^114LiUuv] [^114Gwir7] [^112yF7YT].

The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway transmits extracellular growth signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to the nucleus via a **three-tiered kinase cascade** [^114Yc9Ht] (RAF → MEK → ERK) [^112qiHv6], regulating proliferation, differentiation, and survival [^112qiHv6]. RAS is activated by RTKs and recruits RAF to the membrane, where RAF dimerizes and activates MEK, which then activates ERK; ERK phosphorylates transcription factors and kinases to alter gene expression and cellular behavior [^114JqSgP]. Mutations in RAS or RAF (notably BRAF V600E) [^111DWAMJ] cause **constitutive pathway activation** [^11779wdY], driving tumorigenesis and making the pathway a key therapeutic target [^113grnhH].

## Key components and activation mechanism

| **Component** | **Function** | **Activation mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| RAS | Small GTPase; signal switch | Activated by RTKs via GEFs (e.g. SOS); GTP-bound state recruits RAF [^11472Apq] |
| RAF (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) | Serine/threonine kinase | Membrane recruitment by RAS; dimerization; phosphorylation activates kinase [^1126Au5V] |
| MEK1/2 | Dual-specificity kinase | Phosphorylated by RAF; activates ERK [^112qiHv6] |
| ERK1/2 | Serine/threonine kinase | Phosphorylated by MEK; translocates to nucleus; phosphorylates transcription factors and kinases [^114Yc9Ht] |

---

Activation begins when **RTKs** stimulate RAS to bind GTP [^111YssAZ], recruiting RAF to the membrane, where RAF dimerizes and becomes active. Active RAF phosphorylates MEK, which then phosphorylates ERK; ERK moves to the nucleus and phosphorylates targets that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and survival [^114Yc9Ht].

---

## Regulation and feedback mechanisms

The pathway is tightly controlled by **feedback and scaffolding** [^114Yc9Ht]:

- **Negative feedback**: ERK phosphorylates RAF and MEK, reducing their activity [^113TyndA].
- **Scaffold proteins**: KSR and MP1 organize the cascade and enhance signaling fidelity [^11119JEn].
- **Phosphatases**: MKPs dephosphorylate ERK, limiting signaling duration [^notfound].

---

## Role in cancer

The pathway is frequently dysregulated in cancer; **RAS mutations** (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS) occur in ~30% of cancers and cause constitutive signaling [^111z9EVB], while **BRAF mutations** (notably V600E) [^111DWAMJ] drive ~8% of cancers, including melanoma and colorectal tumors [^11386buJ]. These mutations promote proliferation, survival, and metastasis, making the pathway a major oncogenic driver [^113pk1ib].

---

## Therapeutic targeting

Inhibitors targeting this pathway include **RAF inhibitors** (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) for BRAF-mutant melanoma and colorectal cancer [^113grnhH], **MEK inhibitors** (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) used with RAF inhibitors to improve durability and delay resistance [^1161GKUK], and **ERK inhibitors** (ulixertinib, SCH772984) under study to overcome resistance to RAF/MEK therapy [^115Nk1dK].

---

## Resistance mechanisms

Resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors commonly arises via **reactivation of ERK signaling** [^11779wdY] through:

- **RTK activation**: Upregulation of EGFR, FGFR, or others [^116YusRM].
- **RAS mutations**: Secondary RAS mutations restore signaling [^111YssAZ].
- **RAF dimerization**: Promotes bypass of RAF inhibitors [^112T9LYk].
- **ERK mutations**: Reduce inhibitor binding [^114hoQBo].

---

## Clinical implications

The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway is central to cancer biology; its dysregulation drives tumorigenesis, and targeted therapies have improved outcomes in BRAF-mutant melanoma and other cancers [^11779wdY]. Overcoming resistance via combination strategies and next-generation inhibitors remains a key clinical challenge [^114ay2jk].

### Targeting alterations in the RAF-MEK pathway [^112yF7YT]. Cancer Discovery (2019). Medium credibility.

The MAPK pathway is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenic pathways in cancer. Although RAS mutations are the most frequent MAPK alterations, less frequent alterations in downstream components of the pathway, including the RAF and MEK genes, offer promising therapeutic opportunities. In addition to BRAF V600 mutations, for which several approved therapeutic regimens exist, other alterations in the RAF and MEK genes may provide more rare, but tractable, targets. However, recent studies have illustrated the complexity of MAPK signaling and highlighted that distinct alterations in these genes may have strikingly different properties. Understanding the unique functional characteristics of specific RAF and MEK alterations, reviewed herein, will be critical for developing effective therapeutic approaches for these targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations in the RAF and MEK genes represent promising therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types. However, given the unique and complex signaling biology of the MAPK pathway, the diverse array of RAF and MEK alterations observed in cancer can possess distinct functional characteristics. As outlined in this review, understanding the key functional properties of different RAF and MEK alterations is fundamental to selecting the optimal therapeutic approach.

Among mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway has received the most attention in the oncology drug discovery arena. By virtue of its central role in promoting proliferation, survival, and metastasis, this pathway directly affects both the formation and progression of human tumors. The identification of non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of the MAPK kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) resulted in the first demonstration that the ERK pathway could be effectively shut down in a highly selective fashion. Subsequent discovery of the oncogenic nature of B-raf kinase led to the escalation of drug discovery efforts revolving around MEK and RAF. The emergence of multiple drug candidates targeting these downstream kinases provides us with the means for validating the importance of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade in human tumors. This article highlights the lessons learned in the clinical evaluation of MAPK pathway inhibitors as anticancer agents and the complexities surrounding optimization of their therapeutic potential in light of the challenges posed by genetic heterogeneity within patient populations.

### Targeting the raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade for the treatment of cancer [^112qiHv6]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Aberrant regulation of MAPK cascades contribute to cancer and other human diseases. In particular, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK pathway has been the subject of intense research scrutiny leading to the development of pharmacologic inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. ERK is a downstream component of an evolutionarily conserved signaling module that is activated by the Raf serine/threonine kinases. Raf activates the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 dual-specificity protein kinases, which then activate ERK1/2. The mutational activation of Raf in human cancers supports the important role of this pathway in human oncogenesis. Additionally, the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is a key downstream effector of the Ras small GTPase, the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. Finally, Ras is a key downstream effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is mutationally activated and/or overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers. ERK activation also promotes upregulated expression of EGFR ligands, promoting an autocrine growth loop critical for tumor growth. Thus, the EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical scrutiny to identify novel target-based approaches for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the current status of the different approaches and targets that are under evaluation and development for the therapeutic intervention of this key signaling pathway in human disease.

Will the MAPK pathway prove amenable to therapeutic intervention?

### Classifying BRAF alterations in cancer: new rational therapeutic strategies for actionable mutations [^111DWAMJ]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is among the most frequently mutated pathways in human cancer. Approximately 50% of melanoma patients possess a druggable hotspot V600E/K mutation in the BRAF protein kinase. FDA-approved combination therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors are available that provide survival benefits to patients with a BRAF V600 mutation. Non-V600 BRAF mutants are found in many cancers, and are more prevalent than V600 mutations in certain tumor types. For example, between 50–80% of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and 22–30% in colorectal cancer encode for non-V600 mutants. As next generation sequencing becomes increasingly used in clinical practice, oncologists are frequently identifying non-V600 BRAF mutations in their patient's tumors, but are uncertain of viable therapeutic options that could be employed for optimal treatment. From recent studies, a new classification system is emerging for BRAF mutations based on biochemical and signaling mechanisms associated with these mutants. Class I BRAF mutations affect amino acid V600 and signal as RAS-independent active monomers, class II mutations function as RAS-independent activated dimers, and class III mutations are kinase impaired but increase signaling through the MAPK pathway due to enhanced RAS binding and subsequent CRAF activation. These distinct classes of BRAF mutations predict response to targeted therapies and have important implications for future drug development. Herein, we discuss pre-clinical and clinical findings that may lead to improved treatments for all classes of BRAF mutant cancers.

### Targeting RAS-ERK signalling in cancer: promises and challenges [^11779wdY]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2014). Medium credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway is hyperactivated in a high percentage of tumours, most frequently owing to activating mutations of the KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes. Recently, the use of compounds targeting components of ERK signalling, such as RAF or MEK inhibitors, has led to substantial improvement in clinical outcome in metastatic melanoma and has shown promising clinical activity in additional tumour types. However, response rates are highly variable and the efficacy of these drugs is primarily limited by the development of resistance. Both intrinsic and acquired resistance to RAF and MEK inhibitors are frequently associated with the persistence of ERK signalling in the presence of the drug, implying the need for more innovative approaches to target the pathway.

The identification of intracellular signaling cascades important for the growth and survival of cancer cells has led to the development of targeted cancer therapeutics aimed at blocking these signals. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has a well-defined role in cancer biology and has been an important target in the development of targeted therapies. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), a key intermediary of MAPK signaling, have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials. Herein, we review the MAPK pathway, the development of small-molecule MEK inhibitors, and the results obtained to date with MEK inhibitors in human cancer trials.

### Development of anticancer drugs targeting the MAP kinase pathway [^1166g9yd]. Oncogene (2000). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of the role of ras oncogenes in tumorigenesis, we have witnessed an explosion of research in the signal transduction area. In the quest to understand how Ras transmits extracellular growth signals, the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway has emerged as the crucial route between membrane-bound Ras and the nucleus. The MAPK pathway encompasses a cascade of phosphorylation events involving three key kinases, namely Raf, MEK (MAP kinase kinase) and ERK (MAP kinase). This kinase cascade presents novel opportunities for the development of new cancer therapies designed to be less toxic than conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, as a signal transduction-based approach to cancer treatment, inhibition of any one of these targets has the potential for translational pharmacodynamic evaluation of target suppression. The rationale for targeting the MAP kinase pathway will be reviewed here along with a discussion of various pharmacological approaches and the promise they hold for a new generation of anticancer drugs.

### Mechanism and consequences of RAF kinase activation by small-molecule inhibitors [^1148KATP]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the clinical success of RAF inhibitors in BRAF-mutated melanomas, attempts to target RAF kinases in the context of RAS-driven or otherwise RAF wild-type tumours have not only been ineffective, but RAF inhibitors appear to aggravate tumorigenesis in these settings. Subsequent preclinical investigation has revealed several regulatory mechanisms, feedback pathways and unexpected enzymatic quirks in the MAPK pathway, which may explain this paradox. In this review, we cover the various proposed molecular mechanisms for the RAF paradox, the clinical consequences and strategies to overcome it.

### Molecular pathways: response and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF (V600E) tumors [^111RwYAQ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK (MAP-ERK kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway plays a central role in driving proliferation, survival, and metastasis signals in tumor cells, and the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in RAS and BRAF and upstream nodes makes this pathway the focus of significant oncology drug development efforts. This focus has been justified by the recent success of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in prolonging the lives of patients with BRAF(V600E/K)-mutant melanoma. Although it is disappointing that cures are relatively rare, this should not detract from the value of these agents to patients with cancer and the opportunity they provide in allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of drug response and resistance. These insights have already provided the basis for the evaluation of alternative dosing regimens and combination therapies in patients with melanoma.

### The clinical development of MEK inhibitors [^113SZjvn]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Aberrant activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway occurs in more than 30% of human cancers. As part of this pathway, MEK1 and MEK2 have crucial roles in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis and, therefore, MEK1/2 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy in a number of cancers. Highly selective and potent non-ATP-competitive allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors have been developed and assessed in numerous clinical studies over the past decade. These agents are not efficacious in a broad range of unselected cancers, although single-agent antitumour activity has been detected mainly in tumours that harbour mutations in genes encoding the members of the RAS and RAF protein families, such as certain melanomas. Combinations of MEK1/2 inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or other targeted agents are being studied to expand the efficacy of this class of agents. Identifying predictive biomarkers, and delineating de novo and acquired resistance mechanisms are essential for the future clinical development of MEK inhibitors. We discuss the clinical experience with MEK inhibitors to date, and consider the novel approaches to MEK-inhibitor therapy that might improve outcomes and lead to the wider use of such treatments.

### A structure is worth a thousand words: new insights for RAS and RAF regulation [^11472Apq]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

THE RAF KINASES–ESSENTIAL EFFECTORS OF RAS

In order for all RAS proteins to promote tumorigenesis, they must engage the ERK/MAPK cascade, comprised of the RAF, MEK, and ERK protein kinases (reviewed in refs.). The initiating kinases in this effector cascade are members of the RAF kinase family, CRAF/RAF1, BRAF, and ARAF, all of which possess a RAS-binding domain (RBD) that enables them to interact directly with GTP-bound RAS. The interaction with RAS promotes RAF catalytic activation, allowing RAF to phosphorylate and activate MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK. Once activated, ERK can then phosphorylate targets throughout the cell that ultimately bring about the biological changes needed for cell proliferation and tumor growth. For the MEK and ERK kinases, the activation mechanism is quite straightforward with the activating phosphorylation sites located in a region of the kinase domain known as the activation segment, which undergoes a conformational change when phosphorylated that opens the catalytic site for substrate phosphorylation. In contrast, the mechanisms regulating RAF activation are much more complex, involving changes in subcellular localization, protein, and lipid interactions, as well as alterations in the RAF phosphorylation state.

All members of the RAF kinase family can be divided into two functional domains, an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal kinase domain (Fig. 2A; ref.). The regulatory domain contains a variable length N-terminal segment, followed by the RBD, a zinc finger–containing, cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and a linker region possessing a phosphorylation-dependent 14–3–3 binding site. In addition, all RAF kinases contain a second phosphorylation-dependent 14–3–3 binding site located in the short C-terminal tail that follows the kinase domain. It is important to note that members of the 14–3–3 family (β, γ, ε, σ, ζ, τ, and η in mammals) are specific phosphoserine/phosphothreonine (pS/T) binding proteins that contribute to the regulation of many cellular proteins in addition to the RAF kinases. They exist in cells as obligate homo- or heterodimers, with each protomer in the dimer containing an independent pS/T binding channel.

### Integrating signals from RTKs to ERK / MAPK [^115VgYSF]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

Signals received at the cell surface must be properly transmitted to critical targets within the cell to achieve the appropriate biological response. This process of signal transduction is often initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which function as entry points for many extracellular cues and play a critical role in recruiting the intracellular signaling cascades that orchestrate a particular response. Essential for most RTK-mediated signaling is the engagement and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade comprised of the Raf, MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases. For many years, it was thought that signaling from RTKs to ERK occurred only at the plasma membrane and was mediated by a simple, linear Ras-dependent pathway. However, the limitation of this model became apparent with the discovery that Ras and ERK can be activated at various intracellular compartments, and that RTKs can modulate Ras/ERK signaling from these sites. Moreover, ERK scaffolding proteins and signaling modulators have been identified that play critical roles in determining the strength, duration and location of RTK-mediated ERK signaling. Together, these factors contribute to the diversity of biological responses generated by RTK signaling.

### RAF inhibitors prime wild-type RAF to activate the MAPK pathway and enhance growth [^112hTgEr]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF are found in more than 30% of all human tumours and 40% of melanoma, respectively, thus targeting this pathway could have broad therapeutic effects. Small molecule ATP-competitive RAF kinase inhibitors have potent antitumour effects on mutant BRAF(V600E) tumours but, in contrast to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, are not potent against RAS mutant tumour models, despite RAF functioning as a key effector downstream of RAS and upstream of MEK. Here we show that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors have two opposing mechanisms of action depending on the cellular context. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAF inhibitors effectively block the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and decrease tumour growth. Notably, in KRAS mutant and RAS/RAF wild-type tumours, RAF inhibitors activate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in a RAS-dependent manner, thus enhancing tumour growth in some xenograft models. Inhibitor binding activates wild-type RAF isoforms by inducing dimerization, membrane localization and interaction with RAS-GTP. These events occur independently of kinase inhibition and are, instead, linked to direct conformational effects of inhibitors on the RAF kinase domain. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrate that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can have opposing functions as inhibitors or activators of signalling pathways, depending on the cellular context. Furthermore, this work provides new insights into the therapeutic use of ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors.

### Characterization of a novel mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 / 2 inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action for cancer therapy [^113KzUNN]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway plays a central role in regulating tumor cell growth, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. The key components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal module are frequently altered in human cancers. Targeting this pathway represents a promising anticancer strategy. Small molecule inhibitors targeting MEK1/2 have shown promise in the clinic; however, ultimate clinical proof-of-concept remains elusive. Here, we report a potent and highly selective non-ATP-competitive MEK1/2 inhibitor, RO4927350, with a novel chemical structure and unique mechanism of action. It selectively blocks the MAPK pathway signaling both in vitro and in vivo, which results in significant antitumor efficacy in a broad spectrum of tumor models. Compared with previously reported MEK inhibitors, RO4927350 inhibits not only ERK1/2 but also MEK1/2 phosphorylation. In cancer cells, high basal levels of phospho-MEK1/2 rather than phospho-ERK1/2 seem to correlate with greater sensitivity to RO4927350. Furthermore, RO4927350 prevents a feedback increase in MEK phosphorylation, which has been observed with other MEK inhibitors. We show that B-Raf rather than C-Raf plays a critical role in the feedback regulation. The unique MAPK signaling blockade mediated by RO4927350 in cancer may reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. Thus, RO4927350 represents a novel therapeutic modality in cancers with aberrant MAPK pathway activation.

### Molecular pathways and mechanisms of BRAF in cancer therapy [^113grnhH]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

With the identification of activating mutations in BRAF across a wide variety of malignancies, substantial effort was placed in designing safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target BRAF. These efforts have led to the development and regulatory approval of three BRAF inhibitors as well as five combinations of a BRAF inhibitor plus an additional agent(s) to manage cancer such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, each regimen is effective only in patients with tumors harboring BRAFV600 mutations and the duration of benefit is often short-lived. Further limitations preventing optimal management of BRAF-mutant malignancies are that treatments of non-V600 BRAF mutations have been less profound and combination therapy is likely necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms, but multi-drug regimens are often too toxic. With the emergence of a deeper understanding of how BRAF mutations signal through the RAS/MAPK pathway, newer RAF inhibitors are being developed that may be more effective and potentially safer and more rational combination therapies are being tested in the clinic. In this review, we identify the mechanics of RAF signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway, present existing data on single-agent and combination RAF targeting efforts, describe emerging combinations, summarize the toxicity of the various agents in clinical testing, and speculate as to where the field may be headed.

### A structure is worth a thousand words: new insights for RAS and RAF regulation [^115bo3PC]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

The RAS GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancer, with KRAS being the predominant tumor driver. For many years, it has been known that the structure and function of RAS are integrally linked, as structural changes induced by GTP binding or mutational events determine the ability of RAS to interact with regulators and effectors. Recently, a wealth of information has emerged from structures of specific KRAS mutants and from structures of multiprotein complexes containing RAS and/or RAF, an essential effector of RAS. These structures provide key insights regarding RAS and RAF regulation as well as promising new strategies for therapeutic intervention.

Significance

The RAS GTPases are major drivers of tumorigenesis, and for RAS proteins to exert their full oncogenic potential, they must interact with the RAF kinases to initiate ERK cascade signaling. Although binding to RAS is typically a prerequisite for RAF to become an activated kinase, determining the molecular mechanisms by which this interaction results in RAF activation has been a challenging task. A major advance in understanding this process and RAF regulation has come from recent structural studies of various RAS and RAF multiprotein signaling complexes, revealing new avenues for drug discovery.

Introduction

Strategies to durably inhibit the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling network have the potential for broad use in cancers with RAS or RAF family activating mutations, amplifications in downstream kinases, and general dependence on MAPK signaling without genomically conspicuous pathway alterations. While therapies targeting RAF, MEK, and ERK have demonstrated strong preclinical efficacy, — and in some cases impressive activity in clinical trials, — resistance to first generation ERK/MAPK inhibitors has been problematic, largely secondary to mutational and non-mutational pathway reactivation. Novel classes of dual-mechanism inhibitors have recently been developed to more effectively inhibit ERK/MAPK signaling, predominantly by preventing known adaptations that lead to pathway reactivation, for example by blocking the intrinsic kinase function of the target as well as its ability to be phosphorylated by upstream kinases. Nevertheless, acquired resistance to dual-mechanism inhibitors has been increasingly reported –, including studies from our laboratory describing evolved resistance across diverse model systems. This suggests that signaling events beyond traditional pathway reactivation support the development of resistance to sustained ERK/MAPK suppression.

### Ras and raf pathways in epidermis development and carcinogenesis [^112gLxCa]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Raf pathways in the epidermis

The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is the longest-studied and probably the best-described Ras effector pathway. The term 'cascade' already suggests the chain reaction that propels the signal, in the form of sequential phosphorylation, from an entry point to an intermediate kinase and finally to ERK, the business end of the pathway. ERK stimulation results in the phosphorylation of transcription factors, structural proteins and metabolic enzymes, and ultimately engenders both short- and long-term changes in cellular behaviour. This basic three-tiered module is robust and plastic at the same time, allowing not only the amplification but also the diversification and temporal modulation of the signal at each and every node; in mammals, it is found in four mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways that contribute to implementing biological outcomes as diverse as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, motility and response to stress and cytokines.

One outstanding feature of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in mammals is redundancy. Mammals have three Raf isoforms (A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1, also known as C-Raf), two MEK and two ERK isoforms. All three Rafs can bind to Ras and phosphorylate MEK, although B-Raf is much more efficient than the other two and is necessary for ERK activation in vivo (reviewed in;). Both MEKs can phosphorylate ERK1/2; and whether ERK1/2 have non-redundant functions or not is still unclear (see below).

Consistent with its prominent role as a MEK kinase, B-Raf is the component of the ERK pathway most often mutated in human tumours, with a particularly high frequency (43%) in human melanoma. The most frequent B-Raf mutation, V600E, results in constitutive catalytic activity and MEK/ERK activation. Recently, a kinase drug selectively inhibiting B-Raf V600E has achieved an unprecedented response rate of 80% in phase 1 clinical trials involving metastatic melanoma patients, opening new therapeutic avenues for this deadly disease. Less frequent BRAF mutations reduce intrinsic catalytic activity but drive MEK/ERK activation by stimulating the formation of B-Raf/Raf-1 heterodimers in which mutant B-Raf activates wild-type Raf-1 in trans (reviewed in;).

### Discovery of a novel raf kinase inhibitor [^116tuZx5]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

We discuss the biology of Ras signal transduction and the epidemiology of ras mutations in association with disease as a background for the development of a Raf kinase inhibitor, BAY 43–9006. Knowledge of Ras effector pathways has permitted genetic validation of numerous targets involved in the Ras signaling cascade. A key Ras effector pathway involves the kinase cascade RAF/MEK/ERK (MEK: MAP/ERK kinase; ERK: extracellular signal related kinase). Indeed, we present studies of cell lines stably expressing mutant MEK constructs, which point to Raf kinase as a target for therapeutics with selective anti-tumor activity. Finally, a small molecule drug discovery program based on inhibition of Raf kinase activity is outlined and the initial pre-clinical development process of the Raf kinase inhibitor BAY 43–9006 is discussed.

### MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors and cancer therapy: the long and winding road [^114W1ArH]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2015). Medium credibility.

The role of the ERK signalling pathway in cancer is thought to be most prominent in tumours in which mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases RAS, BRAF, CRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 drive growth factor-independent ERK1 and ERK2 activation and thence inappropriate cell proliferation and survival. New drugs that inhibit RAF or MEK1 and MEK2 have recently been approved or are currently undergoing late-stage clinical evaluation. In this Review, we consider the ERK pathway, focusing particularly on the role of MEK1 and MEK2, the 'gatekeepers' of ERK1/2 activity. We discuss their validation as drug targets, the merits of targeting MEK1 and MEK2 versus BRAF and the mechanisms of action of different inhibitors of MEK1 and MEK2. We also consider how some of the systems-level properties (intrapathway regulatory loops and wider signalling network connections) of the ERK pathway present a challenge for the success of MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors, discuss mechanisms of resistance to these inhibitors, and review their clinical progress.

### A structure is worth a thousand words: new insights for RAS and RAF regulation [^117MtPPc]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The RAS GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancer, with KRAS being the predominant tumor driver. For many years, it has been known that the structure and function of RAS are integrally linked, as structural changes induced by GTP binding or mutational events determine the ability of RAS to interact with regulators and effectors. Recently, a wealth of information has emerged from structures of specific KRAS mutants and from structures of multiprotein complexes containing RAS and/or RAF, an essential effector of RAS. These structures provide key insights regarding RAS and RAF regulation as well as promising new strategies for therapeutic intervention.

Significance:

The RAS GTPases are major drivers of tumorigenesis, and for RAS proteins to exert their full oncogenic potential, they must interact with the RAF kinases to initiate ERK cascade signaling. Although binding to RAS is typically a prerequisite for RAF to become an activated kinase, determining the molecular mechanisms by which this interaction results in RAF activation has been a challenging task. A major advance in understanding this process and RAF regulation has come from recent structural studies of various RAS and RAF multiprotein signaling complexes, revealing new avenues for drug discovery.

### ERK inhibition overcomes acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors [^111TxNA6]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is activated in more than 30% of human cancers, most commonly via mutation in the K-ras oncogene and also via mutations in BRAF. Several allosteric mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors, aimed at treating tumors with RAS/RAF pathway alterations, are in clinical development. However, acquired resistance to these inhibitors has been documented both in preclinical and clinical samples. To identify strategies to overcome this resistance, we have derived three independent MEK inhibitor-resistant cell lines. Resistance to allosteric MEK inhibitors in these cell lines was consistently linked to acquired mutations in the allosteric binding pocket of MEK. In one cell line, concurrent amplification of mutant K-ras was observed in conjunction with MEK allosteric pocket mutations. Clonal analysis showed that both resistance mechanisms occur in the same cell and contribute to enhanced resistance. Importantly, in all cases the MEK-resistant cell lines retained their addiction to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as evidenced by their sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of the ERK1/2 kinases. These data suggest that tumors with acquired MEK inhibitor resistance remain dependent on the MAPK pathway and are therefore sensitive to inhibitors that act downstream of the mutated MEK target. Importantly, we show that dual inhibition of MEK and ERK by small molecule inhibitors was synergistic and acted to both inhibit the emergence of resistance, as well as to overcome acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors. Therefore, our data provide a rationale for cotargeting multiple nodes within the MAPK signaling cascade in K-ras mutant tumors to maximize therapeutic benefit for patients.

### RAF kinase dimerization: implications for drug discovery and clinical outcomes [^112T9LYk]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

The RAF kinases activated by RAS GTPases regulate cell growth and division by signal transduction through the ERK cascade and mutations leading to constitutive activity are key drivers of human tumors, as are upstream activators including RAS and receptor tyrosine kinases. The development of first-generation RAF inhibitors, including vemurafenib (VEM) and dabrafenib led to initial excitement due to high response rates and profound regression of malignant melanomas carrying BRAF V600E mutations. The excitement about these unprecedented response rates, however, was tempered by tumor unresponsiveness through both intrinsic and acquired drug-resistance mechanisms. In recent years much insight into the complexity of the RAS-RAF axis has been obtained and inactivation and signal transduction mechanisms indicate that RAF dimerization is a critical step in multiple cellular contexts and plays a key role in resistance. Both homo- and hetero-dimerization of BRAF and CRAF can modulate therapeutic response and disease progression in patients treated with ATP-competitive inhibitors and are therefore highly clinically significant. Ten years after the definition of the RAF dimer interface (DIF) by crystallography, this review focuses on the implications of RAF kinase dimerization in signal transduction and for drug development, both from a classical ATP-competitive standpoint and from the perspective of new therapeutic strategies including inhibiting dimer formation. A structural perspective of the DIF, how dimerization impacts inhibitor activation and the structure-based design of next-generation RAF kinase inhibitors with unique mechanisms of action is presented. We also discuss potential fields of application for DIF inhibitors, ranging from non-V600E oncoproteins and BRAF fusions to tumors driven by aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase or RAS signaling.

### Targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the treatment of malignant melanoma [^1173QHuN]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; i.e. Ras-Raf-Erk) pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in melanoma due to its integral role in the regulation of proliferation, invasiveness, and survival and the recent availability of pharmaceutical agents that inhibit the various kinases and GTPases that comprise the pathway. Genetic studies have identified activating mutations in either B-raf or N-ras in most cutaneous melanomas. Other studies have delineated the contribution of autocrine growth factors (e.g., hepatocyte growth factor and fibroblast growth factor) to MAPK activation in melanoma. Still, others have emphasized the consequences of the down-modulation of endogenous raf inhibitors, such as Sprouty family members (e.g. SPRY2) and raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein, in the regulation of the pathway. The diversity of molecular mechanisms used by melanoma cells to ensure the activity of the MAPK pathway attests to its importance in the evolution of the disease and the likelihood that inhibitors of the pathway may prove to be highly effective in melanoma treatment. MAPK inhibition has been shown to result in the dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bad and Bim. This process in turn leads to caspase activation and, ultimately, the demise of melanoma cells through the induction of apoptosis. Several recent studies have identified non-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-binding partners of raf and suggested that the prosurvival effects of raf and the lethality of raf inhibition are mediated through these alternative targets, independent of the MAPK pathway. Other studies have suggested that endothelial cells are the primary targets of raf inhibitors in vivo and that the antitumor effect of these agents are largely attributable to angiogenesis inhibition. This article reviews the genetic and biochemical factors contributing to MAPK activation in melanoma, the mechanisms by which inhibition of the pathway might prove deleterious to tumor cells, and the potential of MAPK inhibitors in the treatment of the disease.

### Roles of the ras / raf / MEK / ERK pathway in leukemia therapy [^115eidLz]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

The Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is often implicated in sensitivity and resistance to leukemia therapy. Dysregulated signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is often the result of genetic alterations in critical components in this pathway as well as mutations at upstream growth factor receptors. Unrestricted leukemia proliferation and decreased sensitivity to apoptotic-inducing agents and chemoresistance are typically associated with activation of pro-survival pathways. Mutations in this pathway and upstream signaling molecules can alter sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors targeting components of this cascade as well as to inhibitors targeting other key pathways (for example, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)) activated in leukemia. Similarly, PI3K mutations can result in resistance to inhibitors targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, indicating important interaction points between the pathways (cross-talk). Furthermore, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can be activated by chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in leukemia therapy. This review discusses the mechanisms by which abnormal expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can contribute to drug resistance as well as resistance to targeted leukemia therapy. Controlling the expression of this pathway could improve leukemia therapy and ameliorate human health.

### The raf / MEK / ERK signal transduction cascade as a target for chemotherapeutic intervention in leukemia [^114QrLbX]. Leukemia (2002). Low credibility.

The Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signal transduction cascade is a vital mediator of a number of cellular fates including growth, proliferation and survival, among others. The focus of this review centers on the MAPK signal transduction pathway, its mechanisms of activation, downstream mediators of signaling, and the transcription factors that ultimately alter gene expression. Furthermore, negative regulators of this cascade, including phosphatases, are discussed with an emphasis placed upon chemotherapeutic intervention at various points along the pathway. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that the PI3K/Akt pathway may play a role in the effects elicited via MAPK signaling; as such, potential interactions and their possible cellular ramifications are discussed.

### Inhibitors of BRAF dimers using an allosteric site [^111YssAZ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK signaling pathway (ERK signaling) regulates mammalian cell growth, proliferation, and survival. This pathway is normally activated by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that stimulates binding of GTP to RAS at the plasma membrane. RAF proteins (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF isoforms) are subsequently recruited at the membrane by interaction with the active GTP-bound RAS, where they are activated by dephosphorylation and phosphorylation events and simultaneous dimerization of their RAF kinase domains. Activated RAF proteins subsequently initiate a cascade of phosphorylation and activation steps of downstream kinases MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, which then phosphorylate an array of proteins leading to specific cellular effects.

Aberrant activation of ERK signaling is a hallmark of many cancers most commonly due to mutations of RAS and BRAF. BRAF mutants are found in up to 9% of all human cancers and over 50% of melanoma. While RAF proteins activate ERK signaling as homo and heterodimers in the presence of active RAS, mutant BRAF V600E can activate ERK signaling independent of RAS as an active monomer. Drug development efforts have yielded three FDA-approved RAF inhibitors, Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib, and Encorafenib for BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma. These inhibitors show remarkable clinical efficacy in BRAF V600E melanoma tumors from potent inhibition of the monomeric BRAF V600E protein –. However, drug resistance to these inhibitors is developed resulting in only short-term improvement of patients' survival. Several mechanisms of clinical resistance to RAF inhibitors have been identified, including feedback reactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases and RAS, RAS mutations, BRAF amplification and expression of BRAF V600E splice variants –. These resistance mechanisms commonly lead to reactivation of ERK signaling through dimerization of RAF proteins –. RAF dimers are poorly inhibited by the FDA-approved inhibitors, and therefore have been recognized as an important target for limiting drug resistance but also for more effective inhibition of ERK signaling in various tumors.

### Raf kinases in cancer-roles and therapeutic opportunities [^114PHdif]. Oncogene (2011). Low credibility.

Raf are conserved, ubiquitous serine/protein kinases discovered as the cellular elements hijacked by transforming retroviruses. The three mammalian RAF proteins (A, B and CRAF) can be activated by the human oncogene RAS, downstream from which they exert both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent, tumor-promoting functions. The kinase-dependent functions are mediated chiefly by the MEK/ERK pathway, whose activation is associated with proliferation in a broad range of human tumors. Almost 10 years ago, activating BRAF mutations were discovered in a subset of human tumors, and in the past year treatment with small-molecule RAF inhibitors has yielded unprecedented response rates in melanoma patients. Thus, Raf qualifies as an excellent molecular target for anticancer therapy. This review focuses on the role of BRAF and CRAF in different aspects of carcinogenesis, on the success of molecular therapies targeting Raf and the challenges they present.

### Dual-mechanism ERK1 / 2 inhibitors exploit a distinct binding mode to block phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of ERK1 / 2 [^116xit4z]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The RAS-regulated RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in cancer due to activating mutations of growth factor receptors, RAS or BRAF. Both RAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors are clinically approved and various ERK1/2 inhibitors (ERKi) are currently undergoing clinical trials. To date, ERKi display two distinct mechanisms of action (MoA): catalytic ERKi solely inhibit ERK1/2 catalytic activity, whereas dual mechanism ERKi additionally prevents the activating phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at its T-E-Y motif by MEK1/2. These differences may impart significant differences in biological activity because T-E-Y phosphorylation is the signal for nuclear entry of ERK1/2, allowing them to access many key transcription factor targets. Here, we characterized the MoA of five ERKi and examined their functional consequences in terms of ERK1/2 signaling, gene expression, and antiproliferative efficacy. We demonstrate that catalytic ERKi promote a striking nuclear accumulation of p-ERK1/2 in KRAS-mutant cell lines. In contrast, dual-mechanism ERKi exploits a distinct binding mode to block ERK1/2 phosphorylation by MEK1/2, exhibit superior potency, and prevent the nuclear accumulation of ERK1/2. Consequently, dual-mechanism ERKi exhibit more durable pathway inhibition and enhanced suppression of ERK1/2-dependent gene expression compared with catalytic ERKi, resulting in increased efficacy across BRAF- and RAS-mutant cell lines.

Preclinical Insights to Cardiovascular Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK Signaling

The MAPK pathway is a key regulator of normal cell growth and proliferation. This signaling cascade is initiated by the binding of an extracellular ligand to specific membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases. Following the stimulation and phosphorylation of GFR adaptor protein, Src homology 2 domain containing protein becomes associated with the activated GFR with subsequent recruitment of downstream signaling proteins culminating in activation of Ras, the membrane-bound guanosine diphosphate to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange protein (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Cardiovascular Adverse Effects of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors

The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous cellular activities. Targeting this pathway with rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma B-type (BRAF) and mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) blockade results in control of cell proliferation and disease activity in certain BRAF-mutant cancers. BRAF and MEK inhibitors are associated with adverse cardiovascular effects including left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), hypertension, venous thromboembolism, and atrial arrhythmia. We propose strategies for the surveillance and treatment of these adverse effects. BP = blood pressure; ECG = electrocardiography; Echo = echocardiography; LVSD = left ventricular systolic dysfunction; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide.

GTP-bound Ras interacts with rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinases leading to a cascade of phosphorylation events. Of the 3 RAF serine/threonine kinases (cRAF-1, ARAF, and BRAF), BRAF is the most potent inducer of phosphorylation and activation of MEK1 and MEK2 dual-specificity protein kinases. Activated MEK1/2 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. Activated ERK proteins provoke the phosphorylation and activity of numerous important substrates including GFRs, cytokines, transcription factors, and cell cycle regulator proteins. Accordingly, the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is critically involved in the regulation of key cellular activities including proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and suppression of apoptosis. Consequently, mutations of genes coding for proteins in this pathway may allow these processes to become dysregulated and constitutively activated — a feature common to many cancers.

### Oncogenic ras isoforms signaling specificity at the membrane [^112haRV6]. Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

How do Ras isoforms attain oncogenic specificity at the membrane? Oncogenic KRas, HRas, and NRas (K-Ras, H-Ras, and N-Ras) differentially populate distinct cancers. How they selectively activate effectors and why is KRas4B the most prevalent are highly significant questions. Here, we consider determinants that may bias isoform-specific effector activation and signaling at the membrane. We merge functional data with a conformational view to provide mechanistic insight. Cell-specific expression levels, pathway cross-talk, and distinct interactions are the key, but conformational trends can modulate selectivity. There are two major pathways in oncogenic Ras-driven proliferation: MAPK (Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3Kα/Akt/mTOR. All membrane-anchored, proximally located, oncogenic Ras isoforms can promote Raf dimerization and fully activate MAPK signaling. So why the differential statistics of oncogenic isoforms in distinct cancers and what makes KRas so highly oncogenic? Many cell-specific factors may be at play, including higher KRAS mRNA levels. As a key factor, we suggest that because only KRas4B binds calmodulin, only KRas can fully activate PI3Kα/Akt signaling. We propose that full activation of both MAPK and PI3Kα/Akt proliferative pathways by oncogenic KRas4B-but not by HRas or NRas-may help explain why the KRas4B isoform is especially highly populated in certain cancers. We further discuss pharmacologic implications. Cancer Res; 78(3); 593–602. ©2017 AACR.

### Regulation of H-ras-driven MAPK signaling, transformation and tumorigenesis, but not PI3K signaling and tumor progression, by plasma membrane microdomains [^117Tk8ej]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Ras superfamily comprises over 150 small GTPases, which can bind and hydrolyze guanine triphosphate (GTP). The proto-oncogenic homologs most prominently associated with cancers, H-, N- and K-Ras, are ubiquitously expressed and have overlapping yet non-redundant functions. Ras propagates growth factor signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and survival. Ras proteins cycle between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state. Constitutively active (CA) (that is, GTP-locked) Ras mutations are highly transforming and induce tumor formation, and the combined set of activating Ras mutations altogether are associated with as high as ~30% of human malignancies. However, each isotype displays tissue type specificities in cancers, indicating context-dependent modes of action. Thus, the molecular mechanisms of isotypic Ras oncogenesis are still not completely understood.

Related-Ras 1 (R-Ras) is a highly conserved Ras paralog with limited mitogenic signaling properties. R-Ras functions include cell motility, survival and vascular quiescence, distinct from other Ras paralogs. CA R-Ras weakly transforms select cell lines, and activating mutations are not prominent in human malignancies. However, despite identical effector-binding domains, H- and R-Ras support distinct effector signal outputs, suggesting contributions from other domains in the regulation of Ras-effector interactions and signaling. H- and R-Ras paralogs are most divergent in the termini: a 26 amino-acid N-terminal extension in R-Ras which is absent from H-Ras, and in the C-terminal hypervariable domains (HVR), which harbor membrane targeting domains (tDs) at the C-termini. The R-Ras N-terminal domain regulates R-Ras-dependent cell migration, but has not been associated with mitogenic signaling. Activated H-Ras interacts in cells with Raf kinase and facilitates its activation, which propagates phosphorylation of cytosolic kinases MEK and ERK, driving cell proliferation. R-Ras is capable of binding Raf in vitro; however this interaction either does not occur or is of low affinity in cells, believed to account for the weak transforming function of R-Ras. The mechanism for these distinct behaviors is not understood but may reflect distinct properties based on the HVRs.

### Molecular pathways: the basis for rational combination using MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cancers [^113Udq3p]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Mutations in RAS oncogenes are frequently observed in human cancers, and the mutations result in activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, leading to cell proliferation and survival. The pathway is, therefore, a potent therapeutic target in the RAS-mutant cancers. MEK inhibitors can specifically block the pathway and are one of the key types of drugs for the treatment of the RAS-mutant cancers. As RAS proteins activate other downstream signaling proteins in addition to the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, combination therapeutic approaches with MEK inhibitors are also being evaluated. Moreover, MEK inhibitors can arrest cancer cells in G1 phase and repress prosurvival Bcl2 family proteins such as MCL1 and BCL2/BCLXL, and increase expression of Bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only family protein. This mechanism may explain the efficacy of the combination of MEK inhibitors with cytotoxic agents or other targeted inhibitors. A better understanding of the pathway will help us with development of rational combinations for the treatment of the RAS-mutant cancers.

### Targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway: physiological feedback and drug response [^114ehhyN]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation is a frequent event in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations in the BRAF and RAS oncogenes. Targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development. These agents offer the possibility of greater efficacy and less toxicity than current therapies for tumors driven by oncogenic mutations in the MAPK pathway. Early clinical results with the BRAF-selective inhibitor PLX4032 suggest that this strategy will prove successful in a select group of patients whose tumors are driven by V600E BRAF. Relief of physiologic feedback upon pathway inhibition may, however, attenuate drug response and contribute to the development of acquired resistance. An improved understanding of the adaptive response of cancer cells to MAPK pathway inhibition may thus aid in the identification of those patients most likely to respond to targeted pathway inhibitors and provide a rational basis for tailored combination strategies.

### The pan-RAF-MEK nondegrading molecular glue NST-628 is a potent and brain-penetrant inhibitor of the RAS-MAPK pathway with activity across diverse RAS-and RAF-driven cancers [^11478zkm]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

Alterations in the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade are common across multiple solid tumor types and are a driver for many cancers. NST-628 is a potent pan-RAF-MEK molecular glue that prevents the phosphorylation and activation of MEK by RAF, overcoming the limitations of traditional RAS-MAPK inhibitors and leading to deep durable inhibition of the pathway. Cellular, biochemical, and structural analyses of RAF-MEK complexes show that NST-628 engages all isoforms of RAF and prevents the formation of BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, a differentiated mechanism from all current RAF inhibitors. With a potent and durable inhibition of the RAF-MEK signaling complex as well as high intrinsic permeability into the brain, NST-628 demonstrates broad efficacy in cellular and patient-derived tumor models harboring diverse MAPK pathway alterations, including orthotopic intracranial models. Given its functional and pharmacokinetic mechanisms that are differentiated from previous therapies, NST-628 is positioned to make an impact clinically in areas of unmet patient need. Significance: This study introduces NST-628, a molecular glue having differentiated mechanism and drug-like properties. NST-628 treatment leads to broad efficacy with high tolerability and central nervous system activity across multiple RAS- and RAF-driven tumor models. NST-628 has the potential to provide transformative clinical benefits as both monotherapy and vertical combination anchor.

### Structural insights into the BRAF monomer-to-dimer transition mediated by RAS binding [^1126Au5V]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF/RAF1) are key intermediates in the RAS pathway, functioning in the transmission of signals that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Over the years, biochemical studies have provided critical insights regarding the mechanisms that regulate RAF signal output. In quiescent cells, members of the RAF kinase family localize to the cytosol as inactive monomers, maintained in an autoinhibited state through intramolecular interactions between the RAF regulatory and catalytic domains and by the binding of a 14–3–3 dimer to two phosphorylation-dependent serine sites (pS365 and pS729 in BRAF) –. In response to signaling events and RAS activation, RAF interacts directly with GTP-bound RAS at the plasma membrane –, which ultimately disrupts the autoinhibited state and promotes RAF dimerization and kinase activation –.

### KRAS interaction with RAF1 RAS-binding domain and cysteine-rich domain provides insights into RAS-mediated RAF activation [^114JqSgP]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway regulates diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The interaction of membrane-bound active RAS with RAF is the first step in the activation of this pathway. Active RAS recruits RAF to the membrane where RAF dimerizes and becomes active. The activated RAF kinases then phosphorylate and activate MEK kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK kinases. Finally, activated ERK kinases are translocated into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate multiple substrates, including transcription factors. RAS mutations resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway are the most common mutations in human cancers. Strategies that aim to prevent RAS-mediated RAF activation are being developed to treat RAS-driven cancers.

The RAF family comprises three evolutionarily conserved cytosolic serine/threonine kinases (ARAF, BRAF, and RAF1, also known as CRAF), which share three conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR3(Fig. 1a). The N-terminal CR1 region contains the RAS-binding domain (RBD) and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), the CR2 region contains a 14–3–3 recognition site, whereas the C-terminal CR3 region includes the kinase domain and a second binding site for 14–3–3 proteins. Prior to RAF activation, a 14–3–3 dimer binds to phosphorylated serines present in CR2 and CR3, keeping RAF in an autoinhibited state. A recent cryoEM structure of this state revealed that the CRD interacts with both 14–3–3 and the kinase domain of RAF in a manner that precludes CRD interaction with the membrane.

### A structure is worth a thousand words: new insights for RAS and RAF regulation [^114mVnuT]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The recently determined RAS and RAF structures have significantly advanced our understanding of RAS and RAF regulation; however, outstanding issues still remain, and the new structures themselves pose some additional questions. In particular, it is unclear whether all RAF family members will exhibit a similar autoinhibited conformation as is observed for BRAF, and little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms that determine the formation of RAF homodimers versus heterodimers, in particular, the heterodimeric BRAF–CRAF/RAF1 complexes that predominate in RAS-driven signaling. Moreover, in the context of the plasma membrane and RAS binding, whether regions other than the RAF kinase domain make contacts that modulate the dynamics of dimerization is not known, nor is the extent to which full-length RAF dimers impact the organization of RAS complexes at the membrane.

In addition to providing key regulatory insights, these structures have also provided important new information relevant to therapeutic drug targeting. For example, with mounting structural and biochemical evidence supporting isoform and mutation-specific differences in oncogenic RAS alleles, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a single therapeutic strategy will not work for all RAS-driven cancers. Understanding and exploiting these isoform and mutation-specific differences may reveal distinct vulnerabilities, enabling the development of more refined treatment regimens for specific cancer types. In addition, the autoinhibited RAF structures have also demonstrated the potential feasibility of designing inhibitors that stabilize the inactive "compact configuration" of the RAF kinase domain by engaging not only the ATP-binding site, but also residues in the P-loop and kinase domain C-lobe to mimic ATP binding. Moreover, similar approaches to trap RAF and/or other components within the autoinhibited RAF complexes in an inactive state may prove advantageous, as is predicted for the next-generation allosteric MEK inhibitors described above. Thus, based on these initial structural studies, it is exciting to envision a multidisciplinary approach that combines structural biology with cell-based signaling analyses to spur the development of new compounds and inhibitors to combat aberrant RAS- and RAF-dependent signaling in tumor cells.

### The ERK1 / 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as a master regulator of the G1-to S-phase transition [^1154XAJE]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

The Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation control. In normal cells, sustained activation of ERK1/ERK2 is necessary for G1- to S-phase progression and is associated with induction of positive regulators of the cell cycle and inactivation of antiproliferative genes. In cells expressing activated Ras or Raf mutants, hyperactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway elicits cell cycle arrest by inducing the accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which activated ERK1/ERK2 regulate growth and cell cycle progression of mammalian somatic cells. We also highlight the findings obtained from gene disruption studies.

### Conferring specificity on the ubiquitous raf / MEK signalling pathway [^111z9EVB]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Raf first came to the fore as a retroviral oncogene, v-Raf or v-Mil, which could induce tumours in mice and chickens, respectively. Raf-1, the cognate proto-oncogene, is widely expressed and became the most intensely studied Raf family member. The other two family members, A-Raf and B-Raf, feature a more restricted expression. A-Raf is mainly expressed in urogenital tissues and B-Raf expression is highest in neuronal tissues, testis and haematopoetic cells, although recent experiments suggest that the expression of A-Raf and B-Raf at low levels is much more widely spread (reviewed by).

Interest in Raf proteins surged upon identification of their role as direct effectors of Ras. Ras has suffered oncogenic mutations in nearly 30% of all human cancers. All the three Raf family members share the biochemical properties of binding to Ras and to phosphorylate and activate MEK (reviewed by;). Currently, MEK is the only generally acknowledged substrate of Raf kinases. MEK phosphorylates and activates ERK. While Raf and MEK appear restricted to only one class of substrates, ERK musters more than 70 substrates including nuclear transcription factors. This led to the perception of a linear pathway where Ras funnels a great variety of extracellular cues into a three-tiered kinase module, Raf-MEK-ERK, which relies on ERK to dispense the signal to various substrates. An obvious problem with this view is how to rationalise that this pathway controls many and diverse fundamental cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, transformation and apoptosis.

The specificity of biological responses can be encoded in a number of ways. Specificity can be achieved by compartmentalisation, where the accessibility to upstream activators and downstream substrates is regulated by subcellular localisation. The response can also depend on the cellular context, such as the expression of other proteins and activity of other pathways. This requires points of crosstalk where these contextual signals are integrated. In such a scenario, the exact kinetics and duration of ERK signalling will play a major role. Such fine tuning can be adjusted by the differential response of upstream activators to external cues. There may also be yet unrecognised branchpoints that distribute signals into other downstream pathways. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and recent discoveries support all of these possibilities. In this review, we will briefly discuss this evidence.

### Conferring specificity on the ubiquitous raf / MEK signalling pathway [^111D9C2D]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway controls fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival. It remains enigmatic how this pathway can reliably convert a myriad of extracellular stimuli in specific biological responses. Recent results have shown that the Raf family isoforms A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1 have different physiological functions. Here we review how Raf isozyme diversity contributes to the specification of functional diversity, in particular regarding the role of Raf isozymes in cancer.

### Facts and hopes on RAS inhibitors and cancer immunotherapy [^111uJTKe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Subsequent efforts have involved targeting RAS effector proteins, which have been shown using elegant genetic mouse models to be required for the maintenance of RAS-mutant cancer. A plethora of inhibitors have been successfully developed targeting numerous RAS effector proteins, primarily kinases within the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Such drugs often have potent therapeutic activity in preclinical models; however, they have since been shown to have limited activity in clinical trials. This has been attributed to the extensive signaling redundancy that exists in the RAS signaling pathway, multiple feedback mechanisms which causes pathway reactivation, and also narrow therapeutic window as the pathways are required in normal tissue. Combinations of therapies designed to address pathway redundancy and feedback mechanisms have been seriously hampered by high toxicities observed in clinical trials.

RAF ISOFORM REGULATION AND FUNCTION

All the three Raf isoforms contain a Ras-binding site (RBD) in the regulatory domain at the N-terminus, and can consequently be activated by Ras GTPases. The RBD selectively binds to activated GTP-loaded Ras, but the effects are different. Ras binding does not activate Raf-1 directly, but seems to serve to translocate Raf-1 from the cytosol to the membrane, where subsequent activation events occur. These comprise a complex series of events starting with the dephosphorylation of S259, which allows phosphorylation of S338 and possibly Y341 as well as two sites in the activation loop. These modifications work together not only to determine the quantity of the signalling output, but also maybe even the quality. Raf-1 S259 mutant can activate ERK to a similar extent as the v-Raf oncogene, yet fails to transform the cells, suggesting that the quality of the downstream signal is different depending on the upstream mode of activation. Rather little is known about the regulation of A-Raf, but it seems to be regulated in a similar way as Raf-1 yet binds to Ras more weakly and also is a weaker MEK kinase.

### Mechanistic and clinical overview cardiovascular toxicity of BRAF and MEK Inhibitors: state-of-the-art review [^1168wcdP]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Members of the MAPK family have cardioprotective effects, largely considered to be caused by antagonistic effects on apoptotic regulatory pathways. In vivo studies assessing loss of cardiac cRAF-1 activity revealed greater apoptosis in the resting state as well as in response to pressure overload in comparison with wild-type animals. The MEK1-ERK2 signaling pathway is required for the protection of the myocardium following ischemic injury in vivo and heterozygote ERK2 gene–targeted mice have greater myocardial injury following ischemia-reperfusion injury induced via ligation of left anterior descending artery than wild-type mice. Although the role of ERK pathway activation in cardioprotection has been studied extensively, the precise mechanism by which it evokes this effect is less well understood and is likely to involve multiple processes. This may include interleukin-10 activation of ERK1/2 to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α–induced apoptosis, and the suppression of gap junction permeability as a result of mitochondrial potassium-sensitive adenosine triphosphate channel opening in ischemic myocardium.

Vascular Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling

The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway plays a protective role in the vasculature through interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In cultured endothelial cells, phosphorylation of VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor 2 activates phospholipase C with consequent activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. This results in increased endothelial cell proliferation. Activation of ERK1/2 by phospholipase C also activates endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase and stimulates release of prostacyclin mediated by protein kinase C. This results in vasodilation in endothelial cells and has antiproliferative effects in smooth muscle cells. The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is also involved in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, via interaction with fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factors.

Key Points

- The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is a key regulator of normal cell growth and proliferation.
- The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway plays a key role in myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac remodeling, and myocardial cell death.
- The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway interacts with VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factors to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the vasculature.

The MAPK Pathway

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a critical pathway for human cancer cell survival, dissemination, and resistance to drug therapy. One of the most studied MAPK pathways is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK is a subgroup of MAPKs that is activated by external factors such as growth factors and mitogens. The MAPK/ERK pathway is activated by upstream genomic events and/or activation of multiple signaling events where information coalesces at this important nodal pathway point. This pathway is tightly regulated under normal conditions by phosphatases and bidirectional communication with other pathways, such as the AKT/mTOR pathway. Ligand-mediated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) initiate the cascade of ERK signaling that flows through RAS GTPase, which acts as a molecular on/off switch. Once RAS, a family of various oncogenes such as KRAS, NRAS and HRAS, is turned on it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factor and other receptor signals, including RAF and PI3K. RAF activation is achieved through a complex process that requires lipid and protein binding, conformational changes, and regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. There are three RAF proteins in mammals, including BRAF, and they can all activate MAP kinase kinase (MEK) just upstream of ERK. The downstream MAPK/ERK signaling node, predominantly activated by upstream SRC/RAS/RAF signaling, is also regulated by modulation through parallel pathways. Several mutations involving the MAPK/ERK pathway have been identified, occurring upstream in membrane receptor genes (EGFR), in signal transducers (RAS), and in downstream kinases belonging to the MAPK/ERK pathway itself (BRAF) in human cancers and are ripe for targeting. Currently approved for the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanoma with somatic point mutation in the BRAF gene resulting in constitutive activation of BRAF (V600E) kinase, inhibitors of B-RAF kinase are being studied alone (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) and in combination with inhibitors of MEK (cobimetinib) and other pathways to optimize treatment of many tumor types. This therapeutic is well tolerated with the most common adverse effects including skin reactions, photosensitivity, headache and arthralgia, although an increased risk of development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has also been observed. Inhibitor of MEK in monotherapy (Trametinib) was also shown to be effective for the treatment of patients with un-resectable or metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF V 600E/K mutations. However, therapies targeted toward MAPK/ERK components have variable response rates when used in different solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer. Understanding the differential nature of activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in each tumor type is critical in developing single and combination regimens. Several studies have evaluated development of new tracers to specifically target the altered pathways. Also, standard FDG PET still has its role for therapy evaluation or prediction of response.

### Mutant-selective degradation by BRAF-targeting PROTACs [^11386buJ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is important for many aspects of cellular homeostasis. The pathway is initiated upon extracellular growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), thereby activating the kinase cascade. Upon activation of upstream effectors, GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (ARAF, BRAF, or CRAF) to the cell membrane, promoting its dimerization and activation. Thus, the scaffolding and enzymatic role of BRAF are both essential for its function –. Activated RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. BRAF is mutated in 8% of observed cancers including melanoma (60%), colorectal cancer (10%), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (10%), and hairy cell leukemia (100%). These mutations (often missense mutations found in the kinase domain) distinctly affect the biochemical characteristics of the kinase –. Class 1 BRAF mutants such as V600E and V600K are hyper-activating and can signal as monomers in the absence of activated RAS. Class 2 BRAF mutants such as K601E and G469A signal as constitutive, RAS- independent dimers. Lastly, Class 3 BRAF mutants such as G466V and D594N harbor low to no kinase activity and function by binding tightly to RAS thus recruiting CRAF into hyperactivated heterodimers –. FDA-approved inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been successful in increasing progression-free survival of patients harboring hyperactive BRAF V600E mutations. However, as with many kinase inhibitors, resistance occurs that renders patients insensitive to continued treatment. Significant efforts have focused on creating drugs that target Class 2 BRAF mutations by inhibiting dimer formation, but adequate drugs have not yet been approved. Therefore, there is a need for new and innovative therapies to address BRAF-driven cancers.

### RAF inhibitors promote RAS-RAF interaction by allosterically disrupting RAF autoinhibition [^117MUndZ]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RAS−ERK signaling is generally initiated at the plasma membrane where ligand-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) transduce signals to RAS GTPases by stimulating their GTP loading. Downstream of RAS, mammalian cells express three RAF paralogs (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF) that share a conserved C-terminal kinase domain (KD). They also comprise an N-terminal regulatory region (NTR) consisting of a RAS-binding domain (RBD), a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and a Ser/Thr-rich region. The mammalian RAF family also comprises two KSR isoforms that share significant sequence identity with RAF proteins in their C-terminal kinase domain and present a related NTR organization with the exception that they contain a signature domain, called the coiled coil-sterile α motif (CC-SAM) domain, and lack an RBD domain. In unstimulated cells, RAF proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm as monomers in an autoinhibited state through an intramolecular interaction between their NTR and kinase domain (referred to hereafter as the RAF OFF-state). Upon RTK activation, GTP-bound RAS binds to the RAF RBD, which is thought to release the NTR−KD interaction –. This event is accompanied by dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites and phosphorylation of activating residues that respectively contribute to membrane anchoring and kinase domain activation. Concomitantly, RAF proteins undergo kinase domain side-to-side dimerization. This step allosterically drives catalytic switching to the ON-state and is essential for kinase domain activation. Here we refer to the ON-state as dimeric full-length RAF in which NTR autoinhibition has been relieved. Activated RAF proteins convey signals by initiating a phosphorylation cascade from RAF to MEK and MEK to ERK, which culminates in the phosphorylation of an array of substrates eliciting cell-specific responses.

### Signal transduction mediated by the ras / raf / MEK / ERK pathway from cytokine receptors to transcription factors: potential targeting for therapeutic intervention [^117MDfz1]. Leukemia (2003). Low credibility.

The Ras/Raf/Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade couples signals from cell surface receptors to transcription factors, which regulate gene expression. Depending upon the stimulus and cell type, this pathway can transmit signals, which result in the prevention or induction of apoptosis or cell cycle progression. Thus, it is an appropriate pathway to target for therapeutic intervention. This pathway becomes more complex daily, as there are multiple members of the kinase and transcription factor families, which can be activated or inactivated by protein phosphorylation. The diversity of signals transduced by this pathway is increased, as different family members heterodimerize to transmit different signals. Furthermore, additional signal transduction pathways interact with the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to regulate positively or negatively its activity, or to alter the phosphorylation status of downstream targets. Abnormal activation of this pathway occurs in leukemia because of mutations at Ras as well as genes in other pathways (eg PI3K, PTEN, Akt), which serve to regulate its activity. Dysregulation of this pathway can result in autocrine transformation of hematopoietic cells since cytokine genes such as interleukin-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor contain the transacting binding sites for the transcription factors regulated by this pathway. Inhibitors of Ras, Raf, MEK and some downstream targets have been developed and many are currently in clinical trials. This review will summarize our current understanding of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway and the downstream transcription factors. The prospects of targeting this pathway for therapeutic intervention in leukemia and other cancers will be evaluated.

### MAP kinase signalling pathways in cancer [^114KNbHS]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

Cancer can be perceived as a disease of communication between and within cells. The aberrations are pleiotropic, but mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways feature prominently. Here, we discuss recent findings and hypotheses on the role of MAPK pathways in cancer. Cancerous mutations in MAPK pathways are frequently mostly affecting Ras and B-Raf in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Stress-activated pathways, such as Jun N-terminal kinase and p38, largely seem to counteract malignant transformation. The balance and integration between these signals may widely vary in different tumours, but are important for the outcome and the sensitivity to drug therapy.

### RAF inhibitors that evade paradoxical MAPK pathway activation [^111JqSAo]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Oncogenic activation of BRAF fuels cancer growth by constitutively promoting RAS-independent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signalling. Accordingly, RAF inhibitors have brought substantially improved personalized treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, these targeted agents have also revealed an unexpected consequence: stimulated growth of certain cancers. Structurally diverse ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors can either inhibit or paradoxically activate the MAPK pathway, depending whether activation is by BRAF mutation or by an upstream event, such as RAS mutation or receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Here we have identified next-generation RAF inhibitors (dubbed 'paradox breakers') that suppress mutant BRAF cells without activating the MAPK pathway in cells bearing upstream activation. In cells that express the same HRAS mutation prevalent in squamous tumours from patients treated with RAF inhibitors, the first-generation RAF inhibitor vemurafenib stimulated in vitro and in vivo growth and induced expression of MAPK pathway response genes; by contrast the paradox breakers PLX7904 and PLX8394 had no effect. Paradox breakers also overcame several known mechanisms of resistance to first-generation RAF inhibitors. Dissociating MAPK pathway inhibition from paradoxical activation might yield both improved safety and more durable efficacy than first-generation RAF inhibitors, a concept currently undergoing human clinical evaluation with PLX8394.

### Mechanism and consequences of RAF kinase activation by small-molecule inhibitors [^117Muyky]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

RAS dependence

Although inactivating BRAF mutations are observed in some human cancers, they appear to be relatively weak oncogenes, and are somewhat rare. Inducible expression of either KRAS G12D or the kinase dead BRAF D594A oncogene in mouse skin were both insufficient to cause melanocytic tumours alone, yet co-occurrence of both mutations caused rapid cutaneous tumorigenesis. Similarly, RAF inhibitors cause fairly modest MAPK pathway activation in KRAS wild-type cells, but marked MEK phosphorylation and increased proliferation in KRAS-mutated cells in a KRAS-dependent manner. RAF inhibitors also cause membrane localisation of CRAF, where it engages RAS-GTP and becomes phosphorylated at S338, events associated with activation. However, interaction with RAS-GTP may not be the only mechanism involved in the RAF paradox. Expression of a truncated form of CRAF, which lacks the RAS-binding domain is sufficient for RAF inhibitor-induced MAPK activity in cells and in a cell-free system, suggesting that although RAS-GTP may enhance the ability of RAF inhibitors to activate full-length RAF in cells, there is also a RAS-independent mechanism that is intrinsic to the RAF kinase domain.

The double-life of ERKp in human cancer and the curious case of the ERK proteins

The ERK pathway is one of the extensively studied signal transduction cascades. Essential effectors of this signaling cascade in humans fall into three types of eukaryotic protein kinases: (1) HER family Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs, EGFR, HER2–4), RAF family serine/threonine kinases (A/B/CRAF), and (3) dual specificity protein kinase families MEK (MEK1/2) and ERK (ERK1/2) –. In humans, the RAS family, consisting of three essential members, H/N/KRAS, serve as the principal non-kinase effectors within the ERK pathway.

Feedback loops regulate ERK signaling during development and in normal physiologic conditions for cell proliferation, survival, and homeostasis –.

### PAK1 primes MEK1 for phosphorylation by raf-1 kinase during cross-cascade activation of the ERK pathway [^112JTDuc]. Oncogene (2002). Low credibility.

The serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 acts downstream of Ras in the MAPK pathway leading to ERK activation in response to mitogens. Raf-1 has oncogenic potential, but is normally controlled by a complex interplay of inhibitory and activating mechanisms. Although Raf-1 is phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, mitogens cause its membrane recruitment by Ras and subsequent phosphorylation on additional sites. Some of these events modulate Raf-1 kinase activity while others determine interactions with other proteins. These changes regulate the ability of Raf-1 to phosphorylate its downstream targets MEK1 and MEK2. Rho family small G proteins act synergistically with Raf-1 to stimulate the ERK pathway by a cross-cascade mechanism that enhances MEK phosphorylation by Raf-1. Here we show that both Raf-1 and MEK1 are phosphorylated by PAK1 and that mutations at PAK1 phosphorylation sites in either protein prevent cross-cascade activation. In contrast, MEK1 activation by constitutively-active Raf-1 is refractory to mutations at PAK1 phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of MEK1 on serine 298 does not appear to regulate the interaction between Raf-1 and MEK1, but rather the ability of Raf-1 to phosphorylate MEK1 with which it is complexed in vivo. Our findings indicate that PAK1 primes MEK1 for activation by Raf-1 and imply another level of regulation in the ERK cascade.

### Oncogenic B-raf mutations: crystal clear at last [^1156VzBb]. Cancer Cell (2004). Low credibility.

The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a conserved signaling module controlling cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Constitutive activation of this pathway is involved in malignant transformation by several oncogenes, most notably, Ras. The recent discovery by Davies et al. of somatic mutations in the B-RAF gene in human tumors has generated enormous interest in how Raf kinases are regulated and how mutations in B-RAF lead to transformation. A recent study in Cell by Wan et al. reports the crystal structure of the B-Raf kinase domain, providing important new insights into these questions.

### Ras regulates assembly of mitogenic signalling complexes through the effector protein IMP [^11119JEn]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

The signal transduction cascade comprising Raf, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) and MAP kinase is a Ras effector pathway that mediates diverse cellular responses to environmental cues and contributes to Ras-dependent oncogenic transformation. Here we report that the Ras effector protein Impedes Mitogenic signal Propagation (IMP) modulates sensitivity of the MAP kinase cascade to stimulus-dependent activation by limiting functional assembly of the core enzymatic components through the inactivation of KSR, a scaffold/adaptor protein that couples activated Raf to its substrate MEK. IMP is a Ras-responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase that, on activation of Ras, is modified by auto-polyubiquitination, which releases the inhibition of Raf-MEK complex formation. Thus, Ras activates the MAP kinase cascade through simultaneous dual effector interactions: induction of Raf kinase activity and derepression of Raf-MEK complex formation. IMP depletion results in increased stimulus-dependent MEK activation without alterations in the timing or duration of the response. These observations suggest that IMP functions as a threshold modulator, controlling sensitivity of the cascade to stimulus and providing a mechanism to allow adaptive behaviour of the cascade in chronic or complex signalling environments.

### The pan-RAF-MEK nondegrading molecular glue NST-628 is a potent and brain-penetrant inhibitor of the RAS-MAPK pathway with activity across diverse RAS-and RAF-driven cancers [^116zUCLM]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

Highly potent and selective ATP noncompetitive inhibitors of MEK1/2 and monomer selective (type I RAF) inhibitors of BRAF with potency in BRAF V600X (BRAF class I mutants) are some of the best clinically characterized inhibitors of the RAS–MAPK pathway. MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib, are limited clinically due to adverse side effects requiring dose reductions or disruptions and, despite efficacy in BRAF class I mutant cancers, are limited in efficacy in other mutational backgrounds. Even in patients with clinical response to MEK inhibitors, the durability of response remains a hurdle due to multiple mechanisms of resistance to therapy often converging on reactivation of signaling through the RAS–MAPK pathway. One of the best characterized mechanisms of resistance to both MEK inhibitors and type I RAF inhibitors is CRAF-mediated bypass due to loss of negative feedback on the RAF node or activation of RTKs upstream leading to the formation of BRAF–CRAF heterodimers to maintain signaling through the RAS–MAPK pathway. Type II RAF inhibitors, which selectively target BRAF–CRAF heterodimers, and the "paradox breaker" plixorafenib, which disrupts the formation of BRAF dimers, both were developed in an attempt to target CRAF-mediated bypass to other classes of RAF and MEK inhibitors, whereas sparing ARAF activity. However, the type II RAF inhibitors naporafenib and belvarafenib are limited by ARAF-mediated bypass, and response to single-agent inhibitors has been a disappointment clinically.

Successful targeting approaches to the RAS–MAPK pathway have been limited to single agents, and vertical combination strategies targeting multiple nodes of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK cascade are currently under investigation. Type I RAF and MEK inhibitor combinations have been successful clinically in BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma and have more limited efficacy in other BRAF V600 -mutant tumors, such as colorectal cancer, where triplet therapy with the addition of EGFR monoclonal antibodies deepens therapeutic response. Type II RAF inhibitor combinations are also under clinical evaluation in NRAS -mutant cancers; however, their promise is limited by tolerability to the treatment regimens. Recent advances in targeting KRAS G12C -mutant cancers have also been limited by the rapid onset of therapeutic resistance clinically, with proposed vertical combination strategies under evaluation as a mitigation strategy for resistance mechanisms converging on reactivation of the RAS–MAPK pathway.

### Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ERK1 / 2 pathway inhibitors [^115GJNuA]. Oncogene (2013). Low credibility.

The ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2) pathway, comprising the protein kinases RAF (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1), MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase or ERK kinase 1 and 2) and ERK1/2 is frequently de-regulated in human cancers, due to mutations in RAS or BRAF (v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog B1). New, highly selective inhibitors of BRAF and MEK1/2 have shown promise in clinical trials, including in previously intractable diseases such as melanoma. However, drug-resistant tumour cells invariably emerge leading to disease progression. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying such acquired resistance since this may lead to the development of rational strategies either to delay its onset or to overcome it once established. It also offers unique insights into the plasticity of signalling pathways, which may in turn inform our understanding of the basic biology of these pathways and lead to the validation of new drug targets. Several recent reports have identified diverse mechanisms of acquired resistance to MEK1/2 or BRAF inhibitors. In this article, we review these studies, discuss the different mechanisms, identify common themes and consider their therapeutic implications.

### Stamping out RAF and MEK1 / 2 to inhibit the ERK1 / 2 pathway: an emerging threat to anticancer therapy [^112Lsyg1]. Oncogene (2016). Low credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is a key signal transduction pathway in the cells. Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for > 25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

### The pan-RAF-MEK nondegrading molecular glue NST-628 is a potent and brain-penetrant inhibitor of the RAS-MAPK pathway with activity across diverse RAS-and RAF-driven cancers [^114JqeeM]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

Beyond demonstrated efficacy in NRAS -mutant cancer models, NST-628 was broadly efficacious in RAS- and RAF-driven cancer models across diverse tumor types, including melanoma, lung, and pancreatic histologies. Mechanistically, NST-628 inhibits multiple BRAF mutants, including BRAF class II/III mutations that sit at the interface between BRAF and MEK, while not driving the formation of RAF heterodimers, rather inhibiting A/B/CRAF–MEK complexes in an inactive conformation. The differentiated mechanism compared with the type II RAF inhibitors, which drive heterodimer formation, more effectively inhibits CRAF-mediated bypass signaling, especially in BRAF class II/III mutant models. Direct CRAF inhibition in the absence of targeting other RAF isoforms leads to paradoxical activation of RAS–MAPK signaling, emphasizing the importance of targeting all RAF isoforms therapeutically rather than targeting CRAF alone. Given its best-in-class PK profile, consisting of optimized half-life, volume of distribution, and blood–brain barrier penetrance, NST-628 also overcomes the limitations of MEK inhibitors such as trametinib and the RAF–MEK inhibitor avutometinib that have had toxicities requiring dose reductions and intermittent dosing schedule clinically while expanding the impact on the underserved patient population with RAS-driven CNS malignancies.

With emerging therapeutic strategies directly targeting RAS mutations and diverse, yet convergent mechanisms of resistance involving the RAS–MAPK pathway, NST-628 is positioned to become an ideal combination partner for KRAS inhibitors by effectively inhibiting a convergent signaling node. NST-628 effectively combines with the KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib in an NSCLC tumor model that is refractory to KRAS G12C -directed monotherapy and is effective as a single agent in other KRAS -mutant cancers. Our study also showed RTK modulation, parallel PI3K–AKT involvement, and upregulation of tumor-intrinsic immune pathways in short-term adaptive responses and/or resistance to NST-628. These findings identify new strategies for potentially efficacious inhibitor combinations in future preclinical and clinical investigation of NST-628. Collectively, this study shows that with a differentiated mechanism, a balanced metabolic profile, and a potent and tolerable antitumor activity, the nondegrading pan-RAF–MEK glue NST-628 provides a promising therapeutic impact for patients with RAS- and RAF-driven tumors. NST-628 is entering first-in-human clinical trials for the monotherapy treatment of solid tumors with RAS - or RAF mutations.

### Genomics of hairy cell leukemia [^113TyndA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

THE BRAF-V600E MUTATION AND HCL PATHOGENESIS

BRAF is a serine-threonine kinase of the RAF family (also comprising RAF1/CRAF and ARAF) and a key component of the RAS–RAF–MEK-ERK signaling pathway(Fig 1, top left and middle left). This cascade transduces within the cell survival and proliferation signals coming in a controlled way from surface receptors (including receptor tyrosine kinases) only when engaged by their cognate ligands. Ligand-stimulated receptors cause activation of membrane RAS, which recruits cytosolic RAFs to the plasma membrane. This in turn favors phosphorylation of RAFs in their activation segment and RAF dimerization. Active RAFs then phosphorylate and activate MEK1 and MEK2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2 kinases. ERKs disseminate the signal within the cell by phosphorylating in the cytoplasm and nucleus hundreds of targets, including various transcription factors, that elicit the pathway response. However, ERKs also phosphorylates RAFs themselves at specific inhibitory amino acid residues, which releases RAFs from RAS and extinguishes the signal via a negative feedback mechanism. In this way, ERK-dependent phosphorylation can direct in a controlled way a wide range of cellular responses, among which growth, proliferation, and survival are key in cancer pathogenesis when they become deregulated.

### Trametinib (Mekinist) [^116YusRM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Trametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors in vitro and in vivo.

Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone.

In the setting of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, induction of EGFR-mediated MAPK pathway re-activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [see Indications and Usage (1.7)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Administration of MEKINIST tablets 1 mg and 2 mg to patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma resulted in dose-dependent changes in tumor biomarkers, including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK, inhibition of Ki67 (a marker of cell proliferation), and increases in p27 (a marker of apoptosis).

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a dedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on Day 1 and MEKINIST tablets 2 mg once daily on Days 2–14 followed by MEKINIST tablets 3 mg on Day 15. No large changes in the mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) were detected in the study.

A decrease from baseline in HR by 9 beats/min (90% CI: -11.4 to -6.1) and an increase from baseline in PR by 20 ms (90% CI: 13.0 to 27.4) relative to placebo was observed at two hours post-dose in the same study.

In clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib, QTc prolongation > 500 ms occurred in 0.8% of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in 3.8% of patients.

### Condensates as a culprit in RAS activation and inhibitor resistance [^113bWBRs]. Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Therapy resistance is a significant cause of death in patients treated with targeted cancer therapy in diverse oncogene-driven cancers. A better understanding of resistance mechanisms can lay the foundation for improving existing and developing new therapies. A recent elegant study published in Nature Chemical Biology sheds light on a new resistance mechanism. The authors define a novel role for ARAF, a member of the RAF protein family (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF), that is distinct from its previously understood role as a RAS effector and MEK protein kinase in the MAPK pathway. They describe how ARAF sequesters active RAS at the plasma membrane in phase-separated condensates to sustain signaling and prevent inactivation by the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin 1. This study underscores emerging roles for biomolecular condensates in cancer and highlights important implications for disrupting protein condensates to address treatment resistance to RAS (and RAS pathway)-targeted therapies. The study also illuminates evolutionary functional distinction between the RAF proteins and indicates unique biology for ARAF in normal physiology and disease.

### Mechanism and consequences of RAF kinase activation by small-molecule inhibitors [^1116vbsf]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

RAF inhibitors have made a significant impact on the lives of melanoma patients whose tumours express the BRAF V600E oncogene. As with most other cancer therapeutics, efficacy is associated with side effects and in the case of RAF inhibitors, induction of secondary malignancies is a significant concern. However, it appears that the vast majority of cases with the risk to the patient is relatively low, although the clinical experience with these agents is still very early. The pharmacological behaviour of these inhibitors may not have been anticipated but the observations and follow-up mechanistic studies have led to a deeper understanding of RAF–MEK–ERK signalling. These insights will guide future drug development efforts to create better inhibitors that may be optimised towards a tailored pharmacological profile.

### Endothelin-1, but not ANG II, activates MAP kinases through C-src independent ras-raf dependent pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells [^113cyLJV]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and angiotensin II (Ang II) activate common signaling pathways to promote changes in vascular reactivity, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Here we sought to determine whether upstream regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are differentially regulated by ET-1 and Ang II focusing on the role of c-Src and the small GTPase Ras.

Methods and Results

Mesenteric vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from mice with different disruption levels in the c-Src gene (c-Src(±) and c-Src(-/-)) and wild-type (c-Src(+/+)) were used. ET-1 and Ang II induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38MAPK phosphorylation in c-Src(+/+) VSMCs. In VSMCs from c-Src(±) and c-Src(-/-), Ang II effects were blunted, whereas c-Src deficiency had no effect in ET-1-induced MAPK activation. Ang II but not ET-1 induced c-Src phosphorylation in c-Src(+/+) VSMCs. Activation of c-Raf, an effector of Ras, was significantly increased by ET-1 and Ang II in c-Src(+/+) VSMCs. Ang II but not ET-1-mediated c-Raf phosphorylation was inhibited by c-Src deficiency. Knockdown of Ras by siRNA inhibited both ET-1 and Ang II-induced MAPK phosphorylation.

Conclusions

Our data indicate differential regulation of MAPKs by distinct G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas Ang II has an obligatory need for c-Src, ET-1 mediates its actions through a c-Src-independent Ras-Raf-dependent pathway for MAPK activation. These findings suggest that Ang II and ET-1 can activate similar signaling pathways through unrelated mechanisms. MAP kinases are an important point of convergence for Ang II and ET-1.

### BRAF mutation predicts sensitivity to MEK inhibition [^114LiUuv]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

The kinase pathway comprising RAS, RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is activated in most human tumours, often through gain-of-function mutations of RAS and RAF family members. Using small-molecule inhibitors of MEK and an integrated genetic and pharmacologic analysis, we find that mutation of BRAF is associated with enhanced and selective sensitivity to MEK inhibition when compared to either 'wild-type' cells or cells harbouring a RAS mutation. This MEK dependency was observed in BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage, and correlated with both downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and the induction of G1 arrest. Pharmacological MEK inhibition completely abrogated tumour growth in BRAF mutant xenografts, whereas RAS mutant tumours were only partially inhibited. These data suggest an exquisite dependency on MEK activity in BRAF mutant tumours, and offer a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype.

### PI3K pathway activation mediates resistance to MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant cancers [^116RVKp5]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

The RAS pathway is one of the most frequently deregulated pathways in cancer. RAS signals through multiple effector pathways, including the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling cascades. The oncogenic potential of these effector pathways is illustrated by the frequent occurrence of activating mutations in BRAF and PIK3CA as well as loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K. Previous studies have found that whereas BRAF mutant cancers are highly sensitive to MEK inhibition, RAS mutant cancers exhibit a more variable response. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneous response remain unclear. In this study, we show that PI3K pathway activation strongly influences the sensitivity of RAS mutant cells to MEK inhibitors. Activating mutations in PIK3CA reduce the sensitivity to MEK inhibition, whereas PTEN mutations seem to cause complete resistance. We further show that down-regulation of PIK3CA resensitizes cells with co-occurring KRAS and PIK3CA mutations to MEK inhibition. At the molecular level, the dual inhibition of both pathways seems to be required for complete inhibition of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin effector pathway and results in the induction of cell death. Finally, we show that whereas inactivation of either the MEK or PI3K pathway leads to partial tumor growth inhibition, targeted inhibition of both pathways is required to achieve tumor stasis. Our study provides molecular insights that help explain the heterogeneous response of KRAS mutant cancers to MEK pathway inhibition and presents a strong rationale for the clinical testing of combination MEK and PI3K targeted therapies.

### BRAFV600E: implications for carcinogenesis and molecular therapy [^116YYqNC]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is frequently mutated in human cancer. This pathway consists of a small GTP protein of the RAS family that is activated in response to extracellular signaling to recruit a member of the RAF kinase family to the cell membrane. Active RAF signals through MAP/ERK kinase to activate ERK and its downstream effectors to regulate a wide range of biological activities including cell differentiation, proliferation, senescence, and survival. Mutations in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogenes homolog B1 (BRAF) isoform of the RAF kinase or KRAS isoform of the RAS protein are found as activating mutations in approximately 30% of all human cancers. The BRAF pathway has become a target of interest for molecular therapy, with promising results emerging from clinical trials. Here, the role of the most common BRAF mutation BRAF(V600E) in human carcinogenesis is investigated through a review of the literature, with specific focus on its role in melanoma, colorectal, and thyroid cancers and its potential as a therapeutic target.

### MAP kinase signaling and inhibition in melanoma [^116W2CUv]. Oncogene (2013). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is critical to oncogenic signaling in the majority of patients with malignant melanoma. Driver mutations in both NRAS and BRAF have important implications for prognosis and treatment. The development of inhibitors to mediators of the MAPK pathway, including those to CRAF, BRAF, and MEK, has led to major advances in the treatment of patients with melanoma. In particular, the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has been shown to improve overall survival in patients with tumors harboring BRAF mutations. However, the duration of benefit is limited in many patients and highlights the need for understanding the limitations of therapy in order to devise more effective strategies. MEK inhibitors have proven to particularly active in BRAF mutant melanomas also. Emerging knowledge about mechanisms of resistance as well as a more complete understanding of the biology of MAPK pathway signaling provides insight into rational combination regimens and sequences of molecularly targeted therapies.

### Mechanism of the mitogenic influence of hyperinsulinemia [^114ykhHR]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Let us now briefly review the molecular mechanisms by which insulin and hyperinsulinemia, particularly when it occurs in the setting of insulin resistance, can augment proliferative events. In order for all growth factors to stimulate mitogenesis, they must activate the Ras-Raf-Map kinase signalling pathway (Figure 1). Ras proteins are activated by binding guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a process promoted by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos. This activation can occur only if Ras proteins are anchored at the plasma membrane (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Insulin potentiates cellular mitogenic responsiveness to growth factors (GFs). GFs (including insulin) interact with their cognate growth factor receptors (GFR) and activate the Sos-Ras-Raf-Map kinase branch of cellular signalling, thus promoting mitogenesis. Initially, GFs stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Sos) that activates Ras proteins by GTP loading. Sos promotes exchange of GTP for GDP only if Ras is anchored at the plasma membrane. Translocation of Ras protein to the plasma membrane is facilitated by farnesylation of Ras, an attachment of a farnesyl moiety to cysteine residue of Ras under the influence of farnesyltransferase (FTase). Insulin via interaction with its specific cell surface receptor (IR) phosphorylates and activates FTase that increases farnesylation of Ras. Hyperinsulinemia, particularly in the presence of insulin resistance, stimulates FTase and augments the amount of farnesylated Ras available for GTP loading in response to other growth factors. Greater activation of Ras leads to increased mitogenic responsiveness of cells and tissues and enhanced mitogenesis and subsequent pathophysiologic events.

### Binimetinib (Mektovi) [^1161GKUK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Binimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activity. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In vitro, binimetinib inhibited extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in cell-free assays as well as viability and MEK-dependent phosphorylation of BRAF-mutant human melanoma cell lines. Binimetinib also inhibited in vivo ERK phosphorylation and tumor growth in BRAF-mutant murine xenograft models.

Binimetinib and encorafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. Additionally, the combination of binimetinib and encorafenib delayed the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared to either drug alone. In a BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC patient-derived xenograft model in mice, coadministration of encorafenib and binimetinib resulted in greater anti-tumor activity compared to binimetinib alone, with respect to tumor growth inhibition. Increased tumor growth delay after dosing cessation was also observed with the coadministration compared to either drug alone.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Following MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily, no clinically meaningful QT prolongation was observed.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of binimetinib was studied in healthy subjects and patients with solid tumors. After twice-daily dosing, the accumulation is 1.5-fold and the coefficient of variation (CV%) of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is < 40% at steady state. The systemic exposure of binimetinib is approximately dose proportional.

Absorption

After oral administration, at least 50% of the binimetinib dose was absorbed with a median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of 1.6 hours.

Effect of Food

The administration of a single dose of MEKTOVI 45 mg with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (consisting of approximately 150 calories from protein, 350 calories from carbohydrate, and 500 calories from fat) in healthy subjects had no effect on binimetinib exposure.

### KRASPreferentially signals through MAPK in a RAF dimer-dependent manner in non-small cell lung cancer [^113ebAZD]. Cancer Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Assembly of RAS molecules into complexes at the cell membrane is critical for RAS signaling. We previously showed that oncogenic KRAS codon 61 mutations increase its affinity for RAF, raising the possibility that KRAS Q61H, the most common KRAS mutation at codon 61, upregulates RAS signaling through mechanisms at the level of RAS assemblies. We show here that KRAS Q61H exhibits preferential binding to RAF relative to PI3K in cells, leading to enhanced MAPK signaling in in vitro models and human NSCLC tumors. X-ray crystallography of KRAS Q61H :GTP revealed that a hyperdynamic switch 2 allows for a more stable interaction with switch 1, suggesting that enhanced RAF activity arises from a combination of absent intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity and increased affinity for RAF. Disruption of KRAS Q61H assemblies by the RAS oligomer-disrupting D154Q mutation impaired RAF dimerization and altered MAPK signaling but had little effect on PI3K signaling. However, KRAS Q61H oligomers but not KRAS G12D oligomers were disrupted by RAF mutations that disrupt RAF-RAF interactions. KRAS Q61H cells show enhanced sensitivity to RAF and MEK inhibitors individually, whereas combined treatment elicited synergistic growth inhibition. Furthermore, KRAS Q61H tumors in mice exhibited high vulnerability to MEK inhibitor, consistent with cooperativity between KRAS Q61H and RAF oligomerization and dependence on MAPK signaling. These findings support the notion that KRAS Q61H and functionally similar mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies against the MAPK pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that oncogenic KRAS Q61H forms a cooperative RAS-RAF ternary complex, which renders RAS-driven tumors vulnerable to MEKi and RAFi, thus establishing a framework for evaluating RAS biomarker-driven targeted therapies.

### Mek1 alters epidermal growth and differentiation [^114hyAuL]. Cancer Research (2004). Low credibility.

The highly homologous kinases, Mek1 and Mek2, act downstream of Ras and Raf to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinases. In epidermis, Ras and Raf promote hyperplasia; however, they act on multiple Mek-independent effectors, and the extent to which Meks can mediate these effects is unknown. To address this, we expressed inducible Meks in transgenic murine and human epidermis. Both Mek1 and Mek2 triggered ERK phosphorylation. Only Mek1, however, recapitulated Ras/Raf effects in increasing proliferation and integrin expression while suppressing differentiation, which are impacts characteristic of epidermal neoplasia. Furthermore, a kinase-dead Mek1 mutant incapable of phosphorylating ERK proteins retained ability to mediate Mek1-driven epidermal proliferation. Mek1 is thus sufficient to promote the proliferative epithelial phenotype in a manner independent of intact kinase function.

### Targeting KRASG12D mutation in non-small cell lung cancer: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential [^1149RHkc]. Cancer Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
KRAS signaling pathway.

Upon activation by receptor tyrosine kinases, the receptors bind with the adapter protein RAS. RAS also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) through protein growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (GRB2). Then, GRB2 binds to participate in the activation of multiple downstream effectors, including SOS1 or 2 (guanine nucleotide exchange factors [GEFs] that cause phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and protein kinase B (PKB, also known as AKT) to be activated by nucleotide exchange and replacement of GDP with GTP. AKT plays an important role in inhibiting NF-KB and multiple RAS functions. Once activated, RAS interacts with multiple effector transcription factors and activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). PI3K also activates the monomeric GTPase RAC involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK1 and 2) and catalyzes cell migration. Finally, RAS also activates the RALGDS protein, which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for MAPK and RAL and phospholipase C activation, leading to the transcription of multiple transcription factors, including ELK1 and activation protein 1 (AP1). It also activates protein kinase C (PKC) and mobilizes intracellular calcium. RAF protein is essential for the proliferative action of PKA signaling protein kinase A. The mutant KRAS maintains a low level of GTPase activity, resulting in a weak response to upstream signals and a constitutively active state. G12D continuously activates downstream pathways, mainly through the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, leading to abnormal cell proliferation.

### ERK pathway agonism for cancer therapy: evidence, insights, and a target discovery framework [^111Mdb63]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Approximately 40% of human cancers are linked to the abberant upregulation of ERKp. Notably, cancers that harbor genetic alterations in an ERKp effector can be associated with worse clinical outcomes than cancers where such alterations are absent, emphasizing the significance of these alterations on cancer prognosis. For over two decades, the effective inhibition of the ERKp has remained a key focus in cancer research and targeted therapy efforts.

However, in an ironic twist, a wealth of evidence underscores the reality that human cells, including cancer cells, cannot tolerate excessive levels of ERKp activity. While upstream effectors of the ERKp, such as RTKs, RAS, and RAFs, are subject to activating and oncogenic mutations in humans, the mutations in downstream effectors, such as MEK and even to a greater extent ERK, are infrequent. Before the ERK small molecule inhibitors' development and clinical employment, ERK mutations were hardly reported in human cancer. These mutations can be associated with secondary resistance mechanisms that lead to loss-of the protein affinity to ERK inhibitors in cells treated with these compounds –. As illustrated in Fig. 2, among the conventional ERK signaling pathway effectors, the ERK mutations still rank at the bottom of the list regarding the frequency of mutations in human cancer.

Fig. 2
ERK1/2 mutations are relatively rare.

In July 2023, the query of 69223 samples belonging to 65853 patients in 213 curated and non-redundant studies in cBiportal for only mutations among conventional effectors of the ERKp yielded the approximate frequencies as displayed. Note that this oversimplified schematic is not meant to communicate complex signaling and structures of the effectors. Unlike typical oncogenes, ERK1/2 mutations are distributed along the ERK protein's conserved protein kinase and non-conserved regions, with no hotspot mutational site. Figure generated in Biorender.

The ERKs need two critical phosphorylation events before full conformational activation, none triggered by either cis- or trans-autophosphorylation mechanisms. As opposed to RTKs, RAFs, or even MEKs, ERKs protein conformations have evolved in such a way to be less poised for autoactivation and instead rely on direct phosphotransferase activity of MEKs for full activation.

### Direct autocrine action of insulin on β-cells: does it make physiological sense? [^111UfQw6]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

FIG. 1.
Activation of the IRS signaling cascade pathways. A peptide ligand such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) binds to its receptor, activating the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of that receptor that then tyrosine phosphorylates (pY) adaptor molecules such as IRS-1 or -2. Other receptor tyrosine kinases, or receptors that activate tyrosine kinases such as Janus kinase (JAK), can also activate IRS signaling. This leads to activation of two major signaling cascades, the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (orange) and the phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase (PI3'K)/protein kinase-B (PKB; also known as Akt) signaling pathway (green). For the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, growth factor receptor–bound protein-2 (Grb2)/son of sevenless (SOS) protein complex binds to specific phosphorylated tyrosines on IRS-1/2, activating the GTP/GDP exchange activity of SOS, which loads p21 Ras (Ras) with GTP to activate Ras, leading to phosphorylation of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1, which then phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1), which is then activated to phosphorylate the extracellular signal–regulated kinases-1 and -2 (Erk-1/2). Phospho-activated Erk-1/2 can then directly (or indirectly via phospho-activation of other kinases such as p90 ribosomal serine kinase [p90 RSK]) serine/threonine phosphorylate certain transcription factors, such as cFos and E-twenty-six–like transcription factor 1 (Elk-1), to upregulate gene transcription. Phospho-activated Erk-1/2 can also phosphorylate MAPK–interacting kinase (Mnk) 1 and 2, leading to phosphorylation activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-4e (eIF4e) in a complex also containing eIF4a and eIF4G to increase general protein synthesis at the level initiation phase of translational control. For the PI3'K/PKB signaling pathway, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3'K docks to other specific phosphorylated tyrosine sites on IRS-1/2 that then activates its p110 catalytic activity. This catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphophaste [PI(4,5)P 2] to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphophaste [PI(3,4,5)P 3], which then activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). PDK1 then threonine (pT) phosphorylates PKB for PKB activation, which can be amplified by serine phosphorylation (pS) of PKB by the target of rapamycin complex-2 (TORC2; which includes the protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and associated proteins rictor and mLST8). PKB has a plethora of serine/threonine phosphorylation substrates. PKB-mediated phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis protein-1/2 complex (TSC1/2) inhibits its GTPase activating protein activity to then load the Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) protein with GTP (Rheb GTP), leading to activation of the TORC1 (which includes mTOR and associated proteins raptor and mLST8). TORC1 can then serine/threonine phosphorylate a series of substrates. This includes the eIF4e-binding protein-1 (4e-BP1) that releases it from eIF4e binding, enabling eIF4e to associate with eIF4a and eIF4G in a complex with Mnk, where Mnk then phosphorylates eIF4e to increase rates of protein synthesis translation. This also shows how the Ras/Raf/Erk and PI3'K/PKB signaling pathways can coordinate to give a tight translational control of protein synthesis. TORC1 can also phosphorylate and subsequently activate p70 S6-ribosomal kinase (p70 S6K), which can lead to an increase in the elongation phase of protein synthesis translation. PDK1 can threonine phosphorylate p70 S6K to amplify this effect. TORC1 also phosphorylates Unc-51–like kinases-1/2 (ULK-1/2; also known as autophagy gene-1), which results in inhibition of autophagy. Among PKB's other phosphorylation substrates are proteins involved in the apoptotic process such as Bcl-antagonist of cell death (BAD) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), outlining a mechanism whereby PKB is antiapoptotic. PKB phosphorylation of the transcription factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a causes their removal from the nucleus and promotes their degradation, causing an inhibition of FoxO1/3a-mediated transcription. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) by PKB inhibits GSK3 activity, resulting in increased glycogen deposition and cell growth. Under certain circumstances, PKB can also influence increases in cell growth by phosphorylating the cell-cycle inhibitor proteins p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1 (p21 CIP) and p27 cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor (p27 KIP). PKB can also phosphorylate-inhibit phosphodiesterase-3b (PDE3b) to elevate intracellular cAMP ([cAMP]i) levels. Many of these IRS signaling elements have been shown to be expressed and active and play important roles in pancreatic β-cells in terms of certain functions, growth, and survival (rev. in–), and these are indicated by a yellow highlighted halo.

### ERK mutations and amplification confer resistance to ERK-inhibitor therapy [^114hoQBo]. Clinical Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose: MAPK pathway inhibitors targeting BRAF and MEK have shown clinical efficacy in patients with RAF- and/or RAS-mutated tumors. However, acquired resistance to these agents has been an impediment to improved long-term survival in the clinic. In such cases, targeting ERK downstream of BRAF/MEK has been proposed as a potential strategy for overcoming acquired resistance. Preclinical studies suggest that ERK inhibitors are effective at inhibiting BRAF/RAS-mutated tumor growth and overcome BRAF or/and MEK inhibitor resistance. However, as observed with other MAPK pathway inhibitors, treatment with ERK inhibitors is likely to cause resistance in the clinic. Here, we aimed to model the mechanism of resistance to ERK inhibitors. Experimental Design: We tested five structurally different ATP-competitive ERK inhibitors representing three different scaffolds on BRAF/RAS-mutant cancer cell lines of different tissue types to generate resistant lines. We have used in vitro modeling, structural biology, and genomic analysis to understand the development of resistance to ERK inhibitors and the mechanisms leading to it. Results: We have identified mutations in ERK1/2, amplification and overexpression of ERK2, and overexpression of EGFR/ERBB2 as mechanisms of acquired resistance. Structural analysis of ERK showed that specific compounds that induced on-target ERK mutations were impaired in their ability to bind mutant ERK. We show that in addition to MEK inhibitors, ERBB receptor and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors are effective in overcoming ERK-inhibitor resistance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that combination therapy with MEK or ERBB receptor or PI3K/mTOR and ERK inhibitors may be an effective strategy for managing the emergence of resistance in the clinic.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^116zmVzz]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of Raf dimerisation in normal and oncogenic signalling

The Raf kinases are best known for their role in Ras pathway signalling – a pathway widely utilised to control many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. All members of the Raf family, which include A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, possess a Ras-binding domain (RBD) in their N-terminal regulatory region and can function as effectors of active GTP-bound Ras. The direct interaction with Ras recruits the cytosolic Raf kinases to the plasma membrane and disrupts their autoinhibited state. Ras binding also promotes changes in Raf phosphorylation and induces Raf dimer formation, which is now recognised to be a required step in the Raf activation process. The Raf kinases can dimerise with any of the other Raf family members, and although the factors that determine the dimerisation preferences are poorly understood, B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimers predominate in Ras-dependent signalling (Figure 1a). The Raf kinase domains contact one another through a side-to-side dimer interface, and as a result of protomer transactivation, a catalytically active kinase conformation is assumed, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of MEK. MEK, in turn, phosphorylates and activates ERK, which plays a critical role in the forward transmission of signals and contributes to inhibitory feedback loops that control the duration and amplitude of pathway signalling. With respect to the inhibitory feedback regulation, active ERK phosphorylates multiple components of the Ras pathway, including the Sos guanine nucleotide exchange factors and members of the Raf family. These phosphorylation events have an overall effect of attenuating signal transmission and, in the case of Raf, disrupt both Ras binding and Raf dimerisation.

### ASTX029, a novel dual-mechanism ERK inhibitor, modulates both the phosphorylation and catalytic activity of ERK [^112RSWoP]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The MAPK signaling pathway is commonly upregulated in human cancers. As the primary downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, ERK is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of MAPK-activated cancers and for overcoming resistance to upstream inhibition. ASTX029 is a highly potent and selective dual-mechanism ERK inhibitor, discovered using fragment-based drug design. Because of its distinctive ERK-binding mode, ASTX029 inhibits both ERK catalytic activity and the phosphorylation of ERK itself by MEK, despite not directly inhibiting MEK activity. This dual mechanism was demonstrated in cell-free systems, as well as cell lines and xenograft tumor tissue, where the phosphorylation of both ERK and its substrate, ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), were modulated on treatment with ASTX029. Markers of sensitivity were highlighted in a large cell panel, where ASTX029 preferentially inhibited the proliferation of MAPK-activated cell lines, including those with BRAF or RAS mutations. In vivo, significant antitumor activity was observed in MAPK-activated tumor xenograft models following oral treatment. ASTX029 also demonstrated activity in both in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Overall, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of a dual-mechanism ERK inhibitor such as ASTX029 for the treatment of MAPK-activated cancers, including those which have acquired resistance to inhibitors of upstream components of the MAPK pathway. ASTX029 is currently being evaluated in a first in human phase I-II clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT03520075).

### Molecular signaling in multiple myeloma: association of RAS / RAF mutations and MEK / ERK pathway activation [^1128kB2C]. Oncogenesis (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, this study on primary biopsies demonstrates for the first time that BRAF/RAS mutation status alone is not generally associated with MEK/ERK pathway activation, and may therefore not predict for therapeutic response to MEK inhibition in MM. In broader terms, the current paradigm that MM is substantially driven by activation of the MEK–ERK signaling cascade, due to the high prevalence of BRAF/RAS mutations, may not be true. Our data indicate that pathway-specific immunohistochemistry should be considered to assess pathway activation with the potential to inform future clinical trials of targeted therapies, for example, with, but likely not restricted to, BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Further validation of this concept of targeting activated pathways rather than potential marker mutations should be performed in the context of prospective clinical trials.

### MEK1 / 2 inhibitors in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies [^114EdESK]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of ubiquitous eukaryotic signal transduction enzymes which link extracellular stimuli to intracellular gene expression pathways. While several three-tiered MAPK cascades have been elucidated in mammals, the prototypical pathway involves a network of proteins and kinases including the Rat sarcoma protein (Ras), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (Raf or MAP3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAP2K), and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK or MAPK). This MAPK cascade (the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway) is a receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. There are multiple molecular mechanisms of interaction and activation between the upstream nodes of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and other cell signaling pathways, all ultimately leading to the activation of the nuclear transcription factor ERK. Important downstream targets include MEK1/2, which comprise the final step leading to ERK transcription factor activation. While multiple conduits exist to activate ERK upstream of MEK, there is little redundancy downstream. Located at this pivotal intersection between a limited number of upstream activators and its exclusive downstream targets, MEK is an appealing molecular target of novel cancer therapies. MEK inhibitors are small molecules that inhibit MEK phosphorylation by binding to a pocket adjacent to the ATP binding site, decreasing both the amount of MEK activity, and the quantity of activated ERK in the cell. Unique allosteric noncompetitive binding sites of MEK inhibitors allow specific targeting of MEK enzymes and prevent cross-activation of other serine/threonine protein kinases through the conserved ATP binding site. This paper reviews the translational evidence in favor of MEK inhibitors in cancer, their role in gynecologic malignancies, and details regarding the status of the fourteen MEK inhibitors currently being clinically tested: trametinib, selumetinib, pimasertib, refametinib, PD-0325901, MEK162, TAK733, RO5126766, WX-554, RO4987655, cobimetinib, AZD8330, MSC2015103B, and ARRY-300.

### Discovery of a novel ERK inhibitor with activity in models of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors [^115Nk1dK]. Cancer Discovery (2013). Low credibility.

The high frequency of activating RAS or BRAF mutations in cancer provides strong rationale for targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. These data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors for tumors refractory to MAPK inhibitors.

### RAF inhibitors transactivate RAF dimers and ERK signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF [^114Ex2ch]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Tumours with mutant BRAF are dependent on the RAF-MEK-ERK signalling pathway for their growth. We found that ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors inhibit ERK signalling in cells with mutant BRAF, but unexpectedly enhance signalling in cells with wild-type BRAF. Here we demonstrate the mechanistic basis for these findings. We used chemical genetic methods to show that drug-mediated transactivation of RAF dimers is responsible for paradoxical activation of the enzyme by inhibitors. Induction of ERK signalling requires direct binding of the drug to the ATP-binding site of one kinase of the dimer and is dependent on RAS activity. Drug binding to one member of RAF homodimers (CRAF-CRAF) or heterodimers (CRAF-BRAF) inhibits one protomer, but results in transactivation of the drug-free protomer. In BRAF(V600E) tumours, RAS is not activated, thus transactivation is minimal and ERK signalling is inhibited in cells exposed to RAF inhibitors. These results indicate that RAF inhibitors will be effective in tumours in which BRAF is mutated. Furthermore, because RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in other cells, the model predicts that they would have a higher therapeutic index and greater antitumour activity than mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, but could also cause toxicity due to MEK/ERK activation. These predictions have been borne out in a recent clinical trial of the RAF inhibitor PLX4032 (refs 4, 5). The model indicates that promotion of RAF dimerization by elevation of wild-type RAF expression or RAS activity could lead to drug resistance in mutant BRAF tumours. In agreement with this prediction, RAF inhibitors do not inhibit ERK signalling in cells that coexpress BRAF(V600E) and mutant RAS.

### A transcriptional MAPK pathway activity score (MPAS) is a clinically relevant biomarker in multiple cancer types [^114Gwir7]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved developmental pathway that regulates organ development and tissue homeostasis by transmitting signals through a series of phosphorylation events emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RAS family members, RAF family members, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) (MAP2K1/2), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (MAPK3/1). Nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 then triggers the transcriptional activation of multiple target genes involved in modulating the cellular processes of differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Enhanced MAPK pathway activity can be driven by genetic alterations (including amplification and genetic mutations) in RTKs and RAS/RAF family members, as well as aberrant growth factor signaling. The high prevalence of aberrant MAPK signaling in cancer has motivated the clinical development of inhibitors targeting critical pathway nodes, including BRAF V600 -mutant selective inhibitors, pan-RAF inhibitors, MEK1/2 inhibitors, and ERK1/2 inhibitors. – Currently, there are at least 20 different MEK, RAF, and ERK inhibitors being tested alone or in combination with other drugs in active clinical trials according to. While single genetic events may not always correspond to pathway hyperactivation in tumors, in some instances, these drugs have demonstrated therapeutic benefit alone or in combination in pre-selected patient populations defined by genetic mutations. For example, treatment of BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutant melanoma patients with BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) increases overall survival, and the combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors (cobimetinib or trametinib) achieves deeper MAPK pathway inhibition, resulting in improved clinical efficacy. – However, clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibition in mutant BRAF populations outside of melanoma are more variable, and the therapeutic benefit of MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib, selumetinib, and refametinib does not appear to be associated with KRAS mutation status in lung cancer or pancreatic cancer. – ERK phosphorylation also varies extensively across cell lines and does not predict MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Together, these observations suggest that neither BRAF/ KRAS mutation status nor ERK phosphorylation status alone are sufficiently reliable biomarkers of MAPK pathway activity in multiple cancer indications and that additional, clinically translatable biomarkers are needed.

### Cryo-EM structures of CRAF / MEK1 / 14–3–3 complexes in autoinhibited and open-monomer States reveal features of RAF regulation [^111yFndR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

RAF family kinases ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (Raf-1) are critical components of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which governs essential cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival –. This pathway is activated by growth factor receptors at the cell surface, leading to the activation of RAS proteins, which in turn recruit and activate RAF kinases. Once activated, RAF kinases phosphorylate and activate MEK1/2, which subsequently phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2, culminating in the regulation of gene expression and cellular responses. The three RAF isoforms have both shared and distinct regulatory mechanisms. BRAF has higher catalytic activity and is generally considered to have a simpler activation mechanism compared to CRAF and ARAF. This difference may explain why BRAF mutations are prevalent in many types of cancers, whereas mutations in CRAF and ARAF are comparatively rare.

### Cryo-EM structure of a RAS / RAF recruitment complex [^115MrEMS]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

RAF-family kinases are a central point of control in the signaling apparatus that regulates cellular proliferation, growth, and differentiation. RAFs are maintained in an inactive, autoinhibited state in the cytosol and are activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases via recruitment to the plasma membrane by GTP-bound RAS. Upon activation, RAFs phosphorylate their sole known substrate MEK1/2, and activated MEK in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2. Somatic mutations in RAF can subvert the normal RAS-dependent activation process and are a frequent cause of cancer. In particular, the V600E mutation in BRAF drives more than half of malignant melanoma and is also found in lung, colorectal, thyroid, and many other cancers. The conserved domain structure of BRAF and other family members (ARAF and CRAF, also called RAF1) includes the RAS-binding domain (RBD), a cysteine-rich domain (CRD), and the C-terminal kinase domain (Fig. 1a). The RBD and CRD lie in the N-terminal regulatory region of the protein, which is crucial both for maintaining autoinhibition and for RAS-driven activation and membrane association. We and others have shown how BRAF is locked in an inactive state as a complex with its substrate MEK and a 14–3–3 dimer. In this autoinhibited configuration, the 14–3–3 dimer binds serine phosphorylation sites that flank the BRAF kinase domain (pS365 and pS729), allowing it to restrain both the BRAF kinase and CRD domains in a cradle-like structure that precludes BRAF dimerization, which is crucial for its activation. The CRD domain lies at the center of the autoinhibited complex, where it is largely protected from interactions with the membrane and RAS. The RBD, by contrast, is exposed and available to engage RAS. In the active state, driven by RAS engagement at the plasma membrane, these components reorganize such that the 14–3–3 domain binds the C-terminal pS729 site of two BRAF proteins, driving the formation of an active, back-to-back BRAF kinase dimer. The N-terminal regulatory region appears not to engage with the dimeric kinase/14–3–3 module; instead, it is thought to bind RAS at the membrane –.

### Cobimetinib (Cotellic) [^111gC6E2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular proliferation. BRAF V600E and K mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2. In mice implanted with tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600E, cobimetinib inhibited tumor cell growth.

Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared to either drug alone, coadministration of cobimetinib and vemurafenib resulted in increased apoptosis in vitro and reduced tumor growth in mouse implantation models of tumor cell lines harboring BRAF V600E mutations. Cobimetinib also prevented vemurafenib-mediated growth enhancement of a wild-type BRAF tumor cell line in an in vivo mouse implantation model.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

Clinically relevant QT prolongation has been reported with vemurafenib, further QTc prolongation was not observed when cobimetinib 60 mg daily was co-administered with vemurafenib. Monitor ECG and electrolytes before initiating treatment and routinely during treatment with cobimetinib, when administered with vemurafenib. Review the Full Prescribing Information for vemurafenib for details.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib was studied in healthy subjects and cancer patients. Cobimetinib exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 3.5 to 100 mg (i.e., 0.06 to 1.7 times the recommended dosage). Following oral administration of COTELLIC 60 mg once daily, steady-state was reached by 9 days with a mean accumulation ratio of 2.4-fold (44% CV).

### Selumetinib (Koselugo) [^1139HxwB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Selumetinib is an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). MEK1/2 proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. Both MEK and ERK are critical components of the RAS-regulated RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which is often activated in different types of cancers.

In genetically modified mouse models of NF1 that generate neurofibromas that recapitulate the genotype and phenotype of human NF1, oral dosing of selumetinib inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and reduced neurofibroma numbers, volume, and proliferation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of KOSELUGO have not been fully characterized.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 1.5-times the maximum recommended dose, KOSELUGO does not prolong the QT/QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

At the recommended dosage of 25 mg/m2of KOSELUGO capsules twice daily in pediatric patients (2 to ≤ 18 years old), the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (coefficient of variation [CV%]) following the first dose and at steady state was 731 (62%) ng/mL and 798 (52%) ng/mL, respectively. The mean area under the plasma drug concentration curve (AUC0–12h) following the first dose was 2009 (35%) ng•h/mL and the AUC0 6hat steady state was 1958 (41%) ng•h/mL. Selumetinib AUC and Cmaxincreases proportionally over a dose range from 20 mg/m2to 30 mg/m2(0.8- to 1.2-times the recommended dose). The accumulation was 1.1-fold following administration of KOSELUGO 25 mg/m2twice daily.

At the recommended dosage of 25 mg/m2of KOSELUGO oral granules (sprinkled on smooth yogurt, smooth fruit sauce, smooth fruit puree, or smooth fruit jam) twice daily in pediatric patients (> 1 year old to < 7 years old), the AUC0–24hfollowing the first dose of KOSELUGO oral granules was within the range of that in patients administered KOSELUGO capsules.

### In melanoma, RAS mutations are accompanied by switching signaling from BRAF to CRAF and disrupted cyclic AMP signaling [^117Q9mAC]. Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Melanocytes require the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways to maintain the fine balance between proliferation and differentiation. We have investigated how cross-talk between these pathways affects melanoma progression. We show that cAMP suppresses CRAF activity in melanocytes and that this is essential to suppress the oncogenic potential of CRAF in these cells. As a consequence, BRAF alone is responsible for signaling to MEK. However, when RAS is mutated in melanoma, the cells switch their signaling from BRAF to CRAF. This switch is accompanied by dysregulated cAMP signaling, a step that is necessary to allow CRAF to signal to MEK. Thus, a fundamental switch in RAF isoform usage occurs when RAS is mutated in melanoma, and this occurs in the context of disrupted cAMP signaling. These data have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat this life-threatening disease.

### Resistance to BRAF inhibitors: unraveling mechanisms and future treatment options [^115wZMfd]. Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has emerged as a central target for melanoma therapy due to its persistent activation in the majority of tumors. Several BRAF inhibitors aimed at curbing MAPK pathway activity are currently in advanced stages of clinical investigation. However, their therapeutic success is limited by the emergence of drug resistance, as responses are transient and tumors eventually recur. To develop effective and long-lasting therapies for melanoma patients, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we briefly review recent preclinical studies that have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors and discuss potential strategies to treat drug-resistant melanomas.

### Qualitative differences in disease-associated MEK mutants reveal molecular signatures and aberrant signaling-crosstalk in cancer [^114Yc9Ht]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade, consisting of three tiers of protein kinases (Raf, MEK, and ERK), mediates mitogenic signals and is critical for a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, embryonic development, and carcinogenesis. In general, ERK signaling is initiated by growth factor [e.g. epidermal growth factor (EGF)] binding to its respective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), leading to Ras activation at the plasma membrane. Activated Ras interacts with and activates the Raf family protein kinases (ARaf, BRaf, and Raf-1), which then phosphorylate two conserved Ser residues within the T-loops of MEK1/2, which in turn phosphorylate ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2 translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate multiple substrates including several transcription factors (TFs) (e.g. Elk-1 and Sp1), resulting in the expression of the so-called immediate early genes (IEGs). Since many IEGs encode TFs (e.g. Egr1 and c-fos), their induction further modulates the expression of various target genes controlling a wide array of cellular responses. ERK1/2 are then gradually inactivated by dephosphorylation and return to the cytoplasm. Several other mechanisms are also involved in the regulation of ERK signaling. These include scaffold proteins, docking interactions, protein phosphatases, and multiple feedback loops. Proper regulation of such spatiotemporal dynamics of ERK signaling is critical for the maintenance of cellular functions and homeostasis.

### Multiple roles of rap1 in hematopoietic cells: complementary versus antagonistic functions [^112XxPJX]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Small G proteins serve as critical control points in signal transduction, integrating a wide range of stimuli to dictate discrete cellular outcomes. The outcomes of small G-protein signaling can both potentiate and antagonize one another. Studies in hematopoietic cells have uncovered multiple functions for the small G protein, Rap1 (Ras-proximate-1). Because Rap1 can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion through distinct mechanisms, it serves as a paradigm for the need for tight cellular control of small G-protein function. Rap1 has received recent attention for its role in enhancing integrin-dependent signals. This action of Rap1 augments a variety of processes that characterize hematopoietic-cell function, including aggregation, migration, extravasation, and homing to target tissues. Rap1 may also regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation via pathways that are distinct from those mediating adhesion, and involve regulation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase or ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade. These actions of Rap1 occur in selected cell types to enhance or diminish ERK signaling, depending on the expression pattern of the MAP kinase kinase kinases of the Raf family: Raf-1 and B-Raf. This review will examine the functions of Rap1 in hematopoietic cells, and focus on 3 cellular scenarios where the multiple actions of Rap1 function have been proposed. Recent studies implicating Rap1 in the maturation of megakaryocytes, the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and activation of peripheral T cells will receive particular attention.

### Conferring specificity on the ubiquitous raf / MEK signalling pathway [^1151axDj]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

In contrast, B-Raf is activated directly by Ras binding. B-Raf also features a phosphomimetic aspartate in place of the residue corresponding to Y341, and is constitutively phosphorylated at the S338 equivalent. Thus, B-Raf appears to have shortcircuited several of the events required for the activation of Raf-1. This is consistent with B-Raf possessing a much higher specific activity towards MEK than Raf-1. This could explain why B-raf can fully compensate for the loss of Raf-1 or A-Raf in the knockout cells pertaining to the regulation of ERK.

In addition, B-Raf can be activated by Rap1, a Ras-related protein, which was originally described as a suppressor of Ras transformation. This inhibitory function seems to be due to the ability of Rap1 to sequester Raf-1 in inactive complexes. As this requires Rap1 overexpression, it is unclear whether this function of Rap1 is physiological. Rap1 is activated by numerous growth factors and appears to be a signal transducer in its own right. Again, it has been disputed whether B-Raf is a physiological Rap1 effector, but at least under certain conditions it can promote PC12 cell differentiation by activating B-Raf. The higher activity of B-Raf ensures the sustained activation of ERK that is required for neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. However, there is also differential regulation downstream through crosstalk with the cAMP signalling system. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA phosphorylates and inhibits Raf-1. In contrast, cAMP induces the activation of B-Raf by activation of Rap1. Thus, cAMP should interfere with ERK activation in cells where only Raf-1 is expressed, but promote ERK activation in cells where B-Raf is coexpressed. Switching from one Raf isoform with low MEK kinase activity to another with high activity could serve to fine-tune the activation dynamics of ERK, in order to determine a specific biological response (Figure 1

### Suppression of PTEN expression is essential for antiapoptosis and cellular transformation by oncogenic ras [^117EqDF1]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Ras is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in the array of human cancers. The mechanism by which Ras induces cellular transformation is, however, not fully elucidated. We present here evidence that oncogenic Ras suppresses the expression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), and this action of oncogenic Ras is mediated by the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway via up-regulation of c-Jun. Jun(+/+) cells undergo cellular transformation by oncogenic Ras, and restoration of wild-type PTEN, but not a phosphate-defective mutant of PTEN, induces apoptosis in these cells. Conversely, in Jun(-/-) cells, oncogenic Ras neither suppresses PTEN nor causes transformation, but rather it induces PTEN-dependent apoptosis. An apoptotic response to oncogenic Ras in Jun(-/-) cells can be prevented by suppressing PTEN expression. These findings imply that oncogenic Ras suppresses the apoptotic gene PTEN via the Raf-MEK-ERK-c-Jun pathway to induce antiapoptosis and cellular transformation. Together, our findings identify a novel molecular interface between the oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways that regulates cellular transformation and survival.

### Raf: a strategic target for therapeutic development against cancer… [^112EBpGh]. ASCO (2005). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. Several important signaling elements of the MAPK pathway, particularly Ras and Raf, are encoded by oncogenes, and as such, their structures and functions can be modified, rendering them constitutively active. Because the MAPK pathway is dysregulated in a notable proportion of human malignancies, many of its aberrant and critical components represent strategic targets for therapeutic development against cancer.

Raf, which is an essential serine/threonine kinase constituent of the MAPK pathway and a downstream effector of the central signal transduction mediator Ras, is activated in a wide range of human malignancies by aberrant signaling upstream of the protein and activating mutations of the protein itself, both of which confer a proliferative advantage. Three isoforms of Raf have been identified, and therapeutics targeting Raf, including small-molecule inhibitors and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides, are undergoing clinical evaluation. The outcomes of these investigations may have far-reaching implications in the management of many types of human cancer. This review outlines the structure and diverse functions of Raf, the rationale for targeting Raf as a therapeutic strategy against cancer, and the present status of various therapeutic approaches including ASONs and small molecules, particularly sorafenib.

### Molecular alterations in the ras-raf-erk (MAPK) pathway in metastatic hormone receptor positive (HR +) / HER2-breast cancer: incidence and impact on clinical outcomes… [^111dMWR6]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract 1021 Background: While molecular alterations in PI3K pathway, including PIK3CAmutations, are common in HR+ breast cancer, molecular alterations in MAPK pathway, including KRASand BRAFmutations, are considered rare in HR+ breast cancer. However, tumors can acquire new molecular alterations over time, and blood-based genotyping via circulating tumor DNA could provide a more accurate molecular snapshot. Methods: This study analyzed data collected from metastatic breast cancer patients who had genotyping via a next generation sequencing-based assay that detects ctDNA mutations, including alterations in MAPK pathway. Mutation profiles were also analyzed in tissue biopsies via SNaPshot-NGS, an institutional genotyping assay. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the hazard ratio for the association between these mutations and time to progression, adjusting for key prognostic variables.

Results: Among the HR+ MBC patients, 25% were found to have molecular alterations in MAPK pathway in ctDNA, including mutations in BRAF, KRAS, NRAS. TP53mutation, and multiple alterations were acquired. Among patients with MAPK molecular alterations versus not, there was no significant difference in baseline characteristics, including age at metastatic diagnosis and visceral metastases. In multivariate analysis, patients with MBC harboring MAPK molecular alterations had worse TTP compared to controls. However, there was no difference among those with. PIK3CAmutant tumors versus not. Conclusions: Molecular alterations in MAPK pathway, hitherto considered rare in primary HR+ breast cancer, are not uncommon in metastatic HR+ breast cancer and are associated with worse outcomes.

The study highlights the value of blood-based assays for identification of novel targets and their potential clinical utility in development of genotype driven trials for patients with MBC.

### Exceptional response to MEK inhibition in a patient with RAF1-mutant myxofibrosarcoma: case report and mechanistic overview | JCO precision oncology… [^113CPbgU]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

RAF1 S259mutations are especially prevalent in RASopathies, such as Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, 12and were shown to be activating. 24Our MTB, composed of medical oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, and radiologists, evaluated the potential role of the RAF1 S259Pmutation in tumorigenesis and treatment response. S259 is a critical residue that regulates the activity of RAF. 2RAF1 is in autoinhibited state before activation of RAS. In this state, RAF1 S259 is phosphorylated and bound by 14–3–3 proteins, preventing activation of RAF1 and its recruitment to the plasma membrane. 25, 26On RAS activation, RAF1 interacts with RAS-GTP through its RAS-binding domain and is recruited to the plasma membrane. This induces repositioning of cysteine-rich domain of the RAF1, which also modulates RAS-GTP: RAF1 interaction. 27Through this interaction, S259 is dephosphorylated and RAF1 is primed for activation.

SHOC2 complex is one of the diphosphatase complexes mediating this event. RAF1 forms dimers with other RAF proteins to become fully activated 28. 24Moreover, crystal structure of RAF1: 14–3–3 revealed the requirement of the serine residue for the full interaction.
29. S259P mutation is expected to abolish this interaction, allowing recruitment of phosphatases that can act on near-by residues, disrupting cytosolic partition. To note, there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis, and therefore experimental confirmation is needed, such as using peptide affinity assay. However, we showed by western blot that overexpression of RAF1 S259P results in increased ERK phosphorylation in HEK293T cells, indicating enhanced MAPK pathway activity. CDKN2A/ Bloss, which is a frequently occurring event in STS. CDKN2Aencodes for p16 and p14, which regulates cell cycle and p53 pathway, respectively.

### MAP2K4: new kid on the MAP kinase block… [^117RKPeY]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

RAS inhibitors suffer from the same issue seen with other inhibitors that target the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, namely that their effectiveness as single-agents in KRAS-driven cancers is limited by feedback mechanisms that re-activate the MAPK pathway in the presence of drug. It is well established that feedback activation of upstream receptor tyrosine kinases is a frequent feedback mechanism to RAS pathway inhibition and disabling this feedback activation by concomitant inhibition can be highly effective to enhance the effect of MAPK inhibitors. This was first discovered after the clinical observation that BRAF inhibition by vemurafenib did not show similar meaningful clinical responses in CRCs compared to melanomas harboring the same BRAF mutation. In KRAS-mutant cancers, inhibition of upstream RTKs by using pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors has also been shown to be synergistic with MEK inhibition 10.

Based on these encouraging pre-clinical results, several clinical trials were conducted combining pan-HER and MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant cancers 11–13.
15. Mechanistically, RAS pathway inhibition increases MAP2K4-JNK-JUN pathway signaling through inhibition of DUSP4, which in turn activates several RTKs, especially ERBB2 and ERBB3, that subsequently reactivate the RAS pathway in the presence of drug 15. Consequently, genetic loss of MAP2K4 confers sensitivity to RAS pathway inhibitors in multiple KRAS-mutant cancer models 15,
16. Indeed, we found that the novel MAP2K4 inhibitor HRX-0233 is highly synergistic with various RAS pathway inhibitors in KRAS-mutant NSCLC and CRC cancer models 16.

Moreover, the combination of the novel MAP2K4 inhibition and KRASG12C-specific inhibitor sotorasib, is well-tolerated and resulted in durable tumor shrinkage in mouse xenografts of human lung cancer cells, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for KRAS-driven cancers, which currently lack effective treatment options. A key question is whether this novel drug combination will be less toxic in cancer patients. Importantly, while MAP2K4 also blocks the feedback activation of HER RTKs upon RAS pathway inhibition, this novel combination is fundamentally different in that MAP2K4 inhibition only prevents the increased expression and activity of RTKs that occurs upon MAPK inhibition, whereas the pan-HER inhibitors also block basal levels of the RTK activity.
