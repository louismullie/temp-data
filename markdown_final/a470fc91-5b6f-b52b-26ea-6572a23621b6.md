## Question

What is the optimal duration of sunlight exposure required to effectively reduce bilirubin levels in neonates with jaundice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of sunlight exposure required to effectively reduce bilirubin levels in neonates with jaundice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to unfiltered direct sunlight versus filtered-sunlight phototherapy. Then, I should verify what the highest-quality trials actually tested for durations and outcomes. Next, I will review guideline positions on sunlight as a therapy. After that, I should consider safety trade-offs and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer with caveats about evidence quality and context of use.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating direct sunlight exposure with filtered-sunlight phototherapy. Direct sunlight contains substantial ultraviolet and infrared radiation and is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool due to safety concerns, whereas filtered-sunlight phototherapy uses window films or similar filters to transmit therapeutic blue-green light while blocking UV and IR, and has been studied in randomized trials in resource-limited settings [^112Jscfn] [^1117pm42] [^114LaTpP].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized trials to see what durations were actually tested and whether they established noninferiority. In the NEJM trial, filtered-sunlight phototherapy was compared with conventional electric phototherapy; efficacy was defined as receiving at least 5 hours of phototherapy per day, and filtered sunlight achieved about 93% efficacy versus 90% with conventional therapy, with no withdrawals for safety, supporting the concept that approximately 4–5 hours per day of filtered sunlight can be effective when delivered consistently [^1117pm42]. In the Lancet Global Health noninferiority trial for moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia, efficacy was assessed on days when at least 4 hours of filtered sunlight were delivered, and filtered sunlight proved noninferior to intensive electric phototherapy, again anchoring a practical minimum of about 4 hours per day in that context [^114LaTpP]. A more recent RCT in moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia similarly operationalized efficacy when infants received at least 4 hours of filtered sunlight, reinforcing the same threshold [^115BNoeC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "optimal" duration without considering the dose-response and operational realities. These trials did not test a range of durations head-to-head, so the 4–5 hour minimum reflects what was feasible and effective in those studies rather than a proven optimum; moreover, availability of sunlight is sporadic, cloud cover and latitude vary, and devices must be maintained to preserve irradiance, which means that in practice, clinicians often aim for as many daylight hours as feasible while prioritizing safety and monitoring rather than a fixed "optimal" duration [^113cYNUm] [^114LaTpP] [^115BNoeC].

> I should confirm guideline positions to avoid overgeneralizing from trials to standard care. The 2022 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline explicitly notes that while direct sunlight can decrease total serum bilirubin, practical limitations mean it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool, and instead recommends intensive electric phototherapy with narrow-band blue light at adequate irradiance when treatment is indicated, reserving sunlight-based approaches for exceptional, resource-constrained circumstances with appropriate filtering and monitoring [^112Jscfn] [^111ZDgpJ]. The Cochrane review concludes that sunlight may be an adjunct in LMIC settings but has not demonstrated that sunlight alone is effective for treatment given sporadic availability and low-certainty evidence, reinforcing caution about routine use [^113cYNUm].

> Let me consider safety and monitoring, because duration without safety controls is not clinically acceptable. Filtered-sunlight studies consistently show increased risk of hyperthermia, with relative risks around 4–5 compared with electric phototherapy, necessitating frequent temperature checks, hydration assessment, and immediate cessation if hyperthermia occurs; hypothermia can also occur in cooler environments, so continuous thermoregulatory monitoring is essential during any sunlight-based intervention [^113cYNUm] [^114LaTpP] [^115BNoeC]. I should double-check that these safety signals were present even when UV/IR filtering was used, which they were, underscoring that filtering reduces but does not eliminate thermal risk [^113cYNUm].

> Now, I will synthesize a clinically useful answer, but I need to be precise about scope and certainty. For filtered-sunlight phototherapy in resource-limited settings, aiming for approximately 4–5 hours per day of exposure, when weather and staffing permit, aligns with the efficacy definitions and outcomes of the best available trials; however, this is a pragmatic minimum rather than a proven optimal dose, and longer exposure may be beneficial when feasible and safe, provided rigorous temperature and hydration monitoring are maintained [^1117pm42] [^114LaTpP] [^115BNoeC]. For direct, unfiltered sunlight, there is no established safe or effective duration for therapeutic use, and major guidelines advise against it due to UV and IR hazards, so it should not be recommended outside of research or exceptional, carefully monitored contexts [^112Jscfn] [^113cYNUm].

> But wait, what if the user is thinking about prevention rather than treatment. One prevention trial suggested that brief, twice-daily 30–60 minute sunlight exposures might reduce the incidence and duration of jaundice, yet the evidence is very low certainty, there were no safety data, and this approach should not be extrapolated to treat established hyperbilirubinemia; thus, I should clearly distinguish this preventive signal from therapeutic dosing of filtered sunlight [^113cYNUm].

> Finally, I should confirm how to translate this into practice if filtered sunlight is the only available option. Ensure UV/IR filtration, maximize exposed body surface area within safe thermoregulatory limits, monitor axillary temperature at least hourly, maintain adequate hydration and feeds, and track bilirubin response with serial measurements; if the bilirubin rise is not controlled or if unsafe temperatures occur, escalate to exchange transfusion protocols or transfer to facilities with electric phototherapy when possible, consistent with AAP escalation principles and the operational constraints described in LMIC-focused analyses [^112Jscfn] [^115rTPTS] [^114LaTpP].

There is **no established optimal duration** of sunlight exposure to reduce neonatal bilirubin, and sunlight is not recommended as primary phototherapy due to safety concerns and variable irradiance [^112Jscfn] [^113cYNUm]. If sunlight is used as a last resort in resource-limited settings, **filtered sunlight for 4–5 hours per day** [^114LaTpP] with close monitoring is supported by limited evidence, but it is less reliable than conventional phototherapy and carries risks of hyperthermia and UV exposure [^113cYNUm]. Conventional phototherapy remains the standard of care, with treatment duration guided by bilirubin response and clinical context [^112Jscfn].

---

## Evidence on sunlight exposure duration

- **Filtered sunlight phototherapy (FSPT)**: Randomized trials show FSPT for 4–5 hours per day can be noninferior to conventional phototherapy in some settings, but efficacy depends on consistent irradiance and weather conditions [^114LaTpP] [^1117pm42].

- **Direct sunlight exposure**: No robust evidence supports a specific duration for unfiltered sunlight; direct exposure is discouraged due to UV risks, temperature instability, and inconsistent irradiance [^112Jscfn] [^113cYNUm].

- **Preventive sunlight exposure**: A Cochrane review suggests 30–60 minutes twice daily may reduce jaundice incidence, but evidence is low quality and not for treatment of established hyperbilirubinemia [^113cYNUm].

---

## Comparison with conventional phototherapy

Conventional phototherapy uses **blue-light LEDs** at 460–490 nm with irradiance ≥ 30 μW/cm²/nm, achieving predictable bilirubin reduction within 4–6 hours [^115vPYk7] [^116pmVdE]. In contrast, **sunlight exposure** is unreliable due to variable irradiance, UV/IR content, and weather dependence; even filtered sunlight requires 4–5 hours to approach conventional efficacy, and safety monitoring is essential [^113cYNUm] [^114LaTpP].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Hyperthermia**: Increased risk with sunlight exposure; requires frequent temperature monitoring and hydration [^113cYNUm] [^114LaTpP].

- **UV radiation**: Direct sunlight poses risks of sunburn and long-term skin damage; filtering is necessary if sunlight is used [^113cYNUm] [^111ZDgpJ].

- **Temperature instability**: Sunlight can cause hypo- or hyperthermia, especially in preterm infants [^113cYNUm] [^113mUXoz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AAP guidelines state that **sunlight is not recommended** as primary phototherapy due to safety and reliability concerns; conventional phototherapy is the standard of care [^112Jscfn]. WHO acknowledges FSPT as a potential adjunct in resource-limited settings but emphasizes safety, monitoring, and the need for further research [^115rTPTS].

---

## Practical recommendations

If sunlight is used as a last resort, **filtered sunlight for 4–5 hours per day** with close monitoring of temperature, hydration, and bilirubin is reasonable, but conventional phototherapy should be pursued when available [^114LaTpP] [^113cYNUm]. Direct, unfiltered sunlight should be avoided due to safety risks and lack of evidence for efficacy [^112Jscfn] [^113cYNUm].

## Summary of evidence

| **Exposure type** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Filtered sunlight phototherapy | 4–5 hours/day | Moderate | - Hyperthermia <br/> - UV exposure <br/> - Monitoring required |
| Direct sunlight exposure | Not recommended | Low | - UV radiation <br/> - Hyperthermia <br/> - Temperature instability |
| Conventional phototherapy | Variable; guided by response | High | - Minimal risk <br/> - Standard of care |

---

There is **no established optimal duration** of sunlight exposure for neonatal jaundice; if filtered sunlight is used, 4–5 hours per day with monitoring is supported by limited evidence, but conventional phototherapy remains the preferred and safer option [^112Jscfn] [^113cYNUm].

### Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice – therapeutic effects on more than one level? [^116DTMgR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Phototherapy for jaundice is a common treatment in neonatal medicine and is used to prevent the neurotoxic effects of bilirubin. Studies have assessed the optimal wavelength of phototherapy light, the importance of irradiance and spectral power, and the types of light source, including the use of single versus multiple light sources. Outcome measures have been duration of need for phototherapy or rate of reduction of serum bilirubin over a given time. An apparent resurgence of kernicterus in recent years has forced us to focus on the emergency management of severely jaundiced infants. Several studies have shown that very rapid reductions of total serum bilirubin levels are possible. The speed with which photoisomers are formed appears to be important both from this perspective and theoretically may also be neuroprotective because of the more polar nature of the photoisomers. This work reviews the evidence concerning the speed of photoisomer formation, as well as the evidence regarding the relative neurotoxicity of bilirubin isomers.

### Sunlight for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates [^113cYNUm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and the other serious complications of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate occur far more frequently in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). This is due to several factors that place babies in LMIC at greater risk for hyperbilirubinemia, including increased prevalence of hematologic disorders leading to hemolysis, increased sepsis, less prenatal or postnatal care, and a lack of resources to treat jaundiced babies. Hospitals and clinics face frequent shortages of functioning phototherapy machines and inconsistent access to electricity to run the machines. Sunlight has the potential to treat hyperbilirubinemia: it contains the wavelengths of light that are produced by phototherapy machines. However, it contains harmful ultraviolet light and infrared radiation, and prolonged exposure has the potential to lead to sunburn, skin damage, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of sunlight administered alone or with filtering or amplifying devices for the prevention and treatment of clinical jaundice or laboratory-diagnosed hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search CENTRAL (2019, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL on 2 May 2019. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs. We updated the searches on 1 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs. We excluded crossover RCTs. Included studies must have evaluated sunlight (with or without filters or amplification) for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice in term or late preterm neonates. Neonates must have been enrolled in the study by one-week postnatal age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Our primary outcomes were: use of conventional phototherapy, treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion, ABE, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, and death.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (1103 infants). All three studies had small sample sizes, were unblinded, and were at high risk of bias. We planned to undertake four comparisons, but only found studies reporting on two. Sunlight with or without filters or amplification compared to no treatment for the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late preterm neonates One study of twice-daily sunlight exposure (30 to 60 minutes) compared to no treatment reported the incidence of jaundice may be reduced (risk ratio [RR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.82; risk difference [RD] -0.14, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.06; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 7, 95% CI 5 to 17; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence) and the number of days that an infant was jaundiced may be reduced (mean difference [MD] -2.20 days, 95% CI -2.60 to -1.80; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no data on safety or potential harmful effects of the intervention. The study did not assess use of conventional phototherapy, treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion, ABE, and long-term consequences of hyperbilirubinemia. The study showed that sunlight therapy may reduce rehospitalization rates within seven days of discharge for treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.11; RD -0.04, -0.08 to 0.01; 1 study, 482 infants; very low-certainty evidence). Sunlight with or without filters or amplification compared to other sources of phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in infants with confirmed hyperbilirubinemia Two studies (621 infants) compared the effect of filtered-sunlight exposure to other sources of phototherapy in infants with confirmed hyperbilirubinemia. Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) and conventional or intensive electric phototherapy led to a similar number of days of effective treatment (broadly defined as a minimal increase of total serum bilirubin in infants less than 72 hours old and a decrease in total serum bilirubin in infants more than 72 hours old on any day that at least four to five hours of sunlight therapy was available). There may be little or no difference in treatment failure requiring exchange transfusion (typical RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.73; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 2 studies, 621 infants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported ABE, and no infants developed this outcome (RR not estimable; RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; 1 study, 174 infants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported death as a reason for study withdrawal; no infants were withdrawn due to death (RR not estimable; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 1 study, 447 infants; low-certainty evidence). Neither study assessed long-term outcomes. Possible harms: both studies showed a probable increased risk for hyperthermia (body temperature greater than 37.5 °C) with FSPT (typical RR 4.39, 95% CI 2.98 to 6.47; typical RD 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 3, 95% CI 2 to 4; 2 studies, 621 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably no difference in hypothermia (body temperature less than 35.5 °C) (typical RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.03; typical RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; 2 studies, 621 infants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Sunlight may be an effective adjunct to conventional phototherapy in LMIC settings, may allow for rotational use of limited phototherapy machines, and may be preferable to families as it can allow for increased bonding. Filtration of sunlight to block harmful ultraviolet light and frequent temperature checks for babies under sunlight may be warranted for safety. Sunlight may be effective in preventing hyperbilirubinemia in some cases, but these studies have not demonstrated that sunlight alone is effective for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia given its sporadic availability and the low or very low certainty of the evidence in these studies.

### Neonatal jaundice: phototherapy [^112YUDQv]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2 to 4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different wavelengths of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different intensities of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different total doses of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of starting hospital phototherapy at different thresholds in term and preterm infants? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

Fourteen studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of different wavelengths, intensities, total doses, and threshold for commencement of the following intervention: hospital phototherapy.

### The need to implement effective phototherapy in resource-constrained settings [^1175oNSz]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phototherapy is the treatment of choice to reduce the severity of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia regardless of its etiology. Its implementation requires a technical framework that conforms to existing evidence-based guidelines that promote its safer and effective use worldwide. Optimal use of phototherapy has been defined by specific ranges of total serum bilirubin thresholds configured to an infant's postnatal age (in hours) and potential risk for bilirubin neurotoxicity. Effective phototherapy implies its use at specific blue light wavelengths (peak emission, 450 ± 20 nm) and emission spectrum (range, 400–520 nm), preferably in a narrow bandwidth that is delivered at an irradiance of ≥ 30 μW/cm(2)/nm to up to 80% of an infant's body surface area. However, this is often not feasible in clinical settings with limited or constrained resources. To identify and bridge implementation barriers, we propose minimum criteria for device performance for safe and practical use of phototherapy as a prophylactic intervention to prevent severe hyperbilirubinemia.

### Filtered sunlight versus intensive electric powered phototherapy in moderate-to-severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^114LaTpP]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Kernicterus resulting from severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a leading cause of preventable deaths and disabilities in low-income and middle-income countries, partly because high-quality intensive phototherapy is unavailable. Previously, we showed that filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) was efficacious and safe for treatment of mild-to-moderate neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. We aimed to extend these studies to infants with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinaemia.

Methods

We did a prospective, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial in Ogbomoso, Nigeria-a simulated rural setting. Near-term or term infants aged 14 days or younger who were of 35 weeks or more gestational age and with total serum bilirubin concentrations at or above the recommended age-dependent treatment levels for high-risk neonates were randomly assigned (1:1) to either FSPT or intensive electric phototherapy (IEPT). Randomisation was computer-generated, and neither clinicians nor the parents or guardians of participants were masked to group allocation. FSPT was delivered in a transparent polycarbonate room lined with commercial tinting films that transmitted effective phototherapeutic light, blocked ultraviolet light, and reduced infrared radiation. The primary outcome was efficacy, which was based on assessable treatment days only (ie, those on which at least 4 h of phototherapy was delivered) and defined as a rate of increase in total serum bilirubin concentrations of less than 3.4 μmol/L/h in infants aged 72 h or younger, or a decrease in total serum bilirubin concentrations in those older than 72 h. Safety was defined as no sustained hypothermia, hyperthermia, dehydration, or sunburn and was based on all treatment days. Analysis was by intention to treat with a non-inferiority margin of 10%.

Findings

Between July 31, 2015, and April 30, 2017, 174 neonates were enrolled and randomly assigned: 87 to FSPT and 87 to IEPT. Neonates in the FSPT group received 215 days of phototherapy, 82 (38%) of which were not assessable. Neonates in the IEPT group received 219 treatment days of phototherapy, 67 (31%) of which were not assessable. Median irradiance was 37.3 μW/cm 2 /nm (IQR 21.4–56.4) in the FSPT group and 50.4 μW/cm 2 /nm (44.5–66.2) in the IEPT group. FSPT was efficacious on 116 (87.2%) of 133 treatment days; IEPT was efficacious on 135 (88.8%) of 152 treatment days (mean difference -1.6%, 95% CI -9.9 to 6.7; p = 0.8165). Because the CI did not extend below -10%, we concluded that FSPT was not inferior to IEPT. Treatment was safe for all neonates.

Interpretation

FSPT is safe and no less efficacious than IEPT for treatment of moderate-to-severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in near-term and term infants.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^114QjQNs]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy exposure duration and strategies — Phototherapy can be administered continuously or intermittently (ie, cycled), and in view of potential adverse effects of excessive photon exposure, it is prudent to limit the total duration of light exposure or "irradiance dose". Small trials in term or near-term infants have reported that brief light exposure of 15 minutes per hour resulted in equivalent reduction of total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations as compared with continuous phototherapy. In current practice, total duration of phototherapy is determined by serial monitoring of TSB concentration and its discontinuation once a target TSB concentration is reached. Exposure strategies are defined as Continuous: uninterrupted exposure (as with "escalation of care"); Continual: brief interruptions for infant handling, parental bonding, and breastfeeding; and Intermittent (cycled): timed intervals (in minutes or hours) of nonexposure, with cycled phototherapy in extremely low birth weight infants proposed as 15 minutes on and 45 minutes off per hour.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112Jscfn]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Phototherapy — treatment principles and thresholds: Intensive phototherapy requires a narrow-spectrum LED blue light with an irradiance of at least 30 μW/cm2 per nm at a wavelength around 475 nm, and light outside the 460 to 490 nm range provides unnecessary heat and potentially harmful wavelengths. The advantage of intensive phototherapy is that it can quickly lower the TSB and should shorten the duration of treatment, and the primary goal of phototherapy is to decrease the likelihood of further increases in the TSB concentration that would lead to a need for escalation of care, including exchange transfusion. The recommended phototherapy thresholds are far below those at which overt acute bilirubin neurotoxicity or kernicterus occurs, and the committee determined that new evidence justified raising the phototherapy treatment thresholds by a narrow range. Phototherapy should not be used solely with a goal of preventing subtle adverse neurodevelopmental findings, and there is some evidence that phototherapy may lead to a small increase in the risk of subsequent childhood epilepsy; however, the committee believes that the benefit of phototherapy exceeds the small potential risk of epilepsy when the TSB is at or above the phototherapy threshold. Although direct exposure to sunlight can decrease TSB, practical limitations mean it is not recommended as a reliable therapeutic tool.

### Intermittent phototherapy versus continuous phototherapy for neonatal jaundice [^114tGUSH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Phototherapy is a widely accepted, effective first-line therapy for neonatal jaundice. It is traditionally used continuously but intermittent phototherapy has been proposed as an equally effective alternative with practical advantages of improved maternal feeding and bonding. The effectiveness of intermittent phototherapy compared with continuous phototherapy is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the safety and effectiveness of intermittent phototherapy compared with continuous phototherapy.

Search Methods

Searches were conducted on 31 January 2022 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web, MEDLINE and Embase via Ovid. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy in jaundiced infants (both term and preterm) up to the age of 30 days. We compared intermittent phototherapy with continuous phototherapy by any method and at any dose and duration as defined by the authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from included studies. We performed fixed-effect analyses and expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our primary outcomes of interest were rate of decline of serum bilirubin, and kernicterus. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs (1600 infants) in the review. There is one ongoing study and four awaiting classification. There was little or no difference between intermittent phototherapy and continuous phototherapy with respect to rate of decline of bilirubin in jaundiced newborn infants (MD -0.09 micromol/L/hr, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.03; I² = 61%; 10 studies; 1225 infants; low-certainty evidence). One study involving 60 infants reported no incidence of bilirubin induced brain dysfunction (BIND). It is uncertain whether either intermittent or continuous phototherapy reduces BIND because the certainty of this evidence is very low. There was little or no difference in treatment failure (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.15; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.29 to 9.17; 1 study; 75 infants; very low-certainty evidence) or infant mortality (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31 I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1470 infants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence detected little or no difference between intermittent and continuous phototherapy with respect to rate of decline of bilirubin. Continuous phototherapy appears to be more effective in preterm infants, however, the risks of continuous phototherapy and the potential benefits of a slightly lower bilirubin level are unknown. Intermittent phototherapy is associated with a decrease in the total number of hours of phototherapy exposure. There are theoretical benefits to intermittent regimens but there are important safety outcomes that were inadequately addressed. Large, well designed, prospective trials are needed in both preterm and term infants before it can be concluded that intermittent and continuous phototherapy regimens are equally effective.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^114NGLNQ]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy — interpretation of adverse outcomes and device evolution — indicates that studies were unable to categorically differentiate or distinguish adverse outcomes that could be independently attributed to either the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia or exposure to phototherapy, and therefore treatment thresholds should be established that can balance the risk of adverse effects of phototherapy and its possible benefit at reducing total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations before reaching potential neurotoxic levels. These retrospective studies should also be interpreted by the ongoing evolution, over the past 30 years, of phototherapy devices that no longer incorporate heat-generating lamps and filter UV irradiation to avoid unnecessarily high irradiances.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^115YRsBL]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Clinical impact and initiation thresholds — TSB-based decision-making and dosing: Clinical trials have validated the efficacy of phototherapy in reducing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 25 mg/dL [> 428 μmol/L]), and initiation of phototherapy is clinically determined when a specific range of TSB threshold values based on gestational age (in weeks), postnatal age (in hours), and presence or absence of bilirubin neurotoxicity risk factors is reached; the TSB thresholds should provide a sufficient margin of safety and account for interlaboratory variation and individual vulnerability, and phototherapy needs to be delivered in measurable doses (irradiance), which makes it conceptually similar to pharmacotherapy.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^116pmVdE]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia — expected phototherapy response and monitoring — The clinical impact of phototherapy should normally become evident within 4 hours of initiation with an anticipated decrease in total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentrations of > 2 mg/dL (34 μmol/L). Conversion of bilirubin molecules to nontoxic photoisomers occurs within seconds of light exposure and reaches a plateau by 2 hours. Timely implementation of phototherapy for excessive hyperbilirubinemia (TSB > 25 mg/dL [> 428 μmol/L]) is sometimes referred to as the "crash-cart" approach. A minimal reduction in the TSB concentration rise may suggest a "plateau effect" and may be considered a partial response. Serial measurements of TSB concentrations used to monitor the effectiveness of phototherapy by the time rate of TSB decline (mg/dL per hour) should be based on the current 2022 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline Revision.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^1154RAMP]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

In the above sections, we assessed the influences of the duration of neonatal exposure to air pollution, air pollutant concentration newborns were exposed to, and maternal exposure to air pollution in the third trimester of pregnancy on the risk of neonatal jaundice, respectively. Here we estimated the sole effect of each factor on neonatal jaundice after the other two factors were controlled (see Methods).

We find that the relationship between each factor and neonatal jaundice, after controlling the other two factors, were very similar to the relationship without controlling the other two factors (Supplementary Figs. 3–5), suggesting that the influences of individual factors on neonatal jaundice were largely independent.

In this study population, the newborns stayed in the wards all the time before they were discharged from the hospital, and thus they were not exposed to outdoor sunlight. As a result, we found that the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) incident solar irradiance did not affect the relationship between air pollution exposure and the incidence of neonatal jaundice, by stratified analysis of TOA irradiance (see Methods, Supplementary Table 8).

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^115guLxM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Clinical experience suggests increased incidences of neonatal jaundice when air quality worsens, yet no studies have quantified this relationship. Here we reports investigations in 25,782 newborns showing an increase in newborn's bilirubin levels, the indicator of neonatal jaundice risk, by 0.076 (95% CI: 0.027–0.125), 0.029 (0.014–0.044) and 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002–0.016) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for PM 2.5 exposure in the concentration ranges of 10–35, 35–75 and 75–200 μg/m 3, respectively. The response is 0.094 (0.077–0.111) and 0.161 (0.07–0.252) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for SO 2 exposure at 10–15 and above 15 μg/m 3, respectively, and 0.351 (0.314–0.388) mg/dL per mg/m 3 for CO exposure. Bilirubin levels increase linearly with exposure time between 0 and 48 h. Positive relationship between maternal exposure and newborn bilirubin level is also quantitated. The jaundice−pollution relationship is not affected by top-of-atmosphere incident solar irradiance and atmospheric visibility. Improving air quality may therefore be key to lowering the neonatal jaundice risk.

### Phototherapy – traditional and nontraditional [^115eMUz9]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

An observation by an English nurse in 1956 led to the discovery that visible light could lower serum bilirubin levels in newborn infants, and subsequent research showed how photons of light energy are absorbed by the bilirubin molecule converting it into isomers that are readily excreted by the liver and the kidney. Understanding the dose-response effect and other factors that influence the way light works to lower bilirubin levels has led to the effective use of phototherapy and has eliminated the need for exchange transfusion in almost all jaundiced infants.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114bpSq6]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To standardize the use of phototherapy consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation.

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed. Phototherapy devices currently marketed in the United States that incorporate fluorescent, halogen, fiber-optic, or blue light-emitting diode light sources were assessed in the laboratory.

Results

The efficacy of phototherapy units varies widely because of differences in light source and configuration. The following characteristics of a device contribute to its effectiveness: (1) emission of light in the blue-to-green range that overlaps the in vivo plasma bilirubin absorption spectrum (~460–490 nm); (2) irradiance of at least 30 μW · cm(-2) · nm(-1) (confirmed with an appropriate irradiance meter calibrated over the appropriate wavelength range); (3) illumination of maximal body surface; and (4) demonstration of a decrease in total bilirubin concentrations during the first 4 to 6 hours of exposure. RECOMMENDATIONS (SEE APPENDIX FOR GRADING DEFINITION): The intensity and spectral output of phototherapy devices is useful in predicting potential effectiveness in treating hyperbilirubinemia (group B recommendation). Clinical effectiveness should be evaluated before and monitored during use (group B recommendation). Blocking the light source or reducing exposed body surface should be avoided (group B recommendation). Standardization of irradiance meters, improvements in device design, and lower-upper limits of light intensity for phototherapy units merit further study. Comparing the in vivo performance of devices is not practical, in general, and alternative procedures need to be explored.

### A randomized trial of phototherapy with filtered sunlight in African neonates [^1117pm42]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Sequelae of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia constitute a substantial disease burden in areas where effective conventional phototherapy is unavailable. We previously found that the use of filtered sunlight for the purpose of phototherapy is a safe and efficacious method for reducing total bilirubin. However, its relative safety and efficacy as compared with conventional phototherapy are unknown.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled noninferiority trial in which filtered sunlight was compared with conventional phototherapy for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late-preterm neonates in a large, urban Nigerian maternity hospital. The primary end point was efficacy, which was defined as a rate of increase in total serum bilirubin of less than 0.2 mg per deciliter per hour for infants up to 72 hours of age or a decrease in total serum bilirubin for infants older than 72 hours of age who received at least 5 hours of phototherapy; we prespecified a noninferiority margin of 10% for the difference in efficacy rates between groups. The need for an exchange transfusion was a secondary end point. We also assessed safety, which was defined as the absence of the need to withdraw therapy because of hyperthermia, hypothermia, dehydration, or sunburn.

Results

We enrolled 447 infants and randomly assigned 224 to filtered sunlight and 223 to conventional phototherapy. Filtered sunlight was efficacious on 93% of treatment days that could be evaluated, as compared with 90% for conventional phototherapy, and had a higher mean level of irradiance (40 vs. 17 μW per square centimeter per nanometer, P < 0.001). Temperatures higher than 38.0°C occurred in 5% of the infants receiving filtered sunlight and in 1% of those receiving conventional phototherapy (P < 0.001), but no infant met the criteria for withdrawal from the study for reasons of safety or required an exchange transfusion.

Conclusions

Filtered sunlight was noninferior to conventional phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and did not result in any study withdrawals for reasons of safety.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^113BSCJQ]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Risk of phototherapy in infants 35 or more weeks — phototherapy use over the past 6 decades in newborn infants 35 or more weeks of gestation has been safe, effective, and beneficial to neonatal public health, and when performed under medical supervision, no known significant or worrisome risks have been reported. However, concerns about photo-oxidative injury or superficial skin DNA damage have been raised in multiple studies that applied inconsistent light dosing, and it has been suggested that phototherapy is associated with a small, statistical risk of subsequent cancer and epilepsy; most epidemiologic reports are confounded by inconsistent devices and practices including UV exposure or unfiltered direct sunlight, and UV irradiation may occur with fluorescent light sources though mutagenic risk is likely very small and probably inconsequential in most cases. Blue‑green LED devices do not pose this UV risk but have been associated with photo‑oxidation in exposed tissues; in extremely preterm infants, a trial in those with birth weight < 750 g suggests a Bayesian increase in mortality, and another trial is comparing continuous versus cycled phototherapy to assess relative safety and efficacy of reducing exposure, while recent associations with cancer risks and epilepsy need further validation before any changes in current guidelines for clinical practice are warranted.

### Pathogenesis and management of indirect hyperbilirubinemia in preterm neonates less than 35 weeks: moving toward a standardized approach [^111NEpGt]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature infants have a higher incidence of indirect hyperbilirubinemia than term infants. Management of neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia in late preterm and term neonates has been well addressed by recognized, consensus-based guidelines. However, the extension of these guidelines to the preterm population has been an area of uncertainty because of limited evidence. This leads to variation in clinical practice and lack of recognition of the spectrum of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) in this population. Preterm infants are metabolically immature and at higher risk for BIND at lower bilirubin levels than their term counterparts. Early use of phototherapy to eliminate BIND and minimize the need for exchange transfusion is the goal of treatment in premature neonates. Although considered relatively safe, phototherapy does have side effects, and some NICUs tend to overuse phototherapy. In this review, we describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of BIND in preterm neonates, and discuss our approach to standardized management of indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the vulnerable preterm population. The proposed treatment charts suggest early use of phototherapy in preterm neonates with the aim of reducing exposure to high irradiance levels, minimizing the need for exchange transfusions, and preventing BIND. The charts are pragmatic and have additional curves for stopping phototherapy and escalating its intensity. Having a standardized approach would support future research and quality improvement initiatives that examine dose and duration of phototherapy exposure with relation to outcomes.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^113J2FfS]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Irradiance — irradiance is the light intensity or energy output of a device and is measured with a radiometer (W/cm2) or spectroradiometer (μW/cm2/nm); the AAP has recommended that for intensive phototherapy, an irradiance of 30 μW/cm2/nm (range 25 to 35) of blue-green light at around 478 nm in the range 460 to 490 nm be applied. Decline in TSB concentrations may flatten as irradiance doses exceed > 35 μW/cm2/nm, and safety and benefits of much higher doses have yet to be reported. Currently, no single method is in general use for measuring total phototherapy doses, so radiometers recommended by the manufacturer should be used, and visual estimations or ordinary photometric or colorimetric light meters are inappropriate. In practice, maximal irradiance can be achieved by bringing a light source close to the infant; however, halogen or tungsten lights should not be used because of the possibility for heat-generated burns, and with some devices decreasing the distance may severely reduce the exposed body surface area (BSA). A record of therapy is best described by duration, number of devices, daily measure at skin level exposure, and percent of BSA exposed.

### Filtered-sunlight phototherapy for newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia: a randomized trial [^115BNoeC]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) is safe and non-inferior to conventional phototherapy for treating mild-to-moderate hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization. We evaluated the performance of FSPT among newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia.

Methods

Newborns were randomized to FSPT or intensive electric phototherapy (IEPT). Primary outcomes were safety, defined as the absence of hyperthermia, hypothermia, dehydration, or sunburn; and efficacy, defined as the rate of increase in total serum or plasma bilirubin (TSB) < 3.4µmol/L/h for newborns aged ≤ 72h or a decrease in TSB for newborns aged > 72h who received ≥ 4h of phototherapy. Secondary outcomes were night-time phototherapy, exchange transfusion (ET), and neonatal mortality rates.

Results

Some 104 newborns were assigned to FSPT (n = 52) or IEPT (n = 52). Mean irradiance was 27.7 ± 7.3μW/cm²/nm under FSPT and 36.1 ± 8.3μW/cm²/nm under IEPT. FSPT and IEPT were 93.4% and 93.3% efficacious in all treatment days, respectively. No newborn developed controlled hyperthermia or met the criteria for withdrawal for safety reasons under FSPT. Night-time phototherapy was more frequent under FSPT (52.5%) than IEPT (43.4%). Three neonates (FSPT = 2 and IEPT = 1) had ET. No baby died.

Conclusion

Where practicable, FSPT is safe and non-inferior to IEPT for treating neonates with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization when there is no effective IEPT.

Gov Number

NCT02612727 (24/11/2015).

Impact

Filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FSPT) is safe and efficacious for treating newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia during birth hospitalization. Compared to intensive electric phototherapy, FSPT is not associated with higher rates of exchange transfusion or mortality. The incidence of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia with or without acute bilirubin encephalopathy is rare within 72h of life in a population with high prevalence of G6PD deficiency and ABO incompatibility risk. In settings where intensive electric phototherapy that meets the recommended minimum irradiance threshold of 30μW/cm²/nm cannot be assured, FSPT should be considered for at least 4h for newborns with moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia when practicable.

American Academy of Pediatrics technical report — phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants 35 or more weeks of gestation — details device types and parameters associated with effectiveness and monitoring. Literature was reviewed on devices that "incorporate blue to blue-green light-emitting diode, fluorescent, halogen, or fiberoptic light sources". The report notes that "the most effective and safest devices have the following characteristics" including narrow band blue to green light-emitting diode lamps "∼460–490 nm wavelength range; 478 nm optimal", irradiance "of at least 30 μW/cm2/nm (in term infants)", and illumination of "the exposed maximal body surface area of an infant (35% to 80%)". It specifies that "accurate irradiance measurements should be performed using the appropriate irradiance meter calibrated for the wavelength range delivered by the phototherapy device". With proper administration to an infant without concurrent hemolysis, bilirubin "will decrease within the first 4 to 6 hours of initiation".

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^115K2Y3r]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy — research needs — highlights that many gaps in knowledge remain regarding the use of phototherapy and that the following are among the most important: a validated cost-effective device that can measure real-time wavelength and irradiance delivered by a phototherapy device is urgently needed to be able to assess the true efficiency of phototherapy in reducing TSB concentrations; the safety and efficacy of home phototherapy for specific types of newborn infants at specific TSB thresholds remains a research priority; rigorously designed and appropriately powered studies (such as those evaluating the use of cycled [intermittent] phototherapy) are needed to definitively determine the potential long-term sequelae of phototherapy; and design technologies that can continuously measure total photon dose (irradiance delivered to BSA in real time) to identify potential adverse outcomes.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn… [^113ZqYGr]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The exact bilirubin concentration associated with kernicterus in the healthy term infant is unpredictable. Recommendations for the management of hyperbilirubinemia in healthy term newborns have been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Treatment PHOTOTHERAPY Phototherapy employs blue wavelengths of light to alter unconjugated bilirubin in the skin. The bilirubin is converted to less toxic water-soluble photoisomers that are excreted in the bile and urine without conjugation. The decision to initiate phototherapy is based on the newborn's age and total serum bilirubin level. 1 The efficacy of phototherapy depends on several important factors. The ideal configuration is four special blue bulbs placed centrally, with two daylight fluorescent tubes on either side. The power output of the lights is directly related to the distance between the lights and the newborn. 23 Ideally, all lights should be 15 to 20 cm from the infant.

2 To expose the greatest surface area, the newborn should be naked except for eye shields. For double phototherapy, a fiber-optic pad can be placed under the newborn. This method is twice as effective as standard phototherapy.
5. The only contraindication to the use of phototherapy is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, as occurs in patients with cholestasis and hepatic disease. In this setting, phototherapy may cause a dark grayish-brown discoloration of the skin. 2 Potential problems that may occur with phototherapy include burns, retinal damage, thermoregulatory instability, loose stools, dehydration, skin rash, and tanning of the skin. Because phototherapy is continuous, treatment also involves significant separation of the infant and parents. With intensive phototherapy, the total serum bilirubin level should decline by 1 to 2 mg per dL within four to six hours.

1, 5 The bilirubin level may decline more slowly in breastfed infants than in formula-fed infants. 3 Phototherapy usually can be discontinued when the total serum bilirubin level is below 15 mg per dL. 1 The average rebound bilirubin level after phototherapy is below 1 mg per dL. Therefore, hospital discharge of most infants does not have to be delayed to monitor for rebound elevation. 24, 25.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^117T4U2F]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Systematic reviews and quantified adverse outcomes — the AAP Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines Development and Implementation Manual notes new data on potential phototherapy-related harms, the committee reviewed all relevant literature without a date restriction, and two systematic reviews conducted under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Guideline assessed adverse clinically detectable effects versus non-treatment. A review search of 45 manuscripts showed that phototherapy is associated with a statistically significant yet low overall risk of causing potential harm, and childhood seizures are one of the most serious but infrequent illnesses associated with phototherapy used for hyperbilirubinemia with an adjusted 10-year excess risk of 2.4; 95% confidence interval: 0.6–4.1 per 1000 phototherapy-treated infants; despite this association, the rationale remains unclear and the review did not offer rationale for cause and effect.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^1137VtSt]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Clinical experience suggests increased incidences of neonatal jaundice when air quality worsens, yet no studies have quantified this relationship. Here we reports investigations in 25,782 newborns showing an increase in newborn's bilirubin levels, the indicator of neonatal jaundice risk, by 0.076 (95% CI: 0.027–0.125), 0.029 (0.014–0.044) and 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002–0.016) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for PM 2.5 exposure in the concentration ranges of 10–35, 35–75 and 75–200μg/m 3, respectively. The response is 0.094 (0.077–0.111) and 0.161 (0.07–0.252) mg/dL per μg/m 3 for SO 2 exposure at 10–15 and above 15μg/m 3, respectively, and 0.351 (0.314–0.388) mg/dL per mg/m 3 for CO exposure. Bilirubin levels increase linearly with exposure time between 0 and 48h. Positive relationship between maternal exposure and newborn bilirubin level is also quantitated. The jaundice-pollution relationship is not affected by top-of-atmosphere incident solar irradiance and atmospheric visibility. Improving air quality may therefore be key to lowering the neonatal jaundice risk.

### Effectiveness of FIBEROPTIC phototherapy compared to conventional phototherapy in treating HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA amongst term neonates: a randomized controlled trial [^115rzWHN]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum bilirubin reduction rate was assessed as the decline in the TSB levels for the duration of exposure to phototherapy, expressed as a percentage of decline per hour. This was monitored through daily total serum bilirubin levels. Treatment failure was defined as the need for additional phototherapy units ('double phototherapy') determined by serial serum bilirubin response while on phototherapy; a rise in serum bilirubin level more than 9 μmol /L per hour after phototherapy initiation was an indicator for double phototherapy. Phototherapy was stopped when serum bilirubin levels were 50 μmol/L below the phototherapy threshold value on the AAP nomogram. Treatment duration was then assessed as the duration of time of exposure to phototherapy in hours.

Blood samples were analyzed at the KCMC clinical laboratory. The Cobas Integra 400 Plus (Roche Company) was used to analyze the serum bilirubin levels. The sample reached the laboratory within 15 min of collection. A minimum of 1 mL of blood was required. Care was taken to prevent exposure to light by placing the samples in a dark blood transportation box.

Neonates were closely monitored for short term side effects of treatment which included: loose, greenish stools; hydration status: assessed as the difference in daily body weight after starting PT (5% body weight loss was considered as mild dehydration, 5–10% body weight loss was considered as moderate dehydration and more than 10% body weight loss was considered as severe dehydration); skin rashes and brownish discoloration of skin assessed by a dermatologist. Participant's vital signs including temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate were monitored every 4 h throughout phototherapy. Weight was checked daily.

Feeds were calculated based on the daily kilocalories requirement for age. At enrollment, mothers were asked to express breast milk to quantify the milk production. When necessary, neonates were supplemented with infant formula milk to maintain the total daily feeds requirement. Neonates were fed every 3 h in all PT groups. Those who were not maintaining adequate oral intake were supplemented with IV fluids to maintain the total daily fluid requirement, considering the postnatal age, and clinical and laboratory findings.

### Effectiveness of FIBEROPTIC phototherapy compared to conventional phototherapy in treating HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA amongst term neonates: a randomized controlled trial [^1149mpzM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We hypothesize that increasing both the illuminated area and irradiance will improve the effectiveness of fiberoptic phototherapy with regard to bilirubin reduction rate and duration of treatment among term neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Improved effectiveness with fiberoptic phototherapy might mitigate the side effects of conventional phototherapy, create greater mother neonate bonding, encourage breastfeeding and obviates the need for eye patches.

Therefore, our study aimed to compare fiberoptic phototherapy with both a larger illuminated area and high irradiance to conventional phototherapy with regard to bilirubin reduction rate, short term side effects and duration of treatment among term neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^115rTPTS]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Costs of providing intensive or special care for jaundiced newborns could be prohibitive, next only to that of caring for preterm babies in LMICs. However, the development of affordable phototherapy devices and using simple inexpensive enhancements such as hanging white reflecting material around cots (being careful to avoid overheating particularly from halogen lamps), changing bulbs regularly and reducing the distance between baby and lamps, improve the effectiveness of phototherapy. WHO maintains a valuable compendium of innovative and low-cost technologies including phototherapy devices recommended for LMICs. Whatever the light-source, the effectiveness of phototherapy devices can be compromised by erratic power supply, inadequate skin exposure from overcrowding with multiple infants placed under a single device, sub-optimal irradiance levels, and poor device maintenance. Failure to address these issues is likely to increase the frequency of avoidable exchange transfusion. It is, therefore, essential that phototherapy devices are properly monitored, regularly maintained, and staff well trained on how to care for infants receiving phototherapy. If enough effective phototherapy devices are not available in very busy resource-constrained settings, clinical judgement as to which infants should receive priority based on the risk of ABE may be required. Under such conditions, a BIND assessment can aid decisions for intervention.

Guidelines for hyperbilirubinaemia in many high-income countries prohibit exposure to sunlight as a form of treatment. This is primarily due to safety concerns regarding potentially harmful infrared and ultraviolet rays and possible sunburn. In Ghana, exposure of jaundiced infants to sunlight is acknowledged as a treatment option, but WHO guidelines and some other developing countries like Malaysia, India and Kenya discourage or have not made provisions for sunlight therapy (see Additional file 1: Table S1). However, mothers and caregivers with or without the support of health workers continue to expose their jaundiced babies to direct sunlight even in high-income countries. Emerging evidence suggests that the potential risks can be mitigated through specially filtered film canopies which have been successfully piloted in West Africa. However, their use is still experimental and limited to daytime care at periods with favourable climatic conditions. In remote tropical locations where access to conventional treatment is not assured, the trade-off between the risk of ABE/kernicterus and of exposure to sunlight remains a challenge that requires individual and informed judgment call in the patient's best interest.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^113tPBZA]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Evidence for effective phototherapy — Light-emission characteristics of phototherapy devices help in predicting their effectiveness (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B), and clinical effectiveness of a specific device, known before use, allows for individualized monitoring during its application (Aggregate Evidence Quality, Grade A) for a safer implementation strategy. Local guidelines (instructions) for routine clinical use should be made available to clinical staff, and obstructing the light source and reducing the exposed body surface area (BSA) must be avoided (Aggregate Evidence Quality, Grade B). In low-resource locations, the most relevant evidence-based practice should be sought. The Food and Drug Administration has not approved use of any improved technologies that have been modified and adapted for cost-savings, and such improvised devices must still meet minimum efficacy and safety standards and have approval by local institutional regulatory agencies.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^1134YqEZ]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize the principles and application of phototherapy consistent with the current 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics "Clinical Practice Guideline Revision for the Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation".

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed regarding phototherapy devices in the United States, specifically those that incorporate blue to blue-green light-emitting diode, fluorescent, halogen, or fiberoptic light sources, and their currently marketed indications.

Results

The efficacy of phototherapy devices varies widely because of nonstandardized use of light sources and configurations and irradiance meters. In summary, the most effective and safest devices have the following characteristics: (1) incorporation of narrow band blue-to-green light-emitting diode lamps (∼460–490 nm wavelength range; 478 nm optimal) that would best overlap the bilirubin absorption spectrum; (2) emission of irradiance of at least 30 µW/cm2/nm (in term infants); and (3) illumination of the exposed maximal body surface area of an infant (35% to 80%). Furthermore, accurate irradiance measurements should be performed using the appropriate irradiance meter calibrated for the wavelength range delivered by the phototherapy device.

Conclusions

With proper administration of effective phototherapy to an infant without concurrent hemolysis, total serum or plasma bilirubin concentrations will decrease within the first 4 to 6 hours of initiation safely and effectively.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Sunlight exposure has many health benefits for newborns and infants.
Adequate exposure of the neonate to sunshine requires exposure of the neonate to sunlight in the morning, 8:00–10:00, for 30–60 min.
Inadequate exposure of neonates to sunshine leads to vitamin D deficiency and jaundice, which are common health problems worldwide.

### Light-emitting diode phototherapy for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates [^1165BgLg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. The commonly used light sources for providing phototherapy are special blue fluorescent tubes, compact fluorescent tubes and halogen spotlights. However, light emitting diodes (LEDs) as light sources with high luminous intensity, narrow wavelength band and higher delivered irradiance could make phototherapy more efficacious than the conventional phototherapy units.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of LED phototherapy as compared to conventional phototherapy in decreasing serum total bilirubin levels and duration of treatment in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April 30, 2010) and EMBASE (1988 to July 8, 2009). Handsearches of the proceedings of annual meetings of The European Society for Paediatric Research and The Society for Pediatric Research were conducted through 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled neonates (term and preterm) with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and compared LED phototherapy with other light sources (fluorescent tubes, compact fluorescent tubes, halogen spotlight; method of administration: conventional or fibreoptic).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group for data collection and analysis.

Main Results

Six randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four studies compared LED and halogen light sources. Two studies compared LED and compact fluorescent light sources. The duration of phototherapy (six studies, 630 neonates) was comparable in LED and non-LED phototherapy groups (mean difference (hours) -0.43, 95% CI -1.91 to 1.05). The rate of decline of serum total bilirubin (STB) (four studies, 511 neonates) was also similar in the two groups (mean difference (mg/dL/hour) 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04). Treatment failure, defined as the need of additional phototherapy or exchange blood transfusion (1 study, 272 neonates), was comparable (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 7.17). Side effects of phototherapy such as hypothermia (RR 6.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 122.97), hyperthermia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.11) and skin rash (RR 1.83, 95% CI 0.17 to 19.96) were rare and occurred with similar frequency in the two groups.

Authors' Conclusions

LED light source phototherapy is efficacious in bringing down levels of serum total bilirubin at rates that are similar to phototherapy with conventional (compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) or halogen) light sources. Further studies are warranted for evaluating efficacy of LED phototherapy in neonates with haemolytic jaundice or in the presence of severe hyperbilirubinaemia (STB ≥ 20 mg/dL).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (indications for discontinuation), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing phototherapy when the total serum bilirubin has decreased by at least 2 mg/dL below the hour-specific threshold at the initiation of phototherapy. Consider continuing phototherapy for a longer period if there are risk factors for rebound hyperbilirubinemia (such as gestational age < 38 weeks, age < 48 hours at the start of phototherapy, hemolytic disease).

Alternative therapies — natural sunlight (heliotherapy) — are described with both risks and filtered-use approaches. The "sun emits blue-green light in the spectrum needed to most effectively convert bilirubin to its water-soluble isomers for excretion", but "a significant fraction of sunlight is in the UV region (< 400 nm)", which is potentially damaging. Evaluation of "window-tinting films, which have the ability to block UVA (315–400 nm) and IR (> 700 nm) and to selectively transmit visible light including therapeutic blue light", found that transmission of therapeutic "blue-green light (400–520 nm)" through films "ranged from 24% to 83% compared with unfiltered solar radiation". Evidence from settings with limited phototherapy resources supports filtered sunlight with "close monitoring of temperature and overall clinical status", and "Efficacy of filtered-sunlight phototherapy has been shown in clinical studies in Nigeria".

### Neonatal jaundice [^115gQBLJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2–4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1–2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: albumin infusion, exchange transfusion, home phototherapy, hospital phototherapy, tin-mesoporphyrin.

Phototherapy device wavelength standards — For treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, bilirubin absorbs visible light most strongly in the blue region (range: 460–490 nm), with a specific peak wavelength around 478 nm and the most effective light in the blue-to-green (~460 to 490 nm) region; recent in vitro and clinical work indicates light in the blue-green region (478 nm) is optimal, and devices emitting narrow wavelengths within the blue-green (460 to 490 nm, 478 nm optimal) are currently the most effective. Devices that incorporate blue or blue-green LEDs in this range are described as the most effective and have a long lifetime (> 20 000 hours) with low heat output, low infrared emission, and no ultraviolet emission; the visible white light spectrum ranges from approximately 400 to 700 nm, and early devices used blue fluorescent-tube sources with 420- to 480-nm emission.

Optimal BSA — complete (100%) exposure of the total body surface area (BSA) to light is impractical; circumferential illumination achieving total BSA exposure of > 80% with devices arranged to yield 360° exposure has been achieved, whereas in clinical practice planar exposure typically leaves approximately 35% of total BSA exposed (ventral or dorsal) with either overhead lights or phototherapy mattresses/blankets. Changing an infant's position during phototherapy may place the infant at risk for unsafe nonsupine sleep positions, and several well-designed studies have demonstrated the lack of any beneficial effect of changing infant position under phototherapy.

Phototherapy technique and bilirubin photochemistry — wavelengths, kinetics, and response: Phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia uses blue-green light in the wavelength range (460–490 nm), preferably with an optimal peak of 478 nm, producing almost immediate photo-isomerization of unconjugated bilirubin in the skin to the excretable water soluble 4Z,15E photoisomer, peaking within 120 minutes; about 20% of bilirubin is converted to the 4Z,15E photoisomer and 5% to lumirubin, phototherapy is an essential intervention for severe hyperbilirubinemia with timing guided by serial TSB measurements and risk factor screening, and failure of response is unusual unless there is hemolysis or use of inappropriate phototherapy devices.

### Safety and efficacy of filtered sunlight in treatment of jaundice in African neonates [^113PZt8V]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluate safety and efficacy of filtered-sunlight phototherapy (FS-PT).

Methods

Term/late preterm infants #14 days old with clinically significant jaundice, assessed by total bilirubin (TB) levels, were recruited from a maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria. Sunlight was filtered with commercial window-tinting films that remove most UV and significant levels of infrared light and transmit effective levels of therapeutic blue light. After placing infants under an FS-PT canopy, hourly measurements of axillary temperatures, monitoring for sunburn, dehydration, and irradiances of filtered sunlight were performed. Treatment was deemed safe and efficacious if infants were able to stay in FS-PT for 5 hours and rate of rise of TB was ,0.2 mg/dL/h for infants #72 hours of age or TB decreased for infants .72 hours of age.

Results

A total of 227 infants received 258 days of FS-PT. No infant developed sunburn or dehydration. On 85 (33%) of 258 treatment days, infants were removed briefly from FS-PT due to minor temperature-related adverse events. No infant met study exit criteria. FS-PT was efficacious in 92% (181/197) of evaluable treatment days. Mean 6 SD TB change was –0.06 6 0.19 mg/dL/h. The mean 6 SD (range) irradiance of FS-PT was 38 6 22 (2–115) mW/cm2/nm, measured by the BiliBlanket Meter II.

Conclusions

With appropriate monitoring, filtered sunlight is a novel, practical, and inexpensive method of PT that potentially offers safe and efficacious treatment strategy for management of neonatal jaundice in tropical countries where conventional PT treatment is not available.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

### Phototherapy: current methods and future directions [^116hPpvt]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Phototherapy is the most common therapeutic intervention used for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. Although it has become a mainstay since its introduction in 1958, a better understanding of the photobiology of bilirubin, characteristics of the phototherapy devices, the efficacy and safety considerations of phototherapy applications, and improvements in spectroradiometers and phototherapy devices are necessary for more predictable and improved clinical practices and outcomes. A step forward in instituting consistent, uniform, and effective use of phototherapy is the recent American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guideline on the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation, which outlines a clinical strategy for the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia and contains direct recommendations for the application of phototherapy. This article reviews the parameters that determine the efficacy of phototherapy, briefly discusses current devices and methods used to deliver phototherapy, and speculates on future directions and studies that are still needed to complement our presently incomplete knowledge of the facets of this common mode of therapy.

Risk when below phototherapy threshold and when to stop checking: Among infants with TSB concentrations below the phototherapy threshold, the potential need for future phototherapy or escalation of care increases the closer the TSB is to the phototherapy threshold; however, once a spontaneous decline in TcB or TSB over at least 6 hours has been documented and absent other worrisome signs, additional bilirubin measurements are not necessary.

Phototherapy device configuration and exposure optimization — Use of more than 1 phototherapy device can improve effectiveness by increasing a greater available skin surface illumination, but care must be taken to avoid interference and presence of shadows and, thereby, ensure a uniformly irradiated light footprint. Applications in practice indicate that physical obstruction of light by equipment decreases the exposed body surface area (BSA), circumferential phototherapy maximizes the exposed area, combining overhead and below-infant devices could increase the BSA exposed, and in incubators light is best delivered perpendicular to the surface to minimize reflectance, shadows, and loss of efficacy; delineating "single, double, or triple" phototherapy fails to account for extent of BSA exposed, wavelength of light, and uniformity of irradiance at the skin surface level.

### Periodic change of body position under phototherapy in term and preterm neonates with hyperbilirubinaemia [^112uj32h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. Periodic change in position of the neonate under phototherapy (from supine to prone or lateral positions) may improve the efficiency of phototherapy by hastening the access of phototherapy light to bilirubin deposited in different parts of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of periodic change of body position during phototherapy as compared to no prescribed change in body position, on serum total bilirubin level and duration of treatment in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia during the first 28 days of life. Secondary objectives of the review included evaluation of the efficacy of periodic change of body position on the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of bilirubin-induced neurological damage (BIND), side effects of phototherapy, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to run comprehensive searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions on 5 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs if they enrolled neonates (term and preterm) of either gender with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy and compared periodic change of the body position of the infant under phototherapy with no prescribed change in body position.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, consulting with a third review author in the case of disagreement. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including assessing the risk of bias of included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were the duration of phototherapy and rate of fall of serum bilirubin at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included the need for exchange transfusion, number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, and SIDS.

Main Results

We included five studies (343 neonates) with an overall high risk of bias in the review. The body position under phototherapy was changed every two hours or every two-and-a-half hours in two studies each, and every three hours in one study. Three of the five studies included healthy term neonates, whilst the other two studies also included preterm neonates (≥ 33 weeks' gestation); however, separate data about review outcomes in preterm neonates were not available. Periodic change in body position may lead to little or no difference in the duration of phototherapy (mean difference (MD) 1.71 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.17 to 6.59 hours; I² = 58%; 4 studies, 231 participants; low certainty evidence). Only one study reported the rate of fall of serum total bilirubin at 24 hours of starting the phototherapy. Periodic change in body position may lead to little or no difference in the rate of fall of serum total bilirubin at 24 hours (MD 0.02 mg/dL/h, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06 mg/dL/h; 1 study, 100 participants; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to risk of bias and imprecision. None of the included studies reported the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, or SIDS. Lack of separate data precluded subgroup analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of periodic change of body position compared with no prescribed change of body position under phototherapy. There is low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in the duration of phototherapy and rate of fall in bilirubin at 24 hours of starting phototherapy between periodic change in body position and no prescribed change of body position under phototherapy in term and preterm neonates. None of the included studies reported the effect of change of position on the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, or SIDS. One study is awaiting classification and could not be included in the review. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of periodic change in body position under phototherapy, especially in neonates with haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia and in very preterm neonates. The results of this systematic review apply mainly to neonates born at late-preterm or term gestation receiving phototherapy for non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia.

### Hematological parameter changes and associated factors in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia treated with phototherapy [^112vejqY]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperbilirubinemia, also called jaundice, refers to a condition where the skin, sclera, and conjunctiva appear yellow due to elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood.

The main treatment options for severe hyperbilirubinemia include phototherapy (PT) exchange transfusion and pharmacological treatment. PT involves exposing the neonate's skin to special blue or white light to break down excess bilirubin in the blood. This process converts bilirubin to lumirubin, a compound that does not require conjugation in the liver and can be directly excreted in the urine or bile.

Studies suggest that the use of PT may have a direct impact on the function and expression of certain cell surface receptors, such as adhesion molecules, cytokines, and growth factor receptors. The possible mechanism behind the impact of PT on cell surface receptors involves the absorption of light energy by the bilirubin molecule, which leads to the formation of photoproducts. These photoproducts can directly bind to cell surface receptors, altering their conformation and function. Additionally, PT can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce oxidative stress and activate signaling pathways that regulate gene expression of cell surface receptors.

There is some evidence to suggest that children who have received PT for hyperbilirubinemia may be at an increased risk of developing allergic conditions later in life.

Phototherapy, while an effective treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, can lead to hematological side effects. It may result in a reduction in the levels of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets in the bloodstream. The light utilized in PT can decompose bilirubin, generating free radicals that can harm the blood cells. It could cause damage to RBC membranes, making them more vulnerable to lipid peroxidation of erythrocyte membranes, which can aggravate hemolysis. Furthermore, the loss of riboflavin resulting from PT may reduce the activity of erythrocyte glutathione reductase and induce hemolysis. It can also increase the osmotic fragility of normal RBCs. This can result in changes in hemoglobin (Hgb) levels and other parameters related to RBCs. The extent of these changes may vary depending on the severity of hyperbilirubinemia and the duration of PT treatment.

Phototherapy administration and irradiance measurement — implementation guidance: Whenever possible, phototherapy should be provided in the mother's room or in a room in which the mother can remain with the infant, and to optimize the effectiveness of inpatient phototherapy, hospitals should verify that phototherapy systems provide the intended irradiance, following the recommendations of the manufacturer; different irradiance measurement devices can lead to varying results, so it is reasonable to follow the manufacturer recommendations regarding how and when to measure irradiance; the amount of irradiance received by infants is higher directly below the light source than at the periphery, and the irradiance levels recommended in these guidelines refer to those measured below the center of the light source.

### Does provider access to technology improve health care? Evidence from a national distribution of phototherapy in Rwanda [^115y3Krx]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study assessed a large-scale national distribution of phototherapy (PT) for infants at risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia. We combined healthcare data for infants with jaundice (using local clinical definitions) with a randomized roll-out of PT devices to estimate the causal effect of the national distribution. Pre-intervention, < 3.0% of infants were diagnosed as jaundiced, 41.7% of these infants were not tested for bilirubin, and 17.5% and 34.3% were treated with direct sunlight or standard PT, respectively. We found that providing hospitals with PT devices increased care practices: infants with jaundice were more likely to receive PT [+6.26 percentage points (pp)], and less likely to receive sunlight (-6.96 pp) or standard (irradiance < 30 µW/cm 2 /nm) PT (-14.0 pp). However, the intervention did not affect the low diagnosis rate. Our findings suggest that complementary investments in improving diagnosis and monitoring of bilirubin levels increases the benefits of expanding provider access to PT devices.

Infants with mild to moderate hyperbilirubinemia in tropical regions can be treated as safely and effectively with filtered sunlight as with conventional phototherapy, according to a study by US and Nigerian investigators. In countries with limited resources, conventional therapy is often too costly or unavailable because of an inconsistent electrical supply. Thus, newborns with hyperbilirubinemia in these countries may develop acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus if left untreated. Friedrich MJ. Filtered Sunlight Effectively Treats Jaundice.

### Neonatal phototherapy-the need to measure and document… [^116atikR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The unintended discovery in 1951 that sunlight improves neonatal jaundice revolutionized the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Enormous progress has been made in this field, including determining the optimal wavelengths for treatment and replacing fluorescent lights with light-emitting diode lights. Phototherapy in neonates has essentially replaced blood exchange transfusion, an invasive procedure associated with increased morbidities and mortality. Approximately 5% to 7. 5% of term newborns are treated for elevated bilirubin levels with PT. 1 PT effectively lowers serum bilirubin levels without obvious immediate adverse effects. Pediatricians work with the assumption that PT is safe. Perhaps this explains why PT, in contrast with other hospital-based medical treatments, departs from the standard practice of dose measurement and recordkeeping. Goldenhersh MA, Eidelman AI.

### Neonatal jaundice [^117TVxhe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2 to 4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to February 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: albumin infusion, exchange transfusion, home phototherapy, immunoglobulin, hospital phototherapy, and tin-mesoporphyrin.

Phototherapy and ET are widely used therapeutic modalities for jaundice. However, due to constrained resources, devices for measuring bilirubinand effective phototherapy are often lacking in LMICs. This, together with higher prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, blood group incompatibilities, late referrals and delayed recognition of excessive bilirubin levels in LMICs, has necessitated excessive use of ETs.

We systematically reviewed the available evidence pertaining to the global burden of SNJ to inform child health policy regarding its prevention and management especially in LMICs.

### Comparison of biliCocoon phototherapy with overhead phototherapy in hyperbilirubinemic neonates. A randomized clinical trial [^115AmYuJ]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Around 2–6% of term or late preterm neonates receive phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. Standard treatment today is overhead phototherapy. A new device has been developed, the BiliCocoon, where the neonates are "wrapped" presumably making them more comfortable. The aim was to compare the efficacy and performance of the BiliCocoon with overhead LED phototherapy.

Methods

A randomized open-label multicenter trial in three Danish neonatal units. Healthy hyperbilirubinemic neonates, gestational age ≥ 33 weeks and postnatal age 24h to 14 days were randomized to 24hours' of treatment with BiliCocoon or overhead blue LED phototherapy with an equal level of irradiance. A mixed effect model with random effect by center was used to compare the percentage decrease in total serum bilirubin (TSB) between the treatments.

Results

Totally 83 neonates were included. Mean TSB reduction in the BiliCocoon group (N = 42), adjusted for baseline TSB, was significantly lower than in the overhead LED group (N = 41), 29% vs. 38% (p-value < 0.01). Overall difference in temperature by treatment (BiliCocoon vs overhead) was 0.70 [0.37; 1.02] °C, p-value < 0.01.

Conclusion

Bilirubin reducing efficacy of BiliCocoon was lower than that of overhead phototherapy, but it was sufficient for nearly all neonates during 24hours of treatment.

Impact

The BiliCocoon has a bilirubin reducing efficacy, sufficient for almost all neonates during 24hours of phototherapy. The BiliCocoon does not have an equal bilirubin reducing efficacy as overhead phototherapy. The duration of light exposure was longer for the neonates treated in the BiliCocoon. A few neonates can be exclusively breastfed in the BiliCocoon throughout the treatment. The reason for stopping breastfeeding in the BiliCocoon was most often, that the neonates developed hyperthermia.

### Risk of childhood neoplasms related to neonatal phototherapy-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DU7B2]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths

We performed our systematic review according to a pre-registered protocol without major deviations. In contrast to previous studies, we did not pool results from case-control and cohort studies, which reduces the heterogeneity in our reporting. The results from case-control studies exhibited high variability, including both increased and decreased odds. Furthermore, the measured inconsistency was high. The effect estimates from cohort studies had lower heterogeneity, which was also seen as higher statistical consistency. It must be noted that, based on the wide CIs, nearly all the included studies seemed to be underpowered to detect meaningful risk increases.

Limitations

Most of the limitations of this work come from the limitations of the included studies. Several studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of adjustment for possible confounders. The studies that did adjust for confounders rarely presented the rationale for the covariate selection. None of the studies discussed causal pathways or visualized them, e.g. as directed acyclic graphs. To overcome this issue, we have visualized the potential causal pathways in Figure S 4 to better illustrate the possible causality and alternative backdoor paths causing bias to estimates.

We were unable to perform two analyses planned in the protocol: mortality and exposure-outcome gradient (dose dependency). As the studies did not report mortality, we were unable to assess it. Furthermore, we aimed to examine the exposure gradient (higher risk with higher exposure level) in the potential association, as it could have strengthened the plausibility of a potential effect. Dose dependency would have been addressed by examining the duration and intensity of the phototherapy, but only two studies presented information on duration and none on the intensity (number of lamps). Furthermore, we were unable to find information on the phototherapy practices in the included countries during the study periods, as there may have been variations in the bilirubin levels for phototherapy initiation and ending. Thus, this causes additional heterogeneity in our estimates.

### Air pollution exposure associates with increased risk of neonatal jaundice [^114SkN3j]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The above analysis suggests that neonatal exposure to air pollution might significantly increase the neonatal jaundice risk. Possible causal mechanisms are presented below.

Sunlight is effective in breaking down bilirubin levels of newborns –. However, newborns stayed in the wards and were not exposed to outdoor sunlight, as confirmed by examining the relationship between air pollution exposure and jaundice by stratified analysis of TOA solar irradiance (see Methods, Supplementary Table 8).

The biological mechanism underpinning the association concerns how breathed air pollutants affect jaundice through multiple routes. There is scientific evidence that air pollutants enter the bloodstream where they possibly interact with the organs including liver tissue to produce pathological effects. Breathed PM 2.5 might change the levels and activities of P450 enzyme of human cytochrome, which plays an important role in the bilirubin metabolism in newborns. Through affecting the P450 enzyme, breathed PM 2.5 can cause serum bilirubin aggregation and thus raise the bilirubin levels of newborns. Also, air pollutants may affect the metabolism of the bilirubin through damaging the liver function. Studies in experimental models and humans presented the accumulation in the blood and liver following pulmonary exposure to a broader size range of nanoparticles, with translocation markedly greater when sufficiently small, such as for particles < 10 nm diameter. PM 2.5 has direct adverse effects on the liver function. SO 2 is a systemic oxidative damage agent, and it may cause toxicological damage to multiple organs like brain, lung, heart and liver of animals. CO might hinder metabolic and transport function of the placentaand concentrate more in the fetus than in the motherafter crossing the placental barrier. Moreover, CO also leads to acute hepatic dysfunctionand thus affects the function.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^113mUXoz]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy safety and device selection — Attention to device configuration, the light source, and overall ambient temperature is required to minimize the risk of hypothermia or hyperthermia, and safety measures may include a warmer bed, incubator or kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care, provision of adequate nutrition, and adherence to safe sleep practices. Lights with broader wavelengths or non-LED light sources may work, although not as effectively, and may also be potentially harmful because of production of unnecessary heat and other adverse effects including increased evaporative losses, oxidative stress, and skin DNA damage; efficacy also depends on hematocrit because hemoglobin competes with bilirubin for light absorption, and polycythemia could reduce therapeutic efficiency.

### Transition to a safe home sleep environment for the NICU patient [^113Pr2hv]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia and phototherapy — positioning, exposure, and sleep modeling are summarized as follows: During the first week of life, up to 60% of term newborn infants, and 80% of preterm infants will develop jaundice. The factors that affect the dose of phototherapy are the irradiance of the light used, the distance from the light source, and the amount of skin exposed; the infant should be naked except for diaper and eye protection, the phototherapy dose increases as the distance from the light to the infant decreases, and exposure can be maximized by using a phototherapy blanket under the infant while using phototherapy lamps over the infant. Several small studies found no benefit in bilirubin decrease from changing position, and a systematic review concluded that supine positioning is as effective as turning infants periodically; in trials, infants as young as 33 weeks' gestation had identical rates of bilirubin decrease at 12 and 24 hours regardless of supine or alternating positioning, and 100 infants of greater than 34 weeks' gestational age showed no difference with or without positioning. The NICE Guideline Development Group accepted that, in term infants, position has no significant influence and concluded that infants should be placed in a supine position, and the use of phototherapy should not interfere with supine sleep positioning. Conclusions on the page state there is no benefit to changing an infant's position while under phototherapy and that the provider may choose to place the infant on a bilirubin blanket, in addition to an overhead phototherapy unit, if the absolute total serum bilirubin concentration is increasing rapidly.

### The role of phototherapy in the crash-cart approach to extreme neonatal jaundice [^116Couo6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Extreme neonatal jaundice occurs infrequently but carries a high risk of permanent sequelae (kernicterus) when it does. Rapid therapeutic intervention has the potential to reduce this risk in some infants. Several case reports of infants with acute intermediate to advanced bilirubin encephalopathy shows that reversal may be possible. Phototherapy can be instituted at the flip of a switch, whereas other therapeutic measures necessarily involve delays. Therefore, high-intensity phototherapy must be regarded as an emergency measure in infants presenting with extreme jaundice and even more so in the presence of neurological symptoms. The principal and well-described effect of phototherapy involves conversion of bilirubin IXα (z, z) to more polar isomers, which are excreted in bile and urine. When care is taken to maximize the spectral power of phototherapy lights, and whenever possible with measures added to reduce the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, very rapid reductions in total serum bilirubin levels are possible. A hypothesis has been advanced that conversion of bilirubin to more polar photoisomers, which can reach relative concentrations of 20%-25% of total serum bilirubin within 1–2 hours, might have a direct neuroprotective effect. This theory posits that because polar molecules generally require a transporter to cross the blood-brain barrier, bilirubin photoisomers should be less prone to enter the brain. Although this theory has some support in in vitro toxicity studies, the evidence is controversial. Until further experimental support can be gained, photoconversion of bilirubin does not constitute a viable argument against instituting further measures against bilirubin neurotoxicity, such as intravenous immune globulin (when indicated) and exchange transfusion. Conversely, neither is the state of evidence an argument against immediate and effective phototherapy in the medical emergency of extreme neonatal jaundice.

We provide an approach to the use of phototherapy and exchange transfusion in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants of < 35 weeks of gestation. Because there are limited data for evidence-based recommendations, these recommendations are, of necessity, consensus-based. The recommended treatment levels are based on operational thresholds for bilirubin levels and represent those levels beyond which it is assumed that treatment will likely do more good than harm. Long-term follow-up of a large population will be needed to evaluate whether or not these recommendations should be modified.

### Light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy versus non-LED phototherapy devices for hyperbilirubinemia in neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158wZdd]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

This review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of light-emitting diode (LED) phototherapy as compared with the conventional phototherapy in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and their adverse effects. We searched the following databases right from their inception till April, 2021: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and LILACS. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the LED phototherapy with other light sources, which enrolled newborns (term and preterm) with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia were included. We included 21 articles in this review. The treatment with the LED light therapy had a lower failure rate as compared with the non-LED one (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39–0.94). The mean duration of phototherapy was significantly shorter in the group with the LED light source as compared with the one with the non-LED light source (mean difference [hours]: -8.07, 95% CI: -8.45 to -7.68), regardless of the type of non-LED units. However, the rate of bilirubin showed a comparable decline (mean difference [mg/dL/h]: 0.01, 95% CI: -0.00, 0.03) in both the light sources, irrespective of irradiance or distance. No studies reported primary outcomes related to the neurotoxicity effects of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. The LED light devices caused a significantly higher risk of hypothermia. Neonates were at a lower risk of developing hyperthermia and skin rash with the LED light therapy. Our findings provide support for the use of LED light source phototherapy due to its better clinical efficacy, which is evidenced by its shorter duration and lower rate of treatment failure, as compared with the non-LED light sources. KEY POINTS: · The efficacy of phototherapy is dependent on specific characteristics of light sources of phototherapy devices. · LED phototherapy demonstrated better efficacy with shorter duration and lower rate of treatment failure. · Adverse effects of phototherapy devices such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, and skin rash should be monitored.

### Home-versus hospital-based phototherapy for the treatment of non-haemolytic jaundice in infants at more than 37 weeks' gestation [^115Hg8SQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Phototherapy is commonly used for the treatment of neonatal jaundice, and home-based phototherapy is now being used in certain centres. Home-based phototherapy offers possible advantages by avoiding prolonged hospital admissions, promoting mother-infant bonding and reducing hospitalisation costs. Potential problems include increased duration of phototherapy, increased readmission to hospital and increased risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

Objectives

To compare exclusively home-based versus exclusively hospital-based phototherapy or a combination of home- and hospital-based phototherapy for the management of non-haemolytic jaundice in term infants up to 28 days of age. We planned to include specific subgroups for duration in hospital, method of phototherapy and criteria for readiness for discharge.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) January 2013, Issue 1, part of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1966 to 15 February 2013), CINAHL (from 1982 to 15 February 2013) and EMBASE (from 1988 to 15 February 2013). We searched for abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings 2000 to 2013. We searched for ongoing trials on the following websites: ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and Current Controlled Trials (http://controlled-trials.com/).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing term infants who received phototherapy exclusively at home versus phototherapy exclusively in the hospital or a combination of the two for non-haemolytic jaundice.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

No studies that met the predefined eligibility criteria were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

No high-quality evidence is currently available to support or refute the practice of home-based phototherapy for non-haemolytic jaundice in infants at more than 37 weeks' gestation.

### Criteria for treatment of neonatal jaundice [^111oZv7p]. Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is usually based on the measurements of total serum bilirubin levels. Based on empirical data, it is generally recommended to start phototherapy at lower levels in low birth weight and very low birth weight infants than in term infants, but no general agreement exists on exact limits. Treatment criteria in preterm infants do not, however, have the same empirical backing as in term infants. The very low and extremely low birth weight infants are more susceptible to bilirubin toxicity. However, bilirubin may function as an antioxidant and enzyme inducer in these infants. Several other different approaches to establish treatment criteria have also been suggested, and a summary of these are presented and discussed. With the exception of measurement of unbound bilirubin, very few of these approaches have been validated in routine clinical settings. However, unbound bilirubin is at present mainly used also as a parameter to be evaluated in relation to total bilirubin values. The present treatment criteria result in a considerable overtreatment particularly of term infants. However, with a more relaxed attitude toward neonatal hyperbilirubinemia by health care professionals, kernicterus is again reported in term infants. Because the basic mechanisms of bilirubin toxicity as well as the relative significance of the maximum serum bilirubin level compared to the duration of hyperbilirubinemia are not known, individual assessment of a newborn infant's tolerance for hyperbilirubinemia is difficult. Major changes in the empirically developed criteria for treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn are therefore not justified in the near future. For term infants, the search for validated criteria for follow-up of jaundiced infants after discharge are therefore more important than revision of existing criteria for phototherapy.

### Effectiveness of FIBEROPTIC phototherapy compared to conventional phototherapy in treating HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA amongst term neonates: a randomized controlled trial [^114abDRR]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, phototherapy was effective in decreasing bilirubin levels in all three groups. The response was greater in the blue light conventional phototherapy group (0.84%/h), followed by fiberoptic phototherapy (0.74%/h), whereas the white light conventional phototherapy (0.29%/h) had the lowest response in lowering serum bilirubin levels. The effectiveness of fiberoptic PT and blue light conventional PT were comparable in terms of bilirubin reduction rate and treatment duration, whereas fiberoptic phototherapy was more effective than white light conventional PT, with a significantly higher bilirubin reduction rate and shorter treatment duration. No side effects were reported in the fiberoptic PT group, while both conventional PT groups had participants with loose stool. Transient erythematous skin rash was noted in some patients receiving blue light conventional PT.

In this study, the effectiveness of fiberoptic PT and blue light conventional PT were comparable in terms of bilirubin reduction rate, whereas white light conventional PT had a significantly lower bilirubin reduction rate as compared to fiberoptic PT. These findings could be attributed to the distance of the light source from patient, surface area covered, wavelength and the irradiance of the phototherapy units. Schuman et al. compared continuous fiberoptic PT to conventional PT comprised of both blue and white bulbs in the home setting. They found no statistically significant difference in the mean bilirubin reduction rate. The combination of blue and white light in the conventional PT unit used in Schuman et al. study may have influenced the wavelength of their conventional PT unit. One of the advantages of fiberoptic phototherapy is no interruption of exposure, which impedes separation of mother and baby and encourages breastfeeding with long duration of phototherapy. We therefore postulate that continuous PT could further improve the effectiveness of the fiberoptic PT unit as noted in the study by Schuman et al. Though not assessed in our study, we hypothesize that patients with physiologic jaundice, who are otherwise healthy, could receive PT at home, which would reduce hospitalized neonates, positively affecting the workload in the NCU and economic burdens to families and the hospital.

### Effectiveness of FIBEROPTIC phototherapy compared to conventional phototherapy in treating HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA amongst term neonates: a randomized controlled trial [^112fhrES]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Globally an estimated 50% of term neonates develop hyperbilirubinemia (which may manifest as jaundice), typically 2–4 days after birth. About 25% of these babies will require phototherapy (PT) to avoid the effect of high serum unconjugated bilirubin, which can lead to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND). BIND occurs when bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds to brain tissue, resulting in brain injury if not treated appropriately in a timely fashion.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate is typically caused by the normal physiological inability of the neonate to process bilirubin adequately due to the combined effects of increased red blood cell turnover and a transient deficit in bilirubin conjugation in the liver. Moreover, it can also occur from underlying pathological conditions which result in increased bilirubin production and/or decreased bilirubin excretion, these include hemolytic disease of the newborn, polycythemia, extravasation of blood, sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation, increased enterohepatic circulation, inborn errors of metabolism and metabolic disorders.

Two interventions, phototherapy and exchange transfusion, are used to reduce total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels for infants with or at risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia. Phototherapy is now the preferred method of treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia by virtue of its non-invasive nature and its safety, therefore, the use of high-quality phototherapy is paramount to decrease the likelihood of exchange blood transfusion.

Conventional and fiberoptic phototherapy have been proven to be equally effective in the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia among preterm neonates. However, a Cochrane review reported the efficacy of fiberoptic phototherapy in a number of different clinical situations and patient populations, and found that fiberoptic phototherapy was less effective than conventional phototherapy at lowering serum bilirubin in term neonates. These findings were attributed to the low irradiance and/or small surface area illuminated by the mat of the fiberoptic phototherapy units used in previous studies.

### Learning from claims: hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus [^116sLuyZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge for maternity services continues to lie in the identification of the rare baby whose bilirubin level is rising rapidly to levels that are potentially neurotoxic, while avoiding overmedicalisation and unnecessary hospital admission in the vast majority. The risk of kernicterus is low, probably around 1 per 100 000 births, whereas jaundice is visible in approximately 60% of all babies born at term. The number of babies admitted to hospital and treated with phototherapy is considerable, often causing separation of mother and baby and incurring substantial costs to the NHS, yet cases of kernicterus are still occurring. These data show that, at least in the group of babies whose parents litigate on their behalf, most of those who develop kernicterus have an underlying medical diagnosis (ie, the jaundice is not physiological) and have bilirubin levels of over 600 µmol/L at presentation at term. There is clearly a balance to be struck between the desire to prevent kernicterus occurring and the desire to avoid unnecessary hospital admission and treatment for mild to moderate hyperbilirubinaemia, which is never likely to prove dangerous. From these data, we suggest that several messages emerge, and these include the importance of ethnicity, family history, continued inappropriate use of sunlight and a delay in measuring bilirubin levels in babies who are recognised to have jaundice. Our analysis was limited because data was extracted from unstructured expert reports, not the original notes, and on occasion important detail was lacking. We agree with Bhutani and colleagues, who urge an 'aviation style' approach to the problem and call for national registries of kernicterus cases.

### Sixty years of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice-from serendipitous observation to standardized treatment and rescue for millions [^111jh8Nd]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

A breakthrough discovery 60 years ago by Cremer et al. has since changed the way we treat infants with hyperbilirubinemia and saved the lives of millions from death and disabilities. "Photobiology" has evolved by inquiry of diverse light sources: fluorescent tubes (wavelength range of 400-520nm; halogen spotlights that emit circular footprints of light; fiberoptic pads/blankets (mostly, 400-550nm range) that can be placed in direct contact with skin; and the current narrow-band blue light-emitting diode (LED) light (450-470nm), which overlaps the peak absorption wavelength (458nm) for bilirubin photoisomerization. Excessive bombardment with photons has raised concerns for oxidative stress in very low birthweight versus term infants treated aggressively with phototherapy. Increased emphasis on prescribing phototherapy as a "drug" that is dosed cautiously and judiciously is needed. In this historical review, we chronicled the basic to the neurotoxic components of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and the use of standardized interventions.

### Bilirubin measurement and phototherapy use after the AAP 2022 newborn hyperbilirubinemia guideline [^1145qTH1]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Guidelines for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia have helped to reduce rates of significant hyperbilirubinemia. However, recent evidence suggesting overtreatment and potential harms of phototherapy have informed the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline revision and the accompanying increase in phototherapy thresholds. These changes are predicted to safely reduce overuse; however, to date, the exact effect of these guidelines has not been established.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of newborns born at ≥ 35 weeks' gestation across a network of 8 hospitals between January 2022 and June 2023. Outcomes included rates of phototherapy and total serum bilirubin (TSB) measurements before and after guideline publication, as well as clinical outcomes, including length of stay, readmissions, and duration of phototherapy.

Results

In our cohort of > 22000 newborns, we observed a 47% decrease in phototherapy utilization, from 3.9% to 2.1% (P < .001). TSB measurements were reduced by 23%, from 712 to 551 measurements per 1000 newborns (P < .001), without an increase in outpatient TSB measurements. We did not observe an increase in readmissions receiving phototherapy, and length of stay increased by only 1 hour (P < .001).

Conclusions

Our study reveals that the publication of the updated American Academy of Pediatrics 2022 hyperbilirubinemia guidelines has likely yielded a significant reduction in phototherapy use and serum bilirubin measurement. Dedicated quality improvement initiatives may help determine which implementation strategies are most effective. Further population-level studies are needed to confirm safety with ongoing guideline uptake.

### Home-based phototherapy versus hospital-based phototherapy for treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Dgwkq]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective. Phototherapy devices have been found to be an effective method for treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. We reviewed the current literature to determine whether home-based phototherapy is more effective than hospital-based phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Method. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang Data were searched to collect the comparative study of home-based phototherapy versus hospital-based phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. All studies were found to be of low risk based on Cochrane Collaborative Risk of Bias Tool. Data were statistically extracted and evaluated by RevMan 5.3 software. Result. A total of 259 neonates were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with hospital-based phototherapy, home-based phototherapy appeared more effective for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in reducing the rate of total serum bilirubin (standard mean difference = 0.32, 95% confidence interval = -0.22 to 0.86, P = 0.04); however, there was no signiﬁcant difference in duration of phototherapy (standard mean difference = 0.59, 95% confidence interval = 0.28 to 0.90, P = 0.06) in the 2 groups. Conclusion. Home-based phototherapy was more effective than hospital-based phototherapy in treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; home-based phototherapy is an effective, feasible, safe, and alternative to hospital-based phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

### Decreased response to phototherapy for neonatal jaundice in breast-fed infants… [^112L8FNm]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

The duration of exposure to phototherapy was as follows: group 1, 54. 1 ± 20. 8 hours; group 2,
64. 6 ± 25. 1 hours; and group 3,
54. 9 ± 21. 5 hours; the 24-hour rate of decrease in the bilirubin concentration was as follows: group 1,
18. 6% ± 11. 7%; group 2,
17. 1% ± 9. 6%; and group 3,
22. 9% ± 9. 4%. The overall rate of decrease in the bilirubin concentration for the duration of exposure to phototherapy was as follows: group 1, 0. 8% ± 0. 3% per hour; group 2,
0. 6% ± 0. 3% per hour; and group 3,
0. 8% ± 0. 3% per hour. The 24-hour rate of decrease in the bilirubin concentration in group 3 was significantly better than that of group 2 and group 3; the rates of decrease for groups 2 and 3 were similar. The overall rate of decrease in the bilirubin concentration during the duration of exposure to phototherapy in group 2 was significantly less than that of group 1 and group 3; the rates for groups 1 and 3 were similar.

Capillary blood was sampled at the start of exposure and at 12-hour intervals; the lights were off and the infants were removed from the cot during the sampling. Phototherapy was terminated when the bilirubin concentrations had decreased to less than 185 µmol/L on 2 consecutive determinations; the shortest duration of exposure was 24 hours; this considered the diurnal variation of bilirubin concentrations and minimized laboratory errors. The duration of phototherapy was recorded. Phototherapy was highly effective in reducing the bilirubin concentrations in all 3 groups of infants; however, its efficacy in group 2 was poorer compared with the other 2 groups. Statistical analysis by ANOVA demonstrated no significant difference in the duration of exposure to phototherapy, but significant differences in the 24-hour decrease in the bilirubin concentration and the overall decrease in the bilirubin concentration.

### Phototherapy for the treatment of neonatal jaundice and breastfeeding duration and exclusivity [^114MhZMW]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because neonatal jaundice remains one of the most commonly treated conditions of the newborn infant, it is important to assess the unintended consequences of treatment with phototherapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether treatment with phototherapy affects breastfeeding duration in newborns > 35 weeks gestation.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II. The exposure of interest was treatment of neonatal jaundice with phototherapy. The outcomes of interest were any breastfeeding through 12 months and exclusive breastfeeding through 4 months. Logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the association between the exposure and outcomes of interest. All models were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, household income, and gestational age, as well as for several potential markers of suboptimal breastfeeding.

Results

Our study included 4,441 infants, of which 220 (5%) received phototherapy. We found no difference in the likelihood of any breastfeeding through 9 months of age, however, by 12 months, infants exposed to phototherapy were less likely to still be breastfed than those who were not exposed (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.37–0.92). Infants exposed to phototherapy were less likely to be exclusively breastfed throughout the first 4 months of life.

Conclusion

Although phototherapy use did not substantially impact rates of any breastfeeding during the first year, it was associated with decreased rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 4 months of life. This suggests that we need to tailor messaging to mothers of infants receiving phototherapy to promote exclusive breastfeeding.

To validate the liver-associated route, we examined the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 300 newborns (independent of the 25,782 newborns). ALT, AST and GGT can cause abnormal liver function. These 300 newborns had very high total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels in blood (as gold standard for jaundice diagnosis), and they were hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. Among these severely jaundiced newborns, 129 were exposed to more polluted air (AQI > 100), and the other 171 were exposed to less polluted air (AQI < 100). Supplementary Table 7 shows that the ALT and GGT levels were higher in newborns exposed to more serious air pollution (AQI > 100), although the difference was not statistically significant likely due to small sample size. Moreover, newborns exposed to poor air quality had a much higher AST level than those breathing cleaner air (88.68 ± 67.48 versus 62.85 ± 33.56 U per L, P = 0.014). The scatter plot in Supplementary Fig. 7 further shows that among the 300 newborns, the peak bilirubin level grew as the AQI (including all pollutants) increased. These results suggested a significant association between air pollution exposure, neonatal liver functions, and neonatal jaundice.

This study estimated the impact of neonatal and maternal air pollution exposure on the neonatal jaundice risk, and provided evidence for the association to resolve concerns about causal inference. We synthesized the available evidence to quantitate the neonatal jaundice risk associated with PM 2.5, SO 2 and CO including exposure time and average concentration. Our analyses control individual-level differences in maternal pregnancy-induced outcomes like gestational diabetes mellitus, air temperature and relative humidity as confounding factors, and lessen the concern about the confounding. While newborns were in the ward and therefore had little exposure to outdoor sunlight, mothers were exposed to different levels of sunlight during pregnancy, which could confound the air pollution effects for maternal exposure. In addition to environmental factors, mother's socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics may play significant roles in neonatal jaundice risk. In future work, we plan to integrate more data, to investigate the associations.

### Phototherapy to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation: technical report [^111mkknH]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Phototherapy — maternal concerns, health care use, and breastfeeding reports that mothers of infants who had a jaundice diagnosis are more concerned about their infants' overall health at 1-month postnatal age and that maternal concerns are increased if their infant received in-hospital phototherapy, with the authors noting that clinical practice and counseling may have changed over the last 28 y; small increases in outpatient visits before 1 year of age are seen with neonatal jaundice (36%) and phototherapy (73%), most often occurring in the first 2 postnatal months; phototherapy may be associated with a decreased odds of exclusive breastfeeding during postnatal months 1 to 4, yet phototherapy is not associated with a change in the odds of any breastfeeding and although there is a decrease in the odds of any breastfeeding at 12 months postnatally, it seems unlikely that phototherapy is the cause; phototherapy during birth hospitalization is not associated with reduced breastmilk feeding at the 2-month well-child visit.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114ZyW3a]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — neonatal phototherapy and skin cancer risk (Table 1) describes a Scotland population cohort using a retrospective population cohort design that compared infants who received neonatal phototherapy versus no phototherapy and found no difference in skin cancers, with results noting two cases of melanoma.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114qAGmC]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (indications for initiation), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to consider offering treatment with a home LED-based phototherapy device rather than readmission to the hospital as an option in infants already discharged and then developed hyperbilirubinemia (above the phototherapy threshold) and meeting the following criteria:

- gestational age ≥ 38 weeks

- ≥ 48 hours old

- clinically well with adequate feeding

- no known hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors

- no previous phototherapy

- total serum bilirubin concentration ≤ 1 mg/dL above the phototherapy treatment threshold

- an LED-based phototherapy device will be available in the home without delay

- total serum bilirubin can be measured daily.

### Phototherapy with turquoise versus blue light [^1129Gteh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2003). Low credibility.

Preterm jaundiced infants were treated by phototherapy with a new turquoise fluorescent lamp. This was more effective in reducing plasma total bilirubin in relation to light irradiance than the ubiquitously used blue fluorescent lamp.

### Comparing kramer's rule with transcutaneous bilirubin vs. kramer's rule only in reducing total serum bilirubin sampling among neonates with jaundice [^112EGZaz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

A recommended screening approach involves non-invasive TcB measurement, which assesses bilirubin levels by emitting light onto the neonate's skin and measuring the intensity of the reflected wavelength. TcB is recommended for neonates with a gestational age of 35 weeks or more and a postnatal age of more than 24 h. Many studies have demonstrated that TcB has a good correlation with TSB and that it should be utilized as a screening tool when the detected level is less than 250 µmol/L. Local guideline in Malaysia mandates TSB testing when TcB levels surpass 200 µmol/L, irrespective of TcB machine brand, in contrast to the AAP guidelines, which recommend TSB testing for TcB levels exceeding 250 µmol/L or TcB values < 50 µmol/L below the phototherapy level.

Despite the availability of screening methods, TSB measurement remains the gold standard for NNJ diagnosis and the initiation of phototherapy. However, TSB involves obtaining blood samples from neonates via venepuncture or heel-prick, which is painful, time-consuming and requires trained medical personnel with laboratory support. Due to the limitations of the visualization method in screening, TSB is frequently still required despite of all its associated challenges. Hence, TcB is put under extensive investigation and multiple studies have shown that TcB has potential benefits including enhanced accessibility, reduced reliance on TSB blood draws, parental acceptability and cost savings.

In Malaysia, while TcB is integrated into clinical practice guidelines as a screening tool for NNJ, there is a paucity of studies comparing the trends in the number of blood draws for TSB, need for phototherapy, and incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia between neonates screened using KR with TcB versus KR alone. Researchers also aim to compare the number of blood draws for TSB, phototherapy initiation, and cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia in TcB cohorts when using AAP recommendations versus local guidelines. This comparison will explore the impact of different cut-off levels for TSB testing between the two guidelines. Addressing these research gaps is paramount in providing evidence-based recommendations to optimize the NNJ screening program locally.
