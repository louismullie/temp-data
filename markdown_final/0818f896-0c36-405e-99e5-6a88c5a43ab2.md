## Question

why thoracentesis over furosemide increased dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why thoracentesis should be chosen over escalating furosemide dose for the management of pleural effusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanisms and limitations of loop diuretics on pleural fluid. Then, I should verify the diagnostic and therapeutic indications for thoracentesis. Next, I will review guideline statements for key etiologies such as heart failure, parapneumonic effusions, malignant effusions, and hepatic hydrothorax. After that, I will weigh comparative safety and efficacy, including TAP-IT trial data. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical decision framework and make a concise recommendation while double-checking areas where diuretics can mislead diagnostics and increase risk, and where thoracentesis adds immediate value.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic leverage points. Furosemide mobilizes systemic intravascular and interstitial fluid via the kidney but does not directly address pleural space mechanics or the local drivers of exudation such as infection, malignancy, or pleural inflammation, so persistent or recurrent effusions despite diuresis are common when the pleural process is exudative or when diuretic resistance exists, which nudges me toward thoracentesis for large, symptomatic, or diagnostically unclear collections [^113g8rWT] [^114p8g5q].

> Wait, let me verify how diuretics can confound diagnostic interpretation. Loop diuretics raise pleural protein and LDH in heart failure transudates, which can shift Light's criteria toward a false exudative classification; older data also show exudative profiles in heart failure after intravenous diuresis without another cause identified, so if I am escalating diuretics first, I must be cautious about subsequent fluid chemistry interpretation and consider albumin or protein gradients or NT-proBNP to refine etiology if needed [^117KuLgB] [^115qgTr2] [^111mD8Dn].

> I should confirm the risk profile when increasing furosemide doses. Loop diuretics are independently associated with acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with nonmalignant pleural effusions, and FDA labeling warns that high doses can precipitate profound volume and electrolyte depletion with hypotension and arrhythmias; ototoxicity is a rare but recognized risk with aggressive dosing, particularly in renal impairment, so diuretic escalation as a primary strategy for large effusions carries nontrivial systemic hazards that thoracentesis largely avoids [^115MipRe] [^111BMsjQ].

> Next, I should review when thoracentesis is diagnostically imperative. New, unilateral, or atypical effusions without clear heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure that respond promptly to therapy warrant diagnostic thoracentesis with analysis for Light's criteria, cytology, Gram stain and culture, cell count, LDH, protein, pH, and glucose; ultrasound guidance should be used to reduce complications and to characterize complexity and loculations prior to sampling [^116riieh] [^113g8rWT] [^112R6m21] [^111vLdVv].

> Hold on, I should verify special indications where drainage is not optional. In suspected parapneumonic effusion or empyema, pleural fluid pH less than 7.2 or very high LDH with low glucose predicts a complicated course and mandates tube drainage rather than diuretic escalation; guidelines emphasize early sampling and timely intercostal drain placement, with antibiotics tailored to local resistance patterns and clinical context [^112ujKQy] [^1176ezhK] [^1156sYdJ] [^1153NVZZ] [^1131NiUo].

> Let me consider malignant pleural effusion. For symptomatic malignant effusion, initial large-volume thoracentesis provides diagnostic cytology and clarifies whether dyspnea is effusion-driven and whether the lung re-expands, thereby informing definitive management with talc pleurodesis or an indwelling pleural catheter; major societies converge on early pleural intervention for symptomatic patients and advise against relying on diuretics for control, while also recommending no pleural procedure in asymptomatic MPE [^1152cwcA] [^114spNKD] [^115Km6uA] [^114Umwrc] [^113eQN44] [^116UapwE].

> I will now examine heart failure–related effusions and the role of thoracentesis. Small, bilateral, clinically typical transudates with systemic congestion generally respond to guideline-directed diuresis without diagnostic thoracentesis, but when effusions are large, unilateral, atypical, refractory to decongestion, or cause persistent dyspnea, selective thoracentesis is reasonable for symptom relief and diagnostic confirmation; the TAP-IT randomized trial showed that routine upfront thoracentesis in HFrEF with sizeable effusions did not improve 90-day days alive and out of hospital versus medical therapy, but confirmed procedural safety and supports a selective rather than routine approach, especially as the trial excluded massive effusions where mechanical benefit may be greatest [^113g8rWT] [^11325pWR] [^113B2SjH] [^114BMZJc] [^113mnNUe].

> But wait, what about hepatic hydrothorax and other benign, diuretic-refractory states. In decompensated cirrhosis, diuretics are used for ascites control with careful stepwise furosemide titration, yet suspected infected hydrothorax requires diagnostic thoracentesis, and refractory or recurrent symptomatic hydrothorax often necessitates serial drainage or consideration of indwelling catheters in carefully selected palliative contexts given infection risk and transplant considerations [^115ndKfx] [^1131sB3d] [^111yZheD].

> I need to check the safety and technical profile of thoracentesis to balance risk. Ultrasound guidance significantly reduces pneumothorax and solid organ puncture, and large-volume drainage up to several liters is generally safe with very low rates of clinically significant reexpansion pulmonary edema; physiologic and observational data show immediate mechanical relief of dyspnea after removal of 1 to 3 liters even when gas exchange changes are modest in the short term, reinforcing the role of targeted decompression for symptom burden [^112R6m21] [^111vLdVv] [^116qdGDF] [^114AV3NZ] [^111TSuDq] [^115GUcRS] [^116JtBTp].

> Let me reconsider the comparative time course of benefit. Diuretic-driven decongestion may take hours to days to significantly reduce pleural volume, whereas thoracentesis provides immediate reduction in pleural pressure and restoration of lung mechanics; the TAP-IT data also show no meaningful difference in diuretic dosing or discharge renal function between thoracentesis and medical therapy arms, supporting that procedural symptom relief can be obtained without worsening kidney function when performed selectively in heart failure patients [^11325pWR] [^113UL38u] [^113B2SjH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought very high-dose continuous furosemide infusions show limited efficacy across the board, but I should double-check that. A small retrospective case series of very high-dose infusions reported increased urine output without clear electrolyte or ototoxic complications, yet this is low-quality evidence, not specific to pleural effusion pathophysiology, and does not address diagnostic needs or mechanical relief, so it does not overturn the preference for thoracentesis in large, symptomatic, or diagnostically uncertain effusions; moreover, broader observational data still flag diuretics as AKI risk factors in these populations, so caution remains appropriate when considering escalation solely to treat the effusion [^1162a9of] [^115MipRe].

> Hold on, I should verify malignancy workup touchpoints. If pleural effusion accompanies suspected or confirmed thoracic malignancy, early thoracentesis with cytology is recommended, and if nondiagnostic in the setting of high suspicion such as small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma, further tissue via thoracoscopy may be needed; this ensures timely diagnosis and appropriate downstream pleural strategies rather than reliance on diuretics that rarely help in this setting [^111ER6hZ] [^112E9kDf] [^1152cwcA].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic decision framework. Choose thoracentesis when rapid symptom relief is needed from a large effusion, when the etiology is uncertain, when infection or malignancy is suspected, when effusions persist despite optimized diuresis, or when escalating diuretics would pose high AKI or electrolyte risk; reserve diuretic escalation for small, bilateral, clinically typical transudates due to systemic congestion with clear responsiveness to therapy, and use ultrasound to guide any pleural intervention to enhance safety and diagnostic yield [^113g8rWT] [^115MipRe] [^111vLdVv] [^112R6m21].

> In summary, I should confirm that thoracentesis is superior to furosemide dose escalation when effusions are large, symptomatic, refractory to medical therapy, exudative or suspected complicated parapneumonic or malignant, or when diagnostic clarification is needed, given its immediate mechanical benefit, diagnostic yield, and favorable safety with ultrasound guidance; diuretic escalation is reasonable for small, typical transudates with systemic volume overload, but carries risks of AKI and diagnostic confounding, so it should not be the default strategy for substantial or atypical pleural effusions [^112ujKQy] [^1153NVZZ] [^1152cwcA] [^112R6m21] [^111BMsjQ] [^115MipRe].

---

Thoracentesis is preferred over increasing furosemide when **immediate symptom relief** is needed [^116riieh], the effusion is **large or loculated** [^112ujKQy], or diagnostic fluid analysis is required [^1156sYdJ]. Furosemide is less effective for exudative or loculated effusions [^113g8rWT] and can cause **renal dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances**, especially at high doses [^111BMsjQ] [^115MipRe]. Thoracentesis provides rapid dyspnea relief, improves lung mechanics [^116JtBTp], and allows a definitive diagnosis [^113g8rWT], whereas furosemide is best for **transudative effusions** from heart failure or cirrhosis [^113g8rWT].

---

## Clinical indications for thoracentesis

Thoracentesis is indicated when **diagnostic clarity or rapid symptom relief** is required [^1156sYdJ] [^116riieh], including evaluation of new, unilateral, or large effusions without clear heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure [^113g8rWT], and when infection or malignancy is suspected [^112ujKQy]. It provides rapid relief of dyspnea and improves lung mechanics in large or loculated effusions [^116JtBTp] [^112ujKQy]. It is also indicated when effusions persist despite optimal diuretic therapy.

---

## Clinical indications for increasing furosemide dose

Furosemide dose escalation is appropriate when medical management of volume overload is indicated, particularly for **transudative effusions** due to heart failure [^113g8rWT] or cirrhosis [^115ndKfx]. It is useful for systemic congestion accompanying pleural effusion. Dose increases are safer when renal function and electrolytes are stable [^111BMsjQ] [^115MipRe].

---

## Physiological mechanisms of symptom relief

### Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis relieves symptoms by **mechanical decompression** [^116JtBTp], removing pleural fluid to improve lung volumes and reduce the work of breathing. It reduces intrapulmonary shunt and improves oxygenation [^111mjQEr]. Lowering pleural pressure also enhances cardiac filling and output [^116JtBTp].

---

### Furosemide

Furosemide relieves symptoms via **diuresis** [^111BMsjQ], lowering intravascular volume and pleural fluid formation. Afterload reduction improves cardiac output and reduces congestion. It is less effective for exudative or loculated effusions [^113g8rWT].

---

## Risks and complications

### Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis carries **procedural risks**:

- **Pneumothorax**: 5–7% risk [^113RUNHC], reduced with ultrasound guidance [^111vLdVv].

- **Bleeding**: Rare, higher with coagulopathy [^116qdGDF].

- **Infection**: Rare [^116qdGDF].

- **Re-expansion edema**: Rare, especially with large-volume drainage.

---

### Furosemide

Furosemide carries **systemic risks**:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia [^111BMsjQ].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Risk of AKI, especially at high doses [^115MipRe].

- **Hypotension**: From excessive diuresis [^111BMsjQ].

- **Ototoxicity**: Rare at high doses [^111BMsjQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring thoracentesis

Thoracentesis is preferred when **rapid relief** or diagnosis is needed:

- **Large/loculated effusions**: Especially with significant dyspnea [^112ujKQy].

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Suspected infection [^112ujKQy] or malignancy [^1152cwcA] [^113g8rWT].

- **Diuretic resistance**: Persistent effusions despite optimal therapy.

- **Renal impairment**: When diuretics risk worsening renal function [^115MipRe] [^111BMsjQ].

---

## Clinical scenarios favoring increased furosemide dose

Furosemide escalation is preferred when medical management is appropriate, such as transudative effusions from heart failure [^113g8rWT] or cirrhosis [^115ndKfx]. It is reasonable in **volume overload** when renal function and electrolytes are stable [^111BMsjQ] [^115MipRe]. It may also be favored when thoracentesis is contraindicated or declined.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

Patient-specific factors should guide the choice between thoracentesis and diuretic escalation. Renal impairment and electrolyte imbalances favor **thoracentesis** over **high-dose diuretics** [^115MipRe] [^111BMsjQ]. Comorbid bleeding or infection risks may favor medical therapy; patient preference and shared decision-making are essential [^114QgbD3].

---

## Evidence from clinical guidelines and studies

Guidelines support evidence-based choices: BTS 2023 recommends **ultrasound guidance** for thoracentesis [^111vLdVv] and favors pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheters for malignant effusions [^114Umwrc]. The AAFP 2023 advises diagnostic thoracentesis for new, unilateral, or large effusions without clear heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure [^113g8rWT]. The AATS 2017 recommends draining parapneumonic effusions with low pH, low glucose, or high LDH [^112ujKQy] [^1176ezhK].

---

Thoracentesis is preferred over increasing furosemide when **rapid relief or diagnostic clarity** is needed [^116riieh] [^1156sYdJ], the effusion is **large or loculated** [^112ujKQy], or diuretics are ineffective or risky [^115MipRe]. Furosemide is best for **transudative effusions** from heart failure or cirrhosis [^113g8rWT] with stable renal function and electrolytes [^111BMsjQ].

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients with nonmalignant pleural effusions: a retrospective cohort study [^115MipRe]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

A meta-analysis showed that older age was associated with a higher risk of AKI; however, this effect was attenuated by lower eGFR or a higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). eGFR and ACR were consistent, strong risk factors for AKI. In our study, the odds ratio of age was 1.68 (95% CI 1.49–1.92; p < 0.001) in univariate analysis. However, in multivariate and LASSO analyses, the odds ratio of age was attenuated with no statistically significant difference, although it was selected by the LASSO analysis, which might be due to other stronger risk factors. Proteinuria and eGFR remained independent risk factors in our study.

Of the patients, 37.5% had pneumonia, so infection was a very common problem in NMPE patients, especially if abdominal and intracranial infections were considered. We found that vancomycin/teicoplanin was an independent contributor to AKI, with a relatively high odds ratio (OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.38–2.81). The exact mechanism by which vancomycin/teicoplanin induces nephrotoxicity is unclear; it has been reported to be associated with oxidative stress. Although vancomycin/teicoplanin is not the preferred anti-infective agent due to its side effects, it is one of the few antibiotics available for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Clinicians should carefully monitor urine output and creatinine levels when using vancomycin/teicoplanin.

Our results suggest that both spironolactone and loop diuretics are risk factors for AKI in multivariate analysis, with a relatively high odds ratio. This may be related to concomitant heart failure, renal insufficiency, and cirrhosis.

**Warning**: Furosemide is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis accompanied by water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and the dosage and dose schedule must be adjusted to the individual patient's needs (see dosage and administration).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, specifically concerning pleural fluid drainage (tube thoracostomy indications), the AATS 2017 guidelines recommend performing tube thoracostomy in patients with pleural fluid LDH > 1,000 IU/L, glucose < 40 mg/dL, or a loculated pleural effusion. These conditions suggest that the pleural effusion is unlikely to resolve with antibiotics alone.

### Pleural effusion: Diagnostic approach in adults [^113g8rWT]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation.

Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e. infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications.

Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels.

The following constitutes key background information on pleural effusion:

- **Definition**: Pleural effusion is a disease characterized by the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common causes of pleural effusions include congestive heart failure (HF), pneumonia, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism (PE).

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of pleural effusion in the United States is estimated at 400 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space with resultant pleural irritation and compression atelectasis results in clinical manifestations of dyspnea, pleuritic pain, and dry cough.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In hospitalized patients, pleural effusion is associated with 30-day and 1-year mortality rates of 15% and 32%, respectively.

### The evaluation of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure [^116aUxVq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the causes of pleural effusions in patients with heart failure and the association of these statistics' characteristics with the use of diuretics, eighty-one patients with a definite diagnosis of heart failure who underwent thoracentesis were evaluated. Fluids were classified as transudates or exudates using Light's criteria.

- **Results**: Forty-one effusions (in 34 patients) were transudates, and 54 (in 47 patients) were exudates. A specific cause was found for 32 of the exudates (27 patients); except for heart failure, no obvious cause was found for the remaining 22 fluids (20 patients). Exudates with a specific cause were more likely to meet at least two of Light's criteria (18 of 27 [67%]) than exudates without a known cause (2 of 21 [10%]). Intravenous diuretic therapy in the 24 hours before thoracentesis was significantly more common among patients with exudates without a specific cause.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with heart failure may have exudative pleural effusions without an obvious cause except heart failure.

### Clinically documented pleural effusions in medical ICU patients: How useful is routine thoracentesis [^113RUNHC]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of routine thoracentesis on diagnostic assessment and therapeutic measures, a prospective, 1-year, three-center study was conducted involving medical ICU (MICU) patients with physical and radiographic evidence of pleural effusion.

Of the 1,351 patients admitted to three MICUs during the study period, 113 patients had physical and radiographic evidence of pleural effusion, yielding an annual incidence of 8.4%. Routine thoracentesis was performed in 82 patients without contraindications to the procedure.

- **Measurements and results**: Twenty patients (24.4%) had a transudate, 35 patients (42.7%) had an infectious exudate (parapneumonic, n = 21; empyema, n = 14), and 27 patients (32.9%) had a noninfectious exudate. Laboratory parameters including the leukocyte count, the neutrophil percentage in pleural fluid, and the fluid/serum protein and lactate dehydrogenase ratios differed significantly among the three groups. Thoracentesis resulted in improved diagnosis and/or treatment in 46 patients (56%): The presumptive (prethoracentesis) diagnosis was changed in 37 patients (32 patients experienced certain benefit and 5 patients experienced probable benefit from thoracentesis), of whom 27 patients had a change in treatment based on the new diagnosis. In nine other patients, treatment was changed despite the diagnosis remaining the same. The only complications were pneumothorax in six patients (7%), all of which had a favorable outcome after drainage.

In conclusion, infection was identified as the main cause of pleural effusions in this study.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^11325pWR]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms of acute heart failure were eligible for inclusion if they had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45% and a non-negligible pleural effusion related to heart failure. No specific quantitative measure of the effusion was required, but it had to be sizable enough for the physician to find drainage by thoracentesis clinically relevant and feasible.

A strict definition of size or quantity was not applied because incorporating a quantitative assessment of pleural effusion did not mirror clinical practice at the participating hospitals. Patients were deemed suitable for thoracentesis by the treating physician based on the appearance of the pleural effusion on available clinical images. Thus, the resulting population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis based on clinical practice.

Patients with new-onset heart failure and those with acute decompensated chronic heart failure were eligible. A high likelihood of heart failure as the pathogenesis of the effusion was intended. Hence, patients with an LVEF > 45% were not considered for the trial; it was considered that pleural effusion in patients with normal ejection fraction was more likely to represent noncardiac pathogeneses.

Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria:

- Indication for diagnostic thoracentesis
- Contraindication to thoracentesis
- Severely impaired hemodynamics or respiratory failure
- Massive effusion occupying more than two-thirds of the hemithorax

### Treatment of diuretic refractory pleural effusions with bevacizumab in four patients with primary systemic amyloidosis [^115N8fWA]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Refractory pleural effusions present a challenging management problem and are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL). We report a series of four patients with AL who presented with bilateral pleural effusions that were refractory to diuretic therapy. After treatment with bevacizumab, an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, three of the four patients showed improvement in their pleural effusions, peripheral edema, and functional status. Additional studies are needed to further define the role of bevacizumab in the management of this group of patients.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114qS4wE]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Controversy surrounds the effect of chemotherapy on malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Although some oncologists believe that targeted therapies or chemotherapy can resolve MPE, no randomized controlled trials have compared them with treatments such as indwelling pleural catheters (IPC) and/or talc pleurodesis. Clinical observations and case reports have suggested that chemotherapy may reduce pleural effusion. However, the European Respiratory Society (ERS), Spanish Society of Clinical Toxicology (SECT), and British Thoracic Society (BTS) all recommend not delaying treatment for MPE until after systemic anticancer treatment. This is because there is no strong evidence that systemic anticancer treatments improve MPE outcomes, and treatments for MPE are safe and effective. Studies highlight the need for early pleural intervention regardless of tumor type or intended treatment. Therefore, treatment for MPE should be initiated as early as possible.

Some oncologists are concerned about the risk of infection when IPCs are used simultaneously with chemotherapy, whereas others worry about unknown interactions between anticancer treatments and IPCs. However, evidence does not support these concerns. IPCs do not increase the risk of infection in most cases; therefore, chemotherapy should not be withheld from patients with an IPC. Furthermore, the infection rate is similar in patients with or without neutropenia receiving chemotherapy, so neutropenia should not contraindicate simultaneous treatment with chemotherapy and IPC. Drugs can cause adverse pulmonary effects, including pulmonary damage or pleural effusion, but these are rare and can be monitored for early identification and management.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^113UL38u]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

One-third of the participants received oral loop diuretic treatment before admission (45 out of 135) with a median furosemide-equivalent dose of 80 mg (40; 120). Decongestion treatment during index admission was evaluated as the change in furosemide-equivalent dose of loop diuretic from preadmission to discharge dose. Furosemide-equivalent loop diuretic therapy was intensified by a median of 80 mg per day (40; 80) in both groups (P = 0.85). There were no differences between groups in change from baseline to maximum daily dose of furosemide-equivalent loop diuretics administered during the index admission (160 mg [120; 240] in both groups; P = 0.24). In both groups, the median furosemide equivalent dose of loop diuretics at discharge was 80 mg (interquartile range, 40–120; P = 0.92).

On admission, 37% in the control group and 29% in the thoracentesis group were on loop diuretics. At discharge, this proportion increased to 94% (63 out of 67) in the control group and 96% (65 out of 68) in the thoracentesis group. During the index admission, participants experienced a mean weight change of −4.5 kg (± 4.0) in the control group and −5.0 kg (± 3.6) in the thoracentesis group, with no difference between the two groups (P = 0.41).

Renal function at discharge did not differ between the groups. The median creatinine level at discharge was 111 μmol/L (83; 140) in the control group compared with 106 (84; 128) μmol/L in the thoracentesis group (Mann-Whitney parameter, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.36–0.55]).

### Symptom relief after large-volume thoracentesis in the absence of lung perfusion [^111TSuDq]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The physiologic basis for relief from dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the case of a 46-year-old man with a large pleural effusion and absent perfusion to the affected lung who experienced dramatic dyspnea relief after large-volume thoracentesis. This patient's improvement in breathlessness cannot be attributed to improved gas exchange and suggests that the primary physiologic basis for the relief in dyspnea is a change in respiratory system mechanics or work of breathing.

### Persistent pleural effusions in primary systemic amyloidosis: Etiology and prognosis [^116L84UX]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy frequently complicates primary systemic amyloidosis (AL), yet only a small number of these patients develop large pleural effusions refractory to diuretic therapy and thoracentesis. We hypothesized that disruption of pleural function by amyloid deposits underlies persistent pleural effusions (PPEs) in patients with AL disease.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of AL patients with and without PPEs who had been referred to Boston University between 1994 and 2001. The presence of PPEs was defined by a failure to resolve the condition with thoracentesis and aggressive diuresis. AL cardiomyopathy patients without pleural effusions constituted the control (cardiac) group. Indexes of plasma cell dyscrasia, nephrotic syndrome, thyroid function, and echocardiographic measures of left and right ventricle performance were compared between groups. When available, closed needle biopsies and autopsy specimens of parietal pleura were examined for amyloid deposits.

- **Results**: Among 636 patients with AL, 35 PPE patients underwent a median of three thoracenteses each. No statistical differences were found between the PPE and cardiac groups in echocardiographic measures of septal thickness, left ventricular systolic function, or diastolic compliance. Right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis occurred more often in PPE patients; however, nearly half of this group had normal RV systolic function. Renal function, plasma protein levels, and thyroid function were the same between groups. Nephrotic range proteinuria (i.e. > 3 g/d) was more prevalent in the c

### Implementation of evidence on management of pleural diseases: Insights from a territory-wide survey of clinicians in Hong Kong [^1143EGtV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the scope of practice, 96% and 60% of non-respiratory physicians performed thoracentesis and closed needle pleural biopsy, respectively. Eighty-two percent of them would consider the utilization of TUS to guide the procedures. On the contrary, all physicians working in the respiratory stream would use TUS to guide thoracentesis and/or pleural biopsy.

Fifty-eight percent of the respondents reported that trainees performed the majority of chest tube insertion procedures in their hospitals, with the remainder performed by interns, medical specialists, radiologists, thoracic surgeons, or emergency physicians. However, only 26% of the basic and higher physician trainees had received a formal thoracic ultrasonography training program, and 70% of them described their TUS training as inadequate. Teaching by seniors and/or peers during clinical duties was the predominant mode of learning ultrasonography among local clinicians (40% of respiratory physicians and 85% of non-respiratory physicians, x² = 28.205, df = 1, p < 0.001). The most common reasons for referring patients to radiologists for ultrasound-guided pleural procedures were better equipment (50%) or expertise (40%) in ultrasonography, and lack of manpower/space in medical wards (18%). Only 5% of all respondents considered that the waiting time for procedures could be shorter under radiology departments.

- **Investigations of exudative pleural effusion**: For cases with exudative pleural effusion of undetermined cause after first thoracentesis, up to 98% of the respondents would consider non-surgical pleural procedures.

### Furosemide [^115zgusk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Acute pulmonary edema: The usual initial dose of furosemide is 40 mg, injected slowly intravenously over 1 to 2 minutes. If a satisfactory response does not occur within 1 hour, the dose may be increased to 80 mg, injected slowly intravenously over 1 to 2 minutes. If necessary, additional therapy (e.g. digitalis, oxygen) may be administered concomitantly.

Geriatric patients: In general, dose selection for elderly patients should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see precautions: geriatric use).

Pediatric patients: Parenteral therapy should be used only in patients unable to take oral medication or in emergency situations, and should be replaced with oral therapy as soon as practical. The usual initial dose of furosemide injection (intravenously or intramuscularly) in pediatric patients is 1 mg/kg body weight and should be given slowly under close medical supervision. If the diuretic response to the initial dose is not satisfactory, the dosage may be increased by 1 mg/kg not sooner than 2 hours after the previous dose, until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended. Literature reports suggest that the maximum dose for premature infants should not exceed 1 mg/kg/day (see warnings, pediatric use).

Furosemide injection should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration.

### Very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions: A case series [^1162a9of]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data evaluating the efficacy and safety of very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions (≥ 40 mg/h) for volume removal. This infusion is a novel strategy of loop diuretic administration that may add valuable data to the literature.

- **Methods and results**: This was a retrospective chart review. Patients were eligible for inclusion if prescribed a very high-dose furosemide infusion (defined as ≥ 40 mg/h, up to 240 mg/h) from April 1, 2017, to January 1, 2019, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Data collected included the change in cumulative urine output, net urine output, incidence of acute kidney injury, occurrences of hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, body weight, and ototoxicity. Twenty-two patients were included in this analysis. The median change in 24-hour urine output from before to after very high-dose continuous furosemide infusion increased from 1193 mL at 24 hours before infusion initiation to 3518 mL at 24 hours after infusion initiation (P < .01). Serum creatinine increased 24 hours after infusion initiation but decreased within 48 hours. There were no electrolyte abnormalities. Out of 22 patients, only 2 had an occurrence of hypotension. No patients were reported to have ototoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Very high-dose furosemide continuous infusions provide a significant increase in diuresis without worsening renal function, disturbing electrolytes, or increasing the risk of ototoxicity. Further studies are necessary to examine the efficacy and safety of this novel strategy.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^116q8RDT]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Optimal communication involves a clear, written referral from the oncology team to the pleural services/pulmonology team. The referral should encourage two-way communication by including an invitation to contact the referrer if the receiving department has any queries. Proactive collaboration and communication between referring and recipient services are crucial for ensuring that guidelines are followed, and any deviations from the guidelines are appropriate. Subsequent interactions can be via phone, e-mail, or in-person and should focus on addressing treatment issues. The referring clinician must also ensure that the recipient team is adequately trained. Identification of knowledge gaps should prompt clinicians to organize training initiatives that should be led by health care professionals experienced in the treatment of MPE.

The pulmonologist placing the IPC should report the details of the procedure, including the amount of fluid drained, followed by specific recommendations on drainage frequency and volume at home.

- **Unanswered questions**: Treatments for MPE have seen little evolution for decades. Talc pleurodesis was first described in 1935 and IPCs were released onto the market in 1997. In the coming decade, we hope for progress on several key unanswered research questions, which could be transformative for the management of MPE and patient outcomes.
	1. Are there biomarkers that may help predict which treatment a patient will benefit the most from?
	2. Are there drugs that may suppress pleural fluid production?

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^113B2SjH]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

The TAP-IT (Thoracentesis to Alleviate Cardiac Pleural Effusion–Interventional Trial) investigated the effect of therapeutic thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy in patients with acute heart failure and sizeable pleural effusion.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, conducted between August 31, 2021, and March 22, 2024, included patients with acute heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, and non-negligible pleural effusion. Patients with very large effusions (more than two-thirds of the hemithorax) were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to upfront ultrasound-guided pleural pigtail catheter thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy or standard medical therapy alone. The primary outcome was days alive out of the hospital over the following 90 days; key secondary outcomes included length of admission and 90-day all-cause mortality. All outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

- **Results**: A total of 135 patients (median age, 81 years [25th; 75th percentile, 75; 83]; 33% female; median left ventricular ejection fraction, 25% [25th; 75th percentile, 20%; 35%]) were randomized to either thoracentesis (n = 68) or standard medical therapy (n = 67). The thoracentesis group had a median of 84 days (77; 86) alive out of the hospital over the following 90 days compared with 82 days (73; 86) in the control group (P = 0.42). The mortality rate was 13% in both groups, with no difference in survival probability (P = 0.90). There were no differences in the duration of t…

### Patterns of pleural pressure amplitude and respiratory rate changes during therapeutic thoracentesis [^115GUcRS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Large-volume pleural effusion results in increased pleural pressure, negatively affecting lung volumes and inducing clinical symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Conversely, therapeutic thoracentesis typically decreases pleural pressure and has beneficial effects on pulmonary function. Although the number of thoracenteses performed in the United States is reported to be between 127,000 and 173,000 procedures per year, some physiological aspects of pleural fluid removal remain insufficiently studied. This gap in understanding is partly due to the absence of a universal and commonly accepted animal model for studying pleural pathophysiology.

The relationship between pleural fluid volume and pulmonary function has been examined in several human studies. These studies demonstrated that the increase in forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) after therapeutic thoracentesis approximates 20–30% of the withdrawn pleural fluid volume. Changes in spirometric parameters in patients undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis were related to pleural pressure (Ppl). In a study by Light et al, a higher post-thoracentesis pleural pressure and a smaller decrease in pleural pressure following fluid removal were associated with a more significant improvement in FVC.

Some other studies concentrated on the effect of therapeutic thoracentesis on blood gases. A study by Brandstetter and Cohen indicated that PaO2 significantly decreases early after therapeutic thoracentesis but returns to pre-thoracentesis levels after 24 hours. Different results were reported in later studies. Perpiñá et al. found a significant increase in…

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^111mD8Dn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria. If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions.

Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of malignant pleural effusion: a systematic literature review and new approaches [^111hpNUH]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion is a frequent complication in many types of tumors and its presence indicates short expected survival. This review updates the knowledge about the diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion. In recent years, progress has been made in diagnosis through the use of new pathologic and radiologic approaches, such as the introduction of positron emission tomography-computed tomography, immunohistochemical marker combinations, and genetic studies to identify malignant cells.

Treatment is always palliative. New promising drugs have been tested but, awaiting randomized studies, talc pleurodesis remains the treatment of choice, although doubts remain about its safety. A long-term indwelling pleural catheter could be a valid alternative to talc pleurodesis in selected patients with trapped lung syndrome — where the lung fails to re-expand after drainage of pleural effusion — and short life expectancy. However, the correct treatment depends on several factors such as performance status, expected survival, presence of lung reexpansion following pleural drainage, and comorbidities.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^113mnNUe]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Pleural effusion is present in more than half of patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated heart failure. For approximately 20% of these patients, the effusion occupies more than one-third of the hemithorax. Invasive drainage by therapeutic thoracentesis may be used to relieve shortness of breath for patients with sizeable effusions. Thoracentesis provides immediate symptom relief but poses a risk of complications. No evidence exists from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure, therefore, treatment guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding the indications for, or timing of thoracentesis. Thoracentesis is performed at increasing rates, and there is a need for evidence on the effects of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. TAP-IT (Thoracentesis to Alleviate Cardiac Pleural Effusion–Interventional Trial) investigated the effectiveness of upfront thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy compared with medical treatment alone on patient-relevant outcomes in patients admitted to the hospital with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^1117o33m]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

The TAP-IT study is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effectiveness of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure. In patients admitted to the hospital with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and pleural effusion, a strategy of routine referral to thoracentesis did not increase the number of days the participants were alive and out of the hospital in the following 90 days. Thoracentesis was safe, with a major complications rate of 1%, consistent with previous reports. Greater than expected variation in the primary outcome may limit the statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes. However, the findings lay the groundwork for future research to confirm the results and further clarify the potential role of thoracentesis for patients with acute heart failure and pleural effusion.

### Ct volumetric analysis of pleural effusions: a comparison with thoracentesis volumes [^112fPgmT]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT) volumetric analysis of pleural effusions with thoracentesis volumes. A secondary objective was to compare subjective grading of pleural effusion size with thoracentesis volumes.

This retrospective study involved 67 patients with free-flowing pleural effusions who underwent therapeutic thoracentesis. CT volumetric analysis was performed on all patients, and the CT volumes were compared with the thoracentesis volumes. Subjective grading of pleural effusion size was also compared with the thoracentesis volumes.

The results showed that the average difference between CT volume and thoracentesis volume was 9.4 mL (1.3%) ± 290 mL (30%); these volumes were not statistically different (P = 0.79, paired two-tailed Student's t-test). The thoracentesis volume for "small", "moderate", and "large" pleural effusions, as graded on chest CT, was approximately 410 ± 260 cc, 770 ± 270 mL, and 1370 ± 650 mL, respectively. In contrast, on chest radiograph, the volumes were approximately 610 ± 320 mL, 1040 ± 460 mL, and 1530 ± 830 mL, respectively.

CT volumetric analysis is an accessible tool that can be used to accurately quantify the size of pleural effusions.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^1179i4nZ]. Circulation (2025). Low credibility.

The control group received standard medical therapy, with the treating physician determining the dose of diuretics and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). The thoracentesis group was referred to upfront thoracentesis in addition to standard medical therapy. Thoracentesis was performed according to local practices, including any required interruption of anticoagulant therapy. The standard procedure was ultrasound-guided insertion of an intercostal small-bore pigtail catheter, usually 5–8 French, and passive drainage over a few hours. In patients with bilateral non-negligible pleural effusion, bilateral thoracentesis could be performed at the discretion of the treating physician. To ensure the safety of the participants in the control group, thoracentesis was allowed in patients who developed an indication for diagnostic thoracentesis or whose condition deteriorated to a state during which an exclusion criterion was fulfilled. Participants in the control group with diuretic-resistant pleural effusion with no response to pharmacological therapy by day 5 could be referred to thoracentesis. Clinical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging, including echocardiography during the index admission, were performed according to the standard of care of each department, and participants were discharged when deemed appropriate by the treating physician. There were no trial-related follow-up visits. During the 90-day follow-up period, participants were contacted on day 14 after discharge to arrange questionnaire follow-up by telephone.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^116JtBTp]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Small or moderate effusions and their drainage generally do not cause major hemodynamic changes. Even in mechanically ventilated patients, fluid evacuation does not significantly alter blood pressure, cardiac output (CO), or catecholamine dose requirements. A detailed description of the effects of pleural effusion on cardiovascular function is beyond the scope of this article.

Large effusions do not usually reduce CO at rest but can limit its rise during exercise. In a study where saline up to 40 ml/kg was infused into both hemithoraces of dogs, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and central venous pressure increased in proportion to the pleural fluid added. The CO did not change until a larger volume (40–80 ml/kg) was instilled, which then caused a significant drop in CO and resulted in death in many animals. The hemodynamic changes of large bilateral effusions in dogs mimic those of pericardial tamponade: elevated intrapericardial pressure, impaired cardiac filling, reduced stroke volume, and right ventricular diastolic collapse. Ventricular diastolic collapse can also be observed with large, unilateral effusions and resolves quickly post-thoracentesis.

Breathlessness in patients with pleural effusions is most prominent during exertion. Only two studies have examined the effect of pleural effusion and thoracentesis on exercise capacity. Both studies showed an impairment of baseline exercise capacity in patients with effusions and demonstrated benefits from thoracentesis.

One study (n = 25) utilized the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and found an average baseline distance of 432 ± 78 m (73% predicted).

### British thoracic society guideline for pleural disease [^1153NVZZ]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, specifically concerning pleural fluid analysis, the BTS 2023 guidelines recommend the following approach based on the measured pleural fluid pH in patients with suspected complex parapneumonic effusion:

- **Situation: PH ≤ 7.2**: High risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection. Insert an intercostal drain if the volume of accessible pleural fluid on ultrasound deems the procedure safe.

- **Situation: PH > 7.2**: Measure pleural fluid LDH and consider performing intercostal drainage if pleural fluid LDH is > 900 IU/L. This is especially important if other clinical parameters support complex parapneumonic effusion, including ongoing temperature, high pleural fluid volume, low pleural fluid glucose (≤ 4.0 mmol/L or 72 mg/dL), and evidence of pleural contrast enhancement on CT or septation on ultrasound.

- **Situation: PH ≥ 7.4**: Low risk of complex parapneumonic effusion or pleural infection. Do not perform immediate drainage.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^114oc9Nw]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects up to 15% of patients with cancer, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing. Most cases are symptomatic; the most common symptoms are dyspnea due to compression of the lung parenchyma, impaired chest wall movement, and, particularly, diaphragmatic dysfunction. MPE usually represents advanced or metastatic disease, with a median survival of 3–12 months depending on the primary cancer site and other prognostic factors.

- **Common treatments**: The most common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief are therapeutic thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis (talc slurry), or insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) at bedside. Chemical pleurodesis (e.g. talc poudrage, tetracycline, doxycycline, or bleomycin) or mechanical pleurodesis can also be performed during surgery. Pleurectomy or abrasion pleurodesis is still performed in rare cases.

- **Therapeutic thoracentesis**: Therapeutic thoracentesis involves ultrasound-guided insertion of a catheter-over-needle into the pleural space to extract as much pleural fluid as possible. Following thoracentesis, fluid reaccumulates in more than 50% of patients, necessitating multiple thoracentesis procedures. Therefore, thoracentesis is not considered a long-term treatment option.

- **Definitive therapies**: In contrast, talc pleurodesis and IPCs are considered definitive therapies. Talc pleurodesis is typically conducted as an inpatient procedure and involves the delivery of graded talc into the pleural cavity via thoracoscopy (poudrage) or chest tube (slurry) following complete drainage of the MPE and lung re-expansion. Talc pleurodesis is successful.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^111q4f6C]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain severely affecting the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions.

Common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstays of treatment but represent very different approaches: talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by factors such as the patient's clinical characteristics, individual treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care.

We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment. We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients.

There are barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefit.

### Etiologies of bilateral pleural effusions [^114FceL1]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To evaluate the safety, etiology, and outcomes of patients undergoing bilateral thoracentesis. This is a prospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral thoracenteses in an academic medical center from July 2009 through November 2010. Pleural fluid characteristics and etiologies of the effusions were assessed. Mean differences in levels of fluid characteristics between right and left lungs were tested. Associations between fluid characteristics and occurrence of bilateral malignant effusions were evaluated. The rate of pneumothorax and other complications subsequent to bilateral thoracentesis was determined.

- **Results**: Exudates were more common than transudates, and most effusions had multiple etiologies, with 83% having two or more etiologies. Bilateral malignant effusions occurred in 19 patients, were the most common single etiology of exudative effusions, and were associated with higher levels of protein and LDH in the pleural fluid. Among 200 thoracenteses performed with a bilateral procedure, seven resulted in pneumothoraces, three of which required chest tube drainage and four were ex vacuo.

- **Conclusions**: More often than not, there are multiple etiologies that contribute to pleural fluid formation, and of the combinations of etiologies observed, congestive heart failure was the most frequent contributor. Exudative effusions are more common than transudates when bilateral effusions are present. Malignancy is a common etiology of exudative effusions. This study suggests that the overall complication rate following bilateral thoracentesis is significant.

- **Subjects and methods**: Twenty-one patients with transudative pleural effusions due to congestive heart failure were prospectively studied. Repeated diagnostic thoracentesis (mean ± SD = 3 ± 1; range, 2 to 6) was performed until the effusions were radiographically unapparent (5 ± 2 days). Thirty-one patients with congestive heart failure who underwent only a single thoracentesis after diuretic therapy served as controls. We measured the concentrations of various components of pleural effusions in the serum and in the pleural fluid, and determined the serum-pleural fluid gradient (serum concentration minus pleural fluid concentration) and ratio (serum concentration divided by pleural fluid concentration).

- **Results**: The pleural concentrations of most components increased significantly (P < 0.001) from the initial specimen to the final specimen: total protein, from 23 ± 7 g/L to 33 ± 9 g/L; albumin, from 13 ± 4 g/L to 18 ± 6 g/L; lactate dehydrogenase, from 177 ± 62 U/L to 288 ± 90 U/L; cholesterol, from 31 ± 16 mg/dL to 52 ± 22 mg/dL; and cholinesterase, from 1,304 ± 616 U/L to 1,884 ± 674 U/L. Expressed as percentage change, the increases in the serum-pleural fluid gradients for albumin (12% ± 22%) and total protein (11% ± 12%) were significantly less than the increases in their concentrations in pleural fluid.

### Improving the safety of thoracentesis [^116qdGDF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Thoracentesis is a common bedside procedure associated with iatrogenic complications, including pneumothorax. Experienced clinicians using optimal procedural techniques within a supportive system can achieve improvements in safety. However, clinicians have been relatively slow to adopt these changes. This review examines the available literature regarding procedural safety of thoracentesis, with emphasis on best practice models to reduce iatrogenic complications.

Recent studies have identified procedure-specific variables that are independently associated with iatrogenic pneumothorax. These include inexperienced operators, lack of ultrasound imaging, and large-volume aspiration of fluid. The development of a best practice model, including procedural training within a focused procedural group that utilizes ultrasound imaging, further improves thoracentesis procedural safety.

Several procedural modifications have led to improvements in thoracentesis procedural safety, reducing iatrogenic complications. We review the known risks associated with thoracentesis and identify the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors. Based on recent studies, we make recommendations and encourage the incorporation of 'best practice' techniques for thoracentesis procedures.

### A randomized, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intrapleural instillation of methylprednisolone acetate in the management of malignant pleural effusion [^117UrcFK]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine if the intrapleural administration of methylprednisolone acetate (MA) after therapeutic thoracentesis for symptomatic malignant pleural effusion would improve the time to repeat thoracentesis for symptom control, quality of life (QOL), and dyspnea.

The investigation was conducted as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial at a tertiary care cancer treatment center in Edmonton, AB, Canada. Participants were patients with symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to disseminated malignancy requiring therapeutic thoracentesis for symptom control.

In the interventions, sixty-seven patients underwent ultrasound-guided therapeutic thoracentesis to manage symptomatic malignant pleural effusion. They were randomly and blindly assigned to receive either 160 mg (8 mL) of MA or 8 mL of saline solution instilled into the pleural space. The follow-up period was six weeks to determine the time to repeat therapeutic thoracentesis. Additionally, all patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) QOL questionnaire and a dyspnea visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and again two weeks later.

Measurements and results indicated that thirty-three patients received MA, while thirty-four received a placebo. The baseline characteristics in the two groups were similar, with the exception of a slightly higher use of systemic therapy in the placebo group. At the six-week follow-up, 50% of MA-treated patients required repeat thoracentesis compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients, which was not significant (NS). The mean of the individual FACT-G change scores (two weeks - baseline) was similar in the two groups.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions. An official ATS/STS/STR clinical practice guideline [^1118BRxy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). High credibility.

When managing pleural effusion, particularly in cases involving malignant pleural effusion, the ATS/STS/STR 2018 guidelines recommend considering large-volume thoracentesis. This procedure should be performed in patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion if it remains unclear whether the patient's symptoms stem from the effusion. Additionally, if pleurodesis is being considered, assessing lung expandability is crucial to determine whether the lung is expandable.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^115nuNRH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion is a common condition, and therapeutic drainages are performed worldwide every day despite there being limited understanding of the mechanism of breathlessness and no accurate predictors to guide patient selection.

Definitive studies to examine the cause of breathlessness in pleural effusion are challenging to perform. Prior attempts have been limited by small and markedly heterogeneous patient cohorts that include a wide range of pleural effusions of different causes, sizes, and the acuity of accumulation in patients with varying severity of breathlessness, hypoxemia, and cardiorespiratory diseases. Variations in study protocols and endpoints also make comparisons difficult. For example, different assessment times after drainage (ranging from immediately to 48 hours post-drainage) complicate result interpretation. Differences in fluid volume removed further confound the results.

Defining the optimal tool to assess breathlessness in pleural effusion must be a priority. Prospective studies to identify key factors governing breathlessness with pleural effusions and to develop predictors of improvement following pleural drainage are needed. Ideally, a comprehensive approach incorporating clinical, physiological, and radiological parameters in a large unbiased patient population should be employed.

The ability to select and limit pleural interventions to patients who are likely to have symptomatic benefits from fluid drainage would represent a major advance in pleural medicine.

### A randomized controlled trial of thoracentesis in acute heart failure [^114BMZJc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

There are several possible explanations for the neutral outcome of TAP-IT. The population was elderly, with substantial comorbidities and frailty, which may partly explain the lack of effect of thoracentesis on days alive and out of hospital (DAOH). In fact, the 90-day all-cause hospitalization rate was 41%, with heart failure-related hospitalizations accounting for only 14% of the total rehospitalizations. Other trials on decongestive strategies and treatment have shown an effect on short-term outcome measures, such as congestion scores and responses to diuretics, but no effect on rehospitalization, mortality, or length of hospital stay.

The potential benefits of thoracentesis could have been reduced if the effusions were too small. Observational studies on the impact of thoracentesis by effusion size in patients with heart failure are small and have shown conflicting results. One study (n = 10) indicated that symptom relief was more common in patients with effusions greater than 1000 mL, whereas others have found symptom relief and improvement in oxygenation regardless of the volume drained.

In TAP-IT, a pragmatic trial, the population reflects patients considered appropriate for thoracentesis on the basis of clinical practice. The result of TAP-IT reveals that the population considered for thoracentesis does not seem to benefit from routine referral to the procedure. The efficacy of thoracentesis in pleural effusion related to heart failure warrants investigation in more selective populations, perhaps on the basis of persisting symptoms, larger effusion volumes, or low tolerance of diuretics.

### Large-volume thoracentesis and the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema [^114AV3NZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

To avoid reexpansion pulmonary edema (RPE), thoracenteses are often limited to draining no more than 1 L. There are, however, significant clinical benefits to removing more than 1 L of fluid. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence of RPE among patients undergoing large-volume (≥ 1 L) thoracentesis.

- **Methods**: One hundred eighty-five patients undergoing large-volume thoracentesis were included in this study. The volume of fluid removed, absolute pleural pressure, pleural elastance, and symptoms during thoracentesis were compared between patients who did and did not experience RPE.

- **Results**: Of the 185 patients, 98 (53%) had between 1 L and 1.5 L withdrawn, 40 (22%) had between 1.5 L and 2 L withdrawn, 38 (20%) had between 2 L and 3 L withdrawn, and 9 (5%) had more than 3 L withdrawn. Only 1 patient (0.5%, 95% confidence interval: 0.01% to 3%) experienced clinical RPE. Four patients (2.2%, 95% confidence interval: 0.06% to 5.4%) had radiographic RPE, diagnosed only on postprocedure imaging without clinical symptoms. The incidence of RPE was not associated with the absolute change in pleural pressure, pleural elastance, or symptoms during thoracentesis.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical and radiographic RPE after large-volume thoracentesis is rare and independent of the volume of fluid removed, pleural pressures, and pleural elastance. The recommendation to terminate thoracentesis after removing 1 L of fluid needs to be reconsidered: large effusions can, and should, be drained completely as long as chest discomfort or end-expiratory pleural pressure less than -.

### Indwelling pleural catheters for benign pleural effusions: What is the evidence [^111yZheD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Benign pleural effusions are common and usually managed by treating the underlying disease process. In some patients, these effusions may be refractory to medical management. Indwelling pleural catheters, used extensively for malignant pleural effusions, are increasingly used in benign pleural effusions not responding to medical therapy. This review focuses on data regarding their safety and effectiveness in effusions due to congestive heart failure, hepatic hydrothorax, end-stage renal disease, and chylothorax.

- **Recent findings**: Indwelling pleural catheters are effective and appear well tolerated in congestive heart failure, seem to be associated with a low complication rate, and may be considered a reasonable treatment option, particularly for non-transplant candidates. The pleurodesis rate interestingly approaches that of malignant pleural effusions (30–40%). In hepatic hydrothorax, indwelling pleural catheters carry a substantial risk of infectious complications and mortality risk and should be avoided in patients awaiting transplantation, but may be acceptable in the setting of palliation in selected patients intolerant to or poor candidates for other therapeutic options. Data are limited for end-stage renal disease and chylothorax; therefore, indwelling pleural catheters should only be considered in these situations following a thoughtful multidisciplinary discussion.

- **Summary**: Indwelling pleural catheters are effective at symptom palliation and have pleurodesis rates comparable to that seen in malignant pleural effusions. However, given the potential risks and limited data in certain conditions, careful consideration is necessary.

### Therapeutic thoracentesis: The role of ultrasound and pleural manometry [^115ai5GK]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Therapeutic thoracentesis is one of the most commonly performed medical procedures. The availability of handheld ultrasound machines has greatly enhanced the evaluation and management of patients with pleural effusions, with advantages including the absence of radiation, ease of use, portability, and real-time/dynamic imaging. Pleural manometry refers to the measurement of pleural pressure during thoracentesis. Though described more than 122 years ago, most physicians do not measure pleural pressure or even consider the role pleural pressures play in the development of pleural effusions. This review summarizes the relevant data behind the use of ultrasound and manometry and explores their use during therapeutic thoracentesis.

- **Recent findings**: The use of ultrasound has been associated with higher sensitivity for identifying pleural effusions, avoiding 'near misses', and a lower pneumothorax rate for thoracentesis. Pleural manometry can be used to distinguish patients with lung entrapment from those with trapped lung. Manometry is also able to predict the ability to pleurodesis patients with malignant effusions and possibly minimize the risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema when large volumes of pleural fluid are removed.

- **Summary**: The use of ultrasound and pleural manometry enhances the understanding of pleural disease and is associated with clinical benefits that will lead to improved patient care.

Regarding medical management for ascites, more specifically with respect to diuretic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend adding furosemide. The starting dose is 40 mg/day orally, and it can be increased in 40 mg increments to a maximum of 160 mg/day if there is no response to lower doses. This is advised for patients not responding to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, as defined by a body weight reduction of less than 2 kg/week, or in patients developing hyperkalemia.

### Management of malignant pleural effusions: Questions that need answers [^111SnTiY]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common. However, regardless of the differences between patients, their underlying cancer type, and pleural fluid characteristics, management options are often limited. These have not advanced significantly over the last 80 years since pleurodesis was first described. Correspondingly, patient-related outcome measures have been neglected. The evidence (or lack thereof) behind the treatment recommendations is reviewed, and key research questions are described.

- **Recent findings**: Talc continues to be the most effective sclerosant available for pleurodesis in MPE. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing talc pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter insertion as first-line therapy suggests these approaches are equally effective and utilized a patient-based symptom score as the primary outcome. The need to acknowledge the advances in translational medicine and oncological therapies to measure patient-related trial outcomes and to target pleural fluid formation in MPE is discussed.

- **Summary**: Pulmonologists should be aware of the staggering lack of progress in the evidence that supports the current 'recommended' management of MPE. The need for a re-think about MPE management with a focus on alternative therapeutic targets and treatment objectives should be appreciated in order to optimize future patient care.

### Current trends in treating malignant pleural effusion: Evidence, guidelines, and best practice recommendations [^113qmtyJ]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common in individuals with cancer and typically reflects advanced disease. Most cases are symptomatic, with dyspnea and pain having a severe effect on the patient's quality of life (QOL). The management of MPE aims to relieve symptoms, improve QOL, prevent repeated pleural interventions, and minimize hospital admissions.

Common treatments for MPE that provide symptomatic relief include thoracentesis, chemical (talc) pleurodesis, or indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs). Talc pleurodesis and IPCs are the mainstay of treatment but represent very different treatment strategies: talc pleurodesis is an inpatient procedure, whereas IPCs are an ambulatory strategy. Given their similar efficacy, treatment decisions in MPE are often determined by other factors, such as the patient's clinical characteristics, individual treatment goals, and preferences for hospital-based or home-based care.

We provide a summary of the evidence for different interventions for treating MPE and compare recommendations from the major American, European, British, and Spanish guidelines regarding when to consider each treatment. We highlight specific challenging treatment scenarios and key clinical considerations that may influence treatment decisions for different patients.

There are barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care. Patients with symptomatic MPE would benefit from early referral from oncology teams to pleural services. We provide best practice recommendations for optimal referral and coordination of care to ensure that patients receive maximum benefit.

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course.

Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed: malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes. Whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, pleural effusions were attributed to a single cause. However, there is growing recognition that a substantial proportion may have more than one underlying cause. This review aims to summarize recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions with multiple aetiologies.

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant diseases, the incidence of complex pleural patients is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, has been suggested as a method to identify contributing disease processes.

Understanding the potential for multiple causes of a pleural effusion is vital in establishing diagnoses. New diagnostic pathways that increasingly use biomarkers will be required to identify complex pleural effusions. Further studies on whether targeting separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^111mjQEr]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pleural effusions can have significant pathophysiological effects, particularly concerning gas exchange. Most studies examining these effects involve small, heterogeneous patient groups with varying pleural and systemic diseases, conducted in diverse settings such as ventilated versus spontaneously breathing patients. This necessitates careful interpretation of their findings.

- **Gas exchange**: Pleural effusions can impair gas exchange. Studies using mechanically ventilated pigs have demonstrated that the instillation of physiological saline into both pleural spaces leads to early and dose-related hypoxemia. Agusti et al. identified intrapulmonary shunt as a contributing factor to hypoxemia in patients with recent-onset pleural effusions, as determined using the multiple inert gas elimination technique.

Thoracentesis, a procedure to remove fluid from the pleural space, appears to improve gas exchange. A meta-analysis of 19 studies involving 1124 mechanically ventilated patients reported an average improvement in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio by 18%. Improvements in gas exchange are more consistently observed 24 hours post-thoracentesis, rather than immediately. Notably, hypoxemia can worsen up to two hours after thoracentesis, possibly due to re-expansion pulmonary edema or delayed pulmonary re-expansion.

Several factors may influence the extent of improvement in gas exchange following thoracentesis. In mechanically ventilated patients, improvements in PaO2:FiO2 have been linked to the volume of fluid drained and the increase in end-expiratory lung volume. Patients with lower initial PaO2:FiO2 ratios often derive greater benefit from the procedure.
