## Question

Candida treatment diaper

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and treat Candida diaper dermatitis in infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and how to distinguish candidal from irritant diaper dermatitis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, especially when and how to use KOH microscopy. Next, I will review first-line management, including barrier strategies and antifungal selection. After that, I need to check safety considerations, particularly steroid use in the diaper area. Finally, I will consider special populations, prevention, and follow-up, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype of candidal diaper dermatitis. Classically, it presents as a beefy-red, confluent plaque involving the perianal and intertriginous areas with satellite pustules and often involvement of the deep folds, which helps distinguish it from irritant diaper dermatitis that tends to spare the folds and lacks satellite lesions [^1168cD8Y]. Wait, let me verify the satellite sign; yes, the presence of small peripheral pustules is a hallmark that should prompt consideration of Candida overgrowth superimposed on barrier breakdown [^1168cD8Y].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is appropriate. For suspected candidal involvement, a bedside KOH preparation from a pustule or active border showing pseudohyphae and budding yeast confirms infection and guides therapy; culture alone is not sufficient because colonization is common and does not prove infection [^113sbrwj] [^1168cD8Y]. Hold on, I should verify the FDA label language; VUSION is indicated only when candidiasis is documented microscopically, reinforcing the need for KOH rather than culture-only diagnosis in this context [^113sbrwj].

> Next, I should review first-line management. I will now examine the core measures: frequent diaper changes, gentle cleansing with water or mild cleanser, thorough drying, and liberal application of a barrier ointment such as zinc oxide or petrolatum at every change to restore barrier function and reduce irritant exposure [^116a4e6i] [^117G83X7]. Let me consider adjuncts; breathable disposable diapers can reduce humidity and Candida burden, and caregiver education on minimizing friction and moisture is essential to prevent recurrence [^112B5DQZ] [^111rw9Nt].

> If candidiasis is confirmed or strongly suspected clinically with supportive KOH, I should add a topical antifungal. Options with pediatric evidence include nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole, or ciclopirox; typical courses are 7 days, applied at each diaper change, with extension if needed based on response [^113sbrwj] [^114bWszB]. Wait, I should double-check the miconazole data; a double-blind RCT showed miconazole 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base improved moderate-to-severe diaper dermatitis, particularly when Candida was present, supporting both antifungal and barrier benefits in one product [^1151tFF5]. I need to ensure I note that VUSION is FDA-approved for diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis in infants 4 weeks and older, which operationalizes the KOH-first approach in labeling [^113sbrwj].

> But wait, what if someone proposes a steroid-containing combination for rapid relief? I should confirm the safety stance. High-potency or even medium-potency topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in the diaper area due to occlusion and increased systemic absorption, risking HPA axis suppression and other adverse effects; multiple FDA labels explicitly advise against steroid use in the diaper region [^113WtMBs] [^111Wdqde] [^115LkniT]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some combination antifungal–steroid products exist for other tinea, but they should be avoided in the diaper area and in young children, and if used elsewhere, limited to very short courses with close follow-up due to risks of atrophy, masking infection, and systemic effects [^113f4CGC] [^115LkniT].

> I should confirm duration and follow-up. A 7-day antifungal course is typical, with reassessment at 48–72 hours for improvement; if there is no response, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, check adherence, and repeat KOH or obtain culture to exclude resistant Candida or alternative pathogens before escalating therapy [^113sbrwj] [^1168cD8Y]. Let me verify resistance concerns; repeated short courses of miconazole did not select for resistance in a prospective study of infants with diaper candidiasis, which reassures me about appropriate retreatment when needed [^114kwWfk].

> Special populations require extra caution. In infants under 4 weeks, VUSION is not approved and systemic absorption concerns are higher; nystatin is a reasonable alternative given its minimal systemic absorption, and any treatment should be coordinated with pediatric oversight [^113sbrwj]. In immunocompromised children, including those with HIV, candidal diaper dermatitis is common, but routine antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended; management remains topical therapy with close follow-up for refractory disease or systemic spread [^117VVxBW] [^111bkVUf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought VUSION might be appropriate for neonates, but I should correct that; the label restricts use to infants 4 weeks and older, so for younger neonates I will avoid VUSION and favor nystatin or careful observation with aggressive barrier care [^113sbrwj].

> Prevention is crucial to reduce recurrence. I need to ensure caregivers understand frequent diaper changes, gentle cleansing, thorough drying, and consistent barrier use; breathable diapers and minimizing time in wet diapers further reduce Candida overgrowth and skin maceration [^112B5DQZ] [^117G83X7]. Let me reconsider any additional measures; while some caregivers ask about wipes, the key is to avoid harsh or fragranced products and prioritize barrier restoration rather than any specific wipe brand, as technique and moisture control drive outcomes [^116a4e6i].

> In summary, I should confirm candidal involvement with KOH when suspected, implement barrier-first care for all diaper dermatitis, and add a topical antifungal such as nystatin or miconazole for documented or strongly suspected candidiasis, avoiding corticosteroids in the diaper area; reassess in a week and adjust therapy if there is no improvement, with heightened caution in neonates and immunocompromised infants [^113sbrwj] [^1151tFF5] [^113WtMBs]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with both pediatric dermatology practice and antifungal stewardship; yes, this KOH-driven, barrier-centric, steroid-avoidant strategy matches evidence and labeling and minimizes overtreatment while ensuring timely cure [^1168cD8Y] [^116a4e6i].

For diaper candidiasis, use **topical antifungals** such as nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole, or ketoconazole applied at every diaper change for 7–14 days [^113sbrwj] [^114bWszB] [^1151tFF5]. Combine with **barrier creams** (zinc oxide or petrolatum) and frequent diaper changes to keep the area dry [^116a4e6i] [^117G83X7]. Avoid **corticosteroids** unless clearly indicated, as they can worsen infection or cause atrophy [^113f4CGC] [^113WtMBs]. If the rash persists or recurs, confirm the diagnosis with a KOH prep or culture and consider oral fluconazole for severe or refractory cases [^1168cD8Y] [^117JWeNR].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Diaper candidiasis typically presents as:

- **Bright red, well-demarcated plaques**: Often involving the perianal region, buttocks, and groin [^1168cD8Y].

- **Satellite lesions**: Small, erythematous papules or pustules surrounding the main plaque [^1161iAVm].

- **Involvement of skin folds**: Unlike irritant diaper dermatitis, candidiasis often involves the deep folds of the skin [^1168cD8Y].

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, but confirmation can be made by microscopic examination of skin scrapings using potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, which reveals pseudohyphae and budding yeast [^113sbrwj].

---

## Topical antifungal treatments

Topical antifungal agents are the **first-line treatment** for diaper candidiasis. Commonly used agents include:

| **Antifungal agent** | **Formulation** | **Dosage and application** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nystatin | Cream or ointment | Apply at every diaper change | 7–14 days |
| Miconazole | 2% cream or ointment | Apply at every diaper change | 7–14 days |
| Clotrimazole | 1% cream | Apply at every diaper change | 7–14 days |
| Ketoconazole | 2% cream | Apply once daily | 7–14 days |

---

These agents are effective in **eradicating Candida species** and relieving symptoms. Combination therapy with zinc oxide or petrolatum-based barrier creams is recommended to protect the skin and reduce irritation [^1151tFF5].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures are essential to enhance **treatment efficacy** and prevent recurrence:

- **Frequent diaper changes**: Keep the diaper area dry and clean [^117G83X7].

- **Gentle cleansing**: Use mild soaps or water; avoid harsh cleansers [^117Sx7aY].

- **Barrier creams**: Zinc oxide or petrolatum-based creams provide a protective barrier against moisture and irritants [^114nXbzT].

- **Breathable diapers**: Consider using highly breathable disposable diapers to reduce moisture and Candida colonization [^112B5DQZ].

---

## Avoidance of corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are generally **not recommended** for diaper candidiasis because they can exacerbate fungal infections, cause skin atrophy, and increase the risk of systemic absorption due to the occlusive nature of diapers [^113WtMBs]. If inflammation is severe, a low-potency corticosteroid may be used briefly in combination with antifungal therapy, but this should be done cautiously and under medical supervision [^116F9gVD].

---

## Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic antifungal therapy is reserved for **severe, refractory, or recurrent cases**. Oral fluconazole is the preferred agent, typically administered at a dose of 3–6 mg/kg once daily for 7–14 days. Systemic therapy should be considered in immunocompromised patients or when topical therapy fails.

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing recurrence of diaper candidiasis involves:

- **Regular diaper changes**: Frequent changes to keep the area dry [^117G83X7].

- **Proper skin care**: Gentle cleansing and application of barrier creams [^116a4e6i].

- **Breathable diapers**: Use of highly breathable diapers to reduce moisture [^112B5DQZ].

- **Avoidance of irritants**: Minimize exposure to harsh soaps, wipes, and detergents [^116F9gVD].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical attention should be sought if:

- **Rash persists**: No improvement after 7–14 days of treatment.

- **Severe symptoms**: Extensive rash, bleeding, or systemic symptoms.

- **Immunocompromised**: The infant is immunocompromised or has recurrent infections.

---

Diaper candidiasis is a common fungal infection in infants, and **topical antifungal therapy combined with barrier protection and frequent diaper changes** is effective. Systemic therapy is reserved for severe or refractory cases, and prevention focuses on maintaining dryness and proper skin care.

### Symmetric red-purple papules in the diaper region [^112QcAaR]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate intervention at this time?
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen
E. Tissue culture
A. Barrier cream and avoidance of irritants — Correct. The most appropriate intervention at this time is barrier cream and avoiding further irritation. GGI typically resolves spontaneously over weeks to months with conservative management aimed at preventing irritation in the region. Caretakers should also be counseled on frequent diaper changes.
B. Clobetasol 0.05% cream twice a day for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Caution should be used in applying class I topical steroids to the diaper area because of the high risk of adverse effects, especially in the setting of an occlusive diaper. In addition, because of the controversial relationship between topical steroids and GGI, their use is not recommended.
C. Ketoconazole 2% cream daily for 1 week — Incorrect. Ketoconazole 2% cream may be beneficial in treating candidal diaper dermatitis if it coexists with GGI, but that is not the primary process in our patient.
D. Obtain a punch biopsy specimen — Incorrect. Given the tendency for GGI to resolve spontaneously, holding off on obtaining a biopsy specimen is reasonable at this time in this infant. If the lesions fail to improve or the patient develops systemic symptoms, obtaining a biopsy specimen should be considered to rule out a more serious pathology.
E. Tissue culture — Incorrect. GGI is not an infectious process and therefore tissue culture would not be helpful.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review of 63 children [^112Jz5CL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is a common infantile dermatosis with a highly variable prevalence and incidence. This study aimed to present the demographic and clinical features of babies with DD.

Methods

Data, including demographic and clinical features, obtained from DD patient forms were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

The study included 63 babies with DD (female: n = 35 [55.6%]; male: n = 28 [44.4%]; mean age 11.6 mos). Most of the patients (43.5%) were 0 to 6 months of age. In all, 76.3% were breastfed, of whom 31.7% were exclusively breastfed. The number of previous episodes of DD was significantly lower in breastfed babies. The most common diaper area cleansing method was wet wipes (54.1%). Diaper creams were used in 86.2% of patients. DD was severe in 22.2% of patients, moderate in 57.4%, and mild in 20.4%. Candida infection was noted in 77.4% of patients. The median number of previous episodes of DD was significantly higher in patients with Candida infection than in those without (p = 0.02). Treatment yielded greater than 50% improvement (complete and moderate response) in 59.4% of patients at the first follow-up visit (3–5 days) and 82.6% at the second follow-up visit (10 days).

Conclusion

Most babies with DD were 0 to 6 months of age. Breastfed babies had fewer previous episodes of DD, so mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies to reduce the incidence of DD. Candida infection was common; clinicians should be aware of its association with DD.

### A multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans [^114bWszB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent. This open-label study investigated the safety and efficacy of ciclopirox topical suspension 0.77% in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to Candida albicans (C. albicans). Forty-four male and female subjects aged 6 to 29 months were included in the study. Study medication was applied topically to the affected diaper area twice daily for 1 week. Subjects were clinically evaluated at baseline and days 3, 7, and 14 (7 days post-treatment). Safety and efficacy variables included adverse events, mycological culture studies, KOH tests, Severity Scores, and Global Evaluation of Clinical Response. All adverse events were mild to moderate and considered not related to the study medication. Treatment provided statistically significant improvement (P < .05) for both the rate of mycological cure and reduction of Severity Score at each time point compared with baseline. Ciclopirox was safe and effective in the treatment of diaper dermatitis due to C. albicans.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117VVxBW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candida infections — epidemiology and localized candidiasis in children with HIV infection notes that the most common fungal infections in children with HIV infection are caused by Candida spp., and candidiasis is characterized as either localized or invasive. Oral thrush and diaper dermatitis occur in 50% to 85% of children with HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) continues to be one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in children with HIV infection during the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era (28% of children), with an incidence rate of 0.93 per 100 child-years.

### Diaper dermatitis: a therapeutic dilemma. results of a double-blind placebo controlled trial of miconazole nitrate 0.25% [^1151tFF5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area, is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial compared the efficacy and safety of miconazole nitrate 0.25% in a zinc oxide/petrolatum base with that of the ointment base alone in treating acute diaper dermatitis in infants and evaluated the role of Candida albicans in the response to treatment. Infants age 2–13 months with diaper rash were treated with either miconazole nitrate 0.25% (N = 101) or ointment base (N = 101) for 7 days. Although improvement in rash from baseline was seen in both treatment groups on days 3, 5, and 7, patients receiving miconazole nitrate 0.25% had significantly fewer rash sites and lower mean total rash scores on days 5 and 7 (p < 0.001). In the miconazole nitrate 0.25% group, improvement was most marked among those with moderate or severe diaper dermatitis at baseline and among patients whose baseline rashes were positive for C. albicans. Treatment with miconazole nitrate 0.25% was as safe as with ointment base alone. Miconazole nitrate 0.25% ointment is a safe and effective treatment for diaper dermatitis in infants.

### Differential diagnoses of diaper dermatitis [^115zKRec]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common contact eczema present in early childhood. The main cause is an irritant reaction to urine and feces, which is facilitated by the occlusive conditions under the diaper, leading to hyperhydration of the stratum corneum (diaper dermatitis). In addition, diaper pressure and friction can increase the risk of skin inflammation, which also opens the skin up to other irritant agents, allergens, and infectious agents, such as candida albicans. However, a variety of diseases are associated with inflammation of the skin in the diaper region, therefore the term "diaper dermatitis" is merely descriptive and does not reflect anything about the etiopathogenesis. The term diaper dermatitis refers only to an inflammation in the diapering area and should not be automatically equated with reactions to diapers. Making the correct diagnosis requires a thorough examination of the skin in its entirety and a detailed report of the patient's medical and family history. Once a specific pattern is identified, a precise diagnosis, and an appropriate therapy, can be determined.

### Prospective aetiological study of diaper dermatitis in the elderly [^117JWeNR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The different causes of diaper dermatitis (DD) in the elderly are not well known and the treatment is often empirical.

Objectives

To determine the causes of DD in the elderly and to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal treatments in this indication.

Methods

Consecutive patients presenting with DD were included. Clinical evaluation, skin swabs for bacterial and mycological cultures, patch testing and skin biopsy were performed at inclusion. This was followed by 1 month of topical antifungal cream and, if needed, by oral fluconazole for the second month.

Results

Forty-six patients were included (mean age 85 years). Causes of DD were established for 38 patients: 24 had candidiasis (63%), six irritant dermatitis (16%), four eczema (11%) and four psoriasis (11%). After 2 months of treatment, 27 of 37 (73%) patients were cured and five of 37 were improved.

Conclusions

Mycoses and irritant dermatitis are the main causes of DD in the elderly, and emollient skin care and topical antifungal treatment can be considered a first-line therapy for this indication.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113sbrwj]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VUSION Ointment is indicated for adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and /or budding yeast) in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance. (1.2)

1.1 	Indication

VUSION Ointment is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis only when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast), in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. A positive fungal culture for Candida albicans is not adequate evidence of candidal infection since colonization with C. albicans can result in a positive culture. The presence of candidal infection should be established by microscopic evaluation prior to initiating treatment.

VUSION should be used as part of a treatment regimen that includes measures directed at the underlying diaper dermatitis, including gentle cleansing of the diaper area and frequent diaper changes. VUSION should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes.

1.2 	Limitations of Use

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients, or in infants less than 4 weeks of age (premature or term).

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been evaluated in incontinent adult patients. VUSION should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, such as in an adult institutional setting, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance.

### Case report: diaper dermatitis presenting as pustules [^1168cD8Y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is the most common dermatologic disorder of infancy. Its cause can often be determined clinically based on the clinical presentation. Primary diaper dermatitis is associated with irritants and spares the deep skin folds. Secondary diaper dermatitis is most often caused by Candida yeast overgrowth and typically presents as a well-defined area of beefy red erythema covering the diaper area and including the deep folds of skin with hallmark satellite pustules. Other causes include seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, acrodermatitis enteropathica, allergic contact dermatitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and, in the setting of a primarily pustular eruption, bacterial folliculitis. A simple potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH) can confirm the diagnosis of candida diaper dermatitis and guide proper treatment.

### Effects of breathable disposable diapers: reduced prevalence of Candida and common diaper dermatitis [^112B5DQZ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Infants wearing breathable disposable diapers experienced significantly less diaper dermatitis (DD) compared to infants wearing standard, nonbreathable disposable diapers in a series of double-blind clinical trials. Severe DD, including confirmed infection with Candida albicans, was reduced by 38–50% among infants wearing highly breathable (HB) diapers. The prevalence of DD was inversely related to the breathability of the garments. The inhibitory effect of breathable diapers on the survival of Candida was further confirmed in controlled experiments with adult volunteers. A suspension of C. albicans cells was applied to delineated sites on the volar forearm. Each site was then covered by a full-thickness patch from either an HB or a standard diaper. Survival of Candida colonies was reduced by almost two-thirds in the breathable diaper-covered sites compared to the control sites.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis [^113YyJ1D]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous infection with Candida in neonates ranges from such common conditions as thrush and diaper dermatitis to serious diseases with potential for systemic involvement, including congenital candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis. In premature infants, seemingly benign mucocutaneous involvement may precede systemic infection and thus warrants thoughtful attention. Skin involvement also may be seen as an expression of systemic disease. The physical appearance of these lesions is often characteristic, allowing easy diagnosis. The patients at risk differ by gestational age and postnatal age at presentation. Systemic candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis typically occur in premature infants, particularly those with extremely low birth weight (≤ 1,000 g), whereas thrush and diaper dermatitis may occur in infants of any gestational age or birth weight. Congenital candidiasis presents at birth, while invasive fungal dermatitis typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of life, and thrush, diaper dermatitis, and systemic candidiasis may occur at any time in infancy. Controversy exists concerning optimal therapy of mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### The importance of skincare for neonates and infants: an algorithm [^116a4e6i]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The skin of neonates and infants undergoes a maturation process from birth and is susceptible to barrier disruption. The current algorithm follows a US-based consensus paper on skincare approaches using gentle cleansers and moisturizers in neonatal and healthy infant skin. This summary provides clinical information for pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, and pediatric healthcare providers treating neonates and infants.

Methods

The project used a modified Delphi process comprising virtual discussions followed by an online follow-up replacing the use of a questionnaire. During the virtual meeting, the systematic literature review results and a draft algorithm addressing over-the-counter skincare for neonates and infants with healthy skin were discussed and adopted using evidence coupled with the expert opinion and experience of the panel.

Results

The algorithm addresses three clinical signs: xerosis, erythema, and erosion/bulla. A growing body of evidence recognizes the benefits of ongoing daily use of non-alkaline cleansers and ceramides containing moisturizers to reduce inflammation and maintain a healthy skin barrier function. Diaper rash is common in infants presenting as erythema or, in more severe cases, skin erosion. Skin protection with a barrier cream and frequent diaper changes using disposable diapers resolves most cases; however, if the rash continuous despite appropriate care, rule out a candida infection.

Conclusion

The current algorithm focuses on neonatal and infant healthy skin that can benefit from skincare. When applied from birth onwards, gentle cleansers and moisturizers containing barrier lipids help maintain the protective skin barrier. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11):1195–1205. doi:10.36849/JDD.6219.

### Diaper dermatitis: a review and brief survey of eruptions of the diaper area [^112gM6Dm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Eruptions in the diaper area are the most common dermatologic problem in infancy. Such eruptions can be subdivided into primary diaper dermatitis, an acute inflammation of the skin in the diaper area with an ill-defined and multifactorial etiology, and secondary diaper dermatitis, a term which encompasses eruptions in the diaper area with defined etiologies. The most important factors in the development of primary diaper dermatitis are: (i) water/moisture, (ii) friction, (iii) urine, (iv) feces, and (v) microorganisms (sometimes). Possible treatments include minimizing diaper use and using disposable diapers, barrier creams, mild topical cortisones, and antifungal agents. A variety of other inflammatory and infectious processes can occur in the diaper area and an awareness of these secondary types of diaper dermatitis aids in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients.

### Diaper (napkin) dermatitis: a fold (intertriginous) dermatosis [^116F9gVD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Diaper (napkin) dermatitis is an acutely presenting inflammatory irritant contact dermatitis of the diaper region. It is one of the most common dermatologic diseases in infants and children. In the past, the disease was thought to be caused by ammonia; however, a number of factors, such as friction, wetness, inappropriate skin care, microorganisms, antibiotics, and nutritional defects, are important. Diaper dermatitis commonly affects the lower parts of the abdomen, thighs, and diaper area. Involvement of skin fold regions is typical with diaper dermatitis. At the early stages of the disease, only dryness is observed in the affected area. At later stages, erythematous maceration and edema can be seen. Secondary candidal and bacterial infections can complicate the dermatitis. In the differential diagnosis of the disease, allergic contact dermatitis, intertrigo, psoriasis, atopic and seborrheic dermatitis, and the other diseases should be considered. Causes of the disease should be determined and eliminated primarily. Families need to be informed about the importance of a clean, dry diaper area and the frequency of diaper changes. The use of superabsorbent disposable diapers has decreased the incidence of the disease. Soap and alcohol-containing products should be avoided in cleaning the area. In some cases, corticosteroids and antifungal agents can be administered. If necessary, antibacterial agents and calcineurin inhibitors can also be beneficial.

### Prospective trial for the clinical efficacy of anogenital skin care with miconazole nitrate-containing soap for diaper candidiasis [^115YtNuq]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anogenital skin care for the elderly remains an umbrella term concerning protective and non-interventional regimens, particularly for ordinary diaper users. Our recent investigation has demonstrated the preventive effect of daily anogenital washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap to the development of diaper candidiasis. We extended this work to cover our hypothesis as to whether the miconazole soap has a therapeutic benefit in genital candidiasis. The study outline includes: (i) the enrollment of 21 bedridden inpatients (84 ± 9 years; eight men and 13 women) who were diagnosed clinically and mycologically with genital candidiasis, and who had never received topical and/or systemic antifungal agents; (ii) administration of anogenital washing with 0.75% miconazole-containing soap once daily for 4 weeks; and (iii) assessment of clinical symptoms and detection of Candida materials by culture and microscopic examination. As assessed by clinical symptom scoring for incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), the ratio of patients with severe to moderate symptoms dramatically decreased by 2 weeks and 10 of 21 patients became symptom-free at 4 weeks. The IAD clinical severity score was significantly decreased at 4 weeks. Compared with the baseline positivity, both microscopic and cultured Candida-positive rates were significantly decreased at 4 weeks after washing. All culture-detected fungi were Candida albicans. Severe adverse events did not occur in all participants. Individual medical and risk factors had no significant correlation with clinical severity and duration of candidiasis on variance analysis. In conclusion, topical washing with miconazole soap is a safe and reliable non-medical approach for soothing diaper-associated genital candidiasis in bedridden inpatients in whom it is difficult to perform prompt medical examination.

### Evaluation of the impact of 2 disposable diapers in the "Natural" diaper category on diapered skin condition [^117DSm7V]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Adverse Events

There were 135 treatment emergent AEs in 76 babies in this study. None of those events were considered serious AEs. Of the nonserious AEs, 101 were mild and 34 were classified as moderate in severity. Of these events, 124 AEs were classified as not related to test product (eg, ear infections, upper respiratory infections, and insect bites). Eleven AEs were classified as doubtful or possible for relatedness, included yeast infection, diaper rash of at least a 2.5, or other marks in the diapered area not classified as diaper rash (6 were on Diaper A and 5 were on Diaper B).

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^115TzYZx]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Study 1 was a double-blind, multicenter study in which VUSION was compared to the zinc oxide and white petrolatum combination treatment and included 236 infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, complicated by candidiasis as documented by KOH tests that demonstrated pseudohyphae and/or budding yeasts. Study medication was applied at every diaper change for 7 days.

The primary endpoint was "Overall Cure" and required that subjects be both clinically cured (total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection) and microbiologically cured (eradication of candidiasis). Primary efficacy was assessed 1 week following the end of treatment, at Day 14.

Study results are shown in the following table.

Two additional studies provided supportive evidence of the clinical efficacy of VUSION in infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, some of whom cultured positive for C. albicans. However, candidal infection was not documented in the culture-positive subjects, as microscopic testing (e.g. KOH) was not done. Therefore, the positive culture results may have reflected colonization rather than infection.

### A prospective two-year assessment of miconazole resistance in Candida spp. with repeated treatment with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment in neonates and infants with moderate to severe diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis [^114kwWfk]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A petrolatum and zinc oxide-based ointment containing 0.25% miconazole nitrate is reported to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by cutaneous candidiasis (DDCC). This prospective, multicenter, open-label, long-term, phase IV study investigated the potential resistance of Candida spp. to repeated topical use of 0.25% miconazole nitrate in infants age 15 months and younger with moderate to severe DDCC. For initial and recurring episodes of DDCC over the 2-year study period, subjects were treated with a 7-day course of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment (active components: miconazole nitrate 0.25%, zinc oxide 15%, and white petrolatum 81.35%) with a 7-day follow-up. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were conducted before treatment (day 0) and 7 days after treatment (day 14). Potential resistance to miconazole was defined using an arbitrary breakpoint of minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 μg/mL. There was no evidence of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. after single or repeated treatment courses of 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment. For the initial episode of DDCC, 83 of 168 subjects (49.4%) achieved a clinical cure, 77 (45.8%) achieved a mycologic cure, and 49 (29.2%) achieved an overall cure (clinical and mycologic). The overall cure rate for recurrent episodes of DDCC was similar to or numerically greater than rates observed for the initial episode. Treatment of DDCC with 0.25% miconazole nitrate ointment was effective and generally well tolerated. No evidence of the development of resistance to miconazole in Candida spp. was observed.

Diaper dermatitis leads to approximately 20% of all childhood dermatology visits. There have been several technologic advances in diaper design the last several years; however, due to the unique environment of the diaper area, many children continue to suffer from a variety of dermatologic conditions of this region. Common causes include allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, infection, and psoriasis. Treatments include allergen avoidance, barrier protection, parent education, and topical therapies.

### Preventive effects of topical washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap to diaper candidiasis in hospitalized elderly patients: a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111Km6Ec]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of the present randomized, double-blind trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily washing with miconazole nitrate-containing soap for candidiasis at diaper-covered sites in elderly subjects under long-term inpatient care. To confirm the onset and disappearance of candidiasis, we microscopically evaluated the existence of the pseudohyphae and/or blastoconidia of Candida spp. We enrolled 75 elderly patients who wore diapers all day in the hospital or nursing home. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either miconazole soap or miconazole-free placebo soap, and 28 patients in the miconazole group and 27 patients in the placebo group were followed for 4 weeks. Although washing with miconazole soap did not affect the frequency of pseudohyphae/blastoconidia-positive patients, it significantly inhibited the positive conversion of pseudohyphae/blastoconidia compared with the placebo group. As a result, the frequency of patients positive for pseudohyphae/blastoconidia was significantly lower in the miconazole group than in the control group at 4 weeks (17.9% vs 44.4%). Clinically apparent diaper candidiasis did not develop in either group. Washing with miconazole soap was a significant independent factor for reducing the cases positive for pseudohyphae/blastoconidia, while diarrhea and heart failure were significant factors associated with an increase in the positive rate at the end-point. Severe adverse effects were not found in any patients. Thus, washing with miconazole soap is well-tolerated and can inhibit the positive conversion of Candida in patients wearing diapers. Therefore, maintenance of genital hygiene using this soap may prophylactically decrease the overall prevalence of patients with diaper candidiasis.

### Topical therapy for dermatophytoses: should corticosteroids be included? [^113f4CGC]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses, commonly known as ringworm or tinea, represent superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, which are among the most common infections encountered in medicine. The use of corticosteroid-containing combinations in dermatophyte infections that are usually treated with topical medications is still a much-debated issue. The addition of a corticosteroid to local antifungal therapy may be of value in reducing local inflammatory reaction and thus carries the theoretical advantage of rapid symptom relief in acute dermatophyte infections associated with heavy inflammation. However, the use of such combinations requires caution as they have some potential risks, especially with long-term use under occlusive conditions. Corticosteroid-induced cutaneous adverse effects have been reported primarily in pediatric patients due to inappropriate application of these preparations on diaper areas. Additionally, the corticosteroid component may interfere with the therapeutic actions of the antifungal agent, or fungal growth may accelerate because of decreased local immunologic host reaction, such that underlying infection may persist, and dermatophytes may even acquire the ability to invade deeper tissues. Analysis of the literature documenting clinical study data and adverse reactions related to combination therapy, drew the following conclusions: (i) combination products containing a low potency nonfluorinated corticosteroid may initially be used for symptomatic inflamed lesions of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, in otherwise healthy adults with good compliance; (ii) therapy should be substituted by a pure antifungal agent once symptoms are relieved, and should never exceed 2 weeks for tinea cruris and 4 weeks for tinea pedis/corporis; and (iii) contraindications for the use of these combinations include application on diaper or other occluded areas and facial lesions, as well as in children < 12 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients for any reason.

At 1 week of life, the candidal rash was much improved, but an erythematous rash persisted on the trunk, extremities, and face. In addition, the infant developed oral thrush and erythema with numerous pustules in the diaper region, presumed to be a candidal diaper rash. It was recommended that oral nystatin of 2 mL PO QID be started for thrush and continue to apply nystatin 100,000 unit/g nystatin cream twice daily to all the affected areas, including the diaper region. Subsequently, small white papules appeared on bilateral palms, and nystatin cream was applied twice daily with resolution of papules after 2 weeks (Figure 1C).

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^116PyBEM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fungal Infections

Fungal infections are also common in patients with AD, especially those caused by the commensal yeast Malassezia. Malassezia colonisation drives inflammation particularly in patients with seborrheic dermatitis on their head, neck, upper chest and back. Repeated exposure to Malassezia antigens induces autoreactivity to human proteins via molecular mimicry, leading to sustained skin inflammation. In a Japanese study, increased age and AD severity were associated with a higher prevalence and degree of IgE sensitisation to Malassezia antigens; Malassezia -specific IgE levels were higher in adults with AD compared with children.

Candida species, particularly C. albicans, are important fungal colonisers in AD. They mostly colonise the skin and mucosal surfaces of the body, such as the genitourinary tract, oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, causing vulvovaginitis, oral thrush and skin and diaper rash. Candida spp. infections can also lead to serious illnesses in individuals with a compromised immune system. C. albicans colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract results in antigen sensitisation, which may potentially lead to chronic AD. Moreover, abnormalities in the production of antibodies against C. albicans may have a role in AD pathogenesis.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^113HZndC]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The miconazole component of VUSION is an antifungal agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. The mechanism of action of white petrolatum and zinc oxide for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The human pharmacodynamics of Vusion is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) for fungal pharmacodynamics].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The topical absorption of miconazole from VUSION was studied in immunocompetent male and female infants and children (n = 17) with diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast) ranging in age from 1 month to 21 months. After multiple daily applications to the affected area at every diaper change (approximately 5–12 times per day) for 7 days, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were below the lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.5 ng/mL in 15 out of 17 (88%) subjects. In the other 2 remaining subjects, the plasma concentrations of miconazole were 0.57 and 0.58 ng/mL, respectively at a single timepoint (4 hours after the last application) on Day 7.

12.4 	Microbiology

The miconazole nitrate component in this product has been shown to have in vitro activity against Candida albicans, an organism that is associated with diaper dermatitis. The activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans is based on the inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis in the cell membrane. The accumulation of ergosterol precursors and toxic peroxides results in cytolysis of the cell. In vitro minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test results for C. albicans isolates obtained from treatment failures in Clinical Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] does not appear to indicate that resistance to miconazole nitrate was the reason for treatment failure. The clinical significance of the in vitro activity of miconazole nitrate against C. albicans in the setting of diaper dermatitis is unclear.

### Symmetric red-purple papules in the diaper region [^1161iAVm]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A father brought his daughter, a 7-month-old healthy female, to the dermatology clinic with a chief complaint of bumps in her diaper area for 1 month. She was diagnosed with eczema and yeast in this area at a few months of life that were treated with topical nystatin and mupirocin. Her father denied the use of any topical steroids on the bumps.

Discussion: The physical examination revealed a well-appearing child with 4 discrete reddish-purplish round papules that were symmetrically distributed on the convexities of the buttocks, ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.0 cm on a background of erythematous thin papules (Fig 1). The rest of her cutaneous examination was normal.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Diaper candidiasis
B. Granuloma gluteale infantum
C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma
D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis
E. Leukemia cutis
A. Diaper candidiasis — Incorrect. Diaper candidiasis classically presents as erythematous plaques, commonly in the folds, with peripheral satellite lesions.
B. Granuloma gluteale infantum — Correct. The most likely diagnosis is granuloma gluteale infantum (GGI), which typically presents as asymptomatic, symmetric, red to purple, oval or round papules or nodules affecting the diaper area in infants.
C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma — Incorrect. Juvenile xanthogranuloma usually presents as a solitary or few discrete pink to yellow papules on the head and neck.
D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis — Incorrect. Langerhans cell histiocytosis typically presents with pink to yellow or skin-colored 1- to 2-mm eroded or hemorrhagic papules, pustules, or vesicles. Patients may also have a seborrheic dermatitis–like eruption involving the scalp and other flexural areas.
E. Leukemia cutis — Incorrect. Although leukemia cutis has a wide clinical presentation, the most characteristic skin findings are flesh-colored to red-brown papules, nodules, and plaques that may become purpuric. In addition, leukemia cutis typically presents concomitantly with or after a diagnosis of systemic leukemia and patients typically have other systemic symptoms.

### Clinical and mycological benefits of topical application of honey, olive oil and beeswax in diaper dermatitis [^111YhtBn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Twelve infants suffering from diaper dermatitis were treated four times daily for 7 days with a mixture containing honey, olive oil and beeswax. The severity of erythema was evaluated on a five-point scale. Three infants had severe erythema and ulceration, four had moderate erythema, and five had moderate erythema with maceration. The initial mean lesion score of 2.91 ± 0.79 declined significantly (p < 0.05) to 2.0 ± 0.98 (day 3), 1.25 ± 0.96 (day 5) and 0.66 ± 0.98 (day 7). Candida albicans was isolated initially from four patients, but from only two patients after treatment. This topical treatment was safe and well-tolerated, and demonstrated clinical and mycological benefits in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.

### Invasive fungal dermatitis in a 770 Gram neonate [^111aKQiA]. Pediatric Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

A 770 g birthweight, 25-weeks gestation infant girl was born from a bigeminal pregnancy. Six days later she developed erythematous "diaper dermatitis" and maceration of the flexural areas. Despite topical antifungal therapy, erythematous plaques appeared 2 days later on the back. Within less than 24 hours, skin erosions with crusting appeared and spread over the whole body. Candida albicans was found in cutaneous scales, and blood, umbilical catheter, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. In spite of intravenous fluconazole therapy, her general condition deteriorated and she died 2 days later. This premature neonate had a typical case of invasive fungal dermatitis, which is characterized by diffuse erosive and crusting cutaneous lesions appearing several days after birth and a high rate of systemic fungal infection (mainly but not exclusively) due to Candida sp. Mortality is high and prompt diagnosis and initiation of antifungal therapy appears to be the most important factor for survival.

### Mometasone furoate (Elocon) [^113WtMBs]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from
equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS — Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued and
appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids
is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a
clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing
corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate
diagnostic patch testing.

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate
antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does
not occur promptly, use of ELOCON Cream 0.1% should be discontinued until the
infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for Patients

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the
following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for
external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for
which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped
so as to be occlusive, unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse
reactions.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use ELOCON Cream 0.1%
in the treatment of diaper dermatitis. ELOCON Cream 0.1% should not be applied
in the diaper area as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing
(see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION).
This medication should not be used on the face, underarms, or groin areas
unless directed by the physician.
As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control
is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the
physician.
Other corticosteroid-containing products should not be used with ELOCON
Cream 0.1% without first consulting with the physician.

### Incontinence-associated dermatitis: not just babies [^1155ZybN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Irritant diaper dermatitis (IDD) is frequently observed in young children but can affect individuals throughout their lifespan. The broader term incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is used to describe inflammatory skin reactions from prolonged exposure to urine and/or feces. This review compares IAD and IDD in pediatric and geriatric populations, focusing on their pathogenesis, clinical considerations, and management. Both conditions involve prolonged bodily fluid exposure disrupting the skin barrier, making infants and older adults particularly susceptible due to their age-related skin characteristics. Factors such as fecal enzyme activity and diet in infants, and medications and comorbidities in older adults, also influence presentation. Particularly for IAD in the geriatric population, accurate diagnosis and differentiation from other conditions like pressure injuries and intertriginous dermatitis is crucial. Management prioritizes prevention, which includes frequent absorbent product changes and barrier creams. If the condition develops, treatment varies with severity, from barrier applications for mild cases to topical steroids for severe cases. Antifungals or antibiotics may be required for cases with superimposed infections. Future initiatives should concentrate on overcoming the difficulties related to IAD and IDD, such as alleviating physical discomfort, mitigating economic impact, and developing standardized terminology and research specifically tailored to geriatric care.

### Intertrigo and common secondary skin infections [^111ARxYD]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Intertrigo is inflammation of skinfolds caused by skin-on-skin friction. It is a common skin condition affecting opposing cutaneous or mucocutaneous surfaces. Intertrigo may present as diaper rash in children. The condition appears in natural and obesity-created body folds. The friction in these folds can lead to a variety of complications such as secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The usual approach to managing intertrigo is to minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powders such as cornstarch or with barrier creams. Patients should wear light, nonconstricting, and absorbent clothing and avoid wool and synthetic fibers. Physicians should educate patients about precautions with regard to heat, humidity, and outside activities. Physical exercise usually is desirable, but patients should shower afterward and dry intertriginous areas thoroughly. Wearing open-toed shoes can be beneficial for toe web intertrigo. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections should be treated with antiseptics, antibiotics, or antifungals, depending on the pathogens.

### Diaper dermatitis prevalence and severity: global perspective on the impact of caregiver behavior [^111rw9Nt]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrated that the RH under the diaper was significantly lower for infants from China and the United States (perianal) compared with Germany. Higher RH in the diapered area may increase the risk of skin overhydration and could also impact microbiome diversity. This is consistent with previous research showing that diapers that maintain a lower humidity environment were associated with lower Candida albicans infection, a common contributor to DD. 24

While other factors may explain differences in DD prevalence and severity across regions, caregiver behaviors are likely a contributor. The rank order of DD severity across geographies was associated with less time spent in the same diaper overnight, greater prophylactic topical product use, and a robust cleaning routine after a stooling event. While not measured here, it is noteworthy that Chinese caregivers commonly leave the infant undiapered for periods of time, which may prevent skin overhydration. Chinese infants may also have greater individualized care, due to the common practice of numerous family members providing care for a single child. This could explain why Chinese caregivers changed the diaper more frequently during the night, and coupled with higher prophylactic topical product use, would reduce skin exposure to fecal irritants. Reported bathing frequency did not follow the rash rank order, with more frequent bathing reported in the United States and least in China. However, it should be noted that a common practice in China involves robust cleaning after stooling events in a water basin or sink. This practice would account for 2 "baths" per day based on stooling patterns.

### Clinical evaluation of a diaper containing a shea butter-based emollient and impact on diapered skin erythema [^115pWJtT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Administration of an emollient from a diaper (vs. applied by hand) offers several potential advantages. First, the task is simple and effortless for the caregiver. Further, the emollient transfer results demonstrate the approach applies consistent application of microgram amounts versus mg/cm 2 or g/cm 2 amounts when applied by hand. These higher levels may create a prolonged occlusive environment and dysbiosis (e.g. candidal infection), resulting in increased skin hydration and pH. No candidal infections were noted in the present study. Ideally the amount of emollient applied would be effective without interfering with the diapers absorptive function which is required to remove irritants from urine and stool, prevent urine/stool leakage and prevention of fecal contamination of the baby surroundings.

Petrolatum is widely used and has a longer history of use versus shea butter, but both are well tolerated and contact allergies with petrolatum or shea butter are rare. The development of both the PBE and SBE formulations (± diaper) was evaluated in an exposure‐based safety assessment and examined for skin sensitization (Human Repeat Insult Patch Test, HRIPT) and skin irritation (Cumulative Irritation Test, CIT) before releasing to market. In‐market surveillance data is continuously evaluated on the PBE diaper (marketed since the late 1990's and reflecting hundreds of millions of uses globally) and the SBE diaper (since 2019), collectively supporting the skin compatibility of each. Although shea butter may have anti‐inflammatory or moisturization properties, these were not measured in the current studies. Individuals with sensitivities should be attentive to ingredient labels and choose a product according to their tolerance and preference.

### Diaper dermatitis: clinical characteristics and differential diagnosis [^117Jx1mf]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

A diverse group of diseases can cause skin conditions in the diaper area including those which are directly caused by diapers or the diaper environment, some which are not directly due to, but are worsened by, the wearing of diapers, and those which are independent of the presence of the diaper or its resulting environment. Many of these conditions are limited to this area of the skin, but others extend to skin outside this area, and some are signs of systemic disease. We review many of the important causes of eruptions in the diaper area and emphasize key points in the differential diagnosis.

### Optimal management of incontinence-associated dermatitis in the elderly [^113x1Sae]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD), sometimes referred to as perineal dermatitis, is an inflammation of the skin associated with exposure to urine or stool. Elderly adults, and especially those in long-term care facilities, are at risk for urinary or fecal incontinence and IAD. Traditionally, IAD has received little attention as a distinct disorder, and it is sometimes confused with stage I or II pressure ulcers. However, a modest but growing body of research is beginning to provide insights into the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of IAD. In addition, recent changes in reimbursement policies from the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding pressure ulcer prevention has focused attention on the differential diagnosis of IAD versus pressure ulcer, and its influence on pressure ulcer risk. Color, location, depth, and the presence or absence of necrotic tissue are visual indicators used to differentiate IAD from pressure-related skin damage. Prevention is based on avoiding or minimizing exposure to stool or urine combined with a structured skin-care program based on principles of gentle cleansing, moisturization, preferably with an emollient, and application of a skin protectant. Treatment of IAD focuses on three main goals: (i) removal of irritants from the affected skin; (ii) eradication of cutaneous infections such as candidiasis; and (iii) containment or diversion of incontinent urine or stool.

### Effect on skin hydration of using baby wipes to clean the napkin area of newborn babies: assessor-blinded randomised controlled equivalence trial [^114LMSh7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Assessment of trial outcomes

All initial measurements were taken in the hospital and follow up measurements were taken in the home. Our primary outcome measure was change in stratum corneum hydration scores on the buttocks from first assessment (within 48 hours of birth) to 4 weeks post birth, using a Corneometer.

Secondary outcomes comprised change in erythema measurements using a Mexameter (® MX 18); change in Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) using an Aquaflux (AF200), and change in skin surface pH (using a pH meter). Measurements were taken on the babies' buttocks at first assessment (within 48 hours of birth) and 4 weeks post-birth. Anatomical markers were used to ensure assessments were consistent. Two measurements were taken at each site; mean scores were used in analysis. Women were encouraged to cleanse the babies' buttocks and replace the napkin 30 minutes before the assessments were conducted. If the baby soiled the napkin within the 30 minutes prior to proposed assessment, the assessment was delayed for a further 30 minutes. Swabs of the peri-anal area were also obtained at 4 weeks to observe for between-group differences in the presence of microbial skin contaminants and irritants (Coliform bacteria and Candida species). Skin measurement instruments were calibrated prior to recruitment, during the recruitment period and following the last follow-up assessment to prevent measurement error.

Clinical measures included napkin dermatitis observed at first assessment and 4 weeks post-birth by the research midwife, and napkin dermatitis observed by the mother daily from first assessment to 4 weeks post-birth. A semi-structured diary was provided to all mothers; this included a Diaper Area Rash grading scale to aid the process. A set of reference photographs depicting the various levels of diaper rash were used alongside the scale to ensure consistency in clinical observations. Nappy cream usage was also recorded and a rescue treatment was pre-specified (Natusan Nappy Cream). Creams were weighed at the outset of the study and following the last assessment as an accurate measure of usage.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Mometasone furoate [^111Wdqde]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Mometasone furoate lotion should not be used to treat diaper rash or redness. Avoid using mometasone furoate lotion in the diaper area if wearing diapers or plastic pants.

- Avoid using mometasone furoate lotion the face, groin, or underarms (armpits).

- Wash your hands after applying mometasone furoate lotion.

What are the possible side effects of mometasone furoate lotion?

Mometasone furoate lotion may cause serious side effects, including:

- Mometasone furoate lotion can pass through your skin. Too much mometasone furoate lotion passing through your skin can cause your adrenal glands to stop working properly. Your healthcare provider may do blood tests to check for adrenal gland problems.

- Vision problems. Topical corticosteroids may increase your chance of developing vision problems such as cataract and glaucoma. Tell your healthcare provider if you develop blurred vision or other vision problems during treatment with mometasone furoate lotion.

- Skin problems. Skin problems may happen during treatment with mometasone furoate lotion, including allergic reactions (contact dermatitis) and skin infections at the treatment site. Stop using mometasone furoate lotion and tell your healthcare provider if you develop any skin reactions such as pain, tenderness, swelling, or problems healing during treatment with mometasone furoate lotion.

### Prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis [^114nXbzT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis (DD) is one of the most common skin conditions that infants suffer from and their caregivers manage in the first months post-birth. As such, questions of effective prevention and treatment of the condition often arise. Nonmedical skincare practices that support healthy skin barrier function can prevent DD manifestation or alleviate the condition in many cases. The usage of barrier emollients and improved diaper technology contributes to keeping moisture and irritants away from an infant's delicate skin. This paper addresses facts behind commonly asked questions from caregivers regarding DD and discusses effective measures to prevent and treat the condition.

### Miconazole nitrate [^117TJiWv]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back.

Some other helpful tips:

For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly.
Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm. Therefore, use of the diaphragm during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician.
If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection.
You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external sanitary pads or napkins until you have finished your medication or if the vaginal medication leaks.
Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast.
Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement.
Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance.
Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection.
Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection.
Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health.

3 RESULTS

By study design, there were differences in age, weight, race, ethnicity, and Fitzpatrick skin type between countries, but babies were otherwise similar in regard to sex, birthweight, and gestational age at birth. DD scoring across all study participants revealed the perianal region had the highest DD frequency and severity, followed by the intertriginous, genital, and buttock regions.

Comparisons across geographies were also conducted on a subgroup of baby age 2‐8 months (Figure 2; Table 1) (China: n = 591; Germany: n = 316; USA: n = 276). Geographical differences in DD prevalence and severity observed in the overall population were mirrored in the 2‐8 months of subgroup. All subsequent comparisons were restricted to babies 2‐8 months to eliminate the confounding factor of age. In babies 2‐8 months of age, DD scored as moderate or greater severity (eg, a score of ≥ 2.0) was relatively infrequent, occurring in just 1.3% of babies in China, 8.7% in the United States, and 14.9% in Germany. One instance of Candida was noted in a baby from Germany in the setting of mild DD. All babies age 2‐8 months old in China were on an exclusive milk diet compared to 29.5% in the United States and 26.3% in Germany. The predominant source of milk was of human origin (China: 75.7%; USA: 50.6%; Germany: 65.1%). An analysis of diaper rash by race and Fitzpatrick skin type indicated higher levels of rash in lighter skin individuals or Caucasians compared to darker skin babies or Blacks. When considering only Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV, the geographical differences in DD prevalence and severity noted in the overall population remained (data not shown).

### Flurandrenolide (Cordran) [^111iCh1e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Conditions that augment systemic absorption include application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression using urinary-free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, so that supplemental systemic corticosteroids are required.

Pediatric patients may absorb proportionately larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS).

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatologic infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, Flurandrenolide cream should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Information for the Patient

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped in order to be occlusive unless the patient is directed to do so by the physician.
Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions, especially under occlusive dressing.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a patient being treated in the diaper area, because these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.
Do not use Flurandrenolide cream on the face, underarms, or groin areas unless directed by your physician.
If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact your physician.
Do not use other corticosteroid-containing products while using Cordran without first consulting your physician.

Laboratory Tests

The following tests may be helpful in evaluating the HPA axis suppression:

Urinary-free cortisol test

ACTH stimulation test

Isolation and identification of Candida from vaginal swabs

The detection and identification of Candida from vaginal swabs is readily achieved. The swab will be inoculated onto full-plates of chromogenic agar (CHROMagar™Candida, CHROMagar, Paris, France) to isolate, provisionally speciate and semi-quantitatively enumerate (scant, moderate, or heavy) Candida species and to obtain colonies for further work such as susceptibility testing by broth microdilution methods. This medium is chosen to ensure detection of mixed infections. Cultures will be incubated for 72 hours at 35°C in 5% CO 2. Identification to species level will be based on colony morphology, and colour.

Intervention

The treatment group will receive a 6-day course of commercially available vaginal clotrimazole pessaries (Canestan ®). Women will be advised to insert one pessary as gently and deeply as possible into the vagina while lying on her back, preferably at night, for 6 nights. We have chosen 6 days of treatment because this is: supported by the Cochrane Systematic Review of treatment for Candida eradication in pregnancy, this is how commercially available vaginal clotrimazole is marketed and this was the regimen used in the Kiss trial. Women who miss one or more daily doses will be advised to insert a single pessary as soon as they remember or the next evening, and continue using the pessaries until the course of treatment is finished.

Follow-up

A brief (< 5 minutes) follow-up questionnaire will collect information about symptoms of candidiasis, use of antibiotics and/or corticosteroids (risk factors for symptomatic candidiasis), treatment of candidiasis (including study medication, doctor prescribed and over-the-counter medications), treatment side-effects and compliance with the treatment regimen. The questionnaire will be web-based with email notification or mailed with a reply-paid envelope according to the participants stated preference at trial entry. These secondary outcomes will be collected at 28–32 weeks, a gestation when the potential for unmasking the 'no treatment' arm will be irrelevant.

Care of all women and their babies will be otherwise managed according to the standard practices of the model of maternity care she has chosen. Women who develop symptoms of Candida infection will be offered appropriate treatment. The results of the vaginal swab culture taken at the time of trial entry will not be disclosed nor be available in the pregnancy record.

Optimal Use of TCIs

Most treatment algorithms recommend regular use of emollients for control of dry skin with short-term TCS for treatment of AD flares. Under certain circumstances, TCIs are a more appropriate first-line choice and/or useful adjunct to TCS.
As a corticosteroid-sparing agent: Reducing the risks of chronic TCS exposure is important, especially in children treated with intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroids for other atopic diseases such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. The corticosteroid-sparing effect of pimecrolimus cream has been demonstrated in clinical trials. A reduced number of flares and prolonged time-to-flare quantified in tacrolimus ointment clinical trials also supports a corticosteroid-sparing effect.
To treat face and skin fold disease: Skin atrophy, perioral dermatitis, and increased percutaneous absorption are TCS risks prompting greatest concern in patients with inflammatory skin disease involving sensitive skin areas on the face, eyelids, and diaper area. TCIs are well suited for use in these areas due to low acnegenic and atrophogenic potential.
To simplify treatment regimens: Risks associated with TCS use are highest with more potent products, especially when applied to sensitive skin areas. To minimize these risks, a popular approach is to recommend a two-drug treatment regimen using a lower potency TCS on the face and a higher potency product on the body. Patients are often confused about the appropriate drug to use on the affected sites, and monitoring the optimal quantity used can also be complicated. Maintenance treatment with a TCI requires use of only one product on all affected sites. This not only simplifies treatment for the patient, but also allows easier monitoring of drug quantity used over time.
For children who require daily treatment: Safety of TCS has been studied for durations of no longer than 4 weeks for a limited number of products. In contrast, safety of TCIs for durations of up to 1 year has been documented in several prospective trials and registries.
In patients who are TCS intolerant or dependent: Well-described but under-recognized complications of long-term use of TCS include delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, and rebound erythroderma. Neither pimecrolimus cream nor tacrolimus ointment carry these risks.
In patients with confirmed or suspected skin infection: 'In cognito' TCS-associated skin infections are another complication that has been well-described but underappreciated. The proposed mechanism of action is via dendritic cells and antigen presentation. In contrast, TCIs do not affect the differentiation, maturation, or function of dendritic cells. Clinical trials have not identified an increased incidence of skin infection for either TCI.

### Triamcinolone acetonide [^115ogvH4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General:

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of thermal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, substitute a less potent steroid, or use a sequential approach when utilizing the occlusive technique.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Occasionally, a patient may develop a sensitivity reaction to a particular occlusive dressing material or adhesive and a substitute material may be necessary.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

These preparations are not for ophthalmic use.

Information for the Patient:

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Qp4CV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

### Recommendations from a European roundtable meeting on best practice healthy infant skin care [^117G83X7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Diaper Care

Diaper dermatitis is common, affecting most infants at least once 31. The occlusive diaper environment plays host to a complex interplay of potentially damaging factors. Alkaline urine disrupts the pH balance of the epidermis, which encourages microbial overgrowth and activation of fecal lipases, endogenous and exogenous proteases and bile salts, all of which can lead to further injury 32, 33. New recommendations were developed to provide guidance on routine care of the diaper area (Table 7).

Table 7
New Recommendations on Diaper Care

To reduce the risk of diaper dermatitis and manage the condition should it occur, it was strongly recommended that the diaper area be kept clean and dry and that diapers should be changed as often as necessary. The need to keep the diaper area dry was highlighted, as prolonged and excessive humidity can increase friction, lead to skin maceration, increase permeability, and encourage microbial overgrowth 34. Because excessive scrubbing and rubbing of the diaper area may promote irritation and further damage the barrier properties of the skin surface 24, 35, 36, it was strongly recommended that drying should be achieved through air drying or gentle patting with a dry towel or dry cotton balls/squares.

### Interventions for prevention and treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in women with HIV infection [^116yT39J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### Triamcinolone acetonide ointment (trianex 0.05%) [^116Dh9oM]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of thermal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, substitute a less potent steroid, or use a sequential approach when utilizing the occlusive technique.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Occasionally, a patient may develop a sensitivity reaction to a particular occlusive dressing material or adhesive and a substitute material may be necessary.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

These preparations are not for ophthalmic use.

Information for the Patient

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.

Laboratory Tests

A urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating HPA axis suppression.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111bkVUf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Prevention recommendations — children with HIV: Candida organisms are common commensals on mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals; no measures are available to reduce exposure to these fungi except by reducing exposure to unneeded antibiotics that may predispose a patient to Candida colonization. Routine primary prophylaxis of candidiasis in infants and children with HIV infection is not indicated for multiple reasons, including that in the era of ART the prevalence of serious Candida infections is low, a lack of randomized controlled trials of routine primary prophylaxis, concern for potentiating resistant Candida strains, and the potential for drug-drug interactions between antifungal and antiretroviral (ARV) agents.

Asymptomatic candiduria — management emphasizes risk stratification and periprocedural prophylaxis: Elimination of predisposing factors, such as indwelling bladder catheters, is recommended whenever feasible (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Treatment with antifungal agents is NOT recommended unless the patient belongs to a group at high risk for dissemination; high-risk patients include neutropenic patients, very low-birth-weight infants (< 1500 g), and patients who will undergo urologic manipulation (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Neutropenic patients and very low–birth-weight infants should be treated as recommended for candidemia (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Patients undergoing urologic procedures should be treated with oral fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for several days before and after the procedure (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Miconazole nitrate (Monistat-derm) [^114j2aUY]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Dosage and Administration:

Sufficient MONISTAT-DERM Cream should be applied to cover affected areas twice daily (morning and evening) in patients with tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and cutaneous candidiasis, and once daily in patients with tinea versicolor. If MONISTAT-DERM Cream is used in intertriginous areas, it should be applied sparingly and smoothed in well to avoid maceration effects.

Early relief of symptoms (2 to 3 days) is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, Candida infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks and tinea pedis for one month in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after a month of treatment, the diagnosis should be redetermined. Patients with tinea versicolor usually exhibit clinical and mycological clearing after two weeks of treatment.

### Improving diaper design to address incontinence associated dermatitis [^113Hr8r1]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Many factors contribute to the barrier function of skin. For the outermost part of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, the "brick and mortar" model was proposed by Elias which describes the roles of complex extracellular lipid structures (mortar) and protein-rich corneocytes (bricks). Both components are essential for the formation of a robust epidermal barrier. The epidermal barrier is a dynamic structure which is continuously renewed from below and dissolved on the outermost surface through controlled desquamation. The proliferation rate of basal cells, suprabasal keratinization processes, compaction of the corneocytes and stabilization of the intercellular adhesion structures through transglutaminases are taking place in epidermal parts below the epidermal barrier while proteolytic activity in the outermost parts of the stratum corneum regulates the desquamation process (reviewed in). All these events are tightly controlled and the epidermal barrier function is critically dependent on the balance of all processes involved.

With age, the epidermal barrier becomes more susceptible to external stress. The stratum corneum is less acidic causing a reduced epidermal lipid synthesis as well as a delay in lipid-derived lamellar membrane maturation. Moreover, enzymatic systems with specific functions in different parts of the stratum corneum are perturbed weakening the epidermal barrier from a functional aspect. As a result external stress leads to defects in the epidermal barrier and due to a reduced repair capacity in aged skin, inflammation is initiated. Skin contact with faeces, alkaline urine after decomposition on the skin or in urinary tract infections with urease producing bacteria and the liberal use of skin cleansing products provide a plethora of strong, harmful stimuli stressing the epidermal barrier and giving rise to IAD in extreme situations.

Intensive skin care and hygiene, several times per day including cleansing, washing and drying are mandatory to care for these patients. Several skin care regimens have been compared and may help to reduce the prevalence of IAD. The variables to consider are clinical effectiveness but treatment-cost-per-day should not be underestimated as the latter has a large influence on the affordability and availability for patients. In terms of clinical effectiveness, a recent study of four different skin care regimens showed that the rate of IAD was lowered in all of the four skin care protocols. Another important variable to prevent IAD are absorbent incontinence products in the appropriate size and conforming shapes. This topic is poorly reported in the literature as most of the attention has been focused on technical aspects such as the absorptive capacity of the different incontinence briefs for adults.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Effect of diaper cream and wet wipes on skin barrier properties in infants: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^114Bxram]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of different diaper care procedures on skin barrier function in infants has been minimally investigated and may be assessed using objective methods. In a single-center, prospective trial, 89 healthy 9-month-old infants (± 8 wks) were randomly assigned to three diaper care regimens: group I used water-moistened washcloths at diaper changes (n = 30), group II additionally applied diaper cream twice daily (n = 28), and group III used wet wipes and diaper cream twice daily (n = 31). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SCH), skin pH, interleukin 1α (IL-1α) levels, and microbiologic colonization were measured in diapered skin (upper outer quadrant of the buttocks), nondiapered skin (upper leg), and if diaper dermatitis (DD) occurred, using the most affected skin area at day 1 and weeks 4 and 8. Skin condition was assessed utilizing a neonatal skin condition score and diaper rash grade. On diapered skin, SCH decreased in groups II and III, whereas TEWL values were reduced in group II only. Skin pH increased in groups II and III. In general, SCH, skin pH, and IL-1α levels were higher in healthy diapered skin than in nondiapered skin. The incidence and course of DD was comparable in all groups. Areas with DD had greater TEWL and skin pH than unaffected skin areas. Infants who received diaper cream had lower SCH and TEWL and higher pH levels in the diapered area than on nondiapered skin. No correlation with the occurrence of DD was found.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116XK253]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Recommendations for Treating Candidiasis in Patients with Psoriasis

Candida infections in patients with psoriasis often develop in areas that are not readily visible and are often asymptomatic. Dermatologists should be attentive to the presence of mucocutaneous Candida infections when examining a patient with psoriasis. As outlined in Table 3, dermatologists should inquire about oral or genital discomfort to identify potential oropharyngeal or genitourinary candidiasis, especially if a full-body examination is not conducted during the patient visit.

Table 3
Questions to aid in the diagnosis of candidiasis

Based on our clinical experience, candidiasis in patients with psoriasis, who do not have other underlying immunocompromising conditions, is usually superficial and localized. Additionally, Candida infections do not typically exacerbate psoriasis. Treatment is almost always definitive, and it is uncommon for systemic dissemination to occur. Standard antifungal treatment regimens are generally safe and well tolerated in patients with psoriasis, and treatment-related complications are rare. We agree with current guidelines for the treatment of Candida infections, and Tables 1 and 2 can be used to help guide therapy decisions. Physicians should refer to their local or regional guidelines because there may be variations on available treatment options. In our experience, patients with psoriasis are generally more prone to Candida colonization and infections than patients with other chronic dermatoses. Furthermore, the treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis should take into consideration that many individuals with psoriasis are receiving immunosuppressive regimens.

### Triamcinolone acetonide ointment usp, 0.05% (triamcinolone acetonide) [^111QWqKw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-­adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of thermal homeostasis. If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, substitute a less potent steroid, or use a sequential approach when utilizing the occlusive technique.

Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Occasionally, a patient may develop a sensitivity reaction to a particular occlusive dressing material or adhesive and a substitute material may be necessary.

Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS-Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

These preparations are not for ophthalmic use.

Information for the Patient

Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions:

This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes.
Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed.
The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing.
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings.

Laboratory Tests

A urinary free cortisol test and ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating HPA axis suppression.

### Skin care of the diaper area [^116xZ4Ee]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The skin of the diaper area has special needs for protection from the irritating effects of urine and feces and prevention of diaper dermatitis. These needs include products such as diapers that absorb the excreta, as well as products for cleansing and conditioning the skin. A number of factors play a role in development of diaper dermatitis, including prolonged exposure to excreta, alterations in skin pH or increased hydration, and changes in skin microbial flora. Recent decades have seen great improvements in our understanding of these factors and our ability to develop new and better products to protect baby skin. Better diaper designs and the development of pH-buffered baby wipes have improved the care of skin in the diaper area. Continuing research offers the promise of new products with additional benefits for caregivers and infants.

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

### Diaper dermatitis that does not quit [^117F8u9C]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants. The humid, moist environment under the diaper makes the skin more susceptible to injury from exposure to irritants particularly related to urine and feces. A gentle cleansing routine, frequent diaper changes, and a thick barrier cream help control this condition. Irritant diaper dermatitis should be distinguished from other skin conditions that may develop in this sensitive area.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.
