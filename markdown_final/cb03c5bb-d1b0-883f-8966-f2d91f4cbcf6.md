## Question

What is the optimal dosage and duration of fluoxetine therapy in acute stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal dosage and duration of fluoxetine therapy in acute stroke, specifically whether there is a regimen that improves functional outcomes and how to weigh benefits versus risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the goal is functional recovery, depression prevention, or both. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on dose and duration from large randomized trials. Next, I will review guideline positions and meta-analyses to confirm consistency. After that, I need to appraise safety signals, especially fractures and hyponatremia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note any exceptions where fluoxetine might still be reasonable for depression treatment rather than recovery enhancement.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. In acute stroke, fluoxetine has been studied for two distinct purposes: enhancing functional recovery via neuroplasticity and preventing or treating post-stroke depression. These are separate questions with different outcome measures and risk–benefit profiles, so I need to keep them distinct as I evaluate the evidence and recommendations [^4403ebba] [^d40c5b1a].

> Next, I should review the pivotal trials to anchor dose and duration. The largest, methodologically rigorous trials — FOCUS, EFFECTS, and AFFINITY — all used fluoxetine 20 mg orally once daily for 6 months, initiated 2–15 days after stroke onset, and found no improvement in functional outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months, despite good adherence and large sample sizes, which strongly argues against a functional benefit at this dose and duration [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6].

> Wait, let me verify whether shorter courses or different timing changed outcomes. The FLAME trial, which started fluoxetine 20 mg daily at 5–10 days and continued for 3 months, showed improved motor scores on the Fugl-Meyer scale at 90 days, but it was a small, single-center study and did not demonstrate a durable functional benefit on independence or mRS, so its positive motor signal has not translated into consistent functional gains in larger, multicenter trials or meta-analyses [^bc0118e7] [^e15e241a].

> I will now examine guideline syntheses to ensure consistency. Contemporary guidelines from the AHA/ASA and VA/DoD conclude that evidence is insufficient to recommend fluoxetine to enhance motor recovery or functional outcomes after stroke, reflecting the neutral results of the large pragmatic trials and the balance of harms, so routine use for recovery enhancement is not supported [^bf271f8e] [^a30d0dba] [^fe8afb55].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check adverse effects that could offset any modest benefits. Across FOCUS, EFFECTS, and AFFINITY, fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months increased bone fractures by roughly 1–2% absolute risk, with pooled analyses showing approximately a doubling of fracture risk, and also increased hyponatremia and seizures in some trials, which materially worsens the risk–benefit calculus for routine post-stroke use [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6] [^0b0c72b0].

> Let me consider the depression question separately, because the signal differs. Fluoxetine reduced new depression by about 3–4% absolute risk at 6 months in FOCUS and EFFECTS, but this benefit did not translate into improved functional independence, and the fracture risk remains, so using fluoxetine solely to prevent depression is not routinely recommended; however, if depression is diagnosed, SSRIs remain appropriate therapy with monitoring, and guidelines support treating post-stroke depression when present [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^d40c5b1a] [^e1c972f1].

> I should double-check whether any subgroup or alternative SSRI changes the calculus. Meta-analytic explorations suggest citalopram may show signals for motor or dependence outcomes in some analyses, but these are hypothesis-generating and not definitive; given the consistent neutral functional results with fluoxetine and the safety concerns, fluoxetine should not be chosen for recovery enhancement outside of a trial, and if an SSRI is indicated for depression, clinicians may consider agents with a more favorable risk profile in frail, fall-prone patients [^f2552e66] [^c6fc1e23].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. There is no evidence-supported "optimal" fluoxetine regimen for enhancing functional recovery after acute stroke; the tested and ineffective approach is 20 mg daily for 6 months started 2–15 days post-stroke, and shorter 3-month courses have not shown durable functional benefits in larger confirmatory trials, so routine use for recovery is not advised. If fluoxetine is used, it should be for diagnosed depression with informed consent about fracture and hyponatremia risks, and clinicians should monitor bone health, falls, and sodium, especially in older adults or those on anticoagulants [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6] [^d40c5b1a].

---

Fluoxetine is **not recommended** for routine use in acute stroke because large, high-quality RCTs (FOCUS, EFFECTS, AFFINITY) show no improvement in functional outcomes at 6–12 months and a **significant increase in fractures** [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6]. While fluoxetine reduces depression risk by about 3–4%, this modest benefit is offset by harm, including fractures, hyponatremia, and seizures [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6]. Current guidelines advise against using fluoxetine to enhance motor recovery or prevent depression in stroke patients without a psychiatric indication [^bf271f8e] [^f8c38062] [^296e21bc]. If used for diagnosed depression, a standard dose of 20 mg daily is reasonable, but the duration should be individualized and reassessed regularly.

---

## Dosage and duration studied in clinical trials

- **FOCUS trial**: 20 mg daily for 6 months; no functional benefit, increased fractures [^a61c7964].
- **EFFECTS trial**: 20 mg daily for 6 months; no functional benefit, increased fractures and hyponatremia [^b6b932c6].
- **AFFINITY trial**: 20 mg daily for 6 months; no functional benefit, increased falls, fractures, and seizures [^a98ac2f6].
- **FLAME trial**: 20 mg daily for 3 months; improved motor scores at 90 days, but small, single-center, and not replicated in larger trials [^bc0118e7].

---

## Clinical outcomes and efficacy

### Functional recovery

There is **no improvement** in functional outcomes with fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months in FOCUS, EFFECTS, or AFFINITY [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6]. FLAME showed improved motor scores at 90 days, but this did not translate into sustained functional gains and has not been confirmed in larger multicenter trials [^bc0118e7].

---

### Depression prevention

Fluoxetine reduces new depression by about 3–4% at 6 months, but this modest benefit is **outweighed by increased fracture risk** and other adverse effects [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Bone fractures**: Significantly increased in FOCUS, EFFECTS, and AFFINITY; meta-analysis shows a 2.36-fold higher risk with SSRIs in stroke patients [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6] [^0b0c72b0].
- **Hyponatremia**: More frequent with fluoxetine, especially in older adults [^b6b932c6].
- **Seizures**: Increased risk observed in AFFINITY and other studies [^a98ac2f6] [^2eef65fc].
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia are common but generally mild [^3931f779].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding fluoxetine** |
|-|-|
| American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) | - Insufficient evidence to support fluoxetine for motor recovery [^bf271f8e] [^a30d0dba] <br/> - Do not use fluoxetine to enhance functional status after ICH [^f8c38062] |
| VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline | - Insufficient evidence to recommend fluoxetine for motor recovery [^fe8afb55] <br/> - Suggest against routine antidepressants to prevent post-stroke depression [^296e21bc] |
| European Academy of Neurology (EAN) | - Citalopram may be considered for early motor recovery, but fluoxetine is not recommended [^f2552e66] |

---

## Clinical considerations and patient selection

- **Depression**: If fluoxetine is used, it should be for diagnosed depression, not for prevention or motor recovery enhancement [^d40c5b1a] [^e1c972f1].
- **Dose and duration**: 20 mg daily is standard; duration should be individualized based on response and tolerability, with regular reassessment.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for fractures, hyponatremia, seizures, and GI effects, especially in older adults or those on interacting medications [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months** |
|-|-|
| Functional recovery | No benefit (FOCUS, EFFECTS, AFFINITY) [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6] |
| Depression prevention | Modest reduction (~3–4%) [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] |
| Bone fractures | Significantly increased [^a61c7964] [^b6b932c6] [^a98ac2f6] |
| Hyponatremia | Increased risk [^b6b932c6] |
| Seizures | Increased risk [^a98ac2f6] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Fluoxetine is **not recommended** for routine use in acute stroke because it does not improve functional outcomes and increases fracture risk. If used for diagnosed depression, 20 mg daily is standard, but duration should be individualized with ongoing monitoring for adverse effects.

In summary, the results of the FOCUS trial show that fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after an acute stroke did not influence patients' functional outcomes but did decrease the occurrence of depression and increase the occurrence of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function. Ongoing trials and a planned individual patient data meta-analysis are needed to confirm or refute a more modest benefit, either overall or in particular subgroups, and to provide more precise estimates of any harms.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might theoretically reduce post-stroke disability by direct effects on the brain. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2012 and last updated in 2019.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 7 January 2021), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 7 January 2021), MEDLINE (1946 to 7 January 2021), Embase (1974 to 7 January 2021), CINAHL (1982 to 7 January 2021), PsycINFO (1985 to 7 January 2021), and AMED (1985 to 7 January 2021). PsycBITE had previously been searched (16 July 2018). We searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting stroke survivors within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. The comparator was usual care or placebo. Studies reporting at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, cognition, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the study early) were included in the meta-analysis. The primary analysis included studies at low risk of bias.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, stroke type and, our pre-specified outcomes, and bias sources. Two review authors independently extracted data. We used mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed bias risks and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified 76 eligible studies (13,029 participants); 75 provided data at end of treatment, and of these two provided data at follow-up. Thirty-eight required participants to have depression to enter. The duration, drug, and dose varied. Six studies were at low risk of bias across all domains; all six studies did not need participants to have depression to enter, and all used fluoxetine. Of these six studies, there was little to no difference in disability between groups SMD -0.0; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.05; 5 studies, 5436 participants, high-quality evidence) or in independence (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 5 studies, 5926 participants; high-quality evidence) at the end of treatment. In the studies at low risk of bias across all domains, SSRIs slightly reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.14 lower, 95% CI 0.19 lower to 0.08 lower; 4 studies; 5356 participants, high-quality evidence) and there was a slight reduction in the proportion with depression (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86; 3 studies, 5907 participants, high-quality evidence). Cognition was slightly better in the control group (MD -1.22, 95% CI -2.37 to -0.07; 4 studies, 5373 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Only one study (n = 30) reported neurological deficit score (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -1.12 to 0.33; low-quality evidence). SSRIs resulted in little to no difference in motor deficit (SMD 0.03, -0.02 to 0.08; 6 studies, 5518 participants, moderate-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the proportion leaving the study early (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.40; 6 studies, 6090 participants, high-quality evidence). SSRIs slightly increased the outcome of a seizure (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.98; 6 studies, 6080 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and a bone fracture (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.41; 6 studies, 6080 participants, high-quality evidence). One study at low risk of bias across all domains reported gastrointestinal side effects (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.33, to 8.83; 1 study, 30 participants). There was no difference in the total number of deaths between SSRI and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.24; 6 studies, 6090 participants, moderate quality evidence). SSRIs probably result in little to no difference in fatigue (MD -0.06; 95% CI -1.24 to 1.11; 4 studies, 5524 participants, moderate-quality of evidence), nor in quality of life (MD 0.00; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02, 3 studies, 5482 participants, high-quality evidence). When all studies, irrespective of risk of bias, were included, SSRIs reduced disability scores but not the proportion independent. There was insufficient data to perform a meta-analysis of outcomes at end of follow-up. Several small ongoing studies are unlikely to alter conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that SSRIs do not make a difference to disability or independence after stroke compared to placebo or usual care, reduced the risk of future depression, increased bone fractures and probably increased seizure risk.

Added value of this study

The results of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under Supervision (FOCUS) trial suggest that fluoxetine 20 mg given orally daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment might lead to a reduction in the occurrence of depression, it also seems to increase the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

Implications of all the available evidence

Ongoing trials might be able to confirm the external generalisability of these findings to different populations, and a planned individual patient data meta-analysis could clarify whether any subgroups might benefit from fluoxetine and provide more precise estimates of any harms.

The primary aim of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under Supervision (FOCUS) trial was to ascertain whether patients with a clinical stroke diagnosis would have improved functional outcomes with a 6-month course of fluoxetine compared with placebo. Important secondary aims were to identify any other benefits or harms and to assess whether any benefits persisted from the end of the treatment period to 12 months after stroke.

The primary measure of adherence was the estimated duration of study medication (interval in days from first to last dose of study medication) based on all available data, including a capsule count, which was available in 398 (25%) of 1564 patients allocated fluoxetine, and 410 (26%) of 1563 allocated placebo. Patients returned a median of 32 capsules (IQR 10–135) in the fluoxetine group and 33 (11–139) in the placebo group. Our primary measure of adherence was available in 1417 (91%) patients in each group. The median duration of treatment was 185 days (IQR 149–186) in the fluoxetine group, and 183 days (136–186) in the placebo group. The median delay between randomisation and first dose was 0 days (IQR 0–1) in both treatment groups. 1519 (97%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 1494 (96%) in the placebo group received their first dose by day 2 after randomisation. The number and proportion of patients meeting our eligibility criteria and with different levels of adherence to the study medication are shown in the appendix. 143 (9%) patients in the fluoxetine group stopped the trial medication because of perceived adverse effects within the first 90 days compared with 122 (8%) in the placebo group. Around two-thirds of patients took the study medication for at least 150 days.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional recovery after acute stroke (EFFECTS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^b6b932c6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Studies have suggested that fluoxetine could improve neurological recovery after stroke. The Efficacy oF Fluoxetine-a randomisEd Controlled Trial in Stroke (EFFECTS) trial aimed to assess whether administration of oral fluoxetine for 6 months after acute stroke improves functional outcome.

Methods

EFFECTS was an investigator-led, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial that enrolled patients aged 18 years or older between 2 and 15 days after stroke onset in 35 stroke and rehabilitation centres in Sweden. Eligible patients had a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic or intracerebral haemorrhage, brain imaging that was consistent with intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke, and had at least one persisting focal neurological deficit. A web-based randomisation system that incorporated a minimisation algorithm was used to randomly assign (1:1) participants to receive oral fluoxetine 20 mg once daily or matching placebo capsules for 6 months. Patients, care providers, investigators, and outcomes assessors were masked to the allocation. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6 months, analysed in all patients with available mRS data at the 6-month follow-up; we did an ordinal analysis adjusted for the minimisation variables used in the randomisation. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2011-006130-16; ISRCTN, 13020412; and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02683213.

Findings

Between Oct 20, 2014, and June 28, 2019, 1500 patients were enrolled, of whom 750 were randomly assigned to fluoxetine and 750 were randomly assigned to placebo. At 6 months, mRS data were available for 737 (98%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 742 (99%) patients in the placebo group. There was no effect of fluoxetine on the primary outcome-distribution across mRS score categories-compared with placebo (adjusted common odds ratio 0·94 [95% CI 0·78 to 1·13]; p = 0·42). The proportion of patients with a new diagnosis of depression was lower with fluoxetine than with placebo (54 [7%] patients vs 81 [11%] patients; difference -3·60% [-6·49 to -0·71]; p = 0·015), but fluoxetine was associated with more bone fractures (28 [4%] vs 11 [2%]; difference 2·27% [0·66 to 3·87]; p = 0·0058) and hyponatraemia (11 [1%] vs one [< 1%]; difference 1·33% [0·43 to 2·23]; p = 0·0038) at 6 months.

Interpretation

Functional outcome after acute stroke did not improve with oral fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 6 months. Fluoxetine reduced the occurrence of depression but increased the risk of bone fractures and hyponatraemia. Our results do not support the use of fluoxetine after acute stroke.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^a61c7964]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Results of small trials indicate that fluoxetine might improve functional outcomes after stroke. The FOCUS trial aimed to provide a precise estimate of these effects.

Methods

FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 103 hospitals in the UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical stroke diagnosis, were enrolled and randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after onset, and had focal neurological deficits. Patients were randomly allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo orally once daily for 6 months via a web-based system by use of a minimisation algorithm. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), at 6 months. Patients, carers, health-care staff, and the trial team were masked to treatment allocation. Functional status was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.

Findings

Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3127 patients were recruited. 1564 patients were allocated fluoxetine and 1563 allocated placebo. mRS data at 6 months were available for 1553 (99·3%) patients in each treatment group. The distribution across mRS categories at 6 months was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (common odds ratio adjusted for minimisation variables 0·951 [95% CI 0·839–1·079]; p = 0·439). Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated placebo to develop new depression by 6 months (210 [13·43%] patients vs 269 [17·21%]; difference 3·78% [95% CI 1·26–6·30]; p = 0·0033), but they had more bone fractures (45 [2·88%] vs 23 [1·47%]; difference 1·41% [95% CI 0·38–2·43]; p = 0·0070). There were no significant differences in any other event at 6 or 12 months.

Interpretation

Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional recovery after acute stroke (EFFECTS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^d928ecee]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The study EFFECTS was published by EFFECTS Trial Collaboration. and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Intracerebral hemorrhage and Acute ischemic stroke. In the EFFECTS study, the trial question was: what is the role of fluoxetine in patients with acute stroke? In the EFFECTS study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EFFECTS study, the population was: 1500 patients (575 female, 925 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days. The key exclusion criteria were primary subarachnoid hemorrhage; epileptic seizures; unavailable for follow-up for next 12 months; previous drug overdose or attempted suicide; ongoing depression. In the EFFECTS study, the interventions were: n = 750 fluoxetine (an oral dose of 20 mg/day for 6 months) n = 750 placebo (matching placebo for 6 months). In the EFFECTS study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score (76.7 points vs. 77.4 points; AD -0.7 points, 95% CI -6.06 to 4.66). In the EFFECTS study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in memory as measured by the stroke impact scale score (89.3 points vs. 92.9 points; AD -3.6 points, 95% CI -6.19 to -1.01) Borderline significant increase in NIHSS (1 point vs. 1 point;). In the EFFECTS study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, new stroke, thrombotic events, bleeding events. significant differences in new depression (7% vs. 11%), bone fractures (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (1% vs. < 1%) at 6 months. In the EFFECTS study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic or intracerebral hemorrhage in the previous 2–15 days, fluoxetine was not superior to placebo with respect to physical function as measured by the stroke impact scale score.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional outcome after acute stroke (AFFINITY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^a98ac2f6]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Trials of fluoxetine for recovery after stroke report conflicting results. The Assessment oF FluoxetINe In sTroke recoverY (AFFINITY) trial aimed to show if daily oral fluoxetine for 6 months after stroke improves functional outcome in an ethnically diverse population.

Methods

AFFINITY was a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial done in 43 hospital stroke units in Australia (n = 29), New Zealand (four), and Vietnam (ten). Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke in the previous 2–15 days, brain imaging consistent with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and a persisting neurological deficit that produced a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or more. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 via a web-based system using a minimisation algorithm to once daily, oral fluoxetine 20 mg capsules or matching placebo for 6 months. Patients, carers, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was functional status, measured by the mRS, at 6 months. The primary analysis was an ordinal logistic regression of the mRS at 6 months, adjusted for minimisation variables. Primary and safety analyses were done according to the patient's treatment allocation. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12611000774921.

Findings

Between Jan 11, 2013, and June 30, 2019, 1280 patients were recruited in Australia (n = 532), New Zealand (n = 42), and Vietnam (n = 706), of whom 642 were randomly assigned to fluoxetine and 638 were randomly assigned to placebo. Mean duration of trial treatment was 167 days (SD 48·1). At 6 months, mRS data were available in 624 (97%) patients in the fluoxetine group and 632 (99%) in the placebo group. The distribution of mRS categories was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (adjusted common odds ratio 0·94, 95% CI 0·76–1·15; p = 0·53). Compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the fluoxetine group had more falls (20 [3%] vs seven [1%]; p = 0·018), bone fractures (19 [3%] vs six [1%]; p = 0·014), and epileptic seizures (ten [2%] vs two [< 1%]; p = 0·038) at 6 months.

Interpretation

Oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months after acute stroke did not improve functional outcome and increased the risk of falls, bone fractures, and epileptic seizures. These results do not support the use of fluoxetine to improve functional outcome after stroke.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^74e7811e]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Results of small trials indicate that fluoxetine might improve functional outcomes after stroke. The FOCUS trial aimed to provide a precise estimate of these effects.

Methods

FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 103 hospitals in the UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical stroke diagnosis, were enrolled and randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after onset, and had focal neurological deficits. Patients were randomly allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo orally once daily for 6 months via a web-based system by use of a minimisation algorithm. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), at 6 months. Patients, carers, health-care staff, and the trial team were masked to treatment allocation. Functional status was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Patients were analysed according to their treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.

Findings

Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3127 patients were recruited. 1564 patients were allocated fluoxetine and 1563 allocated placebo. mRS data at 6 months were available for 1553 (99·3%) patients in each treatment group. The distribution across mRS categories at 6 months was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (common odds ratio adjusted for minimisation variables 0·951 [95% CI 0·839–1·079]; p = 0·439). Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated placebo to develop new depression by 6 months (210 [13·43%] patients vs 269 [17·21%]; difference 3·78% [95% CI 1·26–6·30]; p = 0·0033), but they had more bone fractures (45 [2·88%] vs 23 [1·47%]; difference 1·41% [95% CI 0·38–2·43]; p = 0·0070). There were no significant differences in any other event at 6 or 12 months.

Interpretation

Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to improve functional outcomes. Although the treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote recovery of function.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for stroke recovery [^ce678866]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) associated with better recovery after stroke?

Bottom Line

SSRIs may be associated with improved recovery after stroke, even in persons without depression. However, much of the evidence is of poor quality. Large, high-quality trials are needed to evaluate the validity of the current evidence and improve precision of estimates of any treatment benefits.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^8e9dd053]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We aimed to recruit at least 3000 patients. We estimated that this sample size would allow us to identify a treatment effect size of fluoxetine in the FOCUS trial that we thought would be important to patients and health and social care services. This effect size would also justify a 6-month course of treatment. FOCUS had 90% power to identify an increase in the proportion of patients with good outcomes (ie, mRS of 0–2) from 39·6% to 44·7% (ie, an absolute difference of 5·1 percentage points), based on an ordinal analysis expressed as a common odds ratio (OR) of 1·23.

The unmasked trial statistician (C Graham) prepared analyses of the accumulating data, which the data monitoring committee reviewed in strict confidence at least once a year. No other members of the trial team, trial steering committee, or patients had access to these analyses. Before recruitment was completed, and without input from the unmasked trial statistician or reference to the unblinded data, the trial steering committee prepared a detailed statistical analysis plan that was then published. For all primary analyses, including our primary analyses of adverse events and safety outcomes, we retained patients in the treatment group to which they were randomly allocated irrespective of the treatment they had actually received. We did a secondary safety analysis according to the treatment patients actually received rather than what they were randomly allocated (comparing those who received some fluoxetine in the first 6 months and those who received no fluoxetine).

### Effects of fluoxetine on outcomes at 12 months after acute stroke: results from EFFECTS, a randomized controlled trial [^edd7a80f]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The EFFECTS (Efficacy of Fluoxetine — a Randomised Controlled Trial in Stroke) recently reported that 20 mg fluoxetine once daily for 6 months after acute stroke did not improve functional outcome but reduced depression and increased fractures and hyponatremia at 6 months. The purpose of this predefined secondary analysis was to identify if any effects of fluoxetine were maintained or delayed over 12 months.

Methods

EFFECTS was an investigator-led, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial in Sweden that enrolled adult patients with stroke. Patients were randomized to 20 mg oral fluoxetine or matching placebo for 6 months and followed for another 6 months. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), at 6 months. Predefined secondary outcomes for these analyses included the modified Rankin Scale, health status, quality of life, fatigue, mood, and depression at 12 months.

Results

One thousand five hundred patients were recruited from 35 centers in Sweden between 2014 and 2019; 750 were allocated fluoxetine and 750 placebo. At 12 months, modified Rankin Scale data were available in 715 (95%) patients allocated fluoxetine and 712 (95%) placebo. The distribution of modified Rankin Scale categories was similar in the 2 groups (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76–1.10]). Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory with a median value of 89 (interquartile range, 75–100) versus 93 (interquartile range, 82–100); P = 0.0021 and communication 93 (interquartile range, 82–100) versus 96 (interquartile range, 86–100); P = 0.024 domains of the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo. There were no other differences in secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine after acute stroke had no effect on functional outcome at 12 months. Patients allocated fluoxetine scored worse on memory and communication on the Stroke Impact Scale compared with placebo, but this is likely to be due to chance.

### Twelve-month outcomes of the AFFINITY trial of fluoxetine for functional recovery after acute stroke: AFFINITY trial steering committee on behalf of the AFFINITY trial collaboration [^0d72ce44]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

The AFFINITY trial (Assessment of Fluoxetine in Stroke Recovery) reported that oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months after acute stroke did not improve functional outcome and increased the risk of falls, bone fractures, and seizures. After trial medication was ceased at 6 months, survivors were followed to 12 months post-randomization. This preplanned secondary analysis aimed to determine any sustained or delayed effects of fluoxetine at 12 months post-randomization.

Methods

AFFINITY was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults (n = 1280) with a clinical diagnosis of stroke in the previous 2 to 15 days and persisting neurological deficit who were recruited at 43 hospital stroke units in Australia (n = 29), New Zealand (4), and Vietnam (10) between 2013 and 2019. Participants were randomized to oral fluoxetine 20 mg once daily (n = 642) or matching placebo (n = 638) for 6 months and followed until 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome was function, measured by the modified Rankin Scale, at 6 months. Secondary outcomes for these analyses included measures of the modified Rankin Scale, mood, cognition, overall health status, fatigue, health-related quality of life, and safety at 12 months.

Results

Adherence to trial medication was for a mean 167 (SD 48) days and similar between randomized groups. At 12 months, the distribution of modified Rankin Scale categories was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.76–1.14]; P = 0.46). Compared with placebo, patients allocated fluoxetine had fewer recurrent ischemic strokes (14 [2.18%] versus 29 [4.55%]; P = 0.02), and no longer had significantly more falls (27 [4.21%] versus 15 [2.35%]; P = 0.08), bone fractures (23 [3.58%] versus 11 [1.72%]; P = 0.05), or seizures (11 [1.71%] versus 8 [1.25%]; P = 0.64) at 12 months.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 6 months after acute stroke had no delayed or sustained effect on functional outcome, falls, bone fractures, or seizures at 12 months poststroke. The lower rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in the fluoxetine group is most likely a chance finding. Registration: URL: http://www.anzctr.org.au/; Unique identifier: ACTRN12611000774921.

### Safety and efficacy of fluoxetine on functional outcome after acute stroke (AFFINITY): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^6d42042f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The study AFFINITY was published by AFFINITY Trial Collaboration. and colleagues in 2020 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke, Intracerebral hemorrhage and Subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the AFFINITY study, the trial question was: what is the role of fluoxetine in patients after acute stroke? In the AFFINITY study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AFFINITY study, the population was: 1280 patients (476 female, 804 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute stroke, brain imaging consistent with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a persisting neurological deficit. The key exclusion criteria were indication or contraindication for fluoxetine; life-threatening disease with < 12-month survival; pregnancy. In the AFFINITY study, the interventions were: n = 642 fluoxetine (an oral dose of 20 mg/day for 6 months) n = 638 placebo (matching placebo daily for 6 months). In the AFFINITY study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in new depression at 6 months (5% vs. 7%; ARD -2, 95% CI -4.59 to 0.59). In the AFFINITY study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in fatigue at 6 months as measured by the vitality subscale of 36-item short form health survey (70 points vs. 70 points;) No significant difference in health-related QoL as measured by the European QoL 5-dimensional 5-level questionnaire (0.81 vs. 0.78; AD 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.06). In the AFFINITY study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, recurrent stroke, thrombotic events, hemorrhagic stroke. significant differences in epileptic seizures (2% vs. < 1%), fall with injury (3% vs. 1%), and new bone fracture (3% vs. 1%) at 6 months. In the AFFINITY study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute stroke, brain imaging consistent with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a persisting neurological deficit, fluoxetine was not superior to placebo with respect to new depression at 6 months.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^dcc8acc0]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Each year, stroke affects around 9 million people worldwide for the first time and results in long-term disability for around 6·5 million people. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is used to treat depression and emotional lability after stroke. Many clinical and preclinical studies have suggested that SSRIs might improve outcomes after stroke through a range of mechanisms, which include enhancing neuroplasticity and promoting neurogenesis. In 2011, the results of the FLAME (FLuoxetine for motor recovery After acute ischaeMic strokE) trial indicated that fluoxetine enhanced motor recovery. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial, 118 patients with ischaemic stroke and unilateral motor weakness, and a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 13, were randomly allocated between 5 and 10 days after stroke onset to receive fluoxetine 20 mg daily or placebo for 3 months. At day 90, the improvement from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer motor score was significantly greater in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. Additionally, the proportion of patients who were independent in daily living (with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0–2) was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group (26% vs 9%, p = 0·015). More participants were free from depression at 3 months in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group (93% vs 71%; p = 0·002). A subsequent Cochrane systematic reviewof SSRIs for stroke recovery identified 52 randomised controlled trials of SSRIs versus controls (in 4060 patients), but no others tested the effect of fluoxetine on functional outcomes measured with the mRS. The findings of the Cochrane review suggested that SSRIs might reduce post-stroke disability, although this estimate was based on a meta-analysis done across various measures of function and greater effects were seen if studies with increased risk of bias were retained and patients with depression were included. Although promising, data from the FLAME trial and the Cochrane review were not sufficiently compelling to alter stroke treatment guidelines or to alleviate concerns that any possible benefits might be offset by serious adverse reactions.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^26b8722e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression and other mood disorders after stroke. The 2012 Cochrane Review of SSRIs for stroke recovery demonstrated positive effects on recovery, even in people who were not depressed at randomisation. A large trial of fluoxetine for stroke recovery (fluoxetine versus placebo under supervision) has recently been published, and it is now appropriate to update the evidence.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 16 July 2018), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, July 2018), MEDLINE (1946 to July 2018), Embase (1974 to July 2018), CINAHL (1982 July 2018), PsycINFO (1985 to July 2018), AMED (1985 to July 2018), and PsycBITE March 2012 to July 2018). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke survivors at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. To be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data from each trial. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risks of bias and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified a total of 63 eligible trials recruiting 9168 participants, most of which provided data only at end of treatment and not at follow-up. There was a wide age range. About half the trials required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between trials. Only three of the included trials were at low risk of bias across the key 'Risk of bias' domains. A meta-analysis of these three trials found little or no effect of SSRI on either disability score: SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; P = 0.75; 2 studies, 2829 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or independence: RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.99; 3 studies, 3249 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We downgraded both these outcomes for imprecision. SSRIs reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.11 lower, 0.19 lower to 0.04 lower; 2 trials, 2861 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a higher observed number of gastrointestinal side effects among participants treated with SSRIs compared to placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.76; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 148 participants; moderate-quality evidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). For seizures there was no evidence of a substantial difference. When we included all trials in a sensitivity analysis, irrespective of risk of bias, SSRIs appeared to reduce disability scores but not dependence. One large trial (FOCUS) dominated the results. We identified several ongoing trials, including two large trials that together will recruit more than 3000 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no reliable evidence that SSRIs should be used routinely to promote recovery after stroke. Meta-analysis of the trials at low risk of bias indicate that SSRIs do not improve recovery from stroke. We identified potential improvements in disability only in the analyses which included trials at high risk of bias. A further meta-analysis of large ongoing trials will be required to determine the generalisability of these findings.

### Fluoxetine for stroke: a mixed bag of outcomes [^1ade4df4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the leading neurologic cause of burden operationalized in terms of disability-adjusted life-years. After stroke, motor deficits, cognitive deficits, and depression cause loss of independence, disability, decreased functioning, and reduced quality of life; these persist into the long term. There are theoretical grounds to consider that, through neuroplasticity and other mechanisms, such impairments can be prevented or attenuated by the early introduction of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as fluoxetine. However, a recent meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; pooled N = 4,145) found that fluoxetine neither improved independence nor reduced disability; whereas fluoxetine did reduce the risk of poststroke depression, it did not improve other outcomes, such as motor and cognitive outcomes, but, rather, was associated with many adverse outcomes. Two very large RCTs were subsequently published. The findings of these RCTs, in combination with the findings of the meta-analysis, suggest that, if fluoxetine is started within 2 weeks of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and is administered in a dose of 20 mg/d for 3–6 months, there is a 3%-4% reduced risk of new onset depression; however, there is no improvement in the likelihood of achieving independence or of reduction of disability. The risk of several adverse outcomes is increased; these include falls (by 2%), bone fractures (by 1%-2%), seizures (by 1%), and hyponatremia (by 1%). Fluoxetine is also associated with the theoretical risk of adverse drug interactions in stroke patients. In summary, there does not appear to be a role for the routine use of fluoxetine in poststroke pharmacologic care.

### Depression outcomes among patients treated with fluoxetine for stroke recovery: the AFFINITY randomized clinical trial [^b9ef8378]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

One in 3 adults experiences clinically significant symptoms of depression during the first year after a stroke, but evidence to support the use of antidepressants in this population remains scant.

Objective

To investigate whether daily treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride reduces the proportion of people affected by clinically significant symptoms of depression after stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this secondary analysis of the Assessment of Fluoxetine in Stroke Recovery parallel-group, randomized (1:1 assignment), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 1221 participants in Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam were recruited between January 11, 2013, and June 30, 2019, and were followed up for 6 months. Adults aged 18 years or older were recruited 2 to 15 days after experiencing a stroke associated with modified Rankin Scale score of 1 or higher.

Interventions

Fluoxetine hydrochloride, 20 mg, or matched placebo daily for 26 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 9 or lower was a prespecified secondary outcome of the trial. Assessments were completed at baseline and at 4, 12, and 26 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included participant-reported clinician diagnosis of depression, prescription of a nontrial antidepressant, or nonpharmacologic treatment of depression. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

A total of 607 participants (378 men [62.3%]; mean [SD] age, 64.3 [12.2] years) were randomly assigned treatment with placebo, and 614 participants (397 men [64.7%]; mean [SD] age, 63.4 [12.4] years) were randomly assigned treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride daily. The groups were balanced for demographic and clinical measures. At baseline, 112 patients (18.5%) in the placebo group and 116 patients (18.9%) in the fluoxetine group had PHQ-9 scores of 9 or higher. During follow-up, 126 of 596 participants (21.1%) treated with placebo and 121 of 598 participants (20.2%) treated with fluoxetine had PHQ-9 scores of 9 or higher (P = 0.70). A similar proportion of participants with PHQ-9 scores less than 9 at baseline who were treated with fluoxetine hydrochloride and placebo developed PHQ-9 scores of 9 or higher during the trial (placebo, 72 of 488 [14.8%]; and fluoxetine, 63 of 485 [13.0%]; P = 0.43). A slightly higher number of participants in the placebo group than in the fluoxetine group had a participant-reported clinician diagnosis of depression (42 of 602 [7.0%] vs 26 of 601 [4.3%]; P = 0.05). By week 26, 14 participants (2.3%) in the placebo group and 12 participants (1.9%) in the fluoxetine group had died (P = 0.67).

Conclusions and Relevance

Routine daily treatment with 20 mg of fluoxetine did not decrease the proportion of people affected by clinically significant symptoms of depression after a stroke, nor did it affect the proportion of people prescribed an antidepressant or receiving nonpharmacologic treatments compared with placebo.

### Pharmacological therapies in post stroke recovery: recommendations for future clinical trials [^4a541c72]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in adults and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Early reperfusion and neuroprotection techniques have been the focus of much effort with the aim of very acute treatment of the stroke. Targeting different mechanisms, pharmacological therapies have the potential to reduce disability in a large fraction of patients who survive the acute stroke. The brain's capacity to reorganize after stroke through plasticity mechanisms can be modulated by pharmacological agents. A number of therapeutic interventions are under study, including small molecules, growth factors, and monoclonal antibodies. Recently it has been shown that the SSRI fluoxetine improved motor deficit in patients with ischaemic stroke and hemiplegia which appeared to be independent of the presence of depression. In this context, it is of major importance to support innovative research in order to promote the emergence of new pharmacological treatments targeting neurological recovery after stroke, as opposed to acute de-occlusion and neuroprotection. This paper is the work of a group of 14 scientists with aim of (1) addressing key areas of the basic and clinical aspects of human brain plasticity after stroke and potential pharmacological targets for recovery, (2) asking questions about the most appropriate characteristics of clinical trials testing drugs in post stroke recovery and (3) proposing recommendations for future clinical trials.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^3931f779]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) after stroke — time to effect, dosing, adverse effects, patient preferences, and evidence quality are summarized as follows: Interim analyses showed improvement at day 30 and day 45, but differences were not statistically significant until day 90, and if a significant motor benefit occurs it likely takes at least three months; studies were relatively short (three to six months), making durability of FMA score benefit difficult to assess. Maintenance doses were relatively low (fluoxetine 20 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day) and within safe dosing limits for adults older than 60. Adverse events data were mixed: one review did not report significant differences versus placebo, while another reported higher incidence in the fluoxetine group than placebo of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01), seizure (OR: 1.46), and fracture (OR: 2.34). A rare but serious adverse effect is bleeding when combined with antithrombotic therapy; assessment of risk should be made, particularly if the patient is on an antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or both. More common (at least 10% reported incidence) but less serious side effects include insomnia, anxiety, headache, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and dry mouth. Patient preferences vary; some might already be prescribed an SSRI or be candidates for an antidepressant and might be able to obtain two benefits from one medication, whereas others might wish to avoid an antidepressant due to stigma or might not prefer adding another oral medication; SSRIs are prescription medications but are easily accessible because many providers are familiar with their use. The evidence for this recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low with limitations including small sample size and short duration.

### Fluoxetine opens window to improve motor recovery after stroke (FLOW) [^37c1f950]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Fluoxetine Opens Window to Improve Motor Recovery After Stroke ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview FLOW Trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of coupling antidepressant therapy with exercise rehabilitation across multiple Canadian sites in 176 stroke patients. 88 patients will be enrolled in each arm of the study. Both groups will receive an exercise program in addition to standard of care rehabilitation, but only one group will receive the active drug fluoxetine. Study participants will be evaluated at baseline, post-exercise program and 6-months post-exercise program. While enrolled in the study, participants will be required to take part in a 12 week, 3 times per week exercise program. Evaluators and patients will be blind to the treatment administered.

The trial is constructed with randomization to remove selection and allocation biases and to ensure greater validity in observed differences in the outcome measures. The Applied Health Research Centre in Toronto will act as the coordinating and analysis center. Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Pre-morbid modified Rankin score > 2
- Substantial premorbid disability or pre-existing deficit or language comprehension deficit that could interfere with assessments
- Diagnosis of major depressive disorder/anxiety disorder requiring antidepressant use within 6 weeks of enrolment.
- Taking neuroleptic drugs, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 30 days of enrolment
- Unstable serious medical condition
- Resting blood pressure exceeding 180/100mmHg
- Requires more than a one person assist for transfer.
- Planned surgery that would affect participation in the trial
- Participating in another formal lower limbs exercise program more than one day per week.
- History of QT prolongation or concomitant use of clearly identified potential QT prolonging drugs, at the investigators discretion.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^290760ea]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 103 hospitals in the UK. The protocol and statistical analysis plan were published before completion of follow-up.

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older; had a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke with brain imaging compatible with intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke (including a normal brain scan); were randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after stroke onset; and had a persisting focal neurological deficit at the time of randomisation that was severe enough to warrant 6 months of treatment from the patient's or carer's perspective.

Patients were excluded if they had subarachnoid haemorrhage except where secondary to a primary intracerebral haemorrhage; they were unlikely to be available for follow-up for the following 12 months; they were unable to speak English and had no close family member available to help with follow-up; they had another life-threatening illness (eg, advanced cancer) that would make 12-month survival unlikely; they had a history of epileptic seizures; they had a history of allergy to fluoxetine; they had contraindications to fluoxetine, including hepatic impairment (alanine aminotransferase more than three times the upper normal limit) or renal impairment (creatinine > 180 μmol/L); they were pregnant or breastfeeding, or women of childbearing age not taking contraception; they had a previous drug overdose or attempted suicide; they were already enrolled into a controlled trial of an investigational medicinal product; they had current or recent (within the last month) depression treated with an SSRI; or they were taking or had, in the past 5 weeks, taken medications that have a potentially serious interaction with fluoxetine.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^6a53fd41]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for post-stroke motor recovery — Recommendation 12 states there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to improve motor outcomes in patients with or without depression (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence cited includes an SR in non-depressed patients with subacute stroke where treatment was initiated within three weeks of stroke and SSRIs provided a significant benefit versus placebo in improving FMA scores with an average treatment difference of 17.63 points, while modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and BI scores did not show a statistically significant improvement; another SR including individuals with and without depression confirmed the same trend. Across these SRs, patient numbers were lower for FMA (n = 263 and n = 287) than for mRS (n = 6,778 and n = 5,431) or BI (n = 435 and n = 814). Regarding time of effect, only two RCTs took interim FMA evaluations, and both studies compared fluoxetine versus placebo and were 90 days in total duration.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched the literature in July, 2018, using the same search strategy as that of a 2012 Cochrane review. In addition to the FLAME (FLuoxetine for motor recovery After acute ischaeMic strokE) trial we identified three other small, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of fluoxetine, which enrolled patients who did not have depression at recruitment and which reported the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) during follow-up. These three trials recruited a total of 154 patients and reported improvements in the mRS in those allocated fluoxetine, but two trials (n = 122) did not publish their mRS data in a format that would facilitate a meta-analysis. The FLAME trial indicated that fluoxetine, when given to patients with a recent ischaemic stroke, a motor deficit, and a median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 13, improved recovery in motor function as measured by the Fugl-Meyer motor score at about 3 months. In a published post-hoc analysis, the proportion of patients who were independent in daily living (mRS 0–2) was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group (26% vs 9%, p = 0·015). However, an ordinal analysis of the mRS data did not show a significant difference between groups (common odds ratio 1·501 [95% CI 0·757–2·974]; p = 0·2446).

Discussion

The results of the FOCUS trial show that fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after an acute stroke does not significantly improve patients' functional outcome or survival at 6 and 12 months. However, fluoxetine decreased the occurrence of depression and increased bone fractures at 6 months.

The strengths of the study, supporting the internal validity of the results, are that bias was minimised by central randomisation without any prospect of foreknowledge; patients, carers, and outcome assessment were masked (with only three episodes of unmasking); there were few losses to follow-up (< 1%), and prespecified intention-to-treat analyses were done. The small difference in the numbers of patients stopping the trial medication for perceived adverse effects suggests that unmasking because of adverse effects was unlikely to have had a significant effect on our results. In any case, expectation bias would normally be expected to bias the result in favour of active treatment. Random error was also minimised by the large sample size and high rates of follow-up, which provided greater statistical power than in previous similar trials. The external validity of the results, at least for the UK stroke population, is supported by the large number of participating hospitals throughout the UK. Compared with unselected patients with stroke admitted to UK hospitals (appendix), there were few differences in the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the FOCUS trial. Patients enrolled in FOCUS had slightly more severe strokes than unselected patients (NIHSS 6 vs 4), which probably reflected inclusion criteria that required patients to have a neurological deficit persisting at the time of enrolment. Also, 60% of enrolled patients were men compared with a UK average of 50% — an unexplained but common observation in stroke trials. Enrolled patients were slightly younger than the UK average (71 years vs 77 years), which might partly explain the male preponderance, with older women being under-represented. Many studies included in the previously published systematic review of randomised controlled trials of fluoxetine were from China, whereas non-white patients comprised less than 5% of those recruited in FOCUS. The ongoing AFFINITY trial is recruiting in Vietnam and will include a larger proportion of Asian patients.

Secondary outcomes at 6 months are shown in table 2 and adverse events at 6 months shown in table 3. Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated placebo to be diagnosed with new depression at 6 months (210 [13·43%] patients vs 269 [17·21%]; difference in proportions 3·78% [95% CI 1·26–6·30]; p = 0·0033) and had better mood measured on MHI-5 at the 6-month follow-up (median 76 [IQR 60–88] vs 72 [56–88]; p = 0·0100). Those allocated fluoxetine had an increased risk of bone fractures compared with those allocated placebo (45 [2·88%] patients vs 23 [1·47%]; difference in proportions 1·41% [95% CI 0·38–2·43]; p = 0·0070). There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes at 6 months, including any of the nine domains of the SIS, the Vitality subscale of SF36, and EQ5D-5L (table 2) or other recorded adverse reactions (table 3). The appendix shows the progress through the trial for patients who received any fluoxetine and those who received no fluoxetine by 6 months. Adverse events and safety outcomes in patients who received any fluoxetine within the first 6 months and those who received no fluoxetine, irrespective of the group to which they were allocated, are shown in the appendix.

### Fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischaemic stroke (FLAME): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^bc0118e7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemiplegia and hemiparesis are the most common deficits caused by stroke. A few small clinical trials suggest that fluoxetine enhances motor recovery but its clinical efficacy is unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate whether fluoxetine would enhance motor recovery if given soon after an ischaemic stroke to patients who have motor deficits.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients from nine stroke centres in France who had ischaemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, had Fugl-Meyer motor scale (FMMS) scores of 55 or less, and were aged between 18 years and 85 years were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomly assigned, using a computer random-number generator, in a 1:1 ratio to fluoxetine (20 mg once per day, orally) or placebo for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke. All patients had physiotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the change on the FMMS between day 0 and day 90 after the start of the study drug. Participants, carers, and physicians assessing the outcome were masked to group assignment. Analysis was of all patients for whom data were available (full analysis set). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00657163.

Findings

118 patients were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (n = 59) or placebo (n = 59), and 113 were included in the analysis (57 in the fluoxetine group and 56 in the placebo group). Two patients died before day 90 and three withdrew from the study. FMMS improvement at day 90 was significantly greater in the fluoxetine group (adjusted mean 34·0 points [95% CI 29·7–38·4]) than in the placebo group (24·3 points [19·9–28·7]; p = 0·003). The main adverse events in the fluoxetine and placebo groups were hyponatraemia (two [4%] vs two [4%]), transient digestive disorders including nausea, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain (14 [25%] vs six [11%]), hepatic enzyme disorders (five [9%] vs ten [18%]), psychiatric disorders (three [5%] vs four [7%]), insomnia (19 [33%] vs 20 [36%]), and partial seizure (one [< 1%] vs 0).

Interpretation

In patients with ischaemic stroke and moderate to severe motor deficit, the early prescription of fluoxetine with physiotherapy enhanced motor recovery after 3 months. Modulation of spontaneous brain plasticity by drugs is a promising pathway for treatment of patients with ischaemic stroke and moderate to severe motor deficit.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c12e20a1]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of poststroke depression (PSD) using pharmacological interventions — A meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among 776 initially nondepressed stroke patients reported reduced likelihood of developing PSD with active pharmacological treatment (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.53), especially after a 1 year treatment (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.56) and with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.61). Reported side effects included nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness, with no significant differences between active treatment and placebo; tremor was significantly associated with sertraline in 1 RCT. An earlier Cochrane review including 12 placebo-controlled trials of 611 individuals found no evidence that antidepressants prevented depression after stroke, but 4 trials (401 participants) subsequently showed benefit for fluoxetine (n = 59 vs placebo n = 59), mianserin (n = 56 vs placebo n = 46), paroxetine (n = 32 vs placebo n = 32), and escitalopram (n = 59 vs placebo n = 58). In summary, 8 trials (n = 776) suggest that pharmacological treatment may be effective in preventing PSD; however, further studies are needed in more representative samples, and additional study is required to determine the optimal timing and duration of treatment.

Randomisation and masking

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive fluoxetine or placebo, by use of a centralised randomisation system. The clinician entered the patient's baseline data into a secure web-based randomisation system hosted by the University of Edinburgh. After the data were checked for completeness and consistency, the system generated a unique study identification number and a treatment pack number, which corresponded to either fluoxetine or placebo. A minimisation algorithmwas used to achieve optimum balance between treatment groups for the following factors: delay since stroke onset (2–8 days vs 9–15 days), computer-generated prediction of 6-month outcome (probability of mRS0 to 2 was ≤ 0·15 vs > 0·15 based on the six simple variable [SSV] model), and presence of a motor deficit or aphasia (according to the NIHSS). The SSV model includes the patient's age; whether the patient is independent in activities of daily living before the stroke; whether they are living alone before the stroke; whether they are able to lift both arms off the bed; whether they are able to walk unassisted; whether they are able to talk, and whether they are not confused. The randomising clinicians in each centre had received training and certification in the application of the NIHSS. The system also incorporated an element of randomisation over and above the minimisation algorithm, so that it allocated patients to the treatment group that minimised the difference between groups with a probability of 0·8 rather than 1·0.

Patients, their families, and the health-care team including the pharmacist, staff in the coordinating centre, and anyone involved in outcome assessments were all masked to treatment allocation by use of a placebo capsule that was visually identical to the fluoxetine capsules even when broken open. An emergency unblinding system was available but was designed so that those in the coordinating centre and those doing follow-up remained masked to treatment allocation.

Post-stroke depression — pharmacotherapy: We suggest a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor for depression symptoms. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs outweighed the potential harms of known side effects, which are typically mild. A large trial assessing functional and mood outcomes in 3,127 acute stroke patients noted that the risk of bone fractures in the fluoxetine group nearly doubled (difference between treatment and placebo group 1.41%, 95% CI: 0.38–2.43; p = 0.007).

### Fluoxetine for motor recovery after acute ischaemic stroke (FLAME): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^6ffa7572]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

The study FLAME (fluoxetine) was published by Chollet F and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Lancet Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of fluoxetine in patients who have motor deficits secondary to ischemic stroke? In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the population was: 118 patients (46 female, 72 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55. The key exclusion criteria were severe post-stroke disability, substantial premorbid disability, clinically diagnosed with depression, receipt of antidepressants, residual motor deficit from a previous stroke, severe aphasia. In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the interventions were: n = 59 fluoxetine (20 mg once per day PO for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke) n = 59 placebo (matching placebo for 3 months starting 5–10 days after the onset of stroke). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90 (34 points vs. 24.3 points; AD 9.8 points, 95% CI 3.4 to 16.1). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the secondary outcomes were: borderline significant increase in mean NIHSS scores at day 90 (5.8 points vs. 6.9 points;) Significant increase in mRS score of 0–2 at day 90 (26% vs. 9%; AD 17%, 95% CI 3.29 to 30.71) Significant increase in change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at day 90 (-0.1 points vs. 3.2 points; AD 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.28 to 6.32). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, including hyponatremia, insomnia, psychiatric disorders, and partial seizure. significant difference in transient digestive disorders (25% vs. 11%) and hepatic enzyme disorders (9% vs. 18%). In the FLAME (fluoxetine) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged between 18–85 years with ischemic stroke and hemiplegia or hemiparesis, who had Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores < 55, fluoxetine was superior to placebo with respect to change in Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores at day 90.

Procedures

Fluoxetine 20 mg or placebo were administered to patients orally once daily for 6 months. The study medication (active and placebo) was manufactured by Unichem (Goa, India), imported by Niche Generics Ltd (Hitchin, UK), purchased from Discovery Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Castle Donington, UK), and quality assured, packaged, labelled, and distributed by Sharp Clinical Services. Patients were supplied with 186 capsules and were prescribed the study medication (20 mg capsules of fluoxetine or placebo capsule) to be taken daily. If a patient was unable to swallow capsules and had an enteral feeding tube in place, the capsules were broken open and the contents put down the tube according to accepted methods. We measured adherence to the study medication by recording the date of the first and last dose taken, the number of missed doses while in hospital, capsule counts when unused capsules were returned, and estimated adherence at the 6-month follow-up. We recorded the reasons for stopping the study medication early. Our primary measure of adherence was the best estimate of the interval between the first and last dose based on all the information available. Therefore, for a particular patient a capsule count might lead us to modify the estimate of the timing of the last dose.

### The efficacy comparison of citalopram, fluoxetine, and placebo on motor recovery after ischemic stroke: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial [^935bd68a]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of oral citalopram, compared with fluoxetine and a placebo, in patients with post-stroke motor disabilities.

Design

A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2015 and January 2016.

Setting

The neurology department of a university-affiliated urban hospital in Tehran, Iran.

Subjects

Ninety adult patients with acute ischemic stroke, hemiplegia, or hemiparesis and a Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale score of below 55 were included.

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: Group A received 20mg PO of fluoxetine daily, Group B received 20mg PO of citalopram daily, and Group C received a placebo PO The duration of the therapy was 90days. In addition to the medications, all of the participants received physiotherapy.

Main Measures

Functional status at 90days, which was measured by the Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale score.

Results

The initial mean (SD) Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores for the placebo, fluoxetine, and citalopram groups were 18.2 (11.42), 20.08 (14.53), and 17.07 (14.92), respectively. After 90days, the scores were 27.96 (18.71) for the placebo group, 52.42 (26.24) for the fluoxetine group, and 50.89 (27.17) for the citalopram group. Compared with the placebo group, the mean Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale scores showed significant increases in the fluoxetine and citalopram groups (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

There was no significant difference between citalopram and fluoxetine in facilitating post-stroke motor recovery in ischemic stroke patients. However, compared with a placebo, both drugs improved post-stroke motor function.

Post-stroke motor recovery pharmacologic agents — fluoxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), dextroamphetamine, and levodopa — show mixed evidence: Fluoxetine was found helpful in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence of benefit for SSRIs in overall disability after stroke, yet the overall quality was not sufficient to make a definitive recommendation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of dextroamphetamine in 71 subjects was negative, and amphetamines carry a risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of levodopa found short-term benefit versus placebo but was limited by relatively small size (47 subjects analyzed) and short-term follow-up of only 3 weeks.

### 2023 guideline for the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^6108273e]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Stroke recovery pharmacotherapy — Fluoxetine has been studied extensively in patients with stroke to promote neuronal plasticity, with trials randomizing patients to fluoxetine 20 mg versus placebo that showed increased osteoporosis, fractures, and seizures without motor recovery improvement; hence, fluoxetine is not recommended to enhance poststroke functional status, although patients with preexisting depression on fluoxetine should continue it to treat depression.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c6fc1e23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed that SSRIs are effective in preventing and treating depression, and improving anxiety, motor function, cognitive function, and dependence in patients after stroke. These benefits were only reproducible with the citalopram subanalysis but not fluoxetine, suggesting that citalopram but not fluoxetine improved the recovery outcomes of patients after stroke. Further well‐conducted placebo‐controlled trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of citalopram among patients after stroke.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^36423f79]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The validity of our results is also supported by the observed reduction in the occurrence of new post-stroke depression at 6 months with fluoxetine, which is consistent with its known antidepressant effects and the results of the FLAME trial. A previous systematic review of five randomised controlled trials (two of fluoxetine, two of sertraline, and one of escitalopram), including FLAME, in patients with stroke and no depression tested whether SSRIs prevented the development of post-stroke depression. In a pooled analysis, 23 (9·3%) of 248 patients treated with an SSRI developed post-stroke depression compared with 59 (24·4%) of 242 treated with a placebo (OR 0·37 [95% CI 0·22–0·61]; p = 0·001). The rate of depression in the placebo groups of these trials was much higher than that in FOCUS, which might have reflected the characteristics of the patients (as they tended to have had more severe strokes than those enrolled in FOCUS) or the different methods of diagnosing depression. Although this observation is consistent with our findings in terms of the direction (but not the magnitude) of treatment effect, it does not take into account the possible excess risk of adverse effects (such as bone fractures), which might offset any benefits of reducing the frequency of post-stroke depression.

The observed 1·4% absolute excess risk of bone fractures at 6 months with fluoxetine in FOCUS is also consistent with previous reports from large case-control and cohort studies. The magnitude of the increased risk in previous observational studies tended to be greater than in FOCUS, but this difference might be attributable to the inherent confounding by treatment indication in observational studies. The rates of serious adverse reactions to fluoxetine referred to in the summary of product characteristics, which we included as secondary outcomes in this trial (eg, epileptic seizures, falls, hyponatraemia, uncontrolled diabetes, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding), were higher in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo group, but the absolute differences were small and not significant. Despite concerns about the effects of fluoxetine on platelet function and interactions with antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, we observed no effect on bleeding or thrombotic adverse events.

Inevitably, some patients withdrew from the trial and were lost to follow-up. Some did not return follow-up questionnaires or left items blank. We excluded patients who had no follow-up data from the analyses, and did sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of these exclusions on the results.

For our primary outcome we did an ordinal analysis expressing the result as a common OR and 95% CI, where a common OR in favour of placebo is less than 1·0, adjusted with logistic regression for the variables in the minimisation algorithm. We did Cox proportional hazards modelling to analyse the effect of treatment on survival up to 12 months, also adjusting for variables included in our minimisation algorithm. We compared the frequency of outcome events by calculating the differences in proportions between treatment groups with their 95% CIs and p values. We present the median scores on the SIS, MHI-5, and the Vitality subscale of the SF36, and EQ5D-5L with the IQRs and p value derived by non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney test). For all these scales, higher values represent better outcomes.

Prespecified subgroup analyses were the effect of treatment allocation on the primary outcome subdivided by key baseline variables described in our published statistical analysis plan, including the probability of being alive and independent (0·00 to ≤ 0·15 vs > 0·15 to 1·00); delay from stroke onset to randomisation (2–8 days vs 9–15 days), motor deficit (present or absent) or aphasia (present or absent), pathological type of stroke (ischaemic vs haemorrhagic), and age (≤ 70 years vs > 70 years); ability to consent for themselves (yes or no); whether or not mood was assessable at baseline, and whether the patient was or was not depressed at baseline. Subgroup analyses were done by observing the change in log-likelihood when the interaction between the treatment and the subgroup was added into a logistic regression model. Statistical analyses were done with SAS, version 9.2.

The study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the mRS, at the 6-month follow-up. We used the simplified mRS questionnaire (smRSq) delivered by post. Among those without a complete postal questionnaire, a telephone interview was done for any further clarification, for completion of missing items, or for the whole questionnaire. Those doing telephone assessments (chief investigators or other staff at the coordinating centre) were trained in their use.

Secondary outcomes were survival at 6 and 12 months, functional status at 12 months (mRS), and health status with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS; for each of nine domains on which the patient scores 0–100). Arm, hand, leg, and foot strength; hand function; mobility; communication and understanding; memory and think_ing; mood and emotions; daily activities; and participation in work, leisure, and social activities were assessed by a Likert scale. Overall rating of recovery was assessed on a visual analogue scale. Mood was assessed with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Fatigue was measured on the Vitality subscale of SF36. Health-related quality of life was measured with the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ5D-5L) to generate utilities. The following adverse events and safety outcomes were systematically recorded: recurrent stroke including ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, acute coronary syndromes, epileptic seizures, hyponatraemia (< 125 mmol/L), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, other major bleeding (lower gastrointestinal, extracranial, subdural, extradural, and subarachnoid), poorly controlled diabetes including hyperglycaemia (> 22 mmol/L) and symptomatic hypoglycaemia, falls resulting in injury, bone fractures, new depression (including a diagnosis made by their treating clinician and initiation of a new antidepressant prescription), and self-harm.

The recruiting hospitals monitored adherence, identified adverse events in hospital, and completed the follow-up form at hospital discharge or death in hospital. National coordinating centre staff followed up patients at 6 months and 12 months to measure the primary and secondary outcomes. Data on adverse events and medications were also collected from patients' general practitioners at 6 months and 12 months.

Our protocol stipulated that if patients developed depression that a clinician wished to treat with an antidepressant during the treatment period, then the clinician should continue the study medication and avoid the use of an SSRI if possible, and instead use either mirtazapine, trazadone, or a tricyclic antidepressant. We monitored the use of all antidepressants during follow-up.

Rehabilitation, mobilization timing, and fluoxetine — The guideline recommends use of coordinated multidisciplinary inpatient team care with early assessment of discharge planning and a goal of early supported discharge for mild to moderate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); implementation of rehabilitation activities such as stretching and functional task training may be considered 24 to 48 hours after moderate ICH, whereas early aggressive mobilization within the first 24 hours after ICH appears to worsen 14-day mortality; multiple randomized trials did not confirm benefit of fluoxetine for functional recovery after ICH, and while fluoxetine reduced depression it also increased the incidence of fractures.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^7d9e2c3e]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome, an ordinal comparison of the distribution of patients across the mRS categories at 6 months, adjusted for variables included in the minimisation algorithm, was similar in the two groups (common OR 0·951 [95% CI 0·839–1·079]; p = 0·439; figure 2). The unadjusted analysis provided similar results (common OR 0·961 [95% CI 0·848–1·089]; p = 0·531). The ordinal analysis was done with the assumption of proportional odds, in the model of mRS by treatment. This assumption was found to hold in the score test for proportional odds assumption (p = 0·9947). Comparison of the mRS dichotomised into 0–2 vs 3–6 similarly showed no significant difference between the groups (adjusted OR 0·955 [95% CI 0·812–1·123], p = 0·576; unadjusted OR 0·957 [0·827–1·107], p = 0·352).

Figure 2
Primary outcome of disability on the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months by treatment group

Ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) adjusted with logistic regression for the variables included in our minimisation algorithm. 1553 patients had mRS data available in each group; 11 patients in the fluoxetine group and ten in the placebo group had missing mRS data. Common odds ratio 0·951 (95% CI 0·839–1·079), p = 0·439; adjusted for baseline variables.

The results of our prespecified subgroup analyses are shown in the appendix. No significant interactions were observed between the prespecified subgroups and the effect of treatment on the primary outcome.

The appendix shows the effect of fluoxetine on our primary outcome in subgroups defined by the eligibility criteria and increasing degrees of adherence to the study medication; we did a series of prespecified per-protocol analyses, which sequentially excluded subgroups of patients who either did not meet our eligibility criteria or had incomplete adherence to the study medication. We did not observe greater benefit in patients with greater adherence.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^fbfb89b7]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The main limitation of FOCUS was the moderate adherence to the trial medication, which might have led us to under-estimate any treatment effect. However, adherence measured in FOCUS was superior to that reported in routine clinical practice, and did not differ substantially between the treatment groups. Differences in adherence between the fluoxetine and placebo groups were more likely if reduced adherence resulted from possible adverse reactions or perceived change (or no change) in patients' conditions. We repeated the analysis of our primary outcome after sequentially excluding patients with different reasons for, and different degrees of, adherence. Such per-protocol analyses can increase the risk of bias, usually in favour of the active treatment. However, our analyses (shown in the appendix) did not show any increased benefit from fluoxetine in patients with greater adherence.

Our use of the smRSq as the primary outcome measure could be perceived as a limitation. However, the smRSq is a valid, reliable, and patient-centred measure of functional outcome, thus ensuring our results are relevant to patients and their families. Additionally, local, face-to-face assessments of outcomes might be more prone to unmasking than those done through postal and telephone follow-up because of patients reporting adverse effects of trial medication. We used patient-reported outcomes, the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) at baseline and the smRSq, MHI-5, and SIS motor score at follow-up by postal and telephone questionnaires. Other limitations of FOCUS include the absence of a standardised psychiatric assessment at baseline or follow-up and absence of a structured neurological examination during follow-up, which were impractical to include in this large, pragmatic, multicentre trial.

We cannot definitively exclude an effect of fluoxetine on a directly measured neurological deficit — such as the Fugl-Meyer motor score, which was measured in the FLAME trial. However, we have shown that a resulting improvement in functional status measured with the mRS or SIS is unlikely.

Other trials of similar design to FOCUS, but with smaller recruitment targets, are ongoing. These studies should allow us to confirm the effects of fluoxetine on post-stroke depression and bone fractures, and provide more precise estimates of the benefits and harms of early fluoxetine, to guide its use in patients with stroke and perhaps other older people with comorbidities. These ongoing trials will also establish the external validity of the FOCUS trial in stroke populations with different ethnic groups and health-care backgrounds — for example, with different intensities of physical rehabilitation.

### Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial [^efed0528]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Patients (or their carers or relatives if patients had mental incapacity) provided written informed consent.

We monitored the quality and integrity of the accumulating clinical data according to a protocol agreed with the study sponsors (the Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research and Development [ACCORD] representing the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian), which involved central statistical monitoring, supplemented by onsite monitoring and detailed source data verification in the coordinating centre and triggered visits when patterns in the data at a centre seemed anomalous. All FOCUS monitoring procedures were compliant with requirements of the study sponsors, the ethics committee and regulatory agencies, and they met all appropriate regulatory and good clinical practice requirements. All baseline data, inpatient data, and 6-month and 12-month outcome data were subject to verification checks built into the randomisation and data management system.

During recruitment, interim analyses of baseline and follow-up data were supplied, in strict confidence at least once every year, to the chairman of the data monitoring committee. In light of these analyses, the data monitoring committee advised the chairman of the trial steering committee whether, in their view, the randomised comparisons provided "proof beyond reasonable doubt" that for all, or some, patients the treatment was clearly indicated or contraindicated, and evidence that might reasonably be expected to materially influence future patient management.

The protocol was approved by the Scotland A Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (Dec 21, 2011). The study was jointly sponsored by the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian. The full protocol is available in the appendix.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^622f2882]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is the major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression. Recently, small trials have demonstrated that SSRIs might improve recovery after stroke, even in people who are not depressed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are the least biased way to bring together data from several trials. Given the promising effect of SSRIs on stroke recovery seen in small trials, a systematic review and meta-analysis is needed.

Objectives

To determine whether SSRIs improve recovery after stroke, and whether treatment with SSRIs was associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2011), Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Register (November 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1948 to August 2011), EMBASE (from 1980 to August 2011), CINAHL (from 1982 to August 2011), AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (from 1985 to August 2011), PsycINFO (from 1967 to August 2011) and PsycBITE (Pyschological Database for Brain Impairment Treatment Efficacy) (March 2012). To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registers, pharmaceutical websites, reference lists, contacted experts and performed citation tracking of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that recruited stroke survivors (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. In order to be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (dependence and disability) or secondary (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early) outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. For trials in English, two review authors independently extracted data. For Chinese papers, one review author extracted data. We used standardised mean differences (SMD) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We identified 56 completed trials of SSRI versus control, of which 52 trials (4059 participants) provided data for meta-analysis. There were statistically significant benefits of SSRI on both of the primary outcomes: RR for reducing dependency at the end of treatment was 0.81 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.97) based on one trial, and for disability score, the SMD was 0.91 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.22) (22 trials involving 1343 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 87%; P < 0.0001). For neurological deficit, depression and anxiety, there were statistically significant benefits of SSRIs. For neurological deficit score, the SMD was -1.00 (95% CI -1.26 to -0.75) (29 trials involving 2011 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 86%; P < 0.00001). For dichotomous depression scores, the RR was 0.43 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.77) (eight trials involving 771 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 77%; P < 0.0001). For continuous depression scores, the SMD was -1.91 (95% CI -2.34 to -1.48) (39 trials involving 2728 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 95%; P < 0.00001). For anxiety, the SMD was -0.77 (95% CI -1.52 to -0.02) (eight trials involving 413 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 92%; P < 0.00001). There was no statistically significant benefit of SSRI on cognition, death, motor deficits and leaving the trial early. For cognition, the SMD was 0.32 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.86), (seven trials involving 425 participants) with high heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 86%; P < 0.00001). The RR for death was 0.76 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.70) (46 trials involving 3344 participants) with no heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 0%; P = 0.85). For motor deficits, the SMD was -0.33 (95% CI -1.22 to 0.56) (two trials involving 145 participants). The RR for leaving the trial early was 1.02 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.21) in favour of control, with no heterogeneity between trials. There was a non-significant excess of seizures (RR 2.67; 95% CI 0.61 to 11.63) (seven trials involving 444 participants), a non-significant excess of gastrointestinal side effects (RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.94 to 3.85) (14 trials involving 902 participants) and a non-significant excess of bleeding (RR 1.63; 95% CI 0.20 to 13.05) (two trials involving 249 participants) in those allocated SSRIs. Data were not available on quality of life, fatigue or healthcare costs. There was no clear evidence from subgroup analyses that one SSRI was consistently superior to another, or that time since stroke or depression at baseline had a major influence on effect sizes. Sensitivity analyses suggested that effect sizes were smaller when we excluded trials at high or unclear risk of bias. Only eight trials provided data on outcomes after treatment had been completed; the effect sizes were generally in favour of SSRIs but CIs were wide.

Authors' Conclusions

SSRIs appeared to improve dependence, disability, neurological impairment, anxiety and depression after stroke, but there was heterogeneity between trials and methodological limitations in a substantial proportion of the trials. Large, well-designed trials are now needed to determine whether SSRIs should be given routinely to patients with stroke.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^143af1cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The AFFINITY (Assessment of Fluoxetine in Stroke Recovery) trial found no benefit from 6 months of daily treatment with 20 mg of oral fluoxetine in reducing disability (measured by mRS at 6 months). This article is a secondary post hoc cohort level analysis of the AFFINITY trial data with repeated measures of mRS at baseline (day 1) and days 28, 90, 180, and 365. Our aims are 2‐fold: (1) to identify baseline demographic and clinical associations with functional recovery (reduction in mRS score) over 12 months after the index stroke and use the statistical power of multiple measurements to compare findings of repeated‐measures and single‐measure analysis; and (2) to descriptively analyze the functional recovery of participants over 12 months. While recovery mostly occurs in the first 3 months, the literature is limited in reporting 12‐month follow‐up, which should capture most long‐term stroke‐related disability. Our results may provide stakeholders with prognostic information, guide future stroke trial analyses, and identify associations for validation in future studies to develop a clinical model for predicting stroke recovery.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^4d7770e7]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association 2022 intracerebral hemorrhage guideline — poststroke depression/anxiety management: Poststroke depression is clinically important, with suicide risk "twice as high in the first 2 years after stroke compared with the general population". Patients with poststroke depression and anxiety "should be referred to a mental health professional for consideration of psychotherapy or talking-based therapy", and "Psychotherapy also significantly reduces poststroke anxiety". The guideline notes that "Pharmacological therapy is beneficial in reducing poststroke depression and anxiety prevalence and symptoms". Regarding specific timing data, "Three randomized trials evaluating fluoxetine for motor recovery after stroke showed reductions in poststroke depression when fluoxetine was started 2 to 15 days after ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke". In addition, "transcranial magnetic stimulation also reduces symptoms of poststroke depression".

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c703eabf]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) — rehabilitation and recovery recommendations state that multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including regular team meetings and discharge planning, should be performed to improve functional outcome and reduce morbidity and mortality. In patients with mild to moderate severity, early supported discharge is beneficial to increase the likelihood of patients living at home at 3 months. In patients with moderate severity, early rehabilitation beginning 24 to 48 hours after onset (including ADL training, stretching, functional task training) may be considered to improve functional outcome and reduce mortality. In patients without depression, fluoxetine therapy is not effective to enhance poststroke functional status. In patients with ICH, very early and intense mobilization within the first 24 hours is associated with lower likelihood of good recovery.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0ec7642b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Every year, about 13.7 million individuals are affected by stroke globally, and about half of the stroke survivors are suffering from disability. Two meta‐analyses estimated that the prevalence of poststroke depression among stroke survivors was 30%. Moreover, these poststroke sequelae were associated with a higher risk for subsequent stroke mortality. Despite the fact that considerable advances have been made in treating the acute form of stroke, there is a constant need to find new and improved methods of treatment. Specifically, those treatments revolve around the long‐term recovery aspect of stroke regardless of eligibility for acute treatments. Many interventions that involve monoaminergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were shown to improve the neurological deficit and disability of patients with stroke.

Several studies evaluated the role of SSRIs in several aspects of stroke recovery. However, the results of these studies were contradictory, with some studies concluding that SSRIs improved poststroke recovery, whereas others indicated that SSRIs did not provide any benefits for patients with stroke. Moreover, 2 Cochrane systematic reviews in 2012 and 2018 showed that SSRIs failed to improve poststroke recovery. However, these reviews highlighted that the included studies had several limitations and heterogeneity. In response to this conclusion, an international collaboration developed a core protocol for 3 trials of fluoxetine for recovery after stroke. The aforementioned Cochrane reviews, conducted before the development of this protocol, did not evaluate the role of SSRIs in treating mental disorders among patients with stroke and did not investigate the efficacy of each drug in the SSRIs family solely. Additionally, several trials were completed since the last Cochrane review in 2018. This necessitates a more updated systematic review and meta‐analysis that accounts for the mentioned issues; hence, we decided to conduct this study to evaluate the role of SSRIs in poststroke recovery.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^a174f093]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression (PSD) — functional outcomes after stroke show adverse associations, with a systematic review of 14 studies with 4498 participants (4 population-based [n = 2800], 5 hospital-based [n = 800], 5 rehabilitation-based [n = 898]) reporting consistent adverse effects and depression associated with poor functional outcomes in 6 of 8 studies (3 of 5 with multivariable analyses). A randomized controlled trial comparing fluoxetine to placebo within 5 to 10 days after stroke showed lower PSD occurrence rates and significant improvement in motor function, and a cohort study found that a lifetime history of depression and active depression affected functional outcome at 3 and 12 months.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^3c26488d]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Stroke rehabilitation — adjunct modalities and pharmacologic agents for mobility: The effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in conjunction with everyday activities for improving mobility, lower extremity strength, and gait speed is uncertain. The effectiveness of rhythmic auditory cueing to improve walking speed and coordination is uncertain. The usefulness of electromyography biofeedback during gait training in patients after stroke is uncertain. Virtual reality may be beneficial for the improvement of gait. The effectiveness of neurophysiological approaches (ie, neurodevelopmental therapy, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) compared with other treatment approaches for motor retraining after an acute stroke has not been established. The effectiveness of water-based exercise for motor recovery after an acute stroke is unclear. The effectiveness of fluoxetine or other SSRIs to enhance motor recovery is not well established. The effectiveness of levodopa to enhance motor recovery is not well established. The use of dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate to facilitate motor recovery is not recommended.

### Interventions for preventing depression after stroke [^2d3a421d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal mood is an important consequence of stroke and may affect recovery and outcome. However, depression and anxiety are often not detected or inadequately treated. This may in part be due to doubts about whether anti-depressant treatments commenced early after the onset of stroke will prevent depression and improve outcome.

Objectives

To determine if pharmaceutical or psychological interventions can prevent the onset of depression, including depressive illness and abnormal mood, and improve physical and psychological outcomes, in patients with stroke.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (June 2003). In addition we searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), CINAHL (1982 to September 2002), PsychINFO (1967 to September 2002), Applied Science and Technology Plus (1986 to September 2002), Arts and Humanities Index (1991 to September 2002), Biological Abstracts (1969 to September 2002), General Science Plus (1994 to September 2002), Science Citation Index (1992 to September 2002), Social Sciences Citation Index (1991 to September 2002), and Sociofile (1974 to September 2002). Reference lists from relevant articles and textbooks were searched, and authors of known studies and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture psychotropic medications were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different types of pharmaceutical agents (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) with placebo, or various forms of psychotherapy against standard care (or attention control), in patients with a recent clinical diagnosis of stroke, where the treatment was undertaken with the explicit intention of preventing depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary analyses focussed on the proportion of patients who met the standard diagnostic criteria for depression applied in the trials at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included depression or mood scores on standard scales, disability or physical function, death, recurrent stroke, and adverse effects.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 1245 participants were included in the review. Data were available for nine trials (11 comparisons) involving different pharmaceutical agents, and three trials of psychotherapy. The time from stroke onset to entry ranged from a few hours to six months, but most patients were recruited within one month of acute stroke. The duration of treatments ranged from two weeks to one year. There was no clear effect of pharmacological therapy on the prevention of depression or on other measures. A significant improvement in mood was evident for psychotherapy, but this treatment effect was small and from a single trial. There was no effect on diagnosed depression.

Reviewers' Conclusions

This review identified a small but significant effect of psychotherapy on improving mood, but no effect of either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy on the prevention of depressive illness, disability, or other outcomes. More evidence is therefore required before any recommendations can be made about the routine use of such treatments to improve recovery after stroke.

### Patterns of antidepressant therapy and clinical outcomes among ischaemic stroke survivors [^fd6a117d]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is a common complication of stroke that is associated with poor functional outcomes and increased mortality. The use of antidepressant medications (ADs) to treat poststroke depression, therefore, holds potential to improve neuropsychiatric outcomes. Beyond the treatment of poststroke depression, ADs have also been hypothesised to improve stroke functional recovery, but without definitive evidence so far from clinical trials. In animal models of stroke, ADs attenuate infarct growth, promote neurogenesis and have neuroprotective effects. Early-stage clinical investigations of acute and chronic stroke patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also shown favourable associations with neuroplasticity and motor recovery. Larger scale clinical trials investigating SSRIs for improving poststroke functional outcomes, including three phase 3 randomised controlled trials of fluoxetine after ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (FOCUS, EFFECTS and AFFINITY), however, showed fluoxetine treatment was associated with increased risk of fractures and no improvement of functional outcomes. The results of these large, randomised controlled trials suggest that SSRI treatment does not significantly improve functional outcomes poststroke. If ADs improve neuropsychiatric outcomes after ischaemic stroke, however, then they may be associated with better discharge and clinical outcomes including lower risk of hospital readmission.

We have previously shown using a local Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) Registry that AD or SSRI use prior to hospitalisation for ischaemic stroke was associated with lower rates of discharge to home despite no difference in admission stroke severity. In this study, we investigated national patterns of AD prescription on discharge and the association between ADs with long-term outcomes at 1-year poststroke.

### European Academy of Neurology and European federation of neurorehabilitation societies guideline on pharmacological support in early motor rehabilitation after acute ischaemic stroke [^f2552e66]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Early pharmacological support for post-stroke neurorehabilitation has seen an abundance of mixed results from clinical trials, leaving practitioners at a loss regarding the best options to improve patient outcomes. The objective of this evidence-based guideline is to support clinical decision-making of healthcare professionals involved in the recovery of stroke survivors.

Methods

This guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase were searched (from database inception to June 2018, inclusive) to identify studies on pharmacological interventions for stroke rehabilitation initiated in the first 7 days (inclusive) after stroke, which were delivered together with neurorehabilitation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on identified interventions to address results from breaking studies (from end of search to February 2020).

Results

Upon manually screening 17,969 unique database entries (of 57,001 original query results), interventions underwent meta-analysis. Cerebrolysin (30 ml/day, intravenous, minimum 10 days) and citalopram (20 mg/day, oral) are recommended for clinical use for early neurorehabilitation after acute ischaemic stroke. The remaining interventions identified by our systematic search are not recommended for clinical use: amphetamine (5, 10 mg/day, oral), citalopram (10 mg/day, oral), dextroamphetamine (10 mg/day, oral), Di-Huang-Yi-Zhi (2 × 18 g/day, oral), fluoxetine (20 mg/day, oral), lithium (2 × 300 mg/day, oral), MLC601(3 × 400 mg/day, oral), phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor PF-03049423 (6 mg/day, oral). No recommendation 'for' or 'against' is provided for selegiline (5 mg/day, oral). Issues with safety and tolerability were identified for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, fluoxetine and lithium.

Conclusions

This guideline provides information for clinicians regarding existing pharmacological support in interventions for neurorecovery after acute ischaemic stroke. Updates to this material will potentially elucidate existing conundrums, improve current recommendations, and hopefully expand therapeutic options for stroke survivors.

### Are they necessary? Preventive therapies for post-stroke depression: a meta-analysis of RCTs [^d07121ec]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

To explore the necessity and feasibility of early anti-depressive therapies in acute stroke patients, we conducted a meta-analysis of currently available randomized control studies (RCTs). Literature search in six databases was done with keywords of cerebrovascular accident, depression and prevention. Only RCTs that met the inclusion criteria were enrolled for further analysis. Twelve eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Prophylactic anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke were shown to reduce the incidence of depression in the patients (RR = = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.43, p < 0.001), improve symptoms of depression (WMD: 5.73, 95% CI: 4.18 to 7.29, p < 0.001), improve motor function (WMD: 12.56, 95%CI: 9.07 to 16.04, p < 0.001) and neurological function (WMD: 1.13, 95%CI: 0.57 to 1.69, p < 0.001). However, anti-depressive therapies showed no effects on mortality (RR = 1.63, 95%CI: 0.55 to 4.85, p = 0.377) and adverse events incidence (RR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.53 to 1.64, p = 0.806). Anti-depressive therapies following acute stroke is effective thus deserves to be advocated.

### Early fluoxetine treatment of post-stroke depression – a three-month double-blind placebo-controlled study with an open-label long-term follow up [^7b7016e1]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Poststroke depression is a frequent psychiatric complication after stroke that may have strong negative impact on rehabilitation therapy and functional recovery. This study was conducted to show the efficacy and safety of early treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine in post-stroke depressed patients.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study was of patients within two weeks after stroke. Moderate to severe depressed patients (determined by Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) > 15, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale) were randomized to receive either 20 mg/d fluoxetine or placebo for 3 months. Beside the psychiatric assessment, patients were evaluated by use of the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS), the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE) and the Barthel-Index (BI). An open-label long-term follow up was done 18 months after the initial assessment.

Results

54 depressed patients of an inpatient population of 242 consecutive stroke patients aged 25 to 85 years entered the trial within the first two weeks post-stroke. 50 patients completed the trial per-protocol. The initial severity of depression was comparable in the two groups (mean baseline HDS score 32.8 in the fluoxetine vs. 30.3 in the placebo group), as were neurological symptom severity and demographic parameters. Significant improvement was seen in both groups within 4 weeks of treatment, whereas no advantages of fluoxetine could be observed at this time. This indicates a high degree of spontaneous recovery during early rehabilitation therapy. BDI scores of patients treated with fluoxetine further decreased until the follow-up at 12 weeks, whereas the scores increased again in the placebo group. This depressive relapse of the placebo patients after the end of most rehabilitation efforts was evident at a long-term follow-up 18 months after inclusion, when patients who had been treated with fluoxetine were significantly less depressed. No side effects of fluoxetine treatment were detected.

Conclusions

The advantages of fluoxetine were obvious at the follow-up 18 months after inclusion, but could not be demonstrated within the first three months of controlled treatment. The multitude of therapeutic efforts that take place in the early phase of rehabilitation might have facilitated spontaneous recovery from depression and might have hindered benefits of antidepressant treatment to become obvious.

### Fluoxetine and fractures after stroke: exploratory analyses from the FOCUS trial [^92056caf]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The FOCUS trial (Fluoxetine or Control Under Supervision) showed that fluoxetine did not improve modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) but increased the risk of fractures. We aimed to describe the fractures, their impact on mRS and factors associated with fracture risk. Methods- A United Kingdom, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients ≥ 18 years with a clinical stroke and persisting deficit assessed 2 to 15 days after onset were eligible. Consenting patients were allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was the mRS at 6 months and secondary outcomes included fractures. Results- Sixty-five of 3127 (2.1%) patients had 67 fractures within 6 months of randomization; 43 assigned fluoxetine and 22 placebo. Fifty-nine (90.8%) had fallen and 26 (40%) had fractured their neck of femur. The effect of fluoxetine on mRS (common odds ratio = 0.951) was not significantly altered by excluding fracture patients (common odds ratio = 0.961). Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that only age > 70 year (hazard ratio = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.13–3.45; P = 0.017), female sex (hazard ratio = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.29–3.51; P = 0.003), and fluoxetine (hazard ratio = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.20–3.34; P = 0.008) were independently associated with fractures. Conclusions- Most fractures resulted from falls. Although many fractures were serious, and likely to impair patients' function, the increased fracture risk did not explain the lack of observed effect of fluoxetine on mRS. Only increasing age, female sex, and fluoxetine were independent predictors of fractures. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.controlled-trials.com. Unique identifier: ISRCTN83290762.

### MAMBO: measuring ambulation, motor, and behavioral outcomes with post-stroke fluoxetine in tanzania: protocol of a phase II clinical trial [^df62b15c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

SSA has a high stroke incidence and post-stroke morbidity. An inexpensive pharmacological treatment for stroke recovery would be beneficial to patients in the region. Fluoxetine, currently on the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List, holds promise as a treatment for motor recovery after ischemic stroke, but its effectiveness is controversial and untested in this context in SSA.

Aim

To determine if fluoxetine 20 mg by mouth daily, given within 14 days of acute ischemic stroke, and taken for 90 days, is well-tolerated and safe with adequate adherence to justify a future randomized, controlled trial of fluoxetine in the United Republic of Tanzania.

Methods

Open-label, phase II clinical trial enrolling up to 120 patients. Participants will be recruited from the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and followed for 90 days. The primary outcomes are: 1) safety, including serum sodium and hepatic enzyme levels; and 2) tolerability, as measured through study case report forms. The secondary outcomes are: 1) change in motor strength, as measured through the Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale; 2) adherence, as measured with electronic pill bottles; and 3) participant depressive symptom burden measured via standard questionnaires.

Conclusions

Expanding the evidence base for fluoxetine for Sub-Saharan African stroke survivors requires testing of its safety, tolerability, and adherence. Compared to prior studies in France and the United Kingdom, the patient characteristics, health infrastructure, and usual care for stroke recovery differ substantially in Tanzania. If fluoxetine reveals favorable endpoints, scale up of its use post-stroke is possible.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^02042b3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

This is the most updated systematic review and meta‐analysis after the implementations of the international collaboration core guidelines in conducting trials for the effect of SSRIs on poststroke recovery. In addition, this is the first review to show that citalopram could improve poststroke recovery. Also, this study was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. However, this study had several limitations. First of all, we only included studies that were published in the English language, which might limit the generalizability of our results. Second, a large proportion of the included studies were low‐moderate‐quality studies. Third, different scales were used by the included trials to measure the same outcome, which reduced the number of the trials in several models. This necessitates well‐conducted placebo‐controlled clinical trials that use standardized tools for assessing poststroke recovery outcomes to assess the safety and the efficacy of SSRIs in promoting poststroke recovery. Fourth, there was high heterogeneity across several outcomes, which might be attributed to different times of starting SSRIs after the stroke, different SSRI doses used by the trials, and different characteristics of patients included in the trials.

### Update on pharmacotherapy for stroke and traumatic brain injury recovery during rehabilitation [^7f33fef8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article evaluates whether specific drugs are able to facilitate motor recovery after stroke or improve the level of consciousness, cognitive, or behavioral symptoms after traumatic brain injury.

Recent Findings

After stroke, serotonin reuptake inhibitors can enhance restitution of motor functions in depressed as well as in nondepressed patients. Erythropoietin and progesterone administered within hours after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury failed to improve the outcome. A single dose of zolpidem can transiently improve the level of consciousness in patients with vegetative state or minimally conscious state.

Summary

Because of the lack of large randomized controlled trials, evidence is still limited. Currently, most convincing evidence exists for fluoxetine for facilitation of motor recovery early after stroke and for amantadine for acceleration of functional recovery after severe traumatic brain injury. Methylphenidate and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors might enhance cognitive functions after traumatic brain injury. Sufficiently powered studies and the identification of predictors of beneficial drug effects are still needed.

Post-stroke depression — evidence summary for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) therapy: Li, L. et al. (2020) found that paroxetine was superior to "routine treatment" at 4-week and 12-week follow-up in 98 patients (2 RCTs) with post-stroke depression as measured by the HAM-D, with 4-week follow-up MD: -7.64; 95% CI: -10.05 – -5.23; p < 0.0001 and 12-week follow-up MD: -9.79; 95% CI: -16.94 – -2.64; p = 0.007. Feng et al. (2022) found that escitalopram (mostly dosed at 5–10 mg per day) was superior to placebo at 1- to 12-month follow-up in 612 patients (7 RCTs) with or without depression at baseline as measured by the HAM-D and other measures at the end of treatment (SMD: -1.25; 95% CI: -1.82– -0.68; p < 0.001). Findings did not differ by depression status at baseline. Li, X. et al. (2020) performed an NMA of 15 RCTs with 5,547 patients with post-stroke depression measuring mean change in total HAM-D score after multiple antidepressants, and extensive analyses comparing SSRIs and SNRIs to placebo revealed that SSRIs and SNRIs consistently outperformed placebo at 4-week follow-up, 8-week follow-up, and end of treatment, with the mean change in HAM-D score consistently meeting the MCID for all analyses except for paroxetine at 4 weeks. These ADs included tricyclic ADs, which are not recommended for treatment of depression in the 2022 VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder because of their side effect profile, and the SR data should be interpreted with caution because of missing key information such as time since stroke and past AD treatment; multiple studies did not explicitly delineate whether patients were diagnosed with depression at baseline or merely exhibited depressive symptoms. The potential benefits of SSRIs and SNRIs and the risks of untreated depression must be balanced with the potential harms, and common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nausea, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and reduced sexual desire or function.

### Risk of fractures in stroke patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0b0c72b0]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Stroke survivors have an increased risk of depression and bone fractures. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with an increased risk of fractures in observational studies. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the effect of SSRIs on the risk of fractures in stroke survivors have been published recently but have not been subject to a meta-analysis. We aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with the use of SSRIs, and the risk of falls, seizures, and recurrent strokes as possible mediators of fractures, in stroke survivors.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of SSRIs in stroke survivors according to a protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020192632). Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Ovid Medline/PubMed bibliographic databases, clinical trial registers, and grey literature sources were searched. RCTs of SSRIs versus placebo or no intervention that report the risk of fractures in adult survivors of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke were included. Two reviewers independently screened search results and extracted data. Meta-analyses were conducted for each outcome using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects models.

Results

The searches yielded 683 records, of which 4 RCTs of 6 months duration with a total of 6549 participants were included in the meta-analysis: 3 studies of fluoxetine and 1 study of citalopram. Treatment with an SSRI for 6 months increased the risk of fractures with a risk ratio of 2.36 (95% CI, 1.64–3.39) compared with placebo. The risk of falls, seizures, and recurrent stroke was not statistically significantly increased. Only studies of fluoxetine and citalopram were available for inclusion in the review, and hence the generalizability of the findings to other SSRIs is uncertain.

Conclusions

Based on available RCTs of fluoxetine and citalopram, SSRIs used for 6 months doubled the risk of fractures in stroke survivors.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2eef65fc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

On the safety of SSRIs among patients after stroke, our study demonstrated that SSRIs were significantly associated with higher risk of seizures compared with a placebo. However, this finding can be confounded by many variables including the low sodium and serotonin levels, which were both described in patients after stroke, and can induce seizures. It is important to mention that none of the included studies accounted for the serotonin or sodium level among their patients before starting the intervention. Furthermore, several observational studies and open‐label trials showed that SSRIs were not associated with seizures, and in contrast, they were associated with reduction in seizure frequency and duration among patients with epilepsy.

We conducted a subanalysis to investigate the effect of different SSRI agents on poststroke recovery. Similar to the primary analysis, the subanalysis results showed that citalopram was significantly associated with improving the poststroke recovery of depression, cognitive function, and motor function. However, fluoxetine was only effective in treating poststroke depression. This indicates that the beneficial effects of SSRIs on poststroke recovery that we found in the primary analysis were driven by citalopram not fluoxetine. Similar to our findings, several studies showed that citalopram had higher efficacy and tolerability compared with fluoxetine in treating depression among adults. These differences in the efficacy between fluoxetine and citalopram can be explained by the fact that fluoxetine has an extremely long half‐life compared with citalopram; hence, a much longer duration is required with fluoxetine to reach a steady state concentration and exert its action. Also, it was shown that fluoxetine has active metabolites resulting in prolongation of the SSRIs' side effects compared with citalopram.

Accordingly, "In patients with ICH, SSRIs should therefore be reserved for patients with moderate to severe depression to balance the importance of treating depression with the risk of increased hemorrhage".

### Is left stroke a risk-factor for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant treatment resistance? [^9680af1c]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to detect changes of depression and cognitive level associated with right and left brain damage during SSRI treatment in subjects with post-stroke Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). After the baseline evaluation, the 45 patients included received a single oral dose of 20–40 mg of fluoxetine or 50–100 mg of sertraline. At day 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 a psychometric test battery comprising the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered. In the whole group repeated measures ANOVAs revealed a highly significant (p < 0.0001) time effect for HDRS and MMSE scores. However, depression improved much more in right stroke subjects in comparison with left stroke subjects (p < 0.001 for the HDRS by laterality interaction). Moreover, there is a suggestion of a possible selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) efficacy in cognitive impairment associated to post-stroke MDD but in treatment-responders only. At the endpoint, chi-square analysis showed that there was a different prevalence rate of MDD between left (n = 10; 50%) and right (n = 4; 16%) stroke patients, whereas the prevalence rate of Minor Depression was identical (25%). The SSRIs fluoxetine and sertraline could be efficacious treatments for post-stroke MDD but these findings suggest that left stroke could be a predictor of treatment resistance.

Poststroke cognitive impairment — pharmacologic trials report limited and mixed evidence: Several medications are used to treat general cognitive disorders, but little literature addresses their use for poststroke cognitive deficits. Ten right-hemispheric stroke survivors were randomized to receive either 5 mg donepezil or placebo, and the donepezil group demonstrated significant improvements on the Mini-Mental Status Examination 1 month after completion of treatment. A pilot study randomized 50 subjects to receive either rivastigmine or placebo; those receiving rivastigmine showed statistically significant improvement on the animal subtask of the verbal fluency measure (1.70 versus 0.13; P = 0.02), with a nonsignificant trend toward improvement on the Color Trails II test. A study of 47 subjects at least 6 months after stroke were randomized to receive fluoxetine, nortriptyline, or placebo; the placebo group exhibited deterioration in executive functioning 21 months after treatment, whereas the fluoxetine and nortriptyline groups significantly improved (F = 12.1 df = 1, 45; P = 0.001).

Treatment duration ranged from 4–52 weeks, benefits might not be demonstrated at 4 weeks because the full effect of ADs can take 4–8 weeks, and there were no follow-up studies to examine sustainability. The recommendation is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low and, given potential risks that slightly outweigh benefits, the guideline states we do not recommend the universal, routine use of ADs for the prevention of post-stroke depression and We suggest against the use of antidepressants for the prevention of post-stroke depression.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c05315bb]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression — medication evidence notes that poststroke depression is treatable with a variety of antidepressant medications, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants being the most widely studied, and treatment with heterocyclic antidepressant medications and SSRIs appears to be a viable option although absolute or relative efficacy has yet to be fully established. In 1 study of 870 veterans with poststroke depression, poststroke SSRI treatment was associated with longer survival, and the authors concluded that after a stroke, SSRI initiation or resumption of treatment should be considered as part of a medication therapy management service, especially if the patient has a history of depression or was taking an SSRI before the stroke. A 2008 Cochrane review analyzing data for 13 pharmaceutical agents, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, found some benefit of pharmacotherapy in terms of a complete remission of depression and improvement in scores on depression rating scales, but there was also an associated increase in adverse events. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no studies on the effectiveness of a combined drug intervention and rehabilitation intervention on recovery outcomes after stroke.

### Interventions for post-stroke fatigue [^071e3e9f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue after stroke is common and distressing to patients. The best way to treat this fatigue is uncertain. Theoretically, several different interventions may be of benefit.

Objectives

To determine whether any treatment for fatigue after stroke reduces the proportion of patients with fatigue, or fatigue severity, or both, and to determine the effect of treatment on health-related quality of life, disability, dependency and death, and whether such treatments are cost effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), CINAHL (1982 to February 2008), AMED (1985 to February 2008), PsycINFO (1967 to February 2008), Digital Dissertations (1861 to March 2008), PsycBITE (searched March 2008), PEDro (searched March 2008), and British Nursing Index (1985 to March 2008). We also searched four trials registries, scanned reference lists, performed citation tracking of included trials, and contacted experts.

Selection Criteria

The review author who performed the searches scrutinised all titles and abstracts, excluded irrelevant references, and obtained references for potentially relevant studies. A second review author independently scrutinised potentially relevant studies to determine whether they fulfilled inclusion criteria. We included randomised controlled trials of any intervention in patients with stroke where fatigue was a primary or secondary endpoint.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two review authors who scrutinised references independently extracted data. We performed a narrative review; we had intended to perform a meta-analysis but this was not possible as the interventions were too diverse for data to be combined.

Main Results

We identified three trials. One randomised 83 patients with emotional disturbance after stroke to fluoxetine or placebo. After correcting for differences in fatigue severity at baseline, there was no significant difference in fatigue between groups at follow up. The second trial randomised 31 women with subarachnoid haemorrhage to tirilazad or placebo, of whom 18 were available for follow up. There was no difference in fatigue between the two groups. The third trial investigated a chronic disease self-management programme in 1150 patients with chronic diseases, of whom 125 had had a stroke. There was no difference in fatigue at follow up between the treatment and control in the subgroup with stroke.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence available to guide the management of fatigue after stroke. Further trials are required.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f7daed25]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several studies investigated the role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in improving poststroke recovery; thus, we have decided to conduct this systematic review and meta‐analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of SSRIs in poststroke recovery.

Methods and Results

In this meta‐analysis we searched the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The studies were included if they were placebo‐controlled trials in design and reported SSRIs' effects on poststroke depression, anxiety, disability, dependence, motor abilities, and cognitive functions. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials. The search yielded 44 articles that included 16 164 patients, and about half of the participants were treated with SSRIs. Our results showed that SSRIs had a significant effect on preventing depression (weighted mean difference [WMD], −7.05 [95% CI, −11.78 to −2.31]), treating depression according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (WMD, −1.45 [95% CI, −2.77 to −0.14]), anxiety (relative risk, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.09–0.61]), dependence (WMD, 8.86 [95% CI, 1.23–16.48]), motor abilities according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (WMD, −0.79 [95% CI, −1.42 to −0.15]), and cognitive functions (WMD, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.12–1.89]). On the other hand, no significant effect of SSRIs on disability was observed. Additionally, we found that treating with SSRIs increased the risk of seizures (relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.13–1.83]), whereas there was no difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding between SSRIs and a placebo.

Conclusions

Our study showed that SSRIs are effective in preventing and treating depression, and improving anxiety, motor function, cognitive function, and dependence in patients after stroke. These benefits were only reproducible with the citalopram subanalysis but not fluoxetine. Further well‐conducted placebo‐controlled trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of citalopram among patients after stroke.

### Novel synaptic plasticity enhancer drug to augment functional recovery with rehabilitation [^ad454bdb]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Classical targets of small compounds to enhance rehabilitation effect

The effect of small compounds on motor function recovery after stroke has been investigated in animal models and clinical trials. There are numerous amounts of studies focusing on adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic systems to modify neural plasticity and to play crucial roles in motor learning. As amphetamine increases the extracellular concentration of catecholamines by blocking their reuptake, modulation of catecholamines was hypothesized to enhance motor function recovery. Although some studies exhibited evidence of facilitative effects of amphetamine on motor function recovery after brain damage with rodents and cats, augmentation of rehabilitation with amphetamine has been limited in nonhuman primates and is inconsistent in humans.

The effect of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a precursor of dopamine, on motor function recovery has also been examined. Based on an in-vivo microdialysis study in rat frontal cortex which showed increases in noradrenaline after systemic administration of L-DOPA, L-DOPA was proposed to increase noradrenaline in synapses and possess the efficacy on motor function recovery without systemic side-effects. However, improvement of motor function recovery with L-DOPA has not been reported in animal models. Despite the lack of biological evidence, L-DOPA was tested in human patients which exhibited inconsistent results.

Serotonin is also expected to be a potential target for pharmacological rehabilitation. It is widely recognized that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work as antidepressants. Serotonin was reported to mediate synaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors during cortical reorganization after visual loss in rodents, suggesting the potential of serotonergic system as a plasticity modulator. In the fluoxetine (an SSRI) in motor recovery of patients with acute ischemic stroke (FLAME) trial, which was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, chronic administration of fluoxetine after stroke enhanced motor recovery. However, in the fluoxetine or control under supervision trial, which was a pragmatic, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind randomized-controlled trial, oral administration of 20 mg fluoxetine administration did not alter the modified Rankin Scale at 6 months after stroke the onset of stroke as compared with placebo.

### Mortality and poststroke depression: a placebo-controlled trial of antidepressants [^8278f600]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Poststroke depression has been shown to increase mortality for more than 5 years after the stroke. The authors assessed whether antidepressant treatment would reduce poststroke mortality over 9 years of follow-up.

Method

A total of 104 patients were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week double-blind course of nortriptyline, fluoxetine, or placebo early in the recovery period after a stroke. Mortality data were obtained for all 104 patients 9 years after initiation of the study. Demographic and clinical measurements were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after the stroke. Survival data were analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

Of the 104 patients, 50 (48.1%) had died by the time of the 9-year follow-up. Of 53 patients who were given full-dose antidepressants, 36 (67.9%) were alive at follow-up, compared with only 10 (35.7%) of 28 placebo-treated patients, a significant difference. Logistic regression analysis showed that the beneficial effect of antidepressants remained significant both in patients who were depressed and in those who were nondepressed at enrollment, after the effects of other factors associated with mortality (i.e., age, coexisting diabetes mellitus, and chronic relapsing depression) were controlled. There were no intergroup differences in severity of stroke, impairment in cognitive functioning and activities of daily living impairment, and other medications received.

Conclusions

Treatment with fluoxetine or nortriptyline for 12 weeks during the first 6 months poststroke significantly increased the survival of both depressed and nondepressed patients. This finding suggests that the pathophysiological processes determining the increased mortality risk associated with poststroke depression last longer than the depression itself and can be modified by antidepressants.

Results

Search Results

Our search yielded 1629 articles, and of them 350 were duplicates. The remaining 1279 articles were screened using the title and abstract, of which 1047 articles were excluded for having a nonexperimental design, using a different intervention, or assessing a different population. The 232 remaining articles were tested against the inclusion criteria using the full‐text form. Of them, 188 articles were excluded because they were non–placebo‐controlled trials or no data about the outcomes of interest, including studies, investigated the effect of SSRIs on pathological crying, muscle strength measurements, visual improvements, and brain activity using imaging such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, 44 articles were included in the quantitative and qualitative data synthesis. The detailed study selection process is described in Figure 1.

PRISMA indicates Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses. CENTRAL, Cochrane.

General Characteristics

The total number of the included patients was 16 164 patients from 44 studies. Of them, 50.5% were treated using SSRIs (8137/16 164), whereas 49.5% were treated using a placebo (8027/16 164). The majority of the studies were conducted in Asia and Europe. The most common comorbidities included in the studies were diabetes and hypertension; 50.0% and 43.2%, respectively, of the included articles included patients with these comorbidities. Furthermore, the most common outcome assessed by the included studies was the efficacy of SSRIs in treating depression; 47.7% of the included articles evaluated this outcome. This was followed by dependence and disability; 38.6% of the included studies evaluated each of these outcomes. Depression and anxiety were most commonly assessed using the HAM‐D and Hamilton Anxiety Scale, respectively. In addition, the majority of the studies used the MMSE, NIHSS, and Barthel Index in assessing cognitive deficit, motor function, and dependence, respectively. Most of the studies assessed disability as a binary variable. Moreover, 58.8% of the included studies evaluated the efficacy of fluoxetine, whereas 38.6% of them evaluated citalopram. The summary of the characteristics of the included studies are described in the Table.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f75751a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Several studies investigated the role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in improving poststroke recovery; thus, we have decided to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of SSRIs in poststroke recovery. Methods and Results In this meta-analysis we searched the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The studies were included if they were placebo-controlled trials in design and reported SSRIs' effects on poststroke depression, anxiety, disability, dependence, motor abilities, and cognitive functions. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The search yielded 44 articles that included 16 164 patients, and about half of the participants were treated with SSRIs. Our results showed that SSRIs had a significant effect on preventing depression (weighted mean difference [WMD], -7.05 [95% CI, -11.78 to -2.31]), treating depression according to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (WMD, -1.45 [95% CI, -2.77 to -0.14]), anxiety (relative risk, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.09–0.61]), dependence (WMD, 8.86 [95% CI, 1.23–16.48]), motor abilities according to National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (WMD, -0.79 [95% CI, -1.42 to -0.15]), and cognitive functions (WMD, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.12–1.89]). On the other hand, no significant effect of SSRIs on disability was observed. Additionally, we found that treating with SSRIs increased the risk of seizures (relative risk, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.13–1.83]), whereas there was no difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms or bleeding between SSRIs and a placebo. Conclusions Our study showed that SSRIs are effective in preventing and treating depression, and improving anxiety, motor function, cognitive function, and dependence in patients after stroke. These benefits were only reproducible with the citalopram subanalysis but not fluoxetine. Further well-conducted placebo-controlled trials are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of citalopram among patients after stroke.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^06d67a85]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Poststroke depression prevention — escitalopram, placebo, and problem-solving therapy: A multisite prevention trial included pharmacological and psychosocial treatment for 176 nondrepressed stroke survivors enrolled within 3 months of stroke and randomized to 1 year of treatment with escitalopram (n = 59), placebo (n = 58), or problem-solving therapy (n = 59). Those taking placebo were more likely to report clinical depression (HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.4–8.2) than those who participated in the problem-solving treatment (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4–3.5) and than those taking escitalopram; after discontinuation at 1 year, 4 in the escitalopram group developed new major depression symptoms, whereas no one in the placebo or problem-solving groups did.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^7454c066]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Function after acute stroke using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is usually assessed at a point in time. The analytical implications of serial mRS measurements to evaluate functional recovery over time is not completely understood. We compare repeated‐measures and single‐measure analyses of the mRS from a randomized clinical trial.

Methods and Results

Serial mRS data from AFFINITY (Assessment of Fluoxetine in Stroke Recovery), a double‐blind placebo randomized clinical trial of fluoxetine following stroke (n = 1280) were analyzed to identify demographic and clinical associations with functional recovery (reduction in mRS) over 12 months. Associations were identified using single‐measure (day 365) and repeated‐measures (days 28, 90, 180, and 365) partial proportional odds logistic regression. Ninety‐five percent of participants experienced a reduction in mRS after 12 months. Functional recovery was associated with age at stroke < 70 years; no prestroke history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or ischemic stroke; prestroke history of depression, a relationship partner, living with others, independence, or paid employment; no fluoxetine intervention; ischemic stroke (compared with hemorrhagic); stroke treatment in Vietnam (compared with Australia or New Zealand); longer time since current stroke; and lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale & Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 scores. Direction of associations was largely concordant between single‐measure and repeated‐measures models. Association strength and variance was generally smaller in the repeated‐measures model compared with the single‐measure model.

Conclusions

Repeated‐measures may improve trial precision in identifying trial associations and effects. Further repeated‐measures stroke analyses are required to prove methodological value.

### Treatment effects of antidepressants in patients with post-stroke depression: a meta-analysis [^bce2327c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD) is critically important, considering the negative impact of PSD. Data regarding the treatment efficacy of antidepressants in patients with PSD are conflicting, and the time-dependent effects of antidepressant treatment in this population are unknown.

Objective

To systematically assess treatment effects of antidepressants in patients with PSD, incorporating data from recent studies.

Methods

A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in patients with PSD was conducted, using published studies from 1984 to 2006. Outcome measures of antidepressant treatment included response rate, depression rating scale scores, recovery of neurologic impairments, and improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) after stroke. The effect size was presented as rate difference (RD) and weighted mean difference for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. Pooled effect sizes were calculated by both fixed-effects and random-effects models.

Results

A total of 1320 patients who met inclusion criteria were identified from 16 RCTs. The pooled response rates in the active and placebo groups were 65.18% (234/359) and 44.37% (138/311), respectively. The pooled RD was 0.23 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.43), indicating a significantly higher response rate in the active group compared with the placebo group. From baseline to endpoint, patients in the active group had significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms compared with patients in the placebo group. Longer duration of treatment was positively correlated with the degree of improvement in depressive symptoms (Spearman's correlation, [rho] = -0.93, p = 0.001). No consistent evidence was found for positive antidepressant effects on the recovery of neurologic impairments and improvements in ADLs.

Conclusions

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that use of antidepressants among patients with a diagnosis of PSD is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms. Longer durations of antidepressant treatment may be associated with greater reductions in depressive symptoms.

### Safety and efficacy of SSRIs in improving poststroke recovery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^966fa5d1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Motor Function

The model that evaluated the efficacy of SSRIs in improving motor function according to the NIHSS score included 11 articles. ‡ This model showed insignificant difference in NIHSS scores between the SSRI group and the placebo group at baseline; this model had insignificant heterogeneity (Figure S5; P = 0.87, I² = 0%). At the end of treatment, the model showed significantly higher motor functions among the SSRI group (lower NIHSS score) compared with the placebo group (Figure S5; WMD, −0.79 [95% CI, −1.42 to −0.15]). This model had significant heterogeneity (Figure S5; P = 0.00, I² = 97%). Moreover, the model that assessed the efficacy of SSRIs in improving motor functions according to the Fugl‐Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery score included 5 studies. This model showed insignificant difference between the SSRI group and the placebo group at baseline. This model showed insignificant heterogeneity (Figure S6; P = 0.72, I² = 0%). However, at the end of the treatment, the model showed significantly higher motor functions (higher Fugl‐Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery scores) among the SSRI group compared with the placebo group (Figure S6; WMD, 14.67 [95% CI, 3.64–25.69]). This model showed significant heterogeneity (Figure S6; P = 0.00, I² = 81%). In addition, the model that assessed the efficacy of SSRIs in improving motor function as a binary variable showed insignificant difference between the SSRI group and the placebo group,(Figure S7; RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.97–1.03]). This model showed significant heterogeneity (Figure S7; P = 0.01, I² = 77%). Furthermore, Pinto et al showed that fluoxetine was significantly associated with better motor functions provided by the Jebsen Hand Function Test tool.

### Patterns of antidepressant therapy and clinical outcomes among ischaemic stroke survivors [^58f0bbe0]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

All data and materials used for this analysis are available from the GWTG-Stroke Registry. Data collection and case ascertainment from the national GWTG-Stroke Registry have been described previously. In brief, all patients aged 65 or older enrolled in a fully participating GWTG-Stroke hospital with a final clinical diagnosis of ischaemic stroke, discharged between April and December 2014, and linked to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services inpatient data were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Patients were excluded from this analysis if they met any of the following criteria: (1) fee for service ineligible at discharge; (2) discharged to hospice or left against medical advice; (3) in-hospital death; (4) discharge AD not documented and (5) any contraindications to AD use (figure 1).

Figure 1

Variables of interest

AD and SSRI use were classified from medication reconciliation data review of preadmission and hospital discharge medications. Patients were assigned to the AD group if they were taking any ADs regardless of the indication. SSRI use was defined if any of following medications were noted: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. All other AD therapy was defined as non-SSRI ADs. AD and SSRI naïve patients were defined as those with no AD or SSRI on preadmission medication list and new AD or SSRI on hospital discharge.

Patient demographics and socioeconomic measures, including age, sex, race and insurance status, were recorded (see online supplemental materials for details). Medical history was obtained from medical records including depression, prior ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), diabetes, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, tobacco use and peripheral vascular disease. On presentation, details of stroke severity (National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), ambulatory status, emergency medical services transport, time of arrival, time from ischaemic stroke onset to arrival and prior AD use were recorded. The variables recorded on discharge included ambulatory status, discharge disposition and discharge medications. Most variables were missing in less than 3% of patients, except for the following: NIHSS (14.8%), ambulatory status at admission (25.5%) and ambulatory status at discharge (3.4%). See online supplemental table S1 for details of how missing data were handled for each variable.
