## Question

Chest pain, dyspnea, ecg with no changes what are the differentials

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the differentials are for chest pain and dyspnea when the initial ECG shows no ischemic changes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the ECG strategy, including serial ECGs and posterior leads. Next, I will review biomarkers and how to interpret them. After that, I need to consider life-threatening cardiac and noncardiac causes that can present with a nondiagnostic ECG. Then, I will examine noncardiac differentials systematically. Finally, I should integrate risk stratification, testing pathways, and special populations, and close with documentation and disposition planning.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and vital signs, because I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and adequate oxygenation before anything else; unstable patients require emergent resuscitation and early involvement of cardiology, critical care, and surgery as indicated, and I should not anchor on a normal ECG if the patient is unstable [^115Wf5GB] [^115ibqEV].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG strategy before concluding "no ischemia". A single normal or nondiagnostic ECG does not exclude ACS, and up to about 6% of patients with evolving ACS may be discharged with a normal ECG, so I should obtain serial ECGs if symptoms persist or evolve, and consider posterior leads V7–V9 if posterior ischemia is suspected; Wellens' pattern in V2–V3 implies critical LAD stenosis even without ST elevation, so I must not miss it [^115ibqEV] [^1138NxxB] [^112oLt2d] [^1141ABUx].

> I need to check biomarkers next. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the preferred standard to detect or exclude myocardial injury; if symptoms began at least 3 hours before arrival and a single hs‑troponin is below the assay's limit of detection, ACS can often be excluded, but I should remember that type 2 MI from supply–demand mismatch can occur with a normal ECG, so dynamic changes in troponin with clinical context remain decisive [^114r7B1D] [^112taSra].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ACS just because the ECG is normal; I should actively consider life-threatening cardiac mimics and noncardiac causes that can present with chest pain and dyspnea and a nondiagnostic ECG, including pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericarditis/myocarditis, pneumothorax, pneumonia, and esophageal rupture, while remembering that some ACS cases, particularly posterior MI or early ischemia, may have minimal or transient ECG changes [^115Wf5GB] [^114PftFF].

> Let me consider pulmonary embolism carefully, since pleuritic pain, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and dyspnea are common but nonspecific; I should use a validated pretest probability tool such as Wells or revised Geneva and then apply D‑dimer or proceed to CTPA based on risk, because PE prevalence in dyspneic patients can be substantial and the ECG may be normal or show only sinus tachycardia or nonspecific ST‑T changes [^111zogSw] [^116C7PxD] [^115qc8pP].

> I will now examine aortic dissection, because abrupt severe chest or back pain with pulse differentials or a widened mediastinum raises concern; however, I should double-check that the sensitivity of pulse deficits is low, so a normal ECG does not reassure me, and urgent CT angiography is indicated when suspicion is moderate to high [^115x8PJk] [^112rAKdm].

> Next, I should review pericarditis and myocarditis, which can present with chest pain and dyspnea and may have nondiagnostic or evolving ECGs; diffuse ST elevation with PR depression favors pericarditis, whereas myocarditis more often shows troponin elevation and may progress to heart failure, so echocardiography and inflammatory markers can help differentiate these entities when the ECG is equivocal [^113kmwjn] [^114VUdnw].

> Let me think about pneumothorax and pneumonia, because unilateral absent breath sounds or pleuritic pain with focal findings shift pretest probability away from ACS; a chest radiograph is appropriate early in the evaluation of acute chest pain to screen for pulmonary and thoracic causes and can rapidly identify these conditions when suspected clinically [^116VGfvx] [^116sYTH1].

> I should confirm that I am not overlooking gastrointestinal etiologies such as esophageal rupture, GERD, or esophageal dysmotility, especially with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, or pain that is positional or meal-related; if cardiac and pulmonary evaluations are unrevealing, targeted GI assessment is reasonable in recurrent chest pain without a physiologic cardiac or pulmonary cause [^113UCVsM] [^117UyZpG].

> But wait, what if the pain is reproducible with palpation or clearly pleuritic and positional; in that case, musculoskeletal causes like costochondritis or rib injury become more likely, and the presence of chest wall tenderness markedly reduces the probability of ACS, though I should still complete appropriate cardiac risk stratification before closing the loop [^115x8PJk] [^1144wiiW].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and testing pathways. For acute presentations, I should apply an ED clinical decision pathway and integrate history, ECG, and hs‑troponin to classify risk; for low-risk patients, urgent cardiac testing is not required, whereas intermediate‑to‑high risk patients benefit from functional or anatomic imaging such as stress echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, CCTA, or invasive angiography depending on pretest probability and local expertise [^112taSra] [^111mSWtY].

> For stable chest pain, let me verify the tiered approach: in low-risk patients with an interpretable ECG, exercise ECG testing can be first-line to assess ischemia and functional capacity, while in intermediate‑to‑high risk patients, stress imaging or CCTA is preferred; shared decision-making about radiation, costs, and downstream implications should be explicit, and I should avoid labeling symptoms as "atypical", instead using "cardiac", "possibly cardiac", or "noncardiac" to guide testing and avoid under-triage [^112aPNhG] [^114b2Tmm] [^111mSWtY].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. Women are at risk for underdiagnosis, so I should actively elicit accompanying symptoms more common in female ACS presentations and maintain a high index of suspicion even when the ECG is nondiagnostic; in pregnancy, physiologic changes complicate evaluation, so I should tailor imaging and use shared decision-making; in COPD exacerbations, I should remember the elevated prevalence of concomitant IHD, AF, and PE and adjust my threshold for troponins and imaging accordingly [^1141VuTm] [^1178xe3B] [^115qc8pP].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and disposition. I must record precise symptom descriptors, risk factors, vitals, exam findings, ECG times and interpretations, troponin values with timing, imaging results, and the rationale for discharge or admission; if discharging, I should provide return precautions and arrange timely follow-up, and if symptoms persist without a physiologic cause after appropriate testing, I should consider noncardiac etiologies and, when appropriate, referral for cognitive behavioral therapy for functional chest pain syndromes [^115Wf5GB] [^113dG3ii].

> In summary, a normal or unchanged ECG in a patient with chest pain and dyspnea is reassuring but insufficient to exclude serious disease; I should repeat ECGs, obtain hs‑troponin with attention to timing and dynamics, apply validated risk tools, and pursue targeted imaging for PE, aortic syndromes, pericarditis/myocarditis, pneumothorax, and pneumonia as indicated, while using structured pathways to decide on functional or anatomic cardiac testing and engaging patients in shared decisions about risks, benefits, and costs [^115ibqEV] [^112taSra] [^111mSWtY].

Chest pain and dyspnea with a normal ECG still require a **broad differential** [^115Wf5GB] and careful risk stratification [^111mSWtY]. The most common noncardiac causes are **pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax, asthma/COPD, and anxiety** [^notfound]; musculoskeletal pain is frequent but benign [^117UyZpG]. Cardiac causes such as unstable angina, NSTEMI, myocarditis, pericarditis, and heart failure can present with normal ECGs, so **serial troponins and ECGs are essential** [^1138NxxB] [^115PLUvA]. Use clinical decision rules (Wells, PERC, HEART) [^111mSWtY] and order chest X-ray, D-dimer, and troponin as indicated [^116VGfvx] [^117TdBEW] [^114r7B1D]. If initial tests are nondiagnostic but suspicion remains, pursue echocardiography, CT angiography, or stress testing [^1132rbwJ] [^113G3N6G] [^114b2Tmm].

---

## Cardiac causes

- **Unstable angina (UA)**: Normal ECG in ~50% of cases; presents with rest or minimal-exertion chest pain and dyspnea [^113MXVPV] [^1136KvSZ].

- **Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**: Normal or nonspecific ECG in ~30%; requires serial high-sensitivity troponins for diagnosis [^113MXVPV] [^1136KvSZ].

- **Myocarditis**: May have normal ECG early; often presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and flu-like symptoms [^113kmwjn] [^114VUdnw].

- **Pericarditis**: Early or mild cases can have normal ECG; typically pleuritic, positional pain [^113kmwjn].

- **Heart failure**: Dyspnea with normal ECG is common; consider BNP/NT-proBNP if heart failure suspected [^116f11oz].

---

## Pulmonary causes

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Normal ECG in ~50%; use Wells or Geneva scores and D-dimer to guide imaging [^1172nwRR] [^111piybs].

- **Pneumonia**: Often normal ECG; look for fever, cough, and focal lung exam findings [^113G3N6G].

- **Pneumothorax**: Sudden pleuritic pain and dyspnea; breath sounds may be normal early [^115x8PJk].

- **Asthma/COPD exacerbation**: Normal ECG is common; wheezing and obstructive pattern on spirometry support diagnosis [^116DHAUM].

---

## Musculoskeletal causes

Musculoskeletal causes include **costochondritis**, with localized, reproducible chest wall tenderness and a normal ECG [^1172nwRR], and **muscle strain or rib fracture**, which typically follow recent trauma or repetitive use and are diagnosed clinically [^117UyZpG].

---

## Gastrointestinal causes

Gastrointestinal causes include **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**, which causes burning retrosternal pain often related to meals and relieved with antacids, and **esophageal spasm or motility disorders**, which present with chest pain and dysphagia and may have a normal ECG [^1172nwRR].

---

## Anxiety and panic disorders

Anxiety and panic disorders commonly present with chest tightness, palpitations, and hyperventilation; the ECG is typically normal [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history and physical exam | All patients [^115Wf5GB] |
| 2 | Chest X-ray | All patients with chest pain and dyspnea [^116VGfvx] |
| 3 | High-sensitivity troponin | Suspected cardiac ischemia [^1136KvSZ] |
| 4 | D-dimer | Suspected PE [^113G3N6G] |
| 5 | Echocardiography | Suspected heart failure, myocarditis, or valvular disease [^111DT1so] |
| 6 | CT pulmonary angiography | Suspected PE or aortic dissection [^113G3N6G] |
| 7 | Stress testing or coronary CT angiography | Intermediate-to-high risk for CAD [^114b2Tmm] |

---

Chest pain and dyspnea with a normal ECG have a **broad differential** [^115UJM2k]; use structured risk assessment and targeted testing to identify serious causes and guide safe disposition [^111mSWtY].

### Diagnosing the cause of chest pain [^117TdBEW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing. Risk of pulmonary embolism can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help determine whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed. Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with chest radiograph. Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis. Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic. Chest pain also may be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^114kpKVi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS, pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease is discussed in this report.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to do not describe chest pain as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Describe chest pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac or noncardiac, as these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

Arrhythmias

The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), is increased in patients with COPD. Furthermore, during an ECOPD, the risk of AF and other arrhythmias doubles, and, importantly, AF during an ECOPD increases morbidity and mortality. AF presence can be ascertained by atypical chest discomfort, palpitations, lightheadedness, and dyspnea, as well as an irregular pulse on palpation. Unlike other morbidities, there is less diagnostic dilemma between AF and ECOPD. Standard ECG and heart monitoring can detect the presence of chronic, acute, or intermittent arrhythmias. The role of new-onset AF as a cause of acute dyspnea in a patient with COPD is still unknown, so the unresolved clinical question is whether AF was a pre-existing or new-onset event. The diagnostic approach to a patient with suspected AF is shown in Figure E2.

PE

The prevalence of PE in patients with ECOPD ranges from 3.3% to 29.4%, being more common in patients with atypical or unexplained ECOPD and requiring specific and prompt management to improve outcomes. PE should be considered in patients with increased dyspnea in the context of risk factors such as a history of venous thromboembolic disease, hospitalization for HF, or malignancy. Although patients with either PE or ECOPD characteristically complain of worsened dyspnea, those with PE commonly report pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and signs of right HF and are less likely to have a cough with increased or purulent sputum.

Two studies have considered practical approaches to evaluating PE frequency in hospitalized patients with ECOPD. The first used the revised Geneva score to assess the pretest clinical probability of PE in 740 patients, whether PE was suspected or not. Patients with a high clinical probability of PE (score of at least 11) proceeded to computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and leg ultrasound. For patients scoring under 11, D-dimer testing was performed, with PE excluded (and no subsequent testing) if the D-dimer value was less than 500 ng/ml. Of 17 patients with high pretest probability, 5 had positive CTPA. In the 442 with low pretest probability and D-dimer of at least 500 μg/L, 36 had a positive CTPA. Importantly, 3-month mortality when PE or deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) was excluded was 5.5%, compared with 27% and 20% in patients with confirmed PE or isolated DVT, respectively.

### Pleuritic chest pain: sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography. Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

Synopsis of noncardiac chest pain — differential diagnosis is broad and includes respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, psychological, and other causes; musculoskeletal causes are the most common and include costochondritis, muscle strain, and consequences of recent or occult chest trauma such as rib fracture; gastrointestinal causes, commonly esophageal, include gastrointestinal reflux, esophageal dysmotility, and gastritis from either medications or peptic ulcer disease; respiratory causes are less frequent but potentially more serious and include PE, pneumonia, and pneumothorax; many patients will have dyspnea in addition to chest pain; psychological causes are usually diagnoses of exclusion but merit consideration in the right context.

IHD

Underlying IHD is associated with more prolonged ECOPDs. Myocardial injury is common and clinically significant during ECOPDs, particularly in patients with pre-existing IHD, and an ECOPD significantly increases the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, not only in the first 30 days after an ECOPD (by 4–10 times) but for up to 1 year after the event. Moreover, one-third of patients with IHD have COPD, which is associated with more frequent emergency room visits, with COPD independently increasing IHD risk and heightening morbidity and mortality.

In outpatients presenting with an ECOPD, a clinical history (established IHD), current symptoms (chest pain/discomfort and/or palpitations), and signs of systemic atherosclerosis (carotid bruit and/or reduced peripheral pulses) or those consistent with acute myocardial ischemia (diaphoresis and/or third heart sound), suggest concomitant IHD. Symptoms plus an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG) support the presence of acute myocardial ischemia. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of myocardial injury or infarction, either as an independent or contributing morbidity of an ECOPD, should follow the fourth universal definition criteria. This requires elevation in blood troponin at admission and/or increase during follow-up, plus at least one other factor (symptoms and/or new ECG changes). COPD can be associated with chronic (usually stable) elevations in troponin concentrations, which can increase during an ECOPD. The diagnostic approach for a patient with suspected IHD is shown in Figure E1 in the online data supplement. No troponin thresholds are quoted because of variability across laboratories and methodology. When the clinical suspicion of IHD is high, a guideline-directed evaluation is generally warranted. Furthermore, given the high prevalence of IHD with ECOPD, evaluation for atherosclerosis and associated diseases should always be considered.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to ECG, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes in patients with chest pain with an initial nondiagnostic ECG, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent or the clinical condition deteriorates.

Defining chest pain — recommendations and terminology — state that "An initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia" (Class of Recommendation [COR] 1, Level of Evidence [LOE] B-NR), and "Chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis" (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

### Acute dyspnea in the office [^116DHAUM]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory difficulty is a common presenting complaint in the outpatient primary care setting. Because patients may first seek care by calling their physician's office, telephone triage plays a role in the early management of dyspnea. Once the patient is in the office, the initial goal of assessment is to determine the severity of the dyspnea with respect to the need for oxygenation and intubation. Unstable patients typically present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, hypoxia, or unstable arrhythmia, and require supplemental oxygen, intravenous access and, possibly, intubation. Subsequent management depends on the differential diagnosis established by a proper history, physical examination, and ancillary studies. Dyspnea is most commonly caused by respiratory and cardiac disorders. Other causes may be upper airway obstruction, metabolic acidosis, a psychogenic disorder, or a neuromuscular condition. Differential diagnoses in children include bronchiolitis, croup, epiglottitis, and foreign body aspiration. Pertinent history findings include cough, sore throat, chest pain, edema, and orthopnea. The physical examination should focus on vital signs and the heart, lungs, neck, and lower extremities. Significant physical signs are fever, rales, wheezing, cyanosis, stridor, or absent breath sounds. Diagnostic work-up includes pulse oximetry, complete blood count, electrocardiography, and chest radiography. If the patient is admitted to the emergency department or hospital, blood gases, ventilation-perfusion scan, D-dimer tests, and spiral computed tomography can help clarify the diagnosis. In a stable patient, management depends on the underlying etiology of the dyspnea.

Electrocardiogram — supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it "should be compared with previous ECGs, if available", and "a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS", so decision‑making "should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG". Masking conditions may occur, and "Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG", therefore "serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing". When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, "management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms", and if ST depression is identified, "management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines". Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is "often 'electrically silent'; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, more specifically with respect to evaluation for ACS (general principles), ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend to consider excluding myocardial injury in patients with acute chest pain, a normal ECG and symptoms suggestive of ACS began at least 3 hours before emergency department arrival, and having a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration below the limit of detection on initial measurement (time zero).

### Role of imaging for acute chest pain syndromes [^113VVfHK]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain suggestive of ischemic cardiac origin, with a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram and negative initial cardiac markers for myocardial necrosis represent a significant diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. Multiple imaging modalities play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and safe discharge of these patients. In this review, we compare the current imaging modalities available for these patients including their diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, and cost effectiveness. Acute rest myocardial perfusion imaging significantly improves the clinical outcome in these patients and reduces the overall cost when incorporated into the decision making pathway. The choice of imaging modality recommended should be based on local institutional expertise and the overall clinical presentation. The imaging modality with high diagnostic accuracy and negative predictive value will provide for precise risk stratification which is important to clinical decision making, including patients who require admission to the hospital and those who can be safely discharged.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

### An adult cystic fibrosis patient presenting with persistent dyspnea: case report [^112McoiX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent dyspnea is a common finding in the cystic fibrosis patient that typically leads to further work up of an alternative pulmonary etiology. Adult cystic fibrosis patients; however, are growing in numbers and they are living into the ages in which coronary artery disease becomes prevalent. Coronary disease should be included in the consideration of diagnostic possibilities.

Case presentation

A 52-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis was evaluated for exertional dyspnea associated with vague chest discomfort. Diagnostic testing revealed normal white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet count, basic metabolic panel, fasting lipid profile, HbA1c, with chest radiograph confirming chronic cystic findings unchanged from prior radiographs and an electrocardiogram that revealed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block. Stress thallium testing demonstrated a reversible anteroseptal perfusion defect with a 55% left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart catheterization found a 99% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery extending into the two diagonal branches, with 100% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery at the trifurcation and 70% lesion affecting the first posterior lateral branch of the circumflex artery.

Conclusion

This case report represents the first description in the medical literature of a cystic fibrosis patient diagnosed with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Applying a standard clinical practice guide proved useful toward evaluating a differential diagnosis for a cystic fibrosis patient presenting with dyspnea and chest discomfort.

Defining chest pain — recommendations (class of recommendation [COR] and level of evidence [LOE]) — include that an initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states that chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature; instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

Electrocardiogram interpretation and repeat testing — supportive points: A normal or unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG, and up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a normal ECG; when the initial ECG is normal or without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and the timing for repeat ECG should be guided by symptoms; when ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms, and if ST depression is identified on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines; a normal ECG may be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions and posterior wall ischemia, therefore right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected; an initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS and patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG if symptoms are ongoing until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS.

### Chest pain with raised troponin, ECG changes but normal coronary arteries [^114kXQxH]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old woman presented to A&E department, with acute onset central chest pain and dyspnoea. ECG showed dynamic T wave changes while 12 h troponin was elevated. A diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome was made and she underwent an inpatient coronary angiogram. Although her coronary arteries were normal, symptoms persisted and D-dimers were found to be elevated. This led to a CT pulmonary angiogram, which ruled out pulmonary embolism, but uncovered a large ascending aortic aneurysm with a contained leak. She was immediately transferred to regional cardiothoracic unit for urgent surgical intervention. This case report illustrates the importance of a good clinical history, physical examination and timely investigations. It also emphasises that not all chest pain events with elevated troponin level are due to acute coronary syndrome and that alternative diagnoses should still be considered.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

### Chronic dyspnea: diagnosis and evaluation [^116zKGr4]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a symptom arising from a complex interplay of diseases and physiologic states and is commonly encountered in primary care. It is considered chronic if present for more than one month. As a symptom, dyspnea is a predictor for all-cause mortality. The likeliest causes of dyspnea are disease states involving the cardiac or pulmonary systems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, pneumonia, and coronary artery disease. A detailed history and physical examination should begin the workup; results should drive testing. Approaching testing in stages beginning with first-line tests, including a complete blood count, basic chemistry panel, electrocardiography, chest radiography, spirometry, and pulse oximetry, is recommended. If no cause is identified, second-line noninvasive testing such as echocardiography, cardiac stress tests, pulmonary function tests, and computed tomography scan of the lungs is suggested. Final options include more invasive tests that should be done in collaboration with specialty help. There are three main treatment and management goals: correctly identify the underlying disease process and treat appropriately, optimize recovery, and improve the dyspnea symptoms. The six-minute walk test can be helpful in measuring the effect of ongoing intervention. Care of patients with chronic dyspnea typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, which makes the primary care physician ideal for management.

Electrocardiogram — actionable recommendations in chest pain: For patients with chest pain and a nondiagnostic initial electrocardiogram (ECG), "serial ECGs to detect potential ischemic changes should be performed, especially when clinical suspicion of ACS is high, symptoms are persistent, or the clinical condition deteriorates". If the initial ECG is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients "should be treated according to STEMI and NSTE-ACS guidelines". For intermediate‑to‑high clinical suspicion with a nondiagnostic initial ECG, "supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 are reasonable to rule out posterior MI".

Evidence gaps and future research in chest pain — Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms for which a person seeks medical care, and it should therefore be the target of substantial research investigation. For acute coronary syndrome (ACS), further research is needed to develop approaches to shorten the interval from symptom onset to presentation, including technologies that permit acquisition and transmission of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from home and remote evaluations (eg, telehealth). An important growing population includes women and men with angina and ACS with angiographically normal or non-obstructive coronary arteries, and further investigation is needed to clarify disease mechanisms. Early evaluation is challenged by symptom classification, and methods that improve pretest probabilities of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) may be aided with machine-learning algorithms. Clinical risk stratification and decision tools will likely grow in popularity due to electronic health record integration, and it would be useful to test them in large randomized trials.

Physical examination findings in patients with chest pain — syndrome-specific clues: Acute coronary syndrome may present with diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, crackles, S3, and an MR murmur, and examination may be normal in uncomplicated cases. Pulmonary embolism can include pain with inspiration. Aortic dissection features severe pain with abrupt onset with pulse differential and a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray. Esophageal rupture may present with emesis, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and unilateral decreased or absent breath sounds. Pericarditis can show fever, pleuritic chest pain increased in the supine position, and a friction rub. Myocarditis may include fever, chest pain, heart failure, and S3. Pneumothorax may present with dyspnea and pain on inspiration with unilateral absence of breath sounds. Costochondritis presents with tenderness of costochondral joints. Herpes zoster presents with pain in a dermatomal distribution, triggered by touch, with a characteristic unilateral dermatomal rash. Chest tenderness on palpation or pain with inspiration markedly reduce the probability of ACS.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Top 10 take-home messages — evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest; pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity troponins are preferred for biomarker diagnosis; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Early care for acute symptoms is stressed; patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

### Differential diagnosis of chest symptoms in the athlete [^111igvRy]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common complaint of athletes in all age groups. In athletes, chest pain is often attributed to "chest tightness", and treatment for bronchospasm is considered. However, the causes of the pain are wide and varied, and the pain is referable to the many organ systems that localize to the thorax. Therefore, when treatment with bronchodilators fails, it becomes important to consider other nonasthmatic causes of the pain. These causes can be organized by system and are explained in this article. Cardiac causes are the most feared and, fortunately, are very rare in the adolescent setting. With a thorough knowledge of etiologies of chest pain, the physician can often make a diagnosis with only a history and a physical exam.

Classification, evaluation, and management of myocardial injury — myocardial injury is defined as any cardiac troponin (cTn) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), and it is acute when there is a dynamic rise and/or fall exceeding assay variation (> 20% relative change) with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile; chronic injury remains elevated but stable on serial measurements. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) requires both acute myocardial injury and evidence of myocardial ischemia, which can be met by the following: symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, new pathological Q waves, new ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities on cardiac imaging, or acute coronary thrombus/erosion on invasive coronary angiography. Five distinct MI subtypes are noted; type 1 MI occurs due to acute plaque disruption, and type 2 MI is due to myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch in the absence of atherothrombosis, with type 2 MI requiring symptoms, ECG changes, new wall motion abnormalities, or coronary angiographic findings to be considered an MI. Table 5 organizes the differential by acute myocardial injury (rising and/or falling cardiac troponin) versus chronic myocardial injury (stable elevation in cardiac troponin) across cardiovascular causes and noncardiovascular causes.

Physical examination — a focused cardiovascular examination should be performed initially in patients presenting with chest pain to aid in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or other potentially serious causes of chest pain (eg, aortic dissection, PE, or esophageal rupture) and to identify complications, and life-threatening causes of chest pain include, but are not limited to, ACS, PE, aortic dissection, and esophageal rupture. Because ST–segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can be recognized on the ECG, the major challenge is to distinguish between non–ST–segment–elevation (NSTE)-ACS and noncardiac chest pain, and with an uncomplicated AMI, the examination may be negative; sudden onset of severe chest pain or back pain associated with limb pulse differential suggest aortic dissection, but sensitivity of the latter finding alone was only 30%.

Pericarditis and myocarditis — clinical presentation and electrocardiographic features: Pericarditis and myocarditis share overlapping common causes and likely form a continuum, and most pericarditis in developed nations is viral although tuberculosis is sometimes a consideration. Pericarditis classically causes sharp, pleuritic chest pain that may improve by sitting up or leaning forward, a pericardial friction rub may be audible, and widespread ST-elevation with PR depression is the electrocardiographic hallmark though changes may be nonspecific and transient. Clinical manifestations of myocarditis are varied, often including sharp chest pain reflective of epicardial inflammation; myocardial dysfunction often causes fatigue and exercise intolerance, and predominance of heart failure distinguishes myocarditis from pericarditis; troponin is usually elevated, while in pericarditis a minimally elevated troponin does not appear to confer a worse prognosis.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains one of the most challenging medical diseases in the emergency department. PE is a potentially life threatening diagnosis that is seen in patients with chest pain and/or dyspnea but can span the clinical spectrum of medical presentations. In addition, it does not have any particular clinical feature, laboratory test, or diagnostic modality that can independently and confidently exclude its possibility. This article offers a review of PE in the emergency department. It emphasizes the appropriate determination of pretest probability, the approach to diagnosis and management, and special considerations related to pregnancy and radiation exposure.

Acute dyspnea — B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone precursor (NTproBNP) may help evaluate heart failure as the cause of dyspnea and can expedite evaluation and treatment; however, routine use of BNP in all patients with acute dyspnea is not recommended. In acute care settings such as an ED, sensitivity of BNP or NTproBNP is substantially higher than specificity and utility is greatest for ruling out heart failure when pretest probability is low to intermediate, while the utility of serial BNP testing in known heart failure is uncertain.

Aim

This executive summary of the clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to assess and diagnose chest pain in adult patients.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from November 11, 2017, to May 1, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant studies, published through April 2021, were also considered.

Structure

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits in the United States. The "2021 AHA/ACC/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR Guideline for the Evaluation and Diagnosis of Chest Pain" provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence on the assessment and evaluation of chest pain. These guidelines present an evidence-based approach to risk stratification and the diagnostic workup for the evaluation of chest pain. Cost-value considerations in diagnostic testing have been incorporated and shared decision-making with patients is recommended.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

### Outpatient diagnosis of acute chest pain in adults [^1172nwRR]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 percent of primary care office visits are for chest pain, and 1.5 percent of these patients will have unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. The initial goal in patients presenting with chest pain is to determine if the patient needs to be referred for further testing to rule in or out acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction. The physician should consider patient characteristics and risk factors to help determine initial risk. Twelve-lead electrocardiography is typically the test of choice when looking for ST segment changes, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, and new-onset T wave inversions. For persons in whom the suspicion for ischemia is lower, other diagnoses to consider include chest wall pain/costochondritis (localized pain reproducible by palpation), gastroesophageal reflux disease (burning retrosternal pain, acid regurgitation, and a sour or bitter taste in the mouth), and panic disorder/anxiety state. Other less common but important diagnostic considerations include pneumonia (fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion), heart failure, pulmonary embolism (consider using the Wells criteria), acute pericarditis, and acute thoracic aortic dissection (acute chest or back pain with a pulse differential in the upper extremities). Persons with a higher likelihood of acute coronary syndrome should be referred to the emergency department or hospital.

### An adult cystic fibrosis patient presenting with persistent dyspnea: case report [^112X719A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first report of a cystic fibrosis patient diagnosed with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and acknowledges that adult cystic fibrosis patients have indeed survived into the years were coronary artery disease becomes prevalent. Therefore, the likelihood of coronary disease should be included in the diagnostic consideration of persistent dyspnea associated with chest discomfort by applying the same standards used in grading a differential with an anginal presentation in non-CF patients.

The patient presented in this case had a Framingham score estimate that predicted a 10-year cardiovascular risk at 4%. However, because of the presence of subtle chest discomfort associated with dyspnea, medical decision making includes an active alternative diagnosis of atypical angina based on two of three positive criteria of exertional symptoms with symptom relief upon resting. Persistent dyspnea may be an occasional finding for a cystic fibrosis patient, and one that typically leads to further work up of a pulmonary etiology; however, cardiovascular disease was additionally considered in this patient.

The typical differential diagnosis of persistent dyspnea in an adult cystic fibrosis patient would include pneumothorax (5% prevalence), atypical mycobacterial pneumonia (15% prevalence), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (30% prevalence), and cor pulmonale (3% prevalence in association with severe CF pulmonary disease). Without a history for hemoptysis, atypical mycobacterium and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis would be less likely. Physical exam and chest radiograph did not support either pneumothorax or congestive heart failure. Symptoms could also be explained by this patient's progression of gastroesophageal reflux and/or Barrett's esophagus.

Atypical angina would be the most prevalent differential diagnosis, at 60%, for our patient's clinical presentation of chest pain in the non-CF male patient at this age. The risk of CAD is not typically considered as an active alternative diagnosis for the CF patient; yet with aging, even CF patients will be at risk for CAD. This risk may even be greater given higher prevalence of known risk factors such as diabetes mellitus in the CF versus non-CF patient.

### Initial evaluation of chest pain [^1154pDne]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain is among the most frequently evaluated presenting complaints in the emergency department (ED). Diagnostic etiologies range from benign to life-threatening. Failure to diagnose the life-threatening chest emergencies-specifically acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism-can lead to catastrophic medical and legal outcomes for the patient and physician respectively. This article focuses on clinical and risk management strategies to minimize misdiagnosis and produce favorable medical and medicolegal outcomes.

### Initial evaluation… [^1144wiiW]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the role of previous chest pain in diagnosing ACS concluded that chest pain that is pleuritic, positional, or reproducible with palpation and not related to exertion is low risk for ACS. Pain that is described as pressure, worse than prior anginal pain, associated with exertion, accompanied by nausea or diaphoresis, and/or radiates to one or both arms/shoulders is higher risk for ACS. 21 ECG findings that increase the likelihood of ACS include ST segment elevation, new-onset left bundle branch block, presence of Q waves, or new T-wave inversions. 22 Similar ECG findings may be observed in non-ACS conditions, including acute pericarditis and left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with suspicion of ACS based on clinical presentation with changes seen on ECG should be transported immediately to the emergency department.

Less Common, but Important, Diagnostic Considerations PERICARDITIS Pericarditis manifests as a clinical triad of pleuritic chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, and diffuse ECG ST–T-wave changes often preceded by a viral illness. 36 Acute pericarditis should be considered in patients presenting with new-onset chest pain that increases with inspiration or when reclining and is lessened by leaning forward. 36 ECG usually demonstrates diffuse ST segment elevation and PR interval depression. PNEUMONIA Common symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain. HEART FAILURE Most patients with heart failure present with dyspnea on exertion, although some will present with chest pain. 41 Clinical impression is predictive of heart failure, as is pulmonary edema on chest radiography.

41 Patients with acute dyspnea and one or more of the MICE criteria likely have heart failure and should be evaluated with echocardiography. 42, 43. PULMONARY EMBOLISM Diagnosing PE in the office is challenging because its presentation is highly variable. Although dyspnea, tachycardia, and/or chest pain are present in 97% of those diagnosed with PE, no single clinical feature effectively supports or rules out its diagnosis.
