## Question

pyoderma gangranosum treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat pyoderma gangrenosum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimickers. Then, I should stratify severity and patient factors. Next, I will weigh first-line systemic options alongside wound care, set a reassessment checkpoint, and outline escalation strategies. After that, I will consider targeted biologics and the role of surgery under immunosuppression. Finally, I'll address special populations and long-term relapse prevention, while continuously checking the strength and limitations of the evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and rule out mimickers because PG is a diagnosis of exclusion and misdiagnosis can cause harm; I need to check for infection, vascular insufficiency, vasculitis, malignancy, and other ulcerative conditions, and I should verify the major Delphi criterion with an edge biopsy showing a neutrophilic infiltrate plus supportive minor criteria such as pathergy, classic undermined violaceous borders, rapid ulceration, and response to immunosuppression within a month, while keeping in mind how often PG is mistaken for infection or other entities in real-world practice [^115njM4S] [^114tGygx] [^116n9NsW].

> Next, I should review disease severity and patient factors; hold on, I should verify the clinical variant because management differs by phenotype and comorbidities, so I will classify ulcerative, bullous, pustular, vegetative, or peristomal types, measure number, size, depth, pain, and kinetics, and screen for associated diseases like IBD, inflammatory arthritis, hematologic malignancy, and hidradenitis suppurativa, while remembering to assess pathergy given its meaningful frequency and prognostic implications for procedural decisions [^1155CFvu] [^116AL4Ge] [^111xZ1XZ].

> Now, I will consider initial systemic therapy; wait, let me verify comparative efficacy, because although systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine are traditional first-line agents, the pragmatic STOP GAP trial showed similar healing kinetics with fewer than half of ulcers healed by 6 months and high adverse event rates, which pushes me to individualize between steroids, cyclosporine, or early biologic therapy in severe or rapidly progressive disease, especially with IBD association [^116oUjJs] [^115XjVET] [^111VMnUd].

> Considering systemic corticosteroids first, I should confirm dosing of prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day with ceilings around 75 mg/day per trial safeguards, anticipate rapid anti-inflammatory benefit via NF-κB modulation, but I need to watch for high adverse event rates and plan a deliberate taper over weeks to months, acknowledging variable response rates and the frequent need for adjunct steroid-sparing agents in multi-lesional disease [^114eb8ne] [^115XjVET] [^116RhXjM].

> For cyclosporine, I will double-check dose at approximately 4 mg/kg/day in divided dosing, accept that STOP GAP found no superiority versus prednisolone for healing or recurrence while adverse events were common, and I should favor this choice in specific comorbid scenarios such as obesity or when glucocorticoid toxicity is a priority concern, bearing in mind peristomal PG where cyclosporine can be useful as part of an integrated approach [^11244GSf] [^116oUjJs].

> Turning to TNF-α inhibitors, I need to verify the robustness of evidence; infliximab has randomized trial support and both infliximab and adalimumab have high overall response rates across phenotypes, often with faster healing and steroid-sparing advantages particularly in IBD-associated PG, though I should also remember rare paradoxical PG induction with targeted agents and weigh infection risk and cost in shared decision-making [^111VMnUd] [^114BrGjD] [^111X4U4H] [^112BprQM].

> Concurrent wound care must be implemented from the outset; wait, I should avoid provoking pathergy, so I will use a TIME-based plan with gentle cleansing, antimicrobial dressings for bioburden control, moisture balance with alginates or foams, and topical high-potency steroids or tacrolimus to the inflamed edges, reserving antibiotics for culture-proven infection and considering NPWT to reduce ulcer burden without sharp debridement during active inflammation, while remembering that specialized debridement options like controlled maggot therapy can occasionally be leveraged when pathergy risk is high [^113Z4x5t] [^116AL4Ge] [^112uWtET] [^116SEsBu] [^115srhM7] [^111xZ1XZ].

> I should set an early checkpoint; at around 6 weeks, I will now examine objective response because STOP GAP found no difference in speed of healing between prednisolone and cyclosporine at this horizon, so I will assess pain, inflammation, undermining, and area reduction and either continue and begin tapering responders or escalate non-responders promptly to second-line or biologic therapy to prevent chronicity and morbidity [^116oUjJs] [^115XjVET].

> If response is inadequate, I should review second-line or adjunctive options; IVIG is an important steroid-sparing choice with relatively attractive safety in infection or malignancy contexts and meaningful response rates, whereas mycophenolate mofetil offers a tolerable maintenance-friendly option; I need to check patient-specific risks when considering thalidomide, dapsone, methotrexate, or azathioprine, and I should be transparent about the largely low-level evidence base outside STOP GAP [^1115tTnm] [^111gJHJx] [^115mBDUi] [^113jcsAJ] [^113ovaPV] [^1129SYxM].

> For targeted biologics in refractory disease, let me reconsider the cytokine axes; IL-17 blockade with ixekizumab or related agents has rapidly cleared lesions in small series, IL-23 or IL-12/23 inhibitors like guselkumab or ustekinumab can be effective particularly after anti-TNF failure, IL-1 receptor antagonism with anakinra may help patients with multiple comorbidities, and JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib or upadacitinib offer multi-cytokine pathway control in therapy-resistant cases, with PDE4 inhibition by apremilast as an oral alternative when biologics are not suitable, though I should confirm off-label status and monitor risks carefully [^113aKYTE] [^112KokTD] [^113iVquG] [^112k2Kso] [^113He9tG] [^116uttQq] [^1144iftK] [^1151FDr9].

> Surgery requires special caution; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that surgery is contraindicated, because under adequate immunosuppression, split-thickness skin grafting secured with NPWT shows high success and low graft failure rates, improving healing time, but I need to ensure inflammatory control before any operative step and consider adjuncts like hyperbaric oxygen in multidisciplinary planning [^114p3eGr] [^116RhXjM] [^113ZyQ2M].

> I should address special situations; in pregnancy and postpartum PG, judicious use of prednisone and infliximab has been successful, while IVIG can be a rescue for severe post-cesarean disease; for genital PG, rapid systemic control is critical to protect vital structures and cyclosporine may maintain remission; when underlying malignancy complicates immunosuppression, IVIG can provide disease control with a more favorable oncologic safety profile, though I must individualize in tumor boards [^112NKTRt] [^112b1neV] [^112dPcE6] [^114Da8ft] [^111gJHJx].

> Long-term, I need to ensure relapse prevention because recurrence is common; I should maintain the lowest effective immunosuppression, taper steroids very slowly, minimize trauma to avoid pathergy, schedule regular photographic wound assessments, and screen periodically for associated diseases and autoinflammatory syndromes where indicated, integrating emerging genetic insights that may refine targeted choices and prognosis discussions with patients [^115XjVET] [^112uWtET] [^115CifN4] [^113AZs4u].

> Stepping back, let me synthesize the algorithm to guide action: confirm PG with Delphi-aligned criteria and exclusion of mimickers, stage severity and comorbidities, initiate first-line systemic therapy tailored to risks and urgency (steroids, cyclosporine, or early TNF-α inhibitor in severe or IBD-associated disease) with concurrent TIME-based wound care, reassess at 6 weeks, escalate swiftly to IVIG, MMF, or targeted biologics if response is suboptimal, consider surgery only after inflammation control, and commit to long-term maintenance and pathergy avoidance, all while remembering that STOP GAP underscores the limitations of traditional first-line monotherapies and supports early combination or biologic strategies in high-risk presentations [^116oUjJs] [^115XjVET] [^111VMnUd].

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is best managed with a **stepwise approach**, starting with **topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors** for mild/localized disease, and escalating to **systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine** for moderate-to-severe or rapidly progressive cases [^1129SYxM] [^116oUjJs]. For refractory disease, escalate to **biologics (infliximab, adalimumab)** or other immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, dapsone) [^111VMnUd]. Wound care should avoid trauma by using **gentle cleansing, nonadherent dressings, and compression when appropriate** [^113Z4x5t]. Surgery is reserved for stable disease under immunosuppression, and a **multidisciplinary team** is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize recurrence [^114p3eGr] [^1129SYxM].

---

## Topical therapies

Topical therapies are indicated for mild or localized PG lesions and are generally well tolerated; they control inflammation and promote healing [^112uWtET] [^114eb8ne]. **High-potency topical corticosteroids** (e.g. clobetasol propionate 0.05%) are effective for localized PG, with 42.6% of patients achieving complete healing at 6 months and a median healing time of 136 days [^112uWtET] [^114eb8ne]. **Tacrolimus ointment** (0.03% or 0.1%) has demonstrated efficacy in localized PG, with complete response rates reported in small case series [^116SEsBu] [^114eb8ne].

---

## Systemic therapies

Systemic therapies are indicated for **moderate-to-severe PG, rapidly progressive disease, or lesions refractory to topical treatments** [^11244GSf] [^114eb8ne].

---

### First-line systemic therapies

**Prednisone** (0.5–1 mg/kg/day) is a first-line therapy that induces clinical response in approximately 40–50% of cases; pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day for 3–5 days) may be used for rapid control [^114eb8ne]. **Cyclosporine**, a calcineurin inhibitor dosed at 4–5 mg/kg/day, is effective as first-line therapy — particularly when corticosteroids are contraindicated — with the STOP GAP trial demonstrating efficacy comparable to prednisolone [^116oUjJs] [^11244GSf].

---

### Second-line systemic therapies

- **Mycophenolate mofetil**: Effective as a steroid-sparing agent, with clinical improvement reported in 84.6% of patients in a retrospective study [^115mBDUi].

- **Methotrexate**: Used as an alternative immunosuppressant, particularly in patients with contraindications to other therapies [^114qxMVd].

- **Dapsone**: An anti-inflammatory antibiotic effective in partial or complete healing in approximately 96.9% of treatment episodes in a retrospective review [^113ovaPV].

---

### Biologic therapies

Biologic agents targeting specific cytokines have emerged as effective treatments for refractory PG [^111VMnUd] [^114eb8ne]. **TNF-α inhibitors** (infliximab, adalimumab) achieve complete response rates of approximately 67% [^111VMnUd] [^114eb8ne]. **Interleukin pathway agents** such as ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor) and anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) have also demonstrated efficacy in refractory cases [^112k2Kso] [^114g56Dc] [^113aKYTE].

---

## Wound care and supportive measures

Effective wound care is essential in PG management. The TIME (Tissue, Infection/Inflammation, Moisture, Edge) model guides wound care strategies [^113Z4x5t]:

- **Gentle cleansing**: Avoid sharp debridement due to pathergy risk [^113Z4x5t].

- **Nonadherent dressings**: Silicone or foam dressings to minimize trauma [^113Z4x5t].

- **Compression therapy**: Useful for lower extremity ulcers to reduce edema and promote healing [^113Z4x5t] [^114eb8ne].

- **Pain management**: Topical lidocaine or systemic analgesics as needed [^113Z4x5t] [^114eb8ne].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgical interventions are generally avoided due to the risk of **pathergy**. However, in selected cases with stable disease under immunosuppression, surgical debridement, skin grafting, or negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) may be considered [^114p3eGr] [^116RhXjM].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving dermatologists, rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, wound care specialists, and plastic surgeons is essential for optimal management of PG. It ensures comprehensive care by addressing underlying systemic diseases, optimizing wound care, and minimizing recurrence [^1129SYxM] [^117Ti8oJ].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies under investigation include:

- **Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors**: Tofacitinib and upadacitinib have shown promise in refractory PG cases [^113He9tG] [^116uttQq].

- **Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors**: Apremilast has been reported effective in case reports [^1144iftK].

- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Effective as adjunct therapy in refractory cases [^1115tTnm] [^114eb8ne].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice is influenced by **disease severity and extent** (localized versus widespread), patient **comorbidities** (e.g. renal insufficiency, malignancy, obesity, diabetes), and previous treatment responses, including refractory or relapsing disease. Patient preferences — such as tolerability, convenience, and cost considerations — also play a key role [^117Ti8oJ] [^114eb8ne].

---

## Recurrence and long-term management

**Recurrence** is common in PG, with relapse rates of approximately 30% reported in the STOP GAP trial. Long-term management includes maintenance immunosuppression, regular follow-up, and patient education to recognize early signs of recurrence [^11244GSf] [^114eb8ne].

---

Pyoderma gangrenosum treatment involves a **stepwise approach**, starting with topical therapies for mild cases and escalating to systemic immunosuppressants and biologics for severe or refractory disease. Effective wound care, supportive measures, and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimal outcomes. Emerging therapies such as JAK inhibitors and IVIG offer promising options for refractory cases.

- **Classical immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs**: The anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids (CS) is attributed to their transcription-altering effects, particularly to NF-κB inhibition, with subsequent downregulation of many proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. The rapid onset of action has made systemic CS a first-line option in pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).

	- Treatment with systemic CS (dose 0.5–1 mg/kg/day) induces a clinical response in about 40–50% of cases, with widely variable complete response rates depending on associated systemic diseases and PG severity. Once healing has been reached, the CS dose can be tapered over a variable time period (4–6 weeks to 12–24 weeks), according to clinical course, comorbidities, and the risk of relapse. Pulse therapy with 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone for 3–5 consecutive days, followed by oral CS, may have a faster onset of action and may also help taper oral CS. As complete remission is achieved only in 40% and relapse prevention only in 20% of those with multi-lesional PG, it is recommended to combine systemic CS with immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory adjuvants in severe cases, with the most common agent being cyclosporine.

### Surgical treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with negative pressure wound therapy and skin grafting, including xenografts: Personal experience and comprehensive review on 161 cases [^114p3eGr]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Low credibility.

Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, debilitating autoinflammatory ulcerative skin disease. No gold standard has been established for the treatment of PG. The role of surgical interventions and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was discussed controversially until recently, as these procedures might pose a trigger to further aggravate the condition.

Recent advances: Recent findings confirm the paradigm change that a surgical approach using PG with split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) secured by NPWT is a safe and valuable treatment if performed under adequate immunosuppression. We elaborate on this through a broad literature search retrieving 101 relevant articles describing 138 patients, complemented with our personal experience on 23 patients, including 2 patients treated with a porcine xenodressing.

Critical issues: A wide range of surgical approaches have been reported, including xenografts. Treatment was ultimately successful in 86% of cases, including those with xenotransplants. Ten percent improved, and failures were mainly reported without immunosuppression. Despite halting the inflammatory process, NPWT alone, without skin grafting, does not significantly accelerate healing time. The best surgical approach appears to be STSG fixed with NPWT, as this leads to higher skin graft take. There remains the problem of the chronic nature of PG and recurrence after the tapering of immunosuppression or trauma; therefore, sustained immunosuppressive treatment is suggested.

Future directions: While surgical treatment is supported by published data, the exact immunosuppression is still an area requiring further clarity.

### Therapy insight: Pyoderma gangrenosum-old disease, new management [^1129SYxM]. Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Well-designed studies that help guide physicians to apply the optimal therapeutic strategy for the management of pyoderma gangrenosum are lacking in the literature. A multidisciplinary approach is paramount for the effective management of this condition, with close involvement of a wound-care specialist and a microbiologist. Treatment should be stepwise in nature. Local wound care, avoidance of trauma, and the application of local steroid or tacrolimus ointment are the first-line treatments. Steroid therapy is the most widely published effective therapy for achieving resolution of pyoderma gangrenosum, although there is growing evidence for the efficacy of infliximab in refractory cases. Other therapies, such as dapsone and clofazamine, should be left as third-line agents for refractory pyoderma gangrenosum. Novel treatments, such as granulocyte apheresis, should only be used under trial conditions to gain an objective evaluation of their efficacy. This article reviews the published treatment strategies in use and aims to guide the effective management of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^111VMnUd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha Inhibitors (Level of Evidence 1B) play a crucial role in the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Tumor necrosis factor-α is a key proinflammatory pleiotropic cytokine that regulates IL1-β, IL-6, and IL-8. The latter is a potent chemokine that serves as a chemoattractant for neutrophils and works synergistically with TNF-α to promote and maintain a proinflammatory state. Expression of TNF-α and its receptors is increased in lesional PG skin.

Biologics, including infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab, have been used in the treatment of PG.

- **Differences in binding**: Etanercept binds only the soluble form of TNF-α, whereas infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab bind both the soluble-bound and membrane-bound forms of TNF-α and induce apoptosis of TNF-α-expressing cells. Certolizumab lacks an Fc domain and therefore cannot induce apoptosis, complement-dependent, or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

There is growing evidence supporting the use of TNF-α inhibitors as first-line treatments, particularly infliximab and adalimumab. A semi-systematic review found a 67% (238 out of 356 patients) complete response rate and an 87% response rate to TNF-α inhibitors overall. There was a trend towards a higher response rate for adalimumab and infliximab compared with etanercept, although this was not statistically significant. Additionally, response rates were not significantly different for PG type or associated diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematological diseases, or other inflammatory disorders.

At the time of writing, infliximab remains the sole anti-TNF-α agent of demonstrated efficacy in classic PG.

### Clinical mimickers misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum [^114tGygx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, ulcerative, neutrophilic dermatosis that can be challenging to diagnose. Diagnosis of PG is clinical due to a lack of specific histopathologic, immunologic, or imaging findings associated with the disease, although several clinical frameworks exist to guide diagnosis. Misdiagnosis of PG is frequent and leads to increased patient morbidity and mortality. This article highlights common mimickers of PG and offers clinical pearls to aid in accurate diagnosis, with the goal of decreasing diagnostic delay and misdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1115tTnm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been utilized as an adjunct steroid-sparing agent and has shown success in treating refractory pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). In particular, IVIG has been used as a second-line systemic therapy for disseminated or moderate-to-severe PG. It is an appealing option because PG comorbidities may underlie contraindications to other, more commonly used systemic therapies. The anti-inflammatory actions of IVIG include hampering immune complex-mediated activation of FcγRs, reducing the half-life of circulating antibodies through neonatal Fc receptor binding, blocking complement activation, disrupting auto-reactive T-cell/antigen-presenting cell interactions, restoring the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and downregulating antibody production.

In a retrospective case series, 88% of patients responded to IVIG as adjunct therapy, with 53% achieving complete response after an average treatment length of 5.9 months. The mean time to initial response was 3.5 weeks. The most common concurrent therapy was systemic corticosteroids (CS). Notably, the time to initial response was reduced with increasing IVIG doses (> 2 g/kg), although the dosage did not have the same beneficial effect on overall treatment length. A retrospective study sought to determine the effects of IVIG incorporation in patients with treatment-resistant PG, finding a statistically significant improvement in complete healing with the addition of IVIG to treatment regimens in patients who had one resistant ulcer and no comorbidities.

### Comorbidity screening in hidradenitis suppurativa: Evidence-based recommendations from the US and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations [^1155CFvu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum.

HS and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) share clinical features, including similar demographic composition, presence of suppurating plaques and ulcers, neutrophil-rich inflammation, response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, and coexistence as part of autoinflammatory syndromes. The prevalence of PG among patients with HS ranges from 0.2% to 0.4%. Prevalence is higher (3.7%) among patients with HS having Crohn's disease (CD). In a study of 65,000 patients with HS, the adjusted odds of having PG was up to 20 times greater among patients with HS (0.18%) compared to control individuals (0.01%). The association was independent of CD status.

Herpes zoster.

Local and systemic inflammation and exposures to immunomodulating therapies may increase reactivation risk. Introduction of a highly effective herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine has also increased the relevance of identifying individuals at elevated risk. In a retrospective study, hospitalized patients with HS had 1.65 (95% CI, 1.13–2.39) times the odds of HZ compared to hospitalized control individuals, although absolute prevalence was low in both groups (0.143% vs 0.145%). In another retrospective cohort study of 30,000 patients with HS, those not receiving immunosuppression had an incidence of 0.4%. Patients with exposure to immunosuppression had a crude HZ incidence of 1.3%, although this burden still approximated that observed in the general US population (1.0%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of developing HZ among patients with HS was similar regardless of immunosuppression status, suggesting that immunosuppression may not significantly alter the risk.

### A rationale for adjuvant surgical intervention in pyoderma gangrenosum [^113ZyQ2M]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Medical specialists who care for patients with pyoderma gangrenosum have traditionally been reluctant to consult plastic surgeons. This hesitation stems from previous negative experiences with debridement and skin grafting. However, a new understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease process and better therapeutic options for control have emerged.

Few studies report on the surgical therapy of this disease, and even fewer report successful outcomes. The authors present their limited experience at the American University of Beirut with four patients who were controlled medically before undergoing skin grafting on their large wounds, thus decreasing morbidity and hospital stay. A review of the literature, along with insights on the rationale and timing of surgery for this particular small group of patients, is discussed.

### Effective strategies for the management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^114qj1tY]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an inflammatory disease characterized by painful ulcerations. It is often associated with other systemic inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune arthritis.

- **The problem**: PG does not have characteristic serologic or histologic features. Therefore, other potential causes such as malignancy, vasculitis, infection, and coagulation disorders should be ruled out. Additionally, patients often have aggressive disease that is refractory to immunosuppressive therapy, but there is only a paucity of clinical data to help direct therapy.

- **Basic/clinical science advances**: There are several lines of evidence to support an immunologic etiology of PG. Although the pathogenesis is still not well understood, it is clear that PG is associated with the upregulation of several cytokines, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1β, IL-6, and interferon gamma, among many others. TNF and IL-1β are of particular interest, as some biologic medications that target these cytokines have been effective in treating PG.

- **Clinical care relevance**: Multiple drugs are available to help control PG. Biologics, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and conventional immunosuppressive drugs have been reported to be effective. Multidrug therapies should be considered for refractory cases.

- **Conclusion**: PG is a complex inflammatory disease with multiple involved pathways. Anti-TNF agents and IVIG represent significant advancements in treatment options. Since some biologic therapies are relatively new, their full efficacy and safety profiles are still being understood.

### Targeted therapy with ixekizumab in pyoderma gangrenosum: A case series and a literature overview [^111gJHJx]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

As the underlying pathology of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is due to immune dysregulation, immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment. Topical or intralesional corticosteroids are used to treat small, localized lesions. Systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine are first-line agents for rapidly progressive lesions. However, one multicenter randomized clinical trial of 121 patients showed less than 50% achieved remission at 6 months with either prednisolone or cyclosporine. The majority experienced at least one therapy-induced adverse reaction, 66% and 68% in prednisolone and cyclosporine groups, respectively.

Sulfasalazine, tacrolimus, thalidomide, azathioprine, minocycline, methotrexate, clofazimine, mycophenolate mofetil, and dapsone have also been used as monotherapy for the treatment of PG. Intravenous immunoglobulin is an efficacious non-pharmacologic option with an attractive safety profile in the context of active infection or malignancy. Due to the concern of cost with repeated infusion, intravenous immunoglobulin is generally used early and subsequently transitioned to another medication.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^1151FDr9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin disease classified within the group of neutrophilic dermatoses. It is clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. The pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum is complex, involving profound dysregulation of components of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, with the follicular unit increasingly recognized as the putative initial target.

T helper 17/T helper 1-skewed inflammation and exaggerated inflammasome activation lead to a dysregulated neutrophil-dominant milieu with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36. Low-evidence studies and a lack of validated diagnostic and response criteria have hindered the discovery and validation of new effective treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum.

We review established and emerging treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum. A therapeutic algorithm based on available evidence is also provided. For emerging treatments, we review target molecules and their role in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Genital pyoderma gangrenosum: Report of two cases and published work review of Japanese cases [^112dPcE6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative skin disorder characterized by non-infectious ulcers, affecting the lower extremities in approximately 70% of cases. It is commonly associated with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematological malignancies. Herein, we report two cases of Japanese patients diagnosed with genital pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Case 1**: A 74-year-old woman without associated systemic complications, presenting with a skin lesion resembling squamous cell carcinoma, limited to the vulva.
- **Case 2**: An 89-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, who had penile and leg ulcers mimicking pressure sores.

Both cases responded well to systemic steroids. We review 13 cases of genital pyoderma gangrenosum (76.9% male; aged 30–89 years) from 1996 to 2012 in Japan, including 11 previously reported cases and the current study's two cases. Four of these 13 cases had associated systemic diseases with skin lesions spreading to extragenital areas. Eight of the remaining nine cases, with genitalia-localized pyoderma gangrenosum, exhibited no associated systemic diseases.

In conclusion, genital pyoderma gangrenosum is rare and may be misdiagnosed. It should be considered in cases of refractory genital ulcers. Additionally, genitalia-localized pyoderma gangrenosum tends to occur without systemic complications.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^111DEmeJ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

This review evaluates both established and emerging immunotherapies for pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), drawing primarily from clinical observations. Managing PG and HS remains a formidable challenge, with immunosuppressive treatments serving as the foundational therapeutic approach. A deeper comprehension of the molecular underpinnings of PG and HS promises to usher in innovative, targeted interventions.

Early diagnosis and intervention for PG and HS are crucial, not only to ensure effective treatment and enhance the patient's quality of life but also to counteract systemic inflammation. This is a phenomenon observed in conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. While direct evidence for such systemic effects remains elusive in the context of PG and HS, the activation of white blood cells and ensuing cutaneous inflammation could potentially herald complications in the cardiovascular system and other organs. Given these potential risks, it is imperative to recognize the value of timely deployment of potent treatments, such as biologics and small molecules, to mitigate inflammation.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^113jcsAJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Thalidomide has been demonstrated to be effective in treating refractory pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) in numerous case reports. It potentially modulates NF-κB-related proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reduces CD8+ T cells. Additionally, thalidomide can selectively inhibit TNF-α production from monocytes, indicating its therapeutic relevance.

Case reports indicate thalidomide's use in cases of primary or idiopathic PG when traditional treatments fail. It has been proposed as monotherapy or in combination with corticosteroids (CS) or immunomodulatory agents, such as dapsone. Reported dosages of thalidomide range from 100 to 400 mg/day. It is crucial to consider the teratogenicity of thalidomide and the rare side effect of peripheral neuropathy.

### A case of genital pyoderma gangrenosum successfully treated with cyclosporine without relapse of established follicular lymphoma [^114Da8ft]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Management of pyoderma gangrenosum in established malignancy is challenging. When vital structures are at risk from ulceration, aggressive management is required; however, immunosuppressive therapy may compromise the prognosis for an underlying malignancy. The optimal management of pyoderma gangrenosum in this setting is unclear.

We report on a 64-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma in partial remission, who had severe genital pyoderma gangrenosum. After multidisciplinary evaluation, she was treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine and healed fully with scarring over 7 weeks. She has required low-dose cyclosporine for 3 years to maintain remission of her genital ulceration; however, she remains well with no relapse of her lymphoma on serial imaging.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A review for the gastroenterologist [^111X4U4H]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare ulcerative skin disease of unknown etiology frequently associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The most common presentation of PG involves the spontaneous and rapid formation of an extremely painful ulcer on the extremities, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In rare cases, PG can manifest as a chronic peristomal complication or as an acute postoperative complication of a surgical wound. The clinical course of PG is unpredictable; it may not correlate with IBD activity and can even precede a diagnosis of IBD. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is challenging and often involves various immunosuppressive therapies. This review aims to provide an update for gastroenterologists on the pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and management of PG, a rare complication of IBD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the neutrophilic dermatoses (pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome) [^113y15pN]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Neutrophilic dermatoses include a spectrum of disorders with similar histologic appearance and pathologic processes. Clinically, however, they have different physical manifestations and associations. This group includes two diseases for which dermatologists are commonly consulted in the hospital, namely pyoderma gangrenosum and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, or Sweet's syndrome.

Evaluation is challenging, and many therapeutic approaches have been described for both. The previously reported diagnostic criteria, physical descriptions, differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment options are reviewed. A practical approach to pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet's syndrome for the provider is described.

### Diagnosis and management of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum: A systematic review [^112ZTzGU]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum (PPG) is an uncommon subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum that is challenging to diagnose and manage due to the lack of evidence-based guidelines. This systematic review aims to identify key clinical features and effective treatment options for PPG.

A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases. The analysis included 335 patients from 79 studies, revealing that PPG typically presents as a painful, rapidly progressing ulcer with undermined, violaceous borders. These symptoms commonly follow ostomy leakage and local skin irritation or trauma.

Systemic steroids are recommended as the first-line therapy. Infliximab and adalimumab can offer control for active inflammatory bowel disease concurrently. A combination of local and systemic therapies is often utilized. Effective management includes wound dressings, careful vehicle selection, and the use of appropriate ostomy devices to reduce leakage, irritation, and pressure-induced ischemia, thereby enhancing healing.

Distinct from classic ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, surgical interventions such as stoma closure and resection in cases of active inflammatory bowel disease have shown efficacy in managing PPG.

The rarity of PPG poses significant challenges, resulting in variable treatment durations and follow-up times across studies, and no randomized trials or diagnostic guidelines are currently available.

In conclusion, this review emphasizes the key clinical characteristics of PPG and outlines several treatment approaches, including a potentially greater role for surgical intervention in effective PPG management.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: A misdiagnosis [^116n9NsW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, commonly mistaken for an infection. Here, we report the case of a 55-year-old woman with an infectious process that was initially misdiagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum and treated accordingly. We also discuss the criteria and methods available to diagnose infections and pyoderma gangrenosum correctly.

### Adalimumab in Japanese patients with active ulcers of pyoderma gangrenosum: Twenty-six-week phase 3 open-label study [^111JhsF3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by deep and painful skin ulcers and is estimated to affect 3–10 per million people per year. The pathogenesis of PG is still poorly understood. Abnormalities in inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, and genetic background have been shown to play a role in the pathophysiology. In approximately half of the cases, PG is associated with underlying systemic disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or lymphoproliferative disorders. Diagnosis is often based on the exclusion of skin neoplasms, infections, stasis ulcers, and other inflammatory conditions. For a definitive diagnosis of PG, a skin biopsy is essential to exclude other dermatoses.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is clinically classified into four types: ulcerative (classic), bullous, pustular, and vegetative. Of these, the ulcerative type is the most common and is characterized by rapidly enlarging deep central ulceration with undermined borders. Initially, a small sterile follicular pustule arises, rapidly forms an abscess, ulcerates, and spreads outward. The ulcerations are surrounded by raised edematous borders, with the surface covered by necrotic tissue. Most commonly, PG occurs in the lower legs, although other sites may also be impacted, such as the face, trunk, and genital regions. Although the clinical manifestations of PG are variable, the subtypes of PG share a similar pathophysiological and histological course.

Although no treatment has currently been approved for PG, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are commonly used in its management.

### Ustekinumab for pyoderma gangrenosum-like skin ulcerations in late-onset leukocyte adhesion deficiency [^114g56Dc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for PG-like wounds in patients with LAD-1 are still under discussion. TNF-α blockade has been reported in three patients, with variable responses. Other options include systemic steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, immunomodulating drugs (i.e. methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil), or IL1β-antagonists (e.g. anakinra).

Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against IL-12 and IL-23, was successfully used in a patient with LAD-1. As depicted in Figure 3, ustekinumab not only led to reduced levels of IL-12 and IL-23, but also significantly reduced IL-1β levels. Ustekinumab thus curbs hyperinflammation and facilitates the healing of ulcers.

The only causative treatment, however, is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which, in a retrospective analysis of 84 patients with LAD, resulted in a 3-year overall survival rate of 84%.

In conclusion, ustekinumab is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with LAD-1 with pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers (PGLUs), and it can be useful in bridging the time until HSCT.

### Portable negative-pressure wound therapy for pyoderma gangrenosum: Report of two cases [^115srhM7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic non-infectious neutrophilic dermatosis that causes undermining ulcers. Topical therapies for the deep ulcers of pyoderma gangrenosum have not been established. To investigate whether negative-pressure wound therapy is effective for a pyoderma gangrenosum ulcer, we used the PICO single-use negative-pressure wound therapy system (Smith & Nephew, London, UK) for two pyoderma gangrenosum patients. In these cases, the ulcers decreased in size, and necrolytic tissue was removed notably. Moreover, there were no secondary infections, nor was there Koebner phenomenon. Our cases suggest that portable negative-pressure wound therapy can be a treatment option for deep, intractable ulcers caused by pyoderma gangrenosum. Because portable negative-pressure wound therapy devices afford increased mobility to patients, they can give the patient a better quality of life than standard negative-pressure wound therapy systems do.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^11244GSf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Cyclosporine (Level of Evidence 1B) is an immunosuppressive drug used as a first-line choice for PG treatment. It is a calcineurin inhibitor that hampers the synthesis of interleukins, particularly IL-2, which is crucial in blocking T-lymphocyte activation.

A multicenter randomized controlled trial, the Study of Treatments for Pyoderma Gangrenosum Patients (STOP GAP), was conducted to compare prednisolone and cyclosporine, the two first-line treatment options for PG. In the STOP GAP trial, patients received either oral prednisolone at 0.75 mg/kg/day or cyclosporine at 4 mg/kg/day. Limitations of this study included the possibility of PG misdiagnosis, as no diagnostic framework for PG was used, and the inclusion of mostly mild PG cases. There was no difference between the two treatments in terms of speed of healing over six weeks, time to healing, treatment response, inflammation resolution, pain, quality of life, treatment failures, and time to recurrence. Notably, almost half of the enrolled patients receiving systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine did not achieve healing of PG ulcers at six months, and almost a third of patients in both treatment groups developed a disease recurrence, with a median time to recurrence of 582 days in both groups. Additionally, about two-thirds of patients experienced adverse effects in each group.

The choice between prednisolone and cyclosporine depends on patients' comorbidities. Pre-existing conditions favoring prednisolone over cyclosporine include renal insufficiency or malignancy, whereas patients with obesity may have different considerations.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with apremilast monotherapy [^1144iftK]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly developing painful ulcers with overhanging borders and peripheral erythema. It is typically treated with local and systemic immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids, cyclosporine, dapsone, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors, but many lesions exhibit treatment resistance or relapse following a successful therapeutic response. Additionally, there is currently a paucity of clinical data to guide the treatment of PG, so management often revolves around guidelines set forth by case reports or small clinical trials, highlighting the need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for this disease. We report a case of PG treated with apremilast monotherapy, a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^112KokTD]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Sixteen months later, a relapse occurred while the patient was still receiving ustekinumab, accompanied by ulceration and associated pain. Assuming the development of neutralizing autoantibodies against ustekinumab, the patient was subsequently treated unsuccessfully with adalimumab and infliximab sequentially. The ulcer expanded to encompass approximately 60% of the patient's left lower leg circumference, exposing tendon and muscle (Fig 1). In response, the patient was administered intravenous immunoglobulin by her oncologist for the potential management of both monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). In addition, prednisone was instituted, which successfully arrested disease progression.

- **Figure 1**: Severe PG involving the left lower extremity with muscle and tendon exposure in May 2019 when ustekinumab was initiated. PG, pyoderma gangrenosum.

Given the previous response to an IL-12/23 antagonist and the failure of two tumor necrosis factor alfa inhibitors, we speculated that inhibiting IL-23 with guselkumab might halt and potentially reverse disease progression. Within weeks of starting guselkumab at a 100 mg monthly dose, the ulcer bed began retreating from the underlying exposed muscles and tendons. Within three months, the ulcer was virtually non-existent. Re-epithelialization was notable over 95% of the original ulcer. The response was found to be durable, with continued remission of the patient's PG after 15 months (Fig 2).

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^111srFg3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are stubborn inflammatory skin diseases categorized as neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. These conditions exhibit connections with other autoinflammatory disorders driven by immune responses. Their pathogenesis is complex, rooted in significant imbalances in both innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly featuring elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8, IL-17, and IL-23. Studies involving skin tissue pathology and serology have indicated that targeting specific cytokines can bring therapeutic benefits. Indeed, many patients in clinical settings have responded positively to such interventions. Yet, given the diverse cytokines in play, focusing on a single one with antibody therapy might not always be effective. When resistance to biologics emerges, a combined approach targeting multiple overactive cytokines with immunosuppressants, for example, cyclosporine and Janus kinase inhibitors, could be an option. In the review, we explore recent therapeutic developments for PG and HS.

### Pg-time: A practical approach to the clinical management of pyoderma gangrenosum [^116AL4Ge]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis which may be rapidly progressive. Standard guidelines for local treatment are lacking. Through our experience, we suggested a local treatment algorithm based on the tissue, infection, moisture balance, and epithelization (TIME) concept. The clinical and histopathological features of 52 patients with PG, the duration, and the evolution of the lesions were retrospectively evaluated.

Systemic therapies, local treatments, and standard wound treatments were reported. We observed ulcerative PG in the majority of the patients (82.6%), followed by the pustular form (9.6%), the peristomal type (3.8%), the vegetative form (1.9%), and the bullous type (1.9%). The lower leg was the most commonly affected area (90.4% of cases). Pathergy was reported in 15.3% of cases.

The first-line treatment was the use of oral glucocorticosteroids (GCSs). We observed healing after three weeks of GCS in 17.3% of cases. In 25% of all cases, we obtained complete healing with long-term low doses (< 0.5mg/kg) of GCS in the range of two to six months. We used second-line treatments in 57.6% of patients. Local, systemic treatment, and correct wound management can be associated with better clinical results.

We suggest a new local therapeutic algorithm in both the inflammatory and non-inflammatory healing phases.

### Recalcitrant cutaneous pyoderma gangrenosum with pulmonary involvement resolved with treatment of underlying plasma cell dyscrasia [^116Qy53c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory ulcerative disease with unknown pathophysiology and etiology. It is associated with many systemic inflammatory, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases. The clinical presentation varies widely but commonly manifests as painful, progressive, and well-demarcated ulcers with blue/gray serpiginous borders. The histopathology of PG is non-specific but typically includes dense neutrophilic infiltration with necrosis and hemorrhage.

These variations and inherent uncertainties of PG can make definitive diagnosis challenging. More common processes, such as infections, vasculitides, and malignancies, must first be excluded. Suggested criteria for PG are as follows: progression of the ulcer(s), ruling out more common ulcerative diseases and atypical infections, confirmation of associated systemic diseases, and response to treatments. Therapy typically includes immunosuppression and wound care, but treatment of underlying systemic diseases, as seen in this case report, has been shown to be successful.

### Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with mycophenolate mofetil as a steroid-sparing agent [^115mBDUi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has enjoyed increasing popularity as an emerging immunosuppressant treatment for various autoimmune dermatologic conditions, including pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of MMF as used in PG. A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients with PG treated with MMF at our institution (Victoria, Australia) for the past 11 years (2001–2012).

We identified 26 patients, 14 female and 12 male. Nine patients (34.6%) had associated systemic conditions. All patients received prednisolone. MMF was used as a first-line steroid-sparing agent in 11 patients (42.3%), second-line in 14 (53.8%), and third-line in 1 (3.85%). The average duration of treatment was 12.1 months. Fourteen patients experienced side effects (53.8%), although most were mild (26.9%). One patient died following a sigmoid colon perforation (3.85%). Overall, 22 patients demonstrated clinical improvement during MMF treatment (84.6%). Thirteen patients achieved complete ulcer healing (50%), 10 while taking MMF and 3 after ceasing it.

This is a retrospective study based on a single-center cohort. Our experience suggests that MMF is highly efficacious in PG together with prednisolone, or as part of combination therapy with other immunosuppressants.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^113Z4x5t]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Wound care is crucial for the appropriate management of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) cases. PG ulcers evolve through inflammatory and healing phases, requiring a differentiated approach depending on depth and exudation. Recently, an algorithm based on the Tissue, Infection or inflammation, Moisture, and Edge (TIME) model has been adapted for PG.

Adequate control of wound bed and perilesional inflammation with topical corticosteroids (CS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors, as well as lidocaine for pain management, is key during the inflammatory phase. In this setting, to avoid pathergy, only gentle cleansing without sharp debridement should be performed. Enzymatic (e.g. collagenases) or autolytic debridement (e.g. hydrogel) can aid in reducing fibrin and necrotic tissues, and may be followed by the application of either absorbent (alginate, hydrofiber) or non-adherent (silicone, foam) dressings to control the exudate.

Alginates are best employed for bleeding PG ulcers because of their hemostatic properties, while polyurethane foam with a silicon layer could be useful on inflamed PG lesions. Antimicrobial dressings to decrease microbial burden and compressive bandages to reduce the exudate, edema, and overgranulation of PG ulcers may also have a role during the inflammatory phase. Indeed, according to a systematic review of the literature, antimicrobial and hyperabsorbent dressings appear to be the most commonly used dressings for the management of PG ulcers, requiring less frequent changes and manipulation. Bioactive dressings, such as collagen sheets, dermal, and/or epider…

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^1129Grud]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates a common conundrum among providers treating patients with recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Case reports have identified IL-1/IL-6 antagonists, Janus kinase-signal transducer, and activator of transcription inhibitors, as well as phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors, but none have evaluated guselkumab, despite the significance of IL-23 expression. PG can be a severely debilitating disease, and the need for evidence-based treatment is crucial. A larger trial analyzing the effect of IL-23 targeting biologics for the treatment of PG would be helpful in further defining the role of this medication within the existing treatment algorithm.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^113mzQk4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are stubborn inflammatory skin diseases categorized as neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. These conditions exhibit connections with other autoinflammatory disorders driven by immune responses. Their pathogenesis is complex, rooted in significant imbalances in both innate and adaptive immune systems, particularly featuring elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin (IL)‐1, IL‐8, IL‐17, and IL‐23.

### Role of inflammatory cells, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in neutrophil-mediated skin diseases [^111AfJkT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease presenting with painful ulcers having undermined edges. Less commonly, bullous and vegetative variants exist. Histology consists of a neutrophil-rich dermal infiltrate. We characterized immunohistochemically the infiltrate in different variants of PG and in another neutrophilic dermatosis such as Sweet's syndrome. We studied 21 patients with PG, eight with Sweet's syndrome, and 20 controls, evaluating skin immunoreactivity for inflammatory cell markers (CD3, CD163, and myeloperoxidase), cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-17], metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Immunoreactivities of CD3, CD163, myeloperoxidase, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-17, MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF were significantly higher in both PG and Sweet's syndrome than in controls (P = 0.0001). Myeloperoxidase (neutrophil marker), IL-8 (cytokine chemotactic for neutrophils), and MMP-9 (proteinase-mediating tissue damage) were expressed more significantly in both ulcerative and bullous PG than in vegetative PG as well as in Sweet's syndrome (P = 0.008-P = 0.0001). In ulcerative PG, the expression of CD3 (pan T cell marker) and CD163 (macrophage marker) were significantly higher in the wound edge than in the wound bed (P = 0.0001). In contrast, the neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase was expressed more significantly in the wound bed than in the wound edge (P = 0.0001). Our study identifies PG as a paradigm of neutrophil-mediated inflammation, with proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and MMPs acting as important effectors.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: Results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^116oUjJs]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial, no difference was found between the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: ciclosporin and prednisolone. The comparison covered a range of outcome measures. Contrary to the anecdotally derived belief that these drugs are efficacious in treating pyoderma gangrenosum, we found that fewer than half of the ulcers healed, even after prolonged treatment, and the speed of onset of response did not differ between the two treatments. Approximately two thirds of participants reported adverse reactions, with 12% experiencing a serious event. The side effects observed were in line with the known side effect profiles of these drugs. More serious adverse reactions, especially serious infections, were reported in the prednisolone group, although patients receiving ciclosporin were at increased risk of renal toxicity.

A recent expert consensus paper considering safety, efficacy, and cost placed prednisolone as the preferred treatment and ciclosporin as the second-ranked treatment among the many suggested interventions for pyoderma gangrenosum. Nonetheless, previous studies have reported large proportions of people with pyoderma gangrenosum achieving complete response with ciclosporin, which led the researchers of the STOP GAP (Study of Treatments fOr Pyoderma GAngrenosum Patients) randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that ciclosporin was superior to prednisolone for the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

Healing responses at six weeks in our study were broadly similar to those observed for the randomised controlled trials considered.

### Inpatient management of pyoderma gangrenosum: Treatments, outcomes, and clinical implications [^116RhXjM]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, ulcerative neutrophilic skin condition of unknown etiology. The disease continues to pose therapeutic challenges, with ongoing controversy regarding the role of surgery.

- **Methods**: A retrospective medical records review was conducted for 29 patients who were diagnosed and treated for PG at an Australian tertiary center over 10 years, from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010.

- **Results**: A total of 29 patients had a diagnosis of PG, with a total of 35 admissions. Nearly all patients had immunosuppressant therapy, and 10 (35%) patients underwent surgery. Eight (28%) received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Complications secondary to medical therapy occurred in 23 (66%) of admissions, with the most common being poor blood sugar control in patients with diabetes (n = 6, 17%) and steroid-induced diabetes (n = 5, 14%). At discharge, 21 (72%) patients' ulcers had improved, and there were 4 (14%) inpatient deaths. At 6 months, 3 of 10 cases with available follow-up showed complete ulcer healing. Most of the patients (n = 8, 80%) who underwent combined medical and surgical therapy had ulcers that had either completely healed or improved at 6 months after discharge. All 3 patients who underwent split skin grafting under immunosuppressive cover (with 2 having hyperbaric oxygen therapy) experienced no postoperative graft failure or pathergy.

- **Conclusions**: Pyoderma gangrenosum remains a therapeutic challenge, with significant complications and morbidity from long-term medical treatment. Surgery should be considered in conjunction with combined hyperbaric therapy.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^114BrGjD]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Biologics**: TNF-α plays a pivotal role as a multifaceted proinflammatory cytokine, enhancing the activity of IL‐1β, IL‐6, and IL‐8. This, in turn, draws neutrophils and collaborates with TNF‐α itself to intensify the inflammatory state. Therapeutics like infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab have gained global utilization. Notably, etanercept targets only the soluble form of TNF‐α. Meanwhile, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab engage both soluble and membrane‐bound TNF‐α forms, prompting the apoptosis of cells expressing TNF‐α. Distinctively, certolizumab, lacking an Fc domain, is unable to trigger apoptosis or induce complement‐dependent or antibody‐dependent cell‐mediated cytotoxicity.

- **Pyoderma gangrenosum**: Elevated levels of TNF‐α and its receptors have been observed in PG‐afflicted skin. A burgeoning body of evidence advocates for the prioritization of TNF‐α inhibitors, especially infliximab and adalimumab, as primary treatment modalities. The effectiveness of infliximab in addressing PG has been validated in a randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial. Furthermore, anti‐TNF‐α inhibitors present as viable alternatives to mitigate the prolonged adverse effects associated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine.

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: TNF‐α is believed to be at the forefront of driving the inflammatory cascade. Notably, its concentration in both serum and HS‐affected skin is markedly elevated compared to healthy individuals, coinciding with raised levels of IL‐1β, IL‐10, and IL‐1.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^112TTVVB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin disease classified within the group of neutrophilic dermatoses and is clinically characterized by painful, rapidly evolving cutaneous ulcers with undermined, irregular, erythematous-violaceous edges. The pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum is complex and involves a profound dysregulation of components of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically predisposed individuals, with the follicular unit increasingly recognized as the putative initial target.

T helper 17/T helper 1-skewed inflammation and exaggerated inflammasome activation lead to a dysregulated neutrophil-dominant milieu with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36. Low-evidence studies and a lack of validated diagnostic and response criteria have hindered the discovery and validation of new effective treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Established and emerging treatments**: We review established and emerging treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum. A therapeutic algorithm based on available evidence is also provided.

- **Emerging treatments**: For emerging treatments, we review target molecules and their role in the pathogenesis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Successful treatment of severe refractory post-cesarean pyoderma gangrenosum with intravenous immunoglobulin [^112b1neV]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly progressing necrolytic ulceration of the skin. Proper treatment is crucial since it can result in devastating consequences. First-line treatments include systemic corticosteroids or cyclosporine. However, no standardized treatment regimens for refractory cases exist, and treatment outcomes are affected by underlying conditions. PG after cesarean section, which is believed to occur in association with underlying pregnancy- and parturition-related immune changes, is extremely rare, and all reported cases in the literature have been successfully treated with systemic or topical corticosteroids.

We report a case of a 32-year-old patient with severe PG occurring on her cesarean scar 3 days after the cesarean delivery. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids and first-line immunomodulatory agents resulted in insufficient response and serious complications. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was then initiated, and a rapid clinical response was seen. The corticosteroid dose was gradually decreased and ceased. IVIG infusion was continued for 3 months until complete recovery. Reactivation was not observed in a 1-year follow-up period. Due to its cost, IVIG infusion is less suitable as a first-line agent. However, IVIG may be an important therapeutic option in resistant postpartum PG, in which first-line agents have failed or led to complications.

### Two cases of maggot debridement therapy in pyoderma gangrenosum [^111xZ1XZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by cutaneous ulceration. PG primarily affects young and middle-aged adults with a preference for women and is often associated with an underlying systemic disease. Although its etiology is unclear, neutrophilic dysfunction, genetic risk factors, and chronic inflammation are thought to contribute to its pathogenesis. Patients with classic PG often present with single or multiple ulcers commonly on the lower extremities or trunk. In addition to medical treatment, wound care to combat the accumulation of necrotic tissue debris and biofilm formation is required for optimal management.

Wound debridement often presents a challenge in PG because of its feature of pathergy, or exacerbation in response to incidental or iatrogenic trauma, which has been reported in up to 31% of cases. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT), a centuries-old tradition in medical history of placing larvae over a wound to digest necrotic tissue, has seen a recent resurgence in popularity. The technology behind this technique has evolved with controlled therapeutic myiasis in which the live larvae are enclosed within a nylon mesh bag so they are obscured from view and cannot escape. In this case series, we review two cases of longstanding PG that were successfully debrided with MDT.

### Progression of pyoderma gangrenosum with angioinvasive fungus [^1134zY7L]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Use of anakinra for PG has been reported but remains rare in the literature. This treatment had promising results in our patient with a severely recalcitrant ulcer of more than a year's duration. However, this case involved an important complication in the management of PG requiring immunosuppression. Our patient was being treated with two immunosuppressants, cyclosporine and anakinra, and was therefore less able to mount an immune response. We were in the process of bridging the patient to anakinra, and her complication occurred at an especially vulnerable point in her care. Because she had had numerous flares previously, we were reluctant to transition rapidly to monomodal anakinra and planned to taper her cyclosporine over time. A repeat biopsy of her worsening plaque revealed AIF and required an immediate change in her treatment. This finding highlights the need to consider broadly any sudden change in clinical course in a patient whose condition is improving.

Patients with complicated PG are commonly iatrogenically immunosuppressed and have a break in the skin barrier, which makes them particularly susceptible to infections. Because of the exuberant inflammatory dysregulation, potent immunosuppressants, often in combination as described in our case, are necessary to attenuate the severely abnormal immune response. Therefore, patients with PG who are treated with anakinra (especially those on multimodal immunosuppression) require special attention, frequent surveillance, and a low threshold for biopsy if they have unexplained worsening of their disease.

### Comparison of the two most commonly used treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum: Results of the STOP GAP randomised controlled trial [^115XjVET]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

Participants received oral prednisolone (brand chosen according to local practice) 0.75 mg/kg/day in a single dose or ciclosporin (Neoral; Novartis) 4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. As this was a pragmatic trial, the dose could be adjusted according to normal practice, to a maximum of 1 mg/kg/day for prednisolone and 5 mg/kg/day for ciclosporin. Topical treatment was prohibited during the trial. In August 2011, after 82 participants had been enrolled, a protocol change was implemented due to a participant experiencing bowel perforation while receiving prednisolone 110 mg/day. As a result, ceiling doses of 75 mg/day for prednisolone and 400 mg/day for ciclosporin were established.

Participants were randomised (1:1) to treatment allocation using a web-based randomisation system hosted by Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, employing a computer-generated pseudorandom list with permuted blocks of randomly varying size between two and six (RALLOC add-on for Stata, TX). Randomisation was stratified by target lesion size (< 20 cm² or ≥ 20 cm²) and the presence or absence of underlying systemic disease. Due to resource limitations and the complexities of different dosing regimens and safety testing of the two drugs, blinding clinicians and participants to treatment allocation was not feasible. Consequently, clinicians and participants were informed of their treatment allocation once data had been irrevocably entered into the randomisation database. Treatment allocation was concealed from the statistician and blinded assessors of the digital images until completion of the trial.

### Etiology and management of pyoderma gangrenosum: a comprehensive review [^114qxMVd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by painful, necrotic ulceration. It typically affects patients in the third to sixth decades of life, with almost equal incidence in men and women. PG occurs most frequently on the lower extremities. Five clinical variants are currently recognized: classic, bullous, pustular, vegetative, and peristomal types. Half of PG cases are seen in association with systemic disease. Mimickers include infection, vascular insufficiency ulcers, systemic vasculitides, autoimmune disease, cancer, and exogenous tissue injury, among others. PG is often a diagnosis of exclusion, as there are no specific laboratory or histopathologic findings to confirm the diagnosis.

PG presents many clinical challenges: it is difficult to diagnose, is frequently misdiagnosed, and often requires a work-up for underlying systemic disease. Successful management of PG typically requires multiple modalities to reduce inflammation and optimize wound healing, in addition to treatment of any underlying diseases. Prednisone and cyclosporine have been mainstays of systemic treatment for PG, although increasing evidence supports the use of biologic therapies, such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, for refractory cases of PG. Here, we review the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of PG, as well as its associated conditions, diagnostic work-up, and management.

### Diagnostic criteria of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum: a Delphi consensus of international experts [^115njM4S]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin condition that is difficult to diagnose. Currently, it is a "diagnosis of exclusion", a definition not compatible with clinical decision making or inclusion for clinical trials.

- **Objective**: To propose and validate diagnostic criteria for ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum.

- **Evidence review**: Diagnostic criteria were created following a Delphi consensus exercise using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. The criteria were validated against peer-reviewed established cases of pyoderma gangrenosum and mimickers using k-fold cross-validation with methods of multiple imputation.

- **Findings**: The Delphi exercise yielded 1 major criterion — a biopsy of the ulcer edge demonstrating neutrophilic infiltrate — and 8 minor criteria: (1) exclusion of infection; (2) pathergy; (3) history of inflammatory bowel disease or inflammatory arthritis; (4) history of papule, pustule, or vesicle ulcerating within 4 days of appearing; (5) peripheral erythema, undermining border, and tenderness at the ulceration site; (6) multiple ulcerations, at least 1 on an anterior lower leg; (7) cribriform or "wrinkled paper" scar(s) at healed ulcer sites; and (8) decreased ulcer size within 1 month of initiating immunosuppressive medication(s). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that 4 of the 8 minor criteria maximized discrimination, yielding sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 90%, respectively.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: This Delphi exercise produced 1 major criterion and 8 minor criteria for the diagnosis of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum induced by secukinumab in a patient with psoriasis successfully treated with ustekinumab [^112BprQM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory condition characterized by painful and necrotic ulcerations with a neutrophil-rich infiltrate. Although its pathogenesis is not completely understood, pyoderma gangrenosum has been associated with autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Drug-induced pyoderma gangrenosum has also been reported in the literature, particularly in relation to new targeted therapies including infliximab, adalimumab, and rituximab. Herein, we present a novel case of pyoderma gangrenosum induced by secukinumab, an anti-interleukin (IL) 17A antibody, in a patient with psoriasis.

### New treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum and hidradenitis suppurativa: A review [^115CifN4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a relatively rare inflammatory skin disease, classified under the umbrella of neutrophilic hypodermal dermatoses. Clinically, it manifests as painful, rapidly progressing skin ulcers distinguished by their undermined, irregular borders and peripheral erythema. Globally, the estimated incidence of PG is between 3 and 10 cases per million individuals annually. PG indicates an autoinflammatory disorder, frequently correlating with other immune-mediated systemic diseases. The most common among these are inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematological malignancies. Moreover, PG can also be a feature of autoinflammatory syndromes such as pyogenic arthritis, PG, and acne (PAPA); PG, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PASH); and pyogenic arthritis, PG, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa (PAPASH).

The pathogenesis of PG is multifaceted, stemming from significant dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity in genetically susceptible individuals. An emerging understanding points to the follicular unit and, in cases involving the palms or soles, likely the sweat gland unit, as primary sites of initial impact. Such triggers precipitate a shift towards type 1/type 3-biased inflammation and heightened inflammasome activation in those predisposed. This cascade culminates in a dysregulated environment dominated by neutrophils, marked by elevated concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-36.

### Management of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum [^115X4uib]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the presentation, management, and outcome of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum at a specialist colorectal unit and develop a strategy for therapy.

- **Methods**: Patients with peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum were identified from a prospectively accrued Institutional Review Board-approved stoma database. Data were collected regarding demographics, disease status, history of illness, time to healing, and treatments used from the database and by chart review.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients presented between 1997 and 2002 with peristomal ulceration consistent with a diagnosis of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum. Diagnosis was predominantly clinically based on a classic presentation of painful, undermined peristomal ulceration. The underlying diagnosis was Crohn's disease in 11 patients, ulcerative colitis in 3, indeterminate colitis in 1, and posterior urethral valves in 1. At the time of development of peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum, the underlying disease was active in 69 percent of patients. Stoma care, ulcer debridement with unroofing of undermined edges, and intralesional corticosteroid injection were associated with a 40 percent complete response rate and a further 40 percent partial response rate. Of five patients who received infliximab, four (80 percent) responded to therapy. Complete response after all forms of therapy, including stoma relocation in seven patients, was 87 percent.

- **Conclusions**: Local wound management and enterostomal therapy are extremely important for patients with peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum. Infliximab may provide further benefit.

### Refractory postsurgical pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome: response to multimodal therapy [^1116KbCz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis that may be difficult to diagnose and treat. We presented a 41-year-old woman who required skin grafting following third-degree burns to her left breast. She suffered recurrent graft dehiscence and infections over many years, prompting elective bilateral reduction mammoplasty. She subsequently developed suture margin ulcerations unresponsive to topical therapies and antibiotics. Skin biopsies were non-specific, and a clinical diagnosis of PG was established.

Although initially responsive to corticosteroids, wounds promptly recurred following steroid taper. She was treated unsuccessfully with various immunomodulatory agents and underwent elective bilateral mastectomy. Following a mastectomy, she developed progressive deep chest wall ulcerations. She failed numerous immunomodulatory treatments, surgical wound closure, and negative pressure wound therapy. Ultimately, treatment with adalimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone, in addition to hyperbaric oxygen therapy, facilitated progressive healing. Our case highlights the role of collaborative multimodal therapy for the treatment of refractory PG.

### Guselkumab as a treatment option for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^113iVquG]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic cutaneous disorder characterized by single or multiple inflammatory nodules, papules, or pustules, which rapidly ulcerate with undermined borders, tenderness, and cribriform scarring upon healing. It is a challenging condition to identify due to initial misdiagnosis and mismanagement with physical debridement, propensity for superinfection, and its rarity. Furthermore, once the correct diagnosis is recognized, therapeutic challenges include promptly implementing an effective treatment to prevent rapid progression with concomitant morbidity and distress to the patient.

Treatment options include topical and intralesional steroids, systemic glucocorticoids, conventional immunosuppressants, biologics, and intravenous immunoglobulin. We present the novel use of guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL)-23, as an effective and safe treatment option for severe and recalcitrant PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^117Ti8oJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare inflammatory neutrophilic disorder with prototypical clinical presentations. Its pathophysiology is complex and not fully explained. Recent information regarding the genetic basis of PG and the role of auto-inflammation provides a better understanding of the disease and new therapeutic targets. PG equally affects patients of both sexes and of any age. Uncontrolled cutaneous neutrophilic inflammation is the cornerstone in a genetically predisposed individual.

Multimodality management is often required to reduce inflammation, optimize wound healing, and treat underlying disease. A gold standard for the management of PG does not exist, and high-level evidence is limited. Multiple factors must be taken into account when deciding on the optimum treatment for individual patients: location, number and size of lesion/ulceration(s), extracutaneous involvement, presence of associated disease, cost, side effects of treatment, as well as patient comorbidities and preferences. Refractory and rapidly progressive cases require early initiation of systemic therapy.

Newer targeted therapies represent a promising pathway for the management of PG, and the main focus of this review is the management and evidence supporting the role of new targeted therapies in PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum: An updated literature review on established and emerging pharmacological treatments [^112uWtET]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

**Topical treatment and wound care**: Topical corticosteroids (Level of Evidence 2B) can be effective for the treatment of mild or localized/unilesional pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Typically, high-potency corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are used, although others have also been reported to be beneficial. In a prospective cohort study, 49 patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream monotherapy, resulting in a median healing time of 136 days. Overall, 42.6% of patients healed completely at six months; however, 21.1% of those who healed had subsequent recurrences. The size of the lesion at presentation was noted to be a significant predictor of time to healing.

### Anakinra for recalcitrant pyoderma gangrenosum [^112k2Kso]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an autoinflammatory neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by rapidly enlarging, painful ulcers. Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the activity of IL-1α and IL-1β by competitively inhibiting IL-1 binding to the IL-1 type 1 receptor. We present a series of two patients with recalcitrant PG, who had limited therapeutic options, multiple comorbidities, and multiple previous treatment failures, who obtained 100% healing with anakinra. Compared with conventional first-line therapies for PG, the safety profile of anakinra may be preferable for patients with multiple comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of anakinra for PG.

### Pyoderma gangrenosum in pregnancy successfully treated with infliximab and prednisone [^112NKTRt]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis with an important inflammatory component that usually presents as a nonhealing ulcer. This cutaneous disorder has been associated with several systemic conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment options for PG in pregnancy are limited. We present a case of pyoderma gangrenosum in a gravid patient treated successfully with infliximab and prednisone.

### Use of dermal injection of activated protein C for treatment of large chronic wounds secondary to pyoderma gangrenosum [^114Pa3Ue]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a systemic disease that presents with cutaneous necrotizing ulceration, producing deep necrotic ulcers, usually with a raised, undermined, violaceous border. Treatment typically involves high-dose immunosuppressive drugs, but more recently, anti-tumor necrosis factor and monoclonal antibodies have been used. Activated protein C (APC) stimulates wound healing in patients with treatment-refractory skin ulcers, possibly by stimulating angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and preventing inflammation.

- **Aim**: To investigate whether APC may be beneficial as a treatment for ulcers related to cutaneous PG.

- **Methods**: Two patients were recruited with a clinical history and physical and histopathological evidence of acute PG. A total of 400 μg (1.0 mL) of APC was injected subcutaneously into the dermal edge of necrotic PG ulcers weekly for a total treatment period of 6 weeks. Photographs were taken, and clinical progress, ulcer size, and pain score were monitored during this period and after the cessation of treatment at weeks 8 and 12.

- **Results**: Over the 12 weeks of the trial, APC led to a reduction in wound size from 3.8 cm² to 0.8 cm² in patient 1 (78.9% decrease) and from 41 cm² to 16 cm² in patient 2 (70.0% decrease), and a reduction in pain scores from 10 to 0 (100% decrease) in both patients.

- **Conclusion**: Although this study is limited due to its small sample size and lack of a true placebo group, it indicates that APC has potential as a therapeutic option for patients with chronic skin ulcers from PG.

### Challenge of diagnosing pyoderma gangrenosum after caesarean section [^112STfb6]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic skin disease that leads to extensive, painful, necrotic ulcerations, particularly at surgical sites. As obstetric cases with pyoderma gangrenosum are rare and, therefore, often misdiagnosed initially, it is important to raise awareness about this rare complication. Here, we describe a patient who presented with pyoderma gangrenosum at the surgical site four days after undergoing a caesarean section. The erythema was initially misdiagnosed as a wound infection, and the patient, who was experiencing pain, underwent antibiotic treatment and surgical wound debridement. When the wound was unresponsive to these treatments, a dermatologist was consulted, who suspected pyoderma gangrenosum and began a high-dose corticosteroids therapy, which led to a fulminant improvement of the local wound. In conclusion, the rare diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a suspected surgical wound infection. Early interdisciplinary treatment is essential to avoid further complications.

### Genetic mutations in pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, and associated autoinflammatory syndromes: Insights into pathogenic mechanisms and shared pathways [^113AZs4u]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Genetic factors**: Recent studies have identified several genetic mutations associated with pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, and other autoinflammatory syndromes. These mutations shed light on their pathogenic mechanisms and suggest shared pathways among these conditions.

- **Pathogenic mechanisms**: The mutations contribute to inflammation and immune dysregulation, which are central to the disease process. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing targeted therapies.

- **Shared pathways**: The research highlights overlapping genetic and molecular pathways between these diseases. This overlap may facilitate the development of multi-targeted treatments that could be more effective than current monotherapies.

Further exploration of these genetic mutations can pave the way for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, offering hope for patients suffering from these challenging conditions.

### Targeted therapy with ixekizumab in pyoderma gangrenosum: A case series and a literature overview [^113aKYTE]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Biologics targeting specific cytokine mediators are reported to be safe alternative treatments. Inhibition of the tumor necrosis factor-α pathway through infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab is an effective measure. Skin biopsies of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) borders have shown elevated expression of IL-23A in multiple cases. Ustekinumab, an agent used for plaque psoriasis, has yielded multiple successful outcomes in PG cases without adverse effects. In addition, IL-1 antagonists may be effective in treating recalcitrant PG. O'Connor et al. reported 100% healing with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the activity of IL-1α and IL-1β, in 2 patients with multiple comorbidities.

Here, we have described 4 cases of PG that resolved with IL-17 inhibition from ixekizumab without reported adverse effects. Other immunomodulating agents, such as brodalumab (anti–IL-17R) and secukinumab (anti–IL-17A), are being proposed as available alternatives. The predominance of neutrophils in PG makes inhibiting neutrophil migration through IL-17 a promising target. Secukinumab, a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A, was used in a 50-year-old woman with PG. Complete response was observed within 3 months and with no recurrence after an additional 2 months of maintenance therapy. Brodalumab, an IL-17A receptor antagonist, has also yielded rapid resolution. In a 23-year-old man with acne conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and a 2-year history of PG (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa syndrome) refractory to systemic corticosteroids, adalimumab, and adjuvant methotrexate, brodalumab resulted in significant improvement.

### Resolution of therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum with upadacitinib [^116uttQq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which can be administered either orally or topically, represent a relatively new therapeutic option for several immune-driven dermatologic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. The potential exists to expand these indications to include therapy-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Due to the challenges in treating PG, which include therapy resistance, frequent relapses, and the inconsistent results of the limited and predominantly off-label treatment options, there is a distinct need for additional therapeutic strategies.

### Topical tacrolimus therapy for pyoderma gangrenosum [^116SEsBu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a type of neutrophilic disorder with a chronic clinical course. Immunosuppressive agents have been used for its management. Among them, corticosteroid is known as the most effective. However, other immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine A, have been selected for patients with PG who were refractory to systemic steroids. Herein, we report a case of PG resistant to systemic steroids, successfully treated with topical tacrolimus.

A fifty-four-year-old male had a 14-year history of PG. In 2002, necrotic ulcers appeared on his right leg that were refractory to oral prednisolone (30 mg/day). The application of topical tacrolimus to the border of the ulcers hastened epithelization of the ulcers and allowed for the reduction of oral prednisolone. Topical tacrolimus therapy may be an effective alternative for PG when the lesion is poorly controlled by corticosteroid.

### Efficacy of systemic dapsone treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum: A retrospective review [^113ovaPV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a neutrophilic dermatosis commonly treated with steroid immunosuppression. The utility of dapsone as a non-immunosuppressive treatment for PG has been reported in case reports and series. We sought to evaluate the response and tolerability of systemic dapsone therapy for treating PG.

- **Methods**: We reviewed PG patients treated with systemic dapsone at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital from 2000 to 2015. A treatment episode was defined as a minimum of 4 weeks of dapsone therapy with a documented response of complete, partial, or no improvement in wound healing.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven patients treated with systemic dapsone met inclusion criteria. Of these, 15.6% of treatment episodes demonstrated a response of complete healing, 81.3% demonstrated partial improvement, and 1 patient (3.1%) demonstrated no response. Nine patients (33.3%) had documented side effects of varying severity, with one (3.7%) requiring cessation of dapsone therapy.

- **Discussion**: Systemic dapsone therapy may represent an effective and tolerable non-immunosuppressive adjuvant treatment for PG wound healing.
