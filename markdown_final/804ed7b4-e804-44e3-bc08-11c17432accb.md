## Question

use of cefepime in patients with penicillin allergy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of cefepime in patients with a reported penicillin allergy, specifically regarding when it is safe to use, what precautions should be taken, and how to manage patients with high-risk allergy histories. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory labeling and what it actually says. Then, I should verify the modern evidence on cross-reactivity and risk stratification. Next, I will examine real-world safety data for cefepime specifically. After that, I need to outline practical administration strategies, including test dosing and monitoring. Finally, I should consider alternatives if cefepime is not appropriate and summarize a decision framework with stewardship implications.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because I need to ensure I'm not overstepping the FDA label. The FDA labeling for cefepime lists a contraindication to use in patients who have had immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime, other cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams, and it cautions that cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactams may occur in up to 10% of penicillin-allergic patients, so I should document that clearly before proceeding [^114MQCbc] [^112X7Bg2] [^114Subuc] [^1137ra1V] [^116kMjQg].

> Wait, let me verify the modern allergy literature, because the label's 10% figure is a legacy estimate and likely overstates current risk. Contemporary practice parameters and meta-analyses show that penicillin–cephalosporin cross-reactivity is far lower, roughly 2% overall and substantially less with later-generation cephalosporins that have dissimilar R1 side chains; importantly, cefepime is categorized among low-similarity cephalosporins, which supports safer use in many penicillin-allergic patients when clinically indicated [^112XeHaw] [^117XfV6o] [^112s9LNp].

> Hold on, I should verify cefepime-specific safety data rather than extrapolate from class effects. In a large inpatient β-lactam allergy program, direct challenges with third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation cephalosporins in patients with IgE penicillin histories yielded a 2.7% overall hypersensitivity reaction rate, with cefepime at 4.4% and an upper 95% CI around 8%; notably, there were no anaphylaxis events in the carbapenem cohort, which informs alternatives if risk is unacceptable [^116z1TPj] [^115KCBCH].

> I need to check the practical approach for low-risk penicillin allergy histories, because most patients fall into this group. For patients with unverified, nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, current guidance supports administering a cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain, such as cefepime, without prior testing or additional precautions, given the very low absolute risk of reaction; this aligns with stewardship goals to avoid unnecessarily broad alternatives [^116QR2zJ] [^112S9xZG].

> But wait, what if the history suggests high risk, such as anaphylaxis or multiple beta-lactam allergies. I should confirm that even in patients with prior penicillin anaphylaxis, a cephalosporin with a structurally dissimilar R1 side chain can be given without testing according to the 2022 practice parameters, though many clinicians still prefer a graded challenge or specialist input; if uncertainty remains, a two-step test dose with observation is reasonable [^116GdV5n] [^112S9xZG] [^1155cqDA].

> Let me think about administration logistics, because I need to ensure safe implementation. A pragmatic approach is to use a two-step test dose: give about 10% of the target dose and observe for 30–60 minutes, then administer the full dose with continued observation; this strategy has been widely adopted in inpatient pathways and balances timeliness with safety, and it is consistent with cephalosporin skin test concentrations and graded challenge frameworks when used [^111Jd4JZ] [^1155cqDA] [^116z1TPj].

> I should double-check monitoring and mitigation plans, because even a low risk is not zero. During and after dosing, monitor for urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If any immediate reaction occurs, stop cefepime and treat supportively with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids as indicated, and document the reaction clearly for future care [^112Ce8Kj] [^1137ra1V] [^116kMjQg].

> Next, I should review alternatives if cefepime is not suitable or if the allergy risk is deemed unacceptable. Carbapenems have extremely low cross-reactivity with penicillins and can generally be administered without prior testing, and aztreonam is safe except in the setting of ceftazidime allergy due to a shared side chain; these choices preserve beta-lactam activity while minimizing cross-reactivity risk [^114YP4n6] [^115cAsWQ] [^113UqJVZ].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship implications, because avoiding beta-lactams can worsen outcomes. Patients labeled penicillin-allergic experience increased use of broader-spectrum agents, higher risks of C. difficile, longer length of stay, and worse surgical outcomes; removing blanket EHR warnings against cephalosporins increased appropriate cephalosporin use without increasing adverse events, reinforcing the safety and importance of delabeling and risk-stratified beta-lactam use [^113DLCHE] [^114evtzP].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. For low-risk, unverified penicillin allergy, proceed with cefepime using standard dosing and consider a two-step test dose if local policy requires. For high-risk histories, either choose a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin and administer with a graded challenge, or select a carbapenem or aztreonam as appropriate. Throughout, align with the FDA label's caution while applying modern, side chain–based risk stratification to optimize safety and stewardship [^114MQCbc] [^112XeHaw] [^112S9xZG].

Cefepime can be used in patients with a reported penicillin allergy when the reaction was **non-anaphylactic** [^116QR2zJ] or the allergy is unverified, as cross-reactivity is low (about 2–4%) [^117XfV6o] and is largely determined by side-chain similarity [^112s9LNp]. For patients with a **confirmed anaphylactic penicillin allergy**, use caution and consider allergy consultation or a graded challenge if cefepime is essential [^11649gzS]. Avoid cefepime in patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to any beta-lactam [^114MQCbc], and monitor closely for hypersensitivity reactions during administration [^notfound].

---

## Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cefepime

- **Historical perspective**: Early estimates suggested ~10% cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, but this was based on older data and impure preparations [^117XfV6o].

- **Current evidence**: Recent studies show cross-reactivity is much lower, approximately 2–4%, and is primarily due to similarities in side chains rather than the beta-lactam ring [^117XfV6o] [^112s9LNp].

- **Cefepime-specific data**: Cefepime has a unique side chain, further reducing the likelihood of cross-reactivity with penicillins [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) provide clear recommendations on the use of cephalosporins, including cefepime, in patients with penicillin allergy:

- **Unverified or non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy**: Cephalosporins, including cefepime, can be administered without prior testing or additional precautions [^116QR2zJ] [^112S9xZG].

- **Confirmed anaphylactic penicillin allergy**: Cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains (including cefepime) may be administered cautiously, preferably with allergy consultation or a graded challenge [^112XeHaw] [^11649gzS].

- **Avoidance**: Patients with a history of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to any beta-lactam antibiotic should avoid cefepime [^114MQCbc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting cefepime use in penicillin-allergic patients

Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated the **safety of cefepime** in patients with penicillin allergy:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: A meta-analysis of 19 prospective and 2 retrospective studies found that the risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains (including cefepime) is approximately 2.11% (95% CI: 0.98–4.46) [^112XeHaw].

- **Clinical trials**: Clinical trials have consistently shown low rates of allergic reactions to cefepime in patients with penicillin allergy, with no significant increase in severe hypersensitivity reactions compared to non-allergic patients [^notfound].

- **Real-world data**: Observational studies have reported safe administration of cefepime in patients with penicillin allergy, with minimal adverse reactions [^116z1TPj].

---

## Risk stratification and management strategies

To minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, clinicians should **stratify patients** based on their allergy history:

| **Allergy history** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|
| Unverified or non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy | Administer cefepime without prior testing or additional precautions [^116QR2zJ] |
| Confirmed anaphylactic penicillin allergy | - Allergy consultation <br/> - Graded challenge <br/> - Or alternative antibiotics (e.g. carbapenems, aztreonam) [^112W47Ct] [^114YP4n6] [^113UqJVZ] |
| Immediate hypersensitivity to any beta-lactam | Avoid cefepime [^114MQCbc] |

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When administering cefepime to patients with a penicillin allergy, clinicians should:

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for signs of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis [^112Ce8Kj].

- **Emergency preparedness**: Ensure appropriate medical support and emergency medications are readily available during administration [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential allergic reactions and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms occur [^notfound].

---

## Alternative antibiotics

If cefepime is contraindicated or not tolerated, **alternative antibiotics** include:

- **Carbapenems**: Low cross-reactivity with penicillins and suitable for severe infections [^114YP4n6].

- **Aztreonam**: Safe for patients with penicillin allergy, except in cases of ceftazidime allergy due to shared side chains [^113UqJVZ].

- **Non-beta-lactam antibiotics**: Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, or macrolides may be considered based on clinical context and patient-specific factors [^111ha7rk].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Cefepime has a favorable safety profile in patients with penicillin allergy, with **low rates of hypersensitivity reactions** and minimal cross-reactivity. Its broad-spectrum activity makes it a valuable option for treating severe infections, particularly in hospitalized patients [^112XeHaw].

---

Cefepime can be safely administered to patients with a reported penicillin allergy, particularly when the allergy is **unverified or non-anaphylactic** [^116QR2zJ]. For patients with confirmed **anaphylactic penicillin allergy**, caution is advised, and allergy consultation or a graded challenge may be necessary [^115KCBCH]. Overall, **cefepime** provides a safe and effective alternative to penicillins, with minimal risk of cross-reactivity [^112XeHaw].

### Penicillin skin testing… [^112vP8gX]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive. In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7. 1% of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Moreover, anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate of one per 52, 000 persons. Data from the Kaiser health care system reported that among 3, 313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any IgE-mediated symptoms from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.

### Diagnosis and management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins [^1142FnYh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics. Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with use of a specific cephalosporin, as a cross-reaction between different cephalosporins or as a cross-reaction to other β-lactam antibiotics, namely, penicillin. Historically, frequent reports of anaphylaxis following administration of first- and second-generation cephalosporins to patients with a history of penicillin allergy led to the belief of a high degree of allergic cross-reactivity. More recent evidence reveals a significantly lower risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and the newer-generation cephalosporins. The current thought is that a shared side chain, rather than the β-lactam ring structure, is the determining factor in immunologic cross-reactivity. Understanding the chemical structure of these agents has allowed us to identify the allergenic determinants for penicillin; however, the exact allergenic determinants of cephalosporins are less well understood. For this reason, standardized diagnostic skin testing is not available for cephalosporins as it is for penicillin. Nevertheless, skin testing to the cephalosporin in question, using a nonirritating concentration, provides additional information, which can further guide the work-up of a patient suspected of having an allergy to that drug. Together, the history and the skin test results can assist the allergist in the decision to recommend continued drug avoidance or to perform a graded challenge versus an induction of tolerance procedure.

### Controversies in drug allergy: beta-lactam hypersensitivity testing [^112mhbPi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

All beta-lactam use is associated with a certain rate of adverse reactions. Many of these adverse reactions result in an allergy to the beta-lactam being entered into the patient's medical record. Unfortunately, only a small minority of these recorded allergies are clinically significant immunologically mediated drug hypersensitivity. An unconfirmed allergy to beta-lactams is a significant public health risk, because patients so labeled typically do not receive narrow-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins when clinically indicated. The alternative antibiotics they receive result in poorer clinical outcomes, increased incidence of serious antibiotic-resistant infections, prolonged hospitalizations, and greater health care utilization. There is a wide variation in beta-lactam allergy incidence and prevalence around the world, based in part on the specific beta-lactams used and overused. There is a wide variation in specific protocols used to confirm current tolerance of beta-lactams and remove these inaccurate allergy reports. Harmonizing testing protocols, when possible, may lead to more widespread use of narrow-spectrum beta-lactams, when clinically indicated, and improve patient safety worldwide. Further research is needed to better understand the regional differences in reporting beta-lactam allergy as this relates to regional differences in beta-lactam use and overuse, the frequency of clinically significant immunologically mediated beta-lactam hypersensitivity, and the optimal testing strategies to confirm current tolerance, based on presenting clinical symptoms.

Study Definitions

We included all oral and parenteral antibiotic treatment courses dispensed or administered to enrolled members in the ambulatory or hospital setting for 12 antibiotic categories: penicillin, cephalosporin, other β-lactams, clindamycin, macrolides, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, quinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, vancomycin, and other antibiotics (a detailed list is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement). Antibiotic use that occurred outside membership periods was excluded. We combined periods of exposure into the same course of antibiotic use if they involved the same drug by the same route and were separated by less than 2 days. The earliest date that the antibiotic was dispensed or administered was used to assign each course to the period before (January 1, 2017-December 12, 2017) or after (December 28, 2017-December 31, 2018) the change in the alert on December 20, 2017; we excluded data on antibiotics dispensed or administered in the 7 days before and 7 days after the change in the alert. The patient's penicillin allergy status was ascertained on the day before the start date of each antibiotic course.

We used any entry in the EHR allergy field to define the presence of a drug allergy. We did not require confirmed IgE-mediated or T-cell–mediated hypersensitivity. Although misclassification of penicillin allergy status in the EHR can occur, we used the presence of an allergy record in the EHR to define allergy because this record triggers the automated warning that was being studied. We extracted complete histories of antibiotic allergies to identify periods of allergies to antibiotics in the 12 categories during the study. New antibiotic allergies were defined as new allergy records after use of an antibiotic in the same category within 30 days of the start of the treatment course.

Potential cases of cephalosporin-associated anaphylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy were identified with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes T78.2 or T88.6 recorded on the same day that a course of parenteral cephalosporins was started or within 1 day of starting a course of oral cephalosporins. Each potential case was manually audited by chart review (E.M. and W.W.C. for the intervention site and M.T.N. for the comparison site) to determine whether it met the current diagnostic criteria for antibiotic-associated anaphylaxis. As a proxy for antibiotic treatment failure, we used the start of a new course of antibiotics in a different category within 30 days of the start of a course of monotherapy.

### Cefepime hydrochloride (Cefepime hydrochloride and dextrose) [^113eTNmR]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Before therapy with Cefepime for Injection and Dextrose Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterials has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefepime for Injection and Dextrose Injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.2 Neurotoxicity

Serious adverse reactions have been reported including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving a dosage adjustment appropriate for their degree of renal impairment.

In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of cefepime and/or after hemodialysis. If neurotoxicity associated with cefepime therapy occurs, discontinue cefepime and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.3 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefepime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^1111RM79]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, there has been concern about penicillin and cephalosporin cross-reactivity, but we now know this has been largely overstated. Cephalosporin allergy is mediated by a different mechanism than penicillin allergy: penicillin allergy is typically mediated by breakdown products of the β-lactam ring, whereas cephalosporin allergy is primarily mediated by the R1 side chain, and so cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains are likely to be safe, even in patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergies. Cefazolin has a completely unique R1 side chain and for this reason it may be the safest of all cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy. Safety of cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy labels has been demonstrated on a large scale by a very large health system (Kaiser Permanente Southern California), which removed the EMR automatic warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy labels and found an increase in cephalosporin use without adverse safety signals. Furthermore, a recent small study of US patients with allergist-verified penicillin allergies demonstrated that the overwhelming majority tolerated cephalosporins.

We identified only 1 patient with a penicillin allergy label who had a severe allergic reaction in the perioperative window. However, this patient had a concomitant listed cephalosporin allergy, and thus an alternative antibiotic would have been recommended as per our hospital guidelines. The patient had received cefazolin on numerous occasions before this event. We surmise that this patient likely developed sensitization to cefazolin given the previous administrations. Otherwise, there were no episodes of anaphylaxis attributable to antibiotic administration in our cohort. This is not surprising because perioperative anaphylaxis is rare, with reported frequencies of 1 in 1,250 operations to 1 in 20,000 operations. Our low reaction rate to cefazolin is consistent with those in other studies that have demonstrated that surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels have rates of reaction to cefazolin similar to the general population rate. Our results suggest on a larger scale that patients with penicillin allergy labels do not seem to have high reaction rates to cefazolin, and cefazolin use can be implemented safely and effectively in the perioperative population, after excluding patients with severe delayed reactions.

### Assessment of the frequency of dual allergy to penicillins and cefazolin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114s5deF]. JAMA Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Cefazolin is the preoperative antibiotic of choice because it is safer and more efficacious than second-line alternatives. Surgical patients labeled as having penicillin allergy are less likely to prophylactically receive cefazolin and more likely to receive clindamycin or vancomycin, which results in higher rates of surgical site infections.

Objective

To examine the incidence of dual allergy to cefazolin and natural penicillins.

Data Sources

MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched without language restrictions for relevant articles published from database inception until July 31, 2020.

Study Selection

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase was performed for articles published from database inception to July 31, 2020, for studies that included patients who had index allergies to a natural penicillin and were tested for tolerability to cefazolin or that included patients who had index allergies to cefazolin and were tested for tolerability to a natural penicillin. A total of 3228 studies were identified and 2911 were screened for inclusion.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted by 2 authors. Bayesian meta-analysis was used to estimate the frequency of allergic reactions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Dual allergy to cefazolin and a natural penicillin.

Results

Seventy-seven unique studies met the eligibility criteria, yielding 6147 patients. Cefazolin allergy was identified in 44 participants with a history of penicillin allergy, resulting in a dual allergy meta-analytical frequency of 0.7% (95% credible interval [CrI],0.1%-1.7%; I2 = 74.9%). Such frequency was lower for participants with unconfirmed (0.6%; 95% CrI, 0.1%-1.3%; I2 = 54.3%) than for those with confirmed penicillin allergy (3.0%; 95% CrI, 0.01%-17.0%; I2 = 88.2%). Thirteen studies exclusively assessed surgical patients (n = 3884), among whom 0.7% (95% CrI, 0%-3.3%; I2 = 85.5%) had confirmed allergy to cefazolin. Low heterogeneity was observed for studies of patients with unconfirmed penicillin allergy who had been exposed to perioperative cefazolin (0.1%; 95% CrI, 0.1%-0.3%; I2 = 13.1%). Penicillin allergy was confirmed in 16 participants with a history of cefazolin allergy, resulting in a meta-analytical frequency of 3.7% (95% CrI, 0.03%-13.3%; I2 = 64.4%). The frequency of penicillin allergy was 4.4% (95% CrI, 0%-23.0%; I2 = 75%) for the 8 studies that exclusively assessed surgical patients allergic to cefazolin.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that most patients with a penicillin allergy history may safely receive cefazolin. The exception is patients with confirmed penicillin allergy in whom additional care is warranted.

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a meta-analysis [^1172WSHK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

Method

Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

Results

A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), and cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin allergic patients; no increase was observed with second generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI, 0.6 to 2.1) or third generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

Conclusion

First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: a review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

β-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

Observations

Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (< 5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (> 10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple β-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources.

Conclusions and Relevance

Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship.

### A systematic review: can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins? [^113RYC9R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

Results

Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, .06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%); this included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

Conclusions

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions is very low, but caution is still advised. Cross-reactivity rates may be higher between cephalosporins and carbapenems; however, minimal data are available.

### A review of evidence supporting the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for prescribing cephalosporin antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients [^111kxW7F]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, evidence-based guidelines endorse the use of cephalosporin antibiotics for patients with reported allergies to penicillin, for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and acute otitis media. Many physicians, however, remain reluctant to prescribe such agents. Although such concern is understandable, lack of consistent data regarding exactly what constitutes an initial penicillin-allergic reaction and subsequent cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins may be preventing many patients from receiving optimal antibiotic therapy. This article reviews evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation. Included is an examination of the types and incidence of reactions to penicillins and cephalosporins; the frequency of cross-reactivity between these 2 groups of agents; experimental and clinical studies that suggest that side chain-specific antibodies predominate in the immune response to cephalosporins, thereby explaining the lack of cross-sensitivity between most cephalosporins and penicillins; the role of skin testing; and the risks of anaphylaxis. Specific recommendations for the treatment of patients on the basis of their responses to previously prescribed agents are summarized.

### Use of cephalosporin with penicillin hypersensitivity… [^111PAhjQ]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Penicillins are the most common cause of drug-induced, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Cephalosporin, which is a beta-lactam antibiotic like penicillin, can cause a similar reaction. Concern about the use of cephalosporins in patients who are allergic to penicillin has prompted the use of antibiotics that do not contain a beta-lactam ring. However, this may result in decreased efficacy, greater cost, and increased antimicrobial resistance. Skin tests can be used to identify IgE antibodies to penicillin. Patients with positive results are desensitized to cephalosporin or given an alternate drug. Currently, the best approach to patients with a reported history of penicillin allergy is uncertain. Romano and associates conducted a prospective study to evaluate the use of cephalosporins in volunteer patients allergic to penicillin.

Skin tests for three generations of cephalosporins were applied, and challenge doses of cefuroxime or ceftriaxone were administered to patients with negative skin tests for all of the cephalosporins tested. Of the 128 patients who had a history of penicillin reaction and a positive result on penicillin skin testing, 14 had a positive skin test for cephalosporins. None of the volunteer patients experienced adverse reactions after the specific cephalosporin challenges. Cephalosporin skin tests at a concentration of 2 mg per mL seem to be reliable indicators of immediate hypersensitivity risk to cefuroxime and ceftriaxone. Of the three potential clinical options in the management of patients allergic to penicillin with compelling needs for cephalosporins, the authors recommend skin testing with cefuroxime or ceftriaxone. If the testing is negative, a graded challenge is appropriate.

Medicolegal issues may arise, however, because current practice guidelines recommend desensitization. |Skin test with cefuroxime or ceftriaxone. * If negative, give a graded challenge of the tested cephalosporin. This option appears to be safe based on this study, avoids the need for admission to the intensive care unit, results in a shorter delay to reaching full antibiotic strength, and clarifies the question of cephalosporin allergy. However, medicolegal issues remain if desensitization is not performed. |.

### Cross-reactivity in β-lactam allergy [^114WKhib]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

β-Lactam drugs (penicillins, amoxicillin, and cephalosporins) account for 42.6% of all severe drug-induced anaphylaxis. In this review, we focus on clinically significant immunologic cross-reactivity in patients with confirmed penicillin allergy to cephalosporins, and the structural involvement of the R 1 and R 2 chemical side chains of the cephalosporins causing IgE-mediated cross-reactivity with penicillin and other cephalosporins. Skin tests predict IgE-mediated reactions and showed cross-reactivity between penicillins and early generation cephalosporins that shared side chains, but confirmatory challenge data are lacking. Later-generation cephalosporins, which have distinct side chains, do not have any skin test cross-reactivity with penicillin/amoxicillin. There is debate as to the involvement of R 2 side chains as the antigenic determinants that cause IgE-mediated hypersensitivity with various cephalosporins. Avoidance of cephalosporins, when they are the drug of choice in a penicillin-allergic individual, results in significant morbidity that outweighs the low risk of anaphylaxis. We conclude that there is ample evidence to allow the safe use of cephalosporins in patients with isolated confirmed penicillin or amoxicillin allergy.

### Understanding penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity, and antibiotic selection in the preoperative setting [^115uPo2Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergies are reported by 8% to 15% of the US population, but up to 95% of these allergies do not correspond to a true allergy when tested. Recent studies have demonstrated that having a penicillin allergy label (PAL) results in a 50% increased odds of surgical site infection among patients reporting a penicillin allergy entirely attributable to the use of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic (primarily clindamycin or vancomycin). This study provides a review of the prevalence of PAL, the cross-reactivity with cefazolin, immunogenic components of cefazolin and penicillin, and current guidelines for preoperative antibiotic selection in patients with PALs. On understanding these principles, a new set of guidelines and a risk stratification tool are proposed for assessing allergies and determining appropriate antibiotic choice, dosage, and timing in the orthopaedic preoperative setting.

### Penicillin allergy impact and management [^116j53Sr]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

There is international evidence that penicillin allergies are associated with inferior prescribing and patient outcomes.

### Cefixime (Suprax) [^113wHeN7]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefixime PO (also known as Suprax, Suprax):
- **Anaphylaxis**: use extreme caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy due to the risk of cross-hypersensitivity.
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefixime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including cefixime, are with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Exacerbation of phenylketonuria**: use caution in patients with phenylketonuria, as chewable tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine.
- **Prolonged PT**: use caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, poor nutritional state, previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy, or receiving a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy. Monitor PT and administer vitamin K as indicated.

### Efficacy and safety of cefepime: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dCnye]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with enhanced coverage against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We did a systematic review of randomised trials that compared cefepime with another beta-lactam antibiotic, alone or with the addition of a non-beta-lactam antibiotic to both study groups. We searched Central, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, new US Food and Drug Administration drug applications, conference proceedings, and references of the included studies. Two reviewers independently did the search and data extraction. 57 trials were included. All-cause mortality-the primary outcome-was higher with cefepime than other beta-lactams (risk ratio [RR] 1.26 [95% CI 1.08–1.49]). Sensitivity analyses by the trials' methodological quality revealed higher RRs for trials reporting adequate allocation-sequence generation (1.52 [1.20–1.92]) and allocation concealment (1.36 [1.09–1.70]). Baseline risk factors for mortality were similar. No significant differences between groups in treatment failure, superinfection, or adverse events were found. This Review provides evidence and offers possible explanations for increased mortality among patients treated with cefepime in randomised trials.

### Overview of penicillin allergy [^116UuVNH]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergy to penicillin is the most commonly reported antibiotic allergy. However, most patients who report a positive history of a prior reaction to penicillin are not found to be allergic to penicillin upon skin testing. Often, this history is vague or based on a parent's recollection of an event that occurred in the distant past. Avoidance of penicillin based on self-reported allergic history alone often leads to the use of an alternate antibiotic with greater cost or side effect profile. Patients with a negative skin test to both major and minor determinants may generally be given penicillin, with a statistical risk of developing an allergic reaction similar to that observed in the general population. A more cautious approach in these cases where the degree of suspicion is low, an allergic etiology is unproven, or there is a negative skin test, is to do a graded challenge. If the skin test is positive, an alternate antibiotic should be used. If, however, an alternate antibiotic is not available, then desensitization may be performed, but there are limitations to desensitization as well, and tolerance is not permanent. Avoidance of cephalosporins may be recommended in cases of penicillin allergy, but newer generation cephalosporins have demonstrate less cross-reactivity to penicillin than earlier generation ones. Desensitization protocols for cephalosporins are available but not standardized. The mechanisms of antibiotic sensitization are not clearly understood.

### Outcomes from an inpatient β-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^115KCBCH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study provides insight into "real world" β-lactam cross reactivity in patients with specified IgE penicillin allergy histories, including patients with severe IgE histories. Prior observational studies of cephalosporins administered to penicillin allergy patients largely excluded patients with higher-risk penicillin allergy histories because they were selected out. Patients with severe IgE histories have an increased risk of true allergy and β-lactam cross reactivity. Although the later (third-, fourth-, or fifth-) generation cephalosporins overall had a low 2.6% HSR rate in patients with IgE penicillin allergy histories, the cefepime HSR rate was 4.4% with a 95% CI of up to 8.0%. It remains unclear whether later-generation cephalosporins need to be initiated with a test-dose challenge (many clinicians initiate these cephalosporins in penicillin allergy histories with a full dose). Of 56 carbapenem test-doses administered to patients with IgE penicillin allergy histories (including almost half with severe IgE histories), there were no HSRs, which prompts us to consider modification of the penicillin hypersensitivity pathway to indicate that carbapenems be administered by a full dose. For mild penicillin allergy histories, full-dose challenges for first- or second-generation cephalosporins are a safe modification that would facilitate the use of any cephalosporin for any patient with mild penicillin allergy histories. This change could benefit acute-care obstetric and perioperative patients where cefazolin or cefoxitin are indicated.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^114YP4n6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Carbapenems — patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). The overall reported incidence of carbapenem allergy is 0.3%-3.7%. In a systematic review including 838 patients with proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, carbapenem reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients (95% CI: 3.1%-5.9%), and among those with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295) only 1 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.006%-1.9%) reacted. Another meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (1127 patients) found cross-reactivity to any carbapenem as 0.87% (95% CI: 0.32%-2.32%), and in a prospective study of 211 patients with skin test–confirmed penicillin allergy all tolerated carbapenems. Patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, as long as it is not a severe delayed cutaneous or organ-involved reaction, can receive carbapenems without prior testing, though in certain situations such as multiple drug allergy or significant patient anxiety a graded drug challenge might be preferred.

### Penicillin and beta-lactam hypersensitivity [^113SAAeH]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Penicillin allergy-getting the label right [^114Ergdr]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Penicillin i allergy is a potentially serious adverse reaction that impacts on antibacterial treatment options. Although it is commonly reported and recorded in medical records, only a minority of patients with a label of penicillin allergy actually have the condition confirmed. The term 'allergy' may be incorrectly applied to adverse reactions that do not have an immunological basis and inappropriate labelling of penicillin allergy can lead to the unnecessary avoidance of penicillins and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Here, we discuss key features that help to distinguish patients at low or high risk of having a true penicillin allergy, summarise what is known about the risk of allergic reactions to other beta-lactam antibacterials in patients with penicillin allergy and discuss the steps to consider when assessing a label of penicillin allergy.

Hypersensitivity reactions to direct test-dose challenges

Overall, 570 penicillin allergy patients who had IgE histories or unknown histories directly challenged with cephalosporins (third, fourth, or fifth generation) or carbapenems [Fig. 1 (A)]. Of the 514 patients directly challenged with third-, fourth-, or fifth-generation cephalosporins, 14 (2.7%) had HSRs (95% CI, 1.5%–4.5%). The highest HSR rate was to cefepime (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.1%–8.0%). Of 56 patients direct challenged to carbapenems, none had HSRs.

We suggest that in patients with a history of an unverified nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. We suggest that in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins, penicillin skin testing and drug challenge should be performed prior to administration of a penicillin therapy. We suggest against penicillin skin testing in patients with a history of nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy prior to administration of a penicillin therapy. We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions. We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, aztreonam may be administered without prior testing unless there is a history of ceftazidime allergy.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113WKhSr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporin antibiotics are commonly prescribed for a wide range of infections as a result of their effectiveness and broad-spectrum activity. These drugs rarely cause diverse immunologic reaction phenotypes across different age groups, including IgE-mediated reactions, benign T-cell–mediated exanthems as well as serum sickness–like, single organ damage, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. At the same time, as a result of their common use, a cephalosporin allergy label is relevant for 1.3% to 1.7% of the general population in the United States.

Despite major progress in understanding more about reactions to cephalosporins, specific and validated testing strategies of cephalosporin allergy evaluation are less well defined. In the last few years, there is evidence that immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins as well as their cross-reactivity with penicillin appears to be largely related to antigenic responses to R1 side chains rather than β-lactam ring cross-reactivity or R2 side chains. Data on cross-reactivity among delayed reaction types are not as well characterized.

With improvements in our understanding of cross-reactivity and reaction risk assessment, the joint 2022 Drug Allergy Practice Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) now advocate a simplified and risk-stratified evaluation for cephalosporin allergy.

For immediate reactions to cephalosporins, the 2022 practice parameter suggests stratifying patients on the basis of potential IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions versus nonanaphylactic reactions. For those patients with nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a direct challenge should be performed for a cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains to determine tolerance. In contrast, for administration of cephalosporins with similar side chains and for the less common anaphylactic reaction history, a negative cephalosporin skin test result to a parenteral cephalosporin is required before challenge to determine tolerance. Cephalosporin skin tests have not been validated and have lower sensitivities than penicillin, so ideally, negative results should always be followed by graded challenges.

Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### Risk of meticillin resistantandin patients with a documented penicillin allergy: population based matched cohort study [^113DLCHE]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

In this study, patients with documented penicillin allergy had an increased incidence of broad spectrum antibiotic use, including the extended Gram positive spectrum antibiotics vancomycin and linezolid, which should be reserved for patients with suspected or known MRSA (or vancomycin resistant enterococci for linezolid). Use of the most narrow spectrum antibiotic that is effective for a given infection is a cornerstone of evidence based treatment for infection and is responsible antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship committees enforce this aim in the hospital setting, with evaluations for penicillin allergy occasionally included in stewardship efforts. This analysis emphasises the importance of performing outpatient antibiotic stewardship and the role that penicillin allergy evaluations might play. Although diagnostic testing for penicillin allergy was developed in the 1960s, and has recently garnered the support of a variety of professional organizations, less than 0.1% of patients with a penicillin allergy label undergo confirmatory testing. Evaluation of penicillin allergy often involves a skin test, and if the result of skin testing is negative, a challenge dose of penicillin or amoxicillin is administered under medical observation. With these evaluation tools, evaluation of penicillin allergy has a more than 99% negative predictive value, takes less than three hours to perform, and costs about $220 (£165; €188; 2016 currency conversion). Previous observational cohorts have shown that more than 90% of patients with listed penicillin allergies can be safely treated with penicillins.

### The use of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a literature review [^117HEXUX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The practice of avoiding cephalosporin administration to penicillin-allergic patients persists despite the low rate of cross reactions between both groups of antibiotics.

Objective

The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the commonly held belief that patients with a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin have a significantly increased risk of an allergic reaction to cephalosporins.

Materials and Methods

Articles were identified through a computerized search of MEDLINE from 1950 to the present using the search terms "penicillin$", "cephalosporin$", "allerg$", "hypersensitivity", and "cross-react$". All articles were reviewed, and additional sources cited in them were added to the literature review.

Results

Penicillins have a cross allergy with first-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 4.8; confidence interval 3.7–6.2) and a negligible cross allergy with second-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 1.1; confidence interval 0.6–2.1). Laboratory and cohort studies confirm that the R1 side chain is responsible for this cross reactivity. Overall cross reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is lower than previously reported, though there is a strong association between amoxicillin and ampicillin with first- and second-generation cephalosporins that share a similar R1 side chain.

Conclusions

Although a myth persists that approximately 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy will have an allergic reaction if given a cephalosporin, the overall cross-reactivity rate is approximately 1% when using first-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with similar R1 side chains. However, a single study reported the prevalence of cross reactivity with cefadroxil as high as 27%. For penicillin-allergic patients, the use of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains than the offending penicillin carries a negligible risk of cross allergy.

### Association between removal of a warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy and antibiotic prescribing [^114evtzP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, removal of a warning in the EHR to avoid cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergies was associated with increased prescribing of cephalosporins and decreased prescribing of some second-line antibiotics. Overall rates of adverse antibiotic-associated reactions or specific serious cephalosporin-associated morbidities were similar before and after removal of the warning. Removing the warning was not associated with a reduction in the known morbidities associated with an unconfirmed penicillin allergy. Greater attention should be given to the accuracy with which patients are labeled as having a penicillin allergy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^111ha7rk]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — management with penicillin allergy: Recent publications indicate that the risk of a serious allergic reaction to second- and third-generation cephalosporins in patients with penicillin or amoxicillin allergy appears to be almost nil and no greater than the risk among patients without such allergy, so patients allergic to amoxicillin with a non–type 1 (late or delayed, > 72 hours) hypersensitivity reaction can safely be treated with cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, and patients with a history of a serious type 1 immediate or accelerated (anaphylactic) reaction to amoxicillin can also safely be treated with these agents. Clinicians may wish to determine individual tolerance by referral to an allergist for penicillin and/or cephalosporin skin-testing before initiation of therapy. The susceptibility of S pneumoniae to cefdinir, cefpodoxime, and cefuroxime varies from 60% to 75%, and the susceptibility of H influenzae varies from 85% to 100%. In young children (< 2 years) with a serious type 1 hypersensitivity to penicillin and moderate or more severe sinusitis, it may be prudent to use a combination of clindamycin (or linezolid) and cefixime; linezolid has excellent activity against all S pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, but lacks activity against H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Alternatively, a quinolone such as levofloxacin may be prescribed, and resistance of pneumococcus and H influenzae to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and azithromycin is sufficient to preclude their use for acute bacterial sinusitis in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity.

### Cefepime hydrochloride (cefepime) [^1137ra1V]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Before therapy with Cefepime for Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefepime for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.2 Neurotoxicity

Serious adverse reactions have been reported including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving a dosage adjustment appropriate for their degree of renal impairment. In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of cefepime and/or after hemodialysis. If neurotoxicity associated with cefepime therapy occurs, discontinue cefepime and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.3 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefepime for Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113P9GHM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

On the subject of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the practice parameter suggests again stratifying patients on the basis of anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite the simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent to which this approach is incorporated into allergy practice remains unclear. Therefore, we surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess current practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real case examples.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116BgFS4]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergy and cephalosporin use in acute otitis media (AOM) — cross-reactivity data and guidance indicate that the previously cited cross-sensitivity rate in penicillin-allergic patients is "approximately 10%" but likely an overestimate, cross-reactivity is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins, and cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to cross-react with penicillin; a Joint Task Force statement reported a 0.1% cephalosporin reaction rate in selected penicillin-allergic patients and they recommend a cephalosporin when there is no severe and/or recent penicillin allergy reaction history and skin testing is not available.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^113UqJVZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Monobactams (aztreonam) — use with beta-lactam allergy histories: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, aztreonam may be administered without testing unless there is a history of ceftazidime allergy (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). There is no cross-reactivity for IgE- or T-cell–mediated hypersensitivity between penicillin and aztreonam, and no cross-reactivity has been demonstrated between cephalosporins and aztreonam, except for ceftazidime (due to shared R1 side chain of ceftazidime). Patients who are penicillin- and cephalosporin-allergic can safely receive aztreonam without prior testing, with the exception of those confirmed allergic to ceftazidime, and conversely patients who are aztreonam-allergic may be treated with all beta-lactams except for ceftazidime.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111MyMBw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.1% of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy. Moreover, in studies that have incorporated penicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons with reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, ranging from 1.5% to 6.1%. Studies in preoperative surgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated for cardiovascular surgery or orthopedics, have rates of skin test positivity < 8.5%. However, when patients with high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, 99% of patients could receive ß-lactams. In hospitalized patients and other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of validated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are 2.5%–9.0%.

Cross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins

Penicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. This structural similarity has led to considerable confusion regarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for allergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-allergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with reported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment with such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone and cefixime) have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients (< 1%) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Moreover, anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate of one per 52,000 persons. Data from the Kaiser health care system reported that among 3,313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin (mostly first generation), no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any IgE-mediated symptoms (e.g. anaphylaxis or urticaria) from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shown that it has 2 side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin, which suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of nonconfirmed penicillin allergy also had the label of cefazolin allergy, suggesting that most patients with a history of penicillin allergy may safely be prescribed cefazolin.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to β-lactam antibiotics [^11649gzS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians commonly encounter patients with a history of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, since about 10% of the population reports such an allergy. At the same time, it is known that about 90% of these patients are not truly allergic and could safely receive beta-lactam antibiotics. Instead, these patients are treated unnecessarily with alternate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases costs and contributes to the development and spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria. In the case of penicillin, relevant allergenic determinants that elicit immune responses are known. Hence, validated diagnostic skin testing to detect the presence of drug-specific IgE antibodies is available. For non-penicillin beta-lactams, the immunogenic determinants that are produced by degradation are unknown, and diagnostic skin testing is of more limited value. Ideally, patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be evaluated when they are well and not in immediate need of antibiotic therapy. Patients who are found to be penicillin skin test-negative may be safely treated with all beta-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive a penicillin-class antibiotic via rapid desensitization, and only in cases when an alternative agent cannot be substituted. Penicillin skin test-positive patients may be safely treated with monobactams. The extent of allergic cross-reactivity between penicillin arid cephalosporins/carbapenems is uncertain; therefore penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive these antibiotics via cautious graded challenge or desensitization. Identification of patients who erroneously carry a label of beta-lactam allergy leads to improved utilization of antibiotics and slows the spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

### Is there cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins? [^116PEi4P]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to determine the risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin exposure in those with prior penicillin reactions.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database. We selected all patients receiving a prescription for penicillin followed by a prescription for a cephalosporin and identified allergic-like events within 30 days after each prescription. Allergic events were defined by 2 sets of codes: 1 more restrictive, 1 more inclusive. Comparison was made with a population of patients receiving a prescription for a penicillin followed by a prescription for a sulfonamide antibiotic.

Results

A total of 3,375,162 patients received a penicillin; 506,679 (15%) received a subsequent cephalosporin. Among patients receiving a penicillin followed by a cephalosporin, the unadjusted risk ratio of an allergic-like event for those who had a prior event, compared with those who had no such prior event, narrowly defined, was 10.1 (confidence interval 7.4–13.8). The absolute risk of anaphylaxis after a cephalosporin was less than 0.001%. The unadjusted risk ratio for sulfonamide antibiotic, rather than cephalosporin after penicillin allergic-like events was 7.2 (confidence interval 3.8–13.5).

Conclusion

Patients with allergic-like events after penicillin had a markedly increased risk of events after either subsequent cephalosporins or sulfonamide antibiotics. Cross-reactivity is not an adequate explanation for this increased risk, and the risk of anaphylaxis is very low. Thus, our data indicate that cephalosporins can be considered for patients with penicillin allergy.

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^1123f96L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 1% to 2% of the population reports a cephalosporin allergy label (CAL). However, many of these labels are misclassified as allergies, and only approximately 8% of CALs correlate with positive skin testing. Furthermore, individuals with true prior IgE-mediated reactions, estimated to be 10%/year or higher, may have loss of hypersensitivity over time and are not truly allergic when tested and rechallenged. Carrying a label of cephalosporin allergy is consequential and often leads to treatment with alternative agents with inferior outcomes, infections owing to multidrug-resistant organisms, and higher health care–related costs. Current literature supports risk stratification of penicillin allergy labels and has described successful delabeling of low-risk labels via direct oral challenge (DOC). Koo et aldescribed that a validated history-based risk stratification approach to penicillin allergy labels is applicable to CALs, with the exception that cephalosporins administered intravenously are considered of higher risk owing to higher pretest probability for positive testing for IgE-mediated allergy. Although evidence has supported the safety of delabeling children through DOCs to cephalosporins, evidence to support generalizability to adults is lacking. In a group of adult outpatients with low-risk CALs, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of removing CAL using DOCs.

### Why was there ever a warning not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin "Allergy"? [^112rygzX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

It is now well-established that avoiding β-lactam antibiotics, when they are the drugs of choice, results in significantly worse long-term global outcomes for patients. Much of this avoidable morbidity has been caused by widespread warnings in electronic health care record systems not to use cephalosporins in the setting of penicillin allergy. High rates, up to 1000-fold higher than now seen, of immunologically mediated reactions were associated with early impure penicillin preparations. This instilled a rational fear of β-lactam-associated anaphylaxis in generations of physicians. In the late 1970s, several editorial comments regarding a potential increased risk to patients given cephalosporins who had a history of a penicillin allergy resulted in the warning that became imbedded in the culture of medicine. Over the past 40 years, compelling data have been developed that refute this warning and showed that the risks of avoiding cephalosporins outweighed the benefits. In late 2017, Kaiser Permanente Southern California completely removed all warnings not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin allergy. The results have recently been published in JAMA Network Open. This Rostrum article provides some of the backstory on the establishment and removal of this warning for physicians who trained over the past 30 years.

### Cefixime (cefixime 400 mg UD) [^114kxNYX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities) have been reported with the use of cefixime.

Before therapy with cefixime is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. If this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised because cross hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibiotics has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to cefixime occurs, discontinue the drug.

5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefixime, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment

The dose of cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)].

5.4 Coagulation Effects

Cephalosporins, including cefixime, may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.

5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing cefixime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Penicillin allergy (PA) evaluation for surgical prophylaxis — patients who report a PA may be evaluated for true hypersensitivity and high-risk reactions, and delabeling a penicillin-allergic patient can facilitate appropriate use of a preoperative prophylactic beta-lactam antibiotic and improve outcomes (Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence). PA labels are common ("8% to 25%"), yet in a test-dose study 40 of 1046 patients (3.8%) had confirmed beta-lactam hypersensitivity and only 3 had a severe reaction. PA reporting has been associated with increased SSI risk (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02–2.22) and with less cefazolin use (12% vs 92%; p < 0.001) and more clindamycin (49% vs 3%; p < 0.001), vancomycin (35% vs 3%; p < 0.001), and gentamicin (24% vs 3%; p < 0.001). Another study found higher SSI among those reporting PA versus those without penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (OR 3.26; 95% CI, 2.71–3.93), underscoring the importance of delabeling.

### Assessing the safety of increased outpatient cephalosporin use following the modification of penicillin allergy cross-reactivity alerts [^117NXpx8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Concerns about penicillin-cephalosporin cross-reactivity have historically led to conservative prescribing and avoidance of cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy labels, potentially causing suboptimal outcomes. Recent evidence suggests a lower risk of cross-reactivity, prompting a reassessment of alert systems.

Objective

To assess the impact of limited penicillin cross-reactivity alerts on outpatient cephalosporin use and the incidence of adverse reactions in a healthcare setting.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study compared cephalosporin prescribing and adverse reactions in patients labeled as penicillin-allergic before and after limiting penicillin cross-reactivity alerts in the electronic medical record at a large academic medical center.

Results

Among 17,174 patients (8,131 pre- and 9,043 post-implementation), there was a statistically significant increase in outpatient cephalosporin prescribing by 8% (P < .001). The use of alternative antibiotic classes decreased. There was no statistically significant increase in adverse events pre- and post-implementation (0.036%-0.058%, P = 0.547), and no severe events were attributable to cross-reactivity. The alert modification reduced alerts by 92% (P < .001).

Conclusion

The reduction of penicillin-cephalosporin cross-reactivity alerts was associated with increased cephalosporin use, without a significant increase in adverse reactions. This demonstrates that the practice is safe and decreases alert burden.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^114D1YLa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Lastly, it is noteworthy that the preintervention rate of cephalosporin use at our institution was much higher than previously published rates. We believe this high baseline rate of cephalosporin use reflects previous institutional antibiotic stewardship efforts including an initiative by the hospital Antimicrobial Stewardship Team to update patients' allergy histories after tolerating cephalosporins to "penicillin tolerates cephalosporins". Patients in our preintervention group also had a higher rate of a listed "penicillin tolerates cephalosporins" label and a higher rate of previous cephalosporin prescriptions in the EMR, both of which would bias our findings toward the null hypothesis. Despite this and strong institutional practices in general promoting cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy labels, our intervention still showed a meaningful increase in cefazolin use in surgical patients, which lends further strength to the power of this initiative.

Taken as a whole, our results hold great significance for antibiotic stewardship in surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels. SSIs are devastating for patients and the health care system. They are the leading cause of health care–associated infections and associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. Furthermore, using alternative second-line antibiotics increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that a first-line antibiotic (ie, cefazolin) is safe for most patients with penicillin allergy labels. On the basis of these findings, we advocate for similar interventions, when appropriate, for surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels across the country and for consideration of national and international guidance to enhance administration of cefazolin in perioperative patients with penicillin allergy labels.

Objective

To describe medical negligence and malpractice cases in which a patient with a known penicillin allergy received a β-lactam and experienced an adverse reaction related to the β-lactam.

Data Sources

Lexis-Nexus, Westlaw, and Google Scholar were searched.

Study Selections

Medical negligence and malpractice cases were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: the plaintiff had a known penicillin allergy, received a β-lactam, and experienced an adverse event. All United States federal and state cases were eligible.

Results

Twenty-seven unique cases met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen cases involved the receipt of a penicillin-based antibiotic; of these cases with a known legal outcome, the plaintiff (patient or representative) prevailed or settled in 3 cases and defendants (providers) prevailed in 7 cases. Seven cases involved the receipt of a cephalosporin; of these cases with a known legal outcome, the plaintiff settled with physicians before trial in 1 case and defendants prevailed in 3 cases. Two cases involved the receipt of a carbapenem. Defendants prevailed in one case and the legal outcome of the other case is unknown. In cases in which the defense successfully moved for summary judgment, judges cited a lack of scientific evidence demonstrating a cephalosporin or carbapenem was contraindicated for a patient with a penicillin allergy.

Conclusion

The cases with published legal outcomes found limited professional liability for clinicians who prescribed cephalosporins or carbapenems to a patient with a known penicillin allergy. These results may decrease the litigation fears of practitioners and risk managers within health care systems.

Direct Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone

Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g. gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash) (Box 2). In addition, a family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with ß-lactam antibiotics. This practice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and for preoperative prophylaxis (,–).

BOX 2
Low-risk history in patients who report penicillin allergy

Gastrointestinal symptoms

Headache

Pruritis without rash

Localized rash

Delayed onset rash (> 24 hours)

Symptoms unknown

Family history of penicillin or another drug allergy

Patient denies allergy but it is on the medical record

Patients at Low Risk for Oral Challenge

If the patient gives only a low-risk history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that includes symptoms such gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonspecific pruritus, or gives a family history only, an oral challenge can be administered to document the absence of allergy (Box 2). If the reaction occurred in the distant past (> 10 years), the likelihood is reduced even further. The risk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased over time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was reported.

Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy

Skin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if any indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Testing is also indicated as a potential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin allergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical record (i.e. delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing does not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with a negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to confirm the negative status.

Persons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by an amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin therapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and for whom no other clinical options exist (e.g. neurosyphilis and syphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist and desensitized before initiating treatment.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

Objective

To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

Methods

A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

Results

Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after vs before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .001). Seven adverse drug reactions occurred during guideline-driven test doses, with no significant difference in rate (3.9% vs 6.1%, P = 0.44) or severity (P > .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoro quinolones (15.3% vs 3.3%, P < .001).

Conclusion

The implementation of an inpatient antibiotic prescribing guideline for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy was associated with an almost 7-fold increase in the number of test doses to β-lactams without increased adverse drug reactions. Patients assessed with guideline-driven test doses were observed to have significantly decreased alternative antibiotic exposure.

### Inpatient β-lactam test-dose protocol and antimicrobial stewardship in patients with a history of penicillin allergy [^1155cqDA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Penicillin allergy is the most commonly reported drug allergy in hospitalized patients, resulting in increased second-line antibiotic use, nosocomial infections, and health care use. Given that most patients are not truly allergic, a safe strategy that empowers the admitting physician is needed.

Objective

To assess the effect on antibiotic prescribing practices for hospitalized patients with penicillin allergy using a validated intervention.

Methods

An intervention was implemented to educate health care professionals on management of patients with penicillin allergy using a validated risk stratification algorithm to guide testing and antibiotic use. Thirty days of control data using current standard of care was compared with 60 days of postintervention data measuring documentation of penicillin allergy history and antibiotic selection.

Results

The relative use of cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics increased by 121.2% (P = 0.03) and 256% (P = 0.04), respectively, without an increase in adverse drug reactions. There was a decrease in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin, 67.2% (P = 0.04); quinolones, 33.3% (P = 0.31); carbapenems, 81.9% (P = 0.08); and aztreonam, 73.8% (P = 0.18).

Conclusion

The antibiotic choice in patients admitted to the hospital with a reported penicillin allergy can be improved by better evaluation of the allergy history and the use of a risk stratification guideline.

### A streamlined approach to optimize perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of penicillin allergy labels [^114yUnLR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with penicillin allergy labels often receive alternative antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis, as opposed to first-line cephalosporins (cefazolin/cefuroxime). Provider misconceptions about the risk of cross-reactivity likely drive this prescribing behavior, which is problematic because of its association with increased risk of surgical-site infections.

Objective

To develop, implement, and assess the safety of a streamlined approach to perioperative antibiotic selection for surgical patients with a penicillin allergy label, to reduce the use of second-line antibiotics.

Methods

A multidisciplinary task force developed an institutional algorithm for antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic surgical patients. The percentage of patients receiving a first-line cephalosporin was compared before and after algorithm utilization. The safety of this approach was assessed via chart review of all patients who received epinephrine or diphenhydramine in the operating room, or diphenhydramine within 24 hours postoperatively, assessing for any adverse reactions to cephalosporin administration.

Results

Between September 2016 and May 2019, 9.3% of surgical patients had documented penicillin allergy (n = 2296). At baseline, 22% of these patients received a cephalosporin, with an increase to more than 80% after algorithm implementation (P < .0001). Among 551 patients with penicillin allergy label who received a cephalosporin after algorithm implementation, no immediate allergic reactions requiring epinephrine were identified; 1 patient had a delayed rash that did not require cephalosporin discontinuation. Three patients received diphenhydramine for "itching" without rash in the setting of concomitant narcotic administration.

Conclusions

Using a streamlined algorithm, we were able to significantly reduce the use of second-line antibiotics in penicillin-allergic surgical patients without severe adverse reactions.

### Antibiotic stewardship interventions improve choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty in patients with reported penicillin allergies [^112szDKe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate cefazolin, the preferred prophylaxis in a total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Regardless, patients with a reported penicillin allergy are less likely to receive first-line perioperative antibiotics as a result of inaccurate penicillin allergy documentation and misconceptions regarding cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins. The over-reporting of penicillin allergies and the safety of cephalosporins in patients with reported penicillin allergies have been well established throughout the evidence [13].

Questions/Purposes

The study sought to answer two questions: (1) Do antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA? (2) What is the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy?

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of orthopaedic patients older than 18 years who underwent a primary elective TJA at a 261-bed community hospital. The study had two periods: the preintervention period ran from March 1, 2017 to August 30, 2017 and the postintervention period was from March 1, 2019 to August 30, 2019. A total of 396 patients with a history of a documented penicillin allergy underwent a THA or TKA during the study periods. After reviewing every fourth patient with a history of a documented penicillin allergy who met study inclusion criteria and excluding those patients who had a codocumented cephalosporin allergy, a total of 180 patients with a documented penicillin allergy were evaluated (90 patients in the preintervention group and 90 patients in the postintervention group). To answer our first study question, regarding whether antibiotic stewardship interventions improve adherence to appropriate prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with a documented penicillin allergy undergoing primary TJA, we evaluated appropriate antibiotic usage pre- and postintervention. To answer our second study question, concerning the risk of allergic or adverse reactions secondary to cefazolin use in patients with a documented penicillin allergy, we reviewed signs of allergic reactions in patients who received cefazolin for a primary TJA and had a documented penicillin allergy.

Results

Postintervention antibiotic use was more appropriate (91% [82 of 90] versus 54% [49 of 90], risk ratio 1.67 [95% confidence interval 1.37 to 2.04]; p < 0.01), particularly in patients with nonsevere allergy (preintervention: 47% [36 of 76] versus postintervention: 96% [76 of 79]; p < 0.01). No patients had signs of an allergic reaction related to cefazolin, including eight patients with severe penicillin allergy.

Conclusion

A multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention increased the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective primary TJA. Patients with nonsevere penicillin allergies, even those reporting hives or local swelling, tolerated cefazolin. Antibiotic stewardship interventions can be implemented across institutions to expand cephalosporin use in patients with a reported penicillin allergy within orthopaedic TJA patients.

### Lack of allergic cross-reactivity to cephalosporins among patients allergic to penicillins [^116TFbqT]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

There are some contradicting data about clinical allergic cross-reactivity to cephalosporins among patients who have had a previous allergic reaction to penicillins. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of administering cephalosporins to penicillin-allergic patients. The diagnosis of penicillin allergy was made by positive skin tests to penicillin reagents and/or provocation tests with the penicillin suspected of causing the allergic reaction. To assess the clinical tolerance to cephalosporins, 41 well-characterized penicillin allergic patients diagnosed by positive skin tests and/or provocation tests were challenged with three cephalosporins that do not share the same side chain to the penicillin that induced the reactions: cephazoline, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone. Skin prick and intradermal tests with all cephalosporins tested were negative. All penicillin-allergic patients tolerated therapeutic doses of the three cephalosporins tested (cephazoline, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone) without any ill effect. These results indicate that the risk of suffering from an allergic reaction on administering cephalosporins to penicillin-allergic patients seems to be very low, provided that cephalosporins with a different side chain to the penicillin responsible for the allergic reaction are used.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation should be performed proactively in patients with a penicillin allergy label [^116pcNYG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Penicillin allergy is the most common drug allergy in the US population. A penicillin allergy label is associated with poor patient outcomes including increased hospital length of stay, increased perioperative infections, and overall increased mortality. A penicillin allergy evaluation accurately identifies approximately 9 of 10 patients who, despite reporting a history of penicillin allergy, can receive penicillins safely. Penicillin allergy evaluations should be offered proactively to healthy patients during routine visits, including children and pregnant women, in advance of antibiotic need.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^113o9UXs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Reported penicillin allergies affect 10% to 15% of patients and are a threat to appropriate administration of first-line surgical-site infection (SSI) antimicrobial prophylaxis. The scope of this impact is enormous: SSIs are the most common and costly health care–associated infections, affecting 2% to 5% of surgeries in the United States. The aims of administering first-line surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are to prevent SSI, lower the risk of multi–drug-resistant organisms, and reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Cefazolin is the medication of choice for most procedures because of its desirable spectrum of activity, favorable safety profile, and low cost. The presence of a penicillin allergy label alone is associated with a 50% increased risk of SSI, likely mediated by reduction in use of first-line antibiotics (most often cefazolin). When alternative antibiotics are used for surgical prophylaxis, there are demonstrably higher rates of SSIs, prosthetic joint infections, surgical revisions, and multi–drug-resistant infections across a broad range of surgical specialties and procedures.,

Although reported penicillin allergies commonly affect prescribing decisions, there is good evidence that most are inaccurate: more than 95% of these patients can tolerate penicillin safely and even more can tolerate cephalosporins. Patients are often inaccurately labeled because either a patient was mislabeled at the time of the inciting event or because, in cases of true allergy, most cases will be outgrown within 10 years. For this reason, such patients are referred to as having penicillin allergy labels, termed to connote the common mislabel. Moreover, a plethora of research now suggests that even in true IgE-mediated penicillin allergies, there is limited cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, especially cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains. In congruence with this understanding, the Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology released updated drug allergy practice parameters in 2022, suggesting that patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin can be given cephalosporins with structurally dissimilar R1 side chains, such as cefazolin. However, other national infectious disease, anesthesiology, and surgical guidelines have not been updated to this effect, and this has not yet been implemented in many surgical centers.

### Cephalosporin allergy [^112rgep1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to cephalosporins may occur because of sensitization to cephalosporin determinants shared with penicillin or to unique cephalosporin haptens. The exact nature of the haptenic determinants resulting from the degradation of currently available cephalosporins is incompletely understood. Cephalosporin skin testing or specific IgE immunoassays have limited clinical utility. Patients with a history of allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin may be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins. Skin testing for an allergy to penicillin may be helpful in patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a clinical indication for cephalosporin use. Most of these patients have negative tests and should not be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other β-lactams [^1157buWX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and paediatric allergy and for other clinicians practising allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a Web-based process and all comments carefully considered. Included in the guideline are epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, molecular structure, formulations available in the UK and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants. Sections on the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins are included. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is discussed in detail. Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures have been made. Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is given in a separate section. An algorithm to help the clinician in the diagnosis of patients with a history of penicillin allergy has also been included.

### Association between removal of a warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy and antibiotic prescribing [^115Xi53q]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Increases in drug-resistant organisms are a global threat, and thus antibiotic stewardship is a critical priority. Approaches to antibiotic stewardship include both reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics and choosing the most appropriate agents. β-Lactams are the preferred treatment for many common pathogens, such as group A and B Streptococcus species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus.β-Lactams are also the preferred prophylactic agents for dental procedures and many other surgical procedures. Physicians may, however, choose a second-line antibiotic in the presence of drug allergies or potential cross-reactivity with β-lactams.

Point-of-care alerts to inform prescribing decisions by physicians and to enhance patient safety have been among the reasons for use of electronic health records (EHRs). In response to Meaningful Use requirements issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, many EHRs include an imbedded function to warn against prescribing cephalosporins to patients with a penicillin allergy. This warning is not consistent with current evidence. For example, no clinically significant immunologic cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins has been shown. Furthermore, avoiding β-lactams when they are the drug of choice is associated with worse outcomes, such as increased risk of surgical site infections, nephrotoxicity, and Clostridioides difficile infection. In addition, use of second-line antibiotic classes in patients with penicillin allergies may be associated with other adverse effects, decreased safety, and antimicrobial resistance.

In December 2017, after a review of the literature and clinical deliberations among leaders in infectious diseases in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Southern California removed a warning in its EHR to avoid prescribing cephalosporins to patients with a penicillin allergy. In the current study, we examined the association of this change with choice of antibiotic, incidence of antibiotic allergy, incidence of cephalosporin-associated anaphylaxis, and rate of penicillin allergy–associated morbidities in patients with a penicillin allergy.

### Cefepime hydrochloride [^116kMjQg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Before therapy with cefepime for injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to cefepime for injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.2 Neurotoxicity

Serious adverse reactions have been reported including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving a dosage adjustment appropriate for their degree of renal impairment. In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of cefepime and/or after hemodialysis. If neurotoxicity associated with cefepime therapy occurs, discontinue cefepime and institute appropriate supportive measures.

5.3 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefepime for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.

CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Penicillin allergy to cephalosporin administration — We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified (not confirmed) nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Moderate. Given that < 5% of patients with an unverified penicillin allergy are truly allergic, and ~2% of those who are truly allergic will experience a reaction to a cephalosporin, when they are given cephalosporins directly, the chance of a reaction is very low with a linked probability of ~0.1% (ie, 0.05 x 0.02 = 0.001). Retrospective studies of parenteral cephalosporin administration to patients with a history of penicillin allergy, without prior penicillin skin testing, have shown rare cephalosporin allergic reactions.

### Misconceptions surrounding penicillin allergy: implications for anesthesiologists [^117Rbe8u]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, often with a cephalosporin, is the mainstay of surgical site infection prevention guidelines. Unfortunately, due to prevalent misconceptions, patients labeled as having a penicillin allergy often receive alternate and less-effective antibiotics, placing them at risk of a variety of adverse effects including increased morbidity and higher risk of surgical site infection. The perioperative physician should ascertain the nature of previous reactions to aid in determining the probability of the prevalence of a true allergy. Penicillin allergy testing may be performed but may not be feasible in the perioperative setting. Current evidence on the structural determinants of penicillin and cephalosporin allergies refutes the misconception of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cefazolin, and there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of anaphylaxis in cefazolin-naive, penicillin-allergic patients. A clinical practice algorithm for the perioperative evaluation and management of patients reporting a history of penicillin allergy is presented, concluding that cephalosporins can be safely administered to a majority of such patients.

### Outcomes from an inpatient β-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^116p3Y5r]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergies, reported by up to 15% of hospitalized patients, impact acute-care antibiotic prescribing. Cephalosporins, antibiotics important to the treatment of common inpatient infections, are inconsistently prescribed to patients reporting penicillin allergies despite low cross reactivity. – Alternatives to β-lactam antibiotics may be less effective, and can lead to adverse sequelae for patients, most notably healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection.

Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy do not have clinically significant hypersensitivity and can be safely treated with penicillins and other β-lactams. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is encouraged by antibiotic stewardship guidelines, penicillin skin testing (PST) is operationally challenging in acute-care settings. Furthermore, many of the antibiotics generally used in hospitalized patients after a negative PST can be administered safely without preceding PST with a full-dose or test-dose challenge. –

The Partners HealthCare System (PHS) guideline for inpatients with β-lactam allergy histories is an antibiotic stewardship tool that includes penicillin and cephalosporin hypersensitivity pathways that direct PST when institutionally available and needed (ie, patients reporting IgE-mediated allergy symptoms to a penicillin who require a penicillin or cross-reactive cephalosporin), but it encourages direct full-dose and test-dose (ie, standardized 2-step graded) drug challenges. Prior to this study, our results demonstrated that the guideline safely increased β-lactam antibiotic use at 2 academic medical centers. – In this study, we sought to further assess the safety of guideline-directed β-lactam antibiotic test doses after implementation of the computerized guideline throughout 5 acute-care PHS hospitals with varied resources.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: a retrospective study of a health system intervention [^114TrHLq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this retrospective cohort study of surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels suggest that a hospital-wide guideline change (with targeted education and support) can meaningfully enhance cephalosporin use as prophylaxis for surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that cefazolin was safely used in a large cohort of patients with penicillin allergy labels, without severe reactions. Surgical, anesthesiology, allergy, and infectious disease guidelines that support the use of cefazolin in surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels should be an important next step to improve rates of SSIs and would likely have an enormous public health impact.

Key messages

- SSIs are common and costly. Penicillin allergy labels often compromise preferred SSI prophylaxis (eg, cefazolin). They are associated with increased rates of SSIs, surgical revisions, and multi–drug-resistant infections.
- This retrospective cohort study found that a hospital-wide intervention to increase the use of cefazolin in surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels was effective and safe. This is the largest study of its kind to date.
- On the basis of our study, we advocate for national and international multidisciplinary joint guidelines across surgical, anesthesiology, allergy, and infectious disease specialty societies to promote the use of cefazolin in appropriate surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels.
