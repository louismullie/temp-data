## Question

Leuprolide for Cushing disease cure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether leuprolide (a GnRH agonist) has any role in curing Cushing's disease, and specifically whether the provided documents support such a role or a curative effect of leuprolide in Cushing's disease, and if not, what the established curative strategies are and how "cure" is framed in this context, and I should also outline what medical therapies are documented and their intent, not cure, in these references, and then synthesize a conclusion based strictly on the cited material, step-by-step [^111n3VLr] [^111vmR86] [^1152pcUj].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base first by checking whether leuprolide or any GnRH agonist appears among the treatment options in these references, because if it is absent entirely, that strongly argues there is no endorsed role here; after scanning, I find zero mentions of leuprolide or GnRH agonists in the guideline-directed or review-listed therapies for Cushing's disease, which consistently catalogue pituitary-directed agents, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors, and glucocorticoid receptor antagonism, but do not include GnRH agonists anywhere in recommended pathways [^112jwJFW] [^116k6MmB] [^1143izE2].

> Next, I should review what therapies are actually documented for Cushing's disease and in what context, to ensure I'm not missing an indirect niche; pituitary-directed therapy includes pasireotide and cabergoline, adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors include ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mitotane, and etomidate, and peripheral antagonism includes mifepristone, with combination therapy sometimes used, but none of these classes involve GnRH agonists, and the effectiveness data emphasize biochemical control rather than cure in medically managed patients [^114BNMfr] [^1122NkDV] [^112jwJFW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "cure" before I define it properly in this literature; cure or remission in Cushing's disease is overwhelmingly tied to successful tumor-directed surgery, with selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy as first-line for pituitary Cushing's and cure rates dependent on tumor size and surgical expertise, whereas medical therapies are generally framed as bridging, adjunctive, or alternatives when surgery fails or is not feasible, not as curative modalities [^1152pcUj] [^111vmR86] [^116qVGdS].

> I should confirm that pituitary-directed medical therapy with pasireotide is indeed positioned for those not cured by or not candidates for surgery and is not labeled as curative, which aligns with the FDA-labeled indication for Signifor in adult Cushing's disease where surgery is not an option or not curative, again reinforcing medical control rather than surgical cure as the paradigm for such agents [^116zZ34A] [^114zdGzv].

> Next, I will examine adrenal-directed control therapies to ensure I'm not overlooking a class shift that could implicate GnRH agonists; the literature consistently highlights adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors like osilodrostat, ketoconazole, and metyrapone as key agents to reduce cortisol excess, often with careful titration or block-and-replace strategies, but again there is no role for GnRH agonists in these pathways, and their intent is control of hypercortisolism, not definitive cure [^1143izE2] [^113HwKEL].

> But wait, what if there is an indirect mechanistic niche via aberrant receptor expression where GnRH agonists could theoretically modulate cortisol, perhaps in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia; let me think about the receptor-targeted concepts discussed here, which focus on somatostatin and dopamine receptors in corticotroph adenomas and ectopic adrenal receptors such as those highlighted in newer adrenal-pathway discussions, yet the cited reviews do not extend these concepts to GnRH agonists for Cushing's disease, and they do not provide any clinical evidence supporting leuprolide in this setting [^115hFZkk] [^111BCWsB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if leuprolide's widespread endocrine use might have been extrapolated here, but I should double-check that none of the major guidelines or meta-analyses include it as a therapeutic option for Cushing's disease; they do not, and instead consistently recommend surgery for cure and list the same medical classes for control without reference to GnRH agonists, which effectively rules out leuprolide's role based on these sources [^111n3VLr] [^111vmR86] [^1122NkDV].

> Synthesis and bottom line: Based strictly on the provided documents, leuprolide is not mentioned, studied, or recommended for Cushing's disease, and no role — curative or otherwise — is supported for GnRH agonists; the curative approach for Cushing's disease remains selective transsphenoidal pituitary surgery when feasible, whereas medical therapies such as pasireotide, cabergoline, steroidogenesis inhibitors, and mifepristone are used to control hypercortisolism when surgery is contraindicated, incomplete, or relapse occurs, and they are not characterized as curative in these references [^1152pcUj] [^111vmR86] [^111n3VLr].

---

Leuprolide is **not effective for curing Cushing disease** because it does not suppress ACTH or cortisol in corticotroph adenomas. The **standard of care is transsphenoidal surgery** [^1152pcUj] [^111vmR86], with medical therapy (pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, or mifepristone) reserved for persistent or recurrent disease [^112jwJFW]. Leuprolide is not recommended by guidelines and should not be used for Cushing disease.

---

## Mechanism of action of leuprolide

Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist that initially increases LH and FSH, then suppresses them with continued use, reducing sex steroids. It is used for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and precocious puberty, but **does not target ACTH or cortisol**.

---

## Pathophysiology of cushing disease

Cushing disease is caused by a **pituitary corticotroph adenoma secreting excess ACTH**, driving adrenal cortisol overproduction [^116LF6pP]. Management aims to normalize cortisol, control the tumor, and reduce morbidity and mortality [^1174CXFh].

---

## Standard treatment options for cushing disease

The **standard treatment options** for Cushing disease include:

- **Transsphenoidal surgery**: First-line therapy [^1152pcUj] with remission rates of 65–90% for microadenomas and lower for macroadenomas.

- **Radiation therapy**: Considered for persistent or recurrent disease after surgery [^112gMZKb].

- **Medical therapy**: Used when surgery is contraindicated, unsuccessful, or as a bridge to radiation; options include pasireotide [^114zdGzv], cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat [^113EYtq7] [^113HwKEL], and mifepristone.

---

## Evidence regarding leuprolide in cushing disease

There is **no evidence supporting leuprolide for Cushing disease**. It does not suppress ACTH or cortisol in corticotroph adenomas, and no clinical trials or case reports support its use.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **do not recommend leuprolide for Cushing disease** [^1119fkhW]. The Endocrine Society and other expert groups endorse surgery first, with medical therapy (pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mifepristone) for persistent or recurrent disease [^112jwJFW].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of leuprolide

Leuprolide has significant side effects, including:

- **Hot flashes and night sweats**: Common with sex steroid suppression.

- **Decreased libido and sexual dysfunction**: Due to reduced sex hormones.

- **Bone density loss**: Increased osteoporosis risk with long-term use.

- **Mood changes and depression**: Reported with chronic therapy.

- **Injection site reactions**: Local irritation and discomfort.

These risks are unacceptable given the **lack of efficacy in Cushing disease**.

---

## Comparison with other medical therapies

Compared to approved therapies, leuprolide is **ineffective for ACTH/cortisol control**. Pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, and mifepristone have demonstrated efficacy and are guideline-supported [^112jwJFW] [^1122NkDV].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Leuprolide is **not effective for Cushing disease** and is not recommended by guidelines. Management should follow established pathways: surgery first, with medical therapy (pasireotide, cabergoline, ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mifepristone) for persistent or recurrent disease [^112jwJFW].

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, specifically concerning indications for treatment, the Endocrine Society's 2015 guidelines recommend considering the avoidance of treatment aimed at reducing cortisol levels or blocking the action of cortisol in patients without specific signs of Cushing's syndrome. This recommendation applies to cases where there are only borderline biochemical abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The benefit of treating to normalize cortisol levels is not established in this setting.

### Osilodrostat: A review of recent clinical studies and practical recommendations for its use in the treatment of Cushing disease [^113HwKEL]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Cushing disease (CD) is characterized by chronic hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Surgery remains the first-line treatment option; however, medical therapy is essential if surgery is contraindicated, fails to achieve remission, or when recurrence occurs after surgical remission. Osilodrostat (Isturisa), a novel steroidogenic inhibitor, is now approved for the treatment of CD in the United States and Cushing syndrome in Europe. This review examines the pharmacology and data on the efficacy, safety, and clinical use of osilodrostat and provides guidance on its use in treating patients with CD.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the literature and published clinical trial data of osilodrostat use in patients with Cushing syndrome. Detailed information related to the clinical assessment of osilodrostat use, potential drug-to-drug interactions, drug initiation, dose titration, and the monitoring of drug tolerability were discussed.

- **Results**: Clinical trial data demonstrated that osilodrostat, by virtue of inhibiting 11-β hydroxylase, potently and rapidly decreased the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels and sustained these reductions, with improved glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and quality of life, as well as lessened depression. Osilodrostat may interact with certain drugs, resulting in QT prolongation, which requires careful assessment of concomitant medications and periodic monitoring using electrocardiogram. The common adverse effects include adrenal insufficiency, hypokalemia, edema, and hyperandrogenic symptoms.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159RXcg]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

To systematically review the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome in clinical practice, this study examines cortisol secretion, clinical symptom improvement, and quality of life. It also assesses the occurrence of side effects associated with these medical therapies.

- **Methods**: Eight electronic databases were searched in March 2017 to identify potentially relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of medical treatment in patients with Cushing's syndrome were eligible. Pooled proportions were reported, including 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: We included 35 articles with a total of 1,520 patients in this meta-analysis. Most included patients had Cushing's disease. The pooled reported percentage of patients with normalization of cortisol ranged from 35.7% for cabergoline to 81.8% for mitotane in Cushing's disease. Patients using medication monotherapy showed a lower percentage of cortisol normalization compared to those using multiple medical agents (49.4% vs. 65.7%); this was even higher for patients with previous radiotherapy (83.6%). Mild side effects were reported in 39.9%, and severe side effects were seen in 15.2% of patients after medical treatment. No meta-analyses were performed for clinical symptom improvement or quality of life due to a lack of sufficient data.

- **Conclusions**: This meta-analysis shows that medication induces cortisol normalization effectively in a large percentage of patients. Medical treatment for Cushing's disease patients is thus a reasonable option in cases where surgery is contraindicated.

### The treatment of Cushing's disease [^112EzLrW]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), or pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, is a severe endocrine disorder caused by a corticotroph pituitary tumor and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery, which results in disease remission in approximately 78% of patients and relapse in about 13% over a 10-year period, indicating that nearly one-third of patients experience long-term surgical failure and require additional second-line treatment.

Patients with persistent or recurrent CD require further treatments, including pituitary radiotherapy, adrenal surgery, and/or medical therapy. Pituitary radiotherapy effectively controls cortisol excess in a significant percentage of patients but carries a considerable risk of hypopituitarism. Adrenal surgery swiftly and definitively controls cortisol excess in nearly all patients but induces adrenal insufficiency.

Medical therapy has recently gained importance due to novel compounds that effectively control cortisol secretion or action. Currently, medical therapy is utilized as a presurgical treatment, particularly for severe disease; as postsurgical intervention in cases of surgical failure or incomplete tumor resection; as bridging therapy before, during, and after radiotherapy while awaiting disease control; or, in selected cases, as primary therapy, primarily when surgery is not feasible.

The adrenal-directed drug ketoconazole is the most commonly used medication due to its efficacy in managing cortisol levels.

### Low immediate postoperative serum-cortisol nadir predicts the short-term, but not long-term, remission after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease [^116qVGdS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The lack of international consensus on the definition of cure after transphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease makes the interpretation of reported outcome figures difficult. Most authors use the clinical resolution of symptoms and one or more biochemical parameters, such as normalization of 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels, low late-night saliva cortisol, normal midnight serum cortisol, or suppression of cortisol following a low-dose dexamethasone test. Due to this lack of consensus and the heterogeneity of patient populations, there is considerable variation in the reported immediate postoperative remission rate, ranging from 55% to 95%. The best results are obtained in patients with non-invasive microadenomas, achieving cure rates as high as 93%, with a marked reduction in the remission rate as tumor diameter and extrasellar extension increase. Our results of 84% in remission at 3 months and 95% in remission at 1 year accord with the literature. It is worth noting that all our patients completed follow-up, while in other published series, up to 30% of the patients were lost to follow-up, which may have biased the results.

In this study, with a mean follow-up of 5.7 years (68 months), five out of 19 patients experienced a late recurrence. This high recurrence rate (26%) may represent the "natural, but underreported, history of the disease" or the consequence of our surgical practice. Few complications were recorded in this series, with zero surgical complications, and three patients developed new hormonal deficits, which may reflect a cautious approach.

### Signifor [^114zdGzv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two dose levels of Signifor over a 6-month treatment period in patients with Cushing's disease. This Phase III, multicenter, randomized study focused on patients who had persistent or recurrent disease despite pituitary surgery or those for whom surgery was not indicated or refused.

Patients with a baseline 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC) greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were randomized to receive a Signifor dosage of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg subcutaneously twice a day. After three months of treatment, patients with a mean 24-hour UFC less than or equal to 2.0 times the ULN and below or equal to their baseline values continued blinded treatment at the randomized dose until month 6. Those who did not meet these criteria were unblinded, and the dose was increased by 0.3 mg twice a day. After the initial six months, patients entered an additional 6-month open-label treatment period, during which the dosage could be reduced by 0.3 mg twice a day if intolerability occurred.

A total of 162 patients participated in the study. The majority were female (78%) and had persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease despite pituitary surgery (83%), with a mean age of 40 years. A small number of patients (4%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median baseline 24-hour UFC for all patients was 565 nmol/24 hours (normal range: 30 to 145 nmol/24 hours). Approximately two-thirds of the randomized patients completed the 6-month treatment period.

### Approach to the Cushing's disease patient with persistent/recurrent hypercortisolism after pituitary surgery [^1134J4sG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Although pituitary surgery is the ideal treatment, it is not always successful, nor is its success always lasting. Close surveillance, both clinical and biological, will detect immediate failure or late recurrence. The reason for recurrence must be thoroughly explored, following the somewhat dogmatic rule that the patient should be offered the best surgery in expert hands. A repeat surgical attempt must be systematically discussed.

When repeat pituitary surgery is not indicated or has failed, a challenging task arises: choosing between options directed toward different targets. These options include directly suppressing tumor ACTH by pituitary radiotherapy (conventional or stereotaxic) or with medications such as:

- **Somatostatin analog**: Pasireotide
- **Dopaminergic drug**: Cabergoline

Additionally, one can directly suppress adrenocortical activity with medications:

- **Inhibitors of adrenal steroidogenesis**: Ketoconazole or metyrapone
- **Adrenolytic**: Lysodren

Surgical options include bilateral adrenalectomy, and peripheral cortisol action can be opposed with the antiglucocorticoid mifepristone. No single option is ideal, able to simultaneously provide a high success rate, rapid onset of action, restoration of a normal pituitary-adrenal axis, and good tolerability.

Close follow-up and thorough evaluation of the cortisolic status will eventually dictate a switch in treatment options and/or combination strategies over time. The tumor status and its possible oncogenic threat, the severity of the hypercortisolism, and the patient's perspectives, such as the wish for fertility, are among the major parameters that can guide a multidisciplinary approach.

### Updates on the role of adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors in Cushing's syndrome: a focus on novel therapies [^117E2JHH]. Pituitary (2016). Low credibility.

Subclinical adrenal Cushing's syndrome

Though controversial, subclinical Cushing's syndrome (CS) or mild adrenal hypercortisolism is defined as a subtle hypersecretion of cortisol that does not fully manifest in a clinical phenotype. Subclinical CS may be associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, or coronary heart disease due to chronic cortisol elevation, but this association has not been conclusively demonstrated. As a result of the sparse data around the treatment of subclinical CS, treatment guidelines vary. Some guidelines recommend adrenalectomy, particularly for patients with worsening comorbidities, while others advocate for careful monitoring of the patient.

While the optimal treatment for these patients is unclear, steroidogenic inhibitors are not currently recommended for the treatment of subclinical CS. Thus, there is a clear need for more studies evaluating the best course of treatment for these patients. For instance, administering steroidogenesis inhibitors as a first-line treatment might obviate the need for adrenalectomy in patients who have bilateral adrenal disease, have contraindications, or refuse surgery if their comorbidities improve with medical treatment.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome with osilodrostat: Practical applications of recent studies with case examples [^114mGbHe]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

It is also important to optimize medical treatment for preexisting comorbidities and to choose drugs with the potential to have a positive effect on glucose, blood pressure, and/or weight. Improving not only the hypercortisolemia, but also focusing on optimal control of comorbid conditions, may decrease the complications associated with COVID-19. Given the limitations on face-to-face visits during COVID-19 restrictions, virtual health care provider visits can be beneficial to triage patient needs. Laboratory tests can be temporarily deferred on the basis of clinical assessment and/or performed at local centers. Virtual follow-ups have been recommended for interim medical monitoring and are welcomed by many patients who may live far from major referral centers; thus, it would be beneficial if they can continue even beyond the pandemic.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114t4nnD]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Study selection**: The initial search identified 960 potentially relevant articles. An additional article was identified through references of included articles, yielding a total of 961 articles. By screening these articles by title and abstract, 874 articles were excluded. The remaining 87 articles were reviewed in detail. In total, 35 articles were included, reporting on six different drugs. Reasons for exclusion are summarized in Fig. 1.

- **Study characteristics**: We included five studies on mitotane, two on pasireotide, three on cabergoline, eight on ketoconazole, five on metyrapone, two on mifepristone, and ten on multiple medical agents. Studies were published between 1971 and 2017. There were eleven single-arm trials, two randomized trials with two treatment arms (pasireotide 600 µg vs. pasireotide 900 µg; first cabergoline, then add ketoconazole vs. first ketoconazole, then add cabergoline), and 22 cohort studies. We included eighteen studies on pituitary Cushing's disease only, two on ectopic Cushing's syndrome only, and fifteen on Cushing's syndrome patients due to various underlying etiologies. In total, 1520 patients were included. There were 28 articles measuring normalization of cortisol by at least urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or a low dose dexamethasone test (88% of 32 articles reporting normalization of cortisol as an outcome). There were 25 studies reporting on clinical improvement and three studies reporting on quality of life.

### Innovative approaches to improve the success of pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: A cost-effectiveness perspective [^111Xu4WS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Costs**: Costs of all therapies were calculated with a bottom-up cost analysis, including operating time, hospital stay, and treatment-specific actions and equipment. Operating time and hospital stay were derived from internal reports of Radboud University Medical Center. Costs corresponding to operating time were derived from a cost analysis of a conventional operating room. Costs of follow-up consults, hospital days, and medical imaging were based on the Dutch guidelines for health economic modeling. The number of follow-up consults that a patient received was based on expert opinion (A.V.).

	- Costs for pathology and diagnostic tests were derived from administrative registers from the Department of Neurosurgery at our hospital. We assumed that 33.5% of patients were hydrocortisone dependent after pituitary surgery, of which 58% were only temporarily dependent. The proportion of patients requiring hormone substitution for any type of hypopituitarism was based on a study from Wagenmakers et al. The proportion of patients requiring ketoconazole after irradiation, as well as the proportion of hypopituitarism before and after (stereotactic) irradiation, was derived from a large international multicenter study. Costs for Nelson syndrome, which occurs in around 28% of patients after bilateral adrenalectomy, are very patient-dependent. Therefore, we assumed that these patients received an extra pituitary surgery, the primary treatment choice for patients with Nelson syndrome. All patients were assumed to be hydrocortisone-dependent after treatment.

### Treatment of adrenocorticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome: A consensus statement [^113udnqo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the published literature and reach a consensus on the treatment of patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome because there is no recent consensus on the management of this rare disorder.

- **Participants**: Thirty-two leading endocrinologists, clinicians, and neurosurgeons with specific expertise in the management of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome representing nine countries were chosen to address:
	1. Criteria for cure and remission of this disorder.
	2. Surgical treatment of Cushing's disease.
	3. Therapeutic options in the event of persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery.
	4. Medical therapy of Cushing's disease.
	5. Management of ectopic ACTH syndrome, Nelson's syndrome, and special patient populations.

- **Evidence**: Participants presented published scientific data, which formed the basis of the recommendations. Where strong evidence was lacking, the opinion shared by a majority of experts was used.

- **Consensus process**: Participants met for two days, during which there were four chaired sessions of presentations, followed by general discussion where a consensus was reached. The consensus statement was prepared by a steering committee and was then reviewed by all authors, with suggestions incorporated if agreed upon by the majority.

- **Conclusions**: ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder requiring a multidisciplinary and individualized approach to patient management. Generally, the treatment of choice for ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is curative surgery with selective pituitary or ectopic corticotroph tumor removal.

### Medical management pathways for Cushing's disease in pituitary tumors centers of excellence (PTCOEs) [^1177VUB5]. Pituitary (2025). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenoma and is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The annual incidence of CD is 1.5 per million, and the prevalence is 57 cases per million, with a female predominance. Despite its rare occurrence, the disorder is associated with commonly encountered comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypercoagulability, osteoporosis and fractures, impaired glucose metabolism, and immune and growth suppression. Higher mortality rates reported in CD, mainly due to cardiovascular causes, were associated with persistent disease. However, long-term sequelae of hypercortisolism may persist even years after successful CD treatment. Hence, prompt diagnosis and management of the disease are essential to optimize patient outcomes. The treatment goal is to achieve disease remission and long-term control ideally without the occurrence of hypopituitarism.

The recommended first-line therapy is selective transsphenoidal surgical resection of the ACTH-secreting adenoma. Remission rates after surgery are dependent on surgeon expertise and may reach 83% for microadenomas and 68% for macroadenomas in PTCOEs. A significant subset of adenomas is so small that they are not visible on high-quality imaging. Although surgical exploration after confirmation by bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling or corticotropin-releasing hormone/high-dose (8 mg) dexamethasone suppression test is the first-line, medical treatment is an alternative option.

### New developments in the medical treatment of Cushing's syndrome [^115hFZkk]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a severe endocrine disorder characterized by chronic cortisol excess due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma, ectopic ACTH production, or a cortisol-producing adrenal neoplasia. Regardless of the underlying cause, untreated CS is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Surgery is the primary therapy for all causes of CS, but surgical failure and ineligibility of the patient to undergo surgery necessitate alternative treatment modalities. The role of medical therapy in CS has been limited due to lack of efficacy or intolerability.

In recent years, however, new targets for medical therapy have been identified, both at the level of the pituitary gland (e.g. somatostatin, dopamine, and epidermal growth factor receptors) and the adrenal gland (ectopically expressed receptors in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia).

In this review, results of preclinical and clinical studies with drugs that exert their action through these molecular targets, as well as already established medical treatment options, will be discussed.

### The diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^115sYoPn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for Cushing's syndrome, particularly in patients with epilepsy, ES 2008 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of dexamethasone testing in patients receiving antiepileptic drugs known to enhance dexamethasone clearance.

### Adrenally directed medical therapies for Cushing syndrome [^1143izE2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) is characterized by excess cortisol secretion, driven by tumorous secretion of corticotropin in the majority of patients. If left untreated, CS results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Tumor-directed surgery is generally the first-line therapy for CS. However, hypercortisolism may persist or recur postoperatively; in other cases, the underlying tumor may not be resectable or its location may not be known. Some patients may be acutely ill and require stabilization before definitive surgery. In these cases, additional interventions are needed, including adrenally directed medical therapies.

Electronic literature searches were performed to identify studies pertaining to adrenally acting agents used for CS. Data were abstracted and used to compile this review.

Adrenally directed medical therapies inhibit one or several enzymes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis. Current available therapies include ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mitotane, and etomidate, with additional agents under investigation. Drugs differ in their mechanisms of action, time course of pharmacologic effect, safety and tolerability, potential for drug-drug interactions, and route of administration. All agents require careful dose titration and patient monitoring to ensure safety and effectiveness while avoiding hypoadrenalism.

These medications play an important role in the management of CS, particularly among patients where surgery is not feasible or effective.

### Extended treatment of Cushing's disease with pasireotide: Results from a 2-year, Phase II study [^1129oa9U]. Pituitary (2014). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease is the clinical consequence of chronic hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma. Patients with Cushing's disease have a 4.8-fold higher mortality than the general population and a high level of cardiovascular, metabolic, and osteoporotic comorbidities. The first-line treatment for patients with Cushing's disease is transsphenoidal surgery, with remission rates of 65–90% in patients with a microadenoma, if performed by an expert pituitary surgeon. Second-line options include repeat surgery, radiotherapy, medical therapy, and bilateral adrenalectomy. However, lower success rates are observed after repeat surgery compared to initial surgery, and hypopituitarism is more common. Hypopituitarism is also common after radiotherapy, whereas bilateral adrenalectomy results in permanent hypoadrenalism.

The most commonly used medical therapies are steroidogenesis inhibitors, none of which have been evaluated in large, prospective clinical trials; these agents are generally used off-label. Recently, pasireotide has been approved as a medical therapy for Cushing's disease in the EU and US, and mifepristone is available to treat hyperglycemia associated with hypercortisolism in the US.

Corticotroph adenomas express multiple somatostatin receptor subtypes (sst), making somatostatin analogues a rational therapeutic option for patients with these tumors. Pasireotide is a multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogue with high affinity for sst 1, sst 2, and sst 3, and the highest affinity for sst 5. The receptor sst 5 is

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uGron]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome in clinical practice, focusing on cortisol secretion, clinical symptom improvement, and quality of life, as well as assessing the occurrence of side effects of these medical therapies.

Eight electronic databases were searched in March 2017 to identify potentially relevant articles. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of medical treatment in patients with Cushing's syndrome were eligible. Pooled proportions were reported, including 95% confidence intervals.

We included 35 articles with a total of 1520 patients in this meta-analysis. Most included patients had Cushing's disease. The pooled reported percentage of patients with normalization of cortisol ranged from 35.7% for cabergoline to 81.8% for mitotane in Cushing's disease. Patients using medication monotherapy showed a lower percentage of cortisol normalization compared to the use of multiple medical agents (49.4% vs. 65.7%); this was even higher for patients with prior radiotherapy (83.6%). Mild side effects were reported in 39.9% of patients, while severe side effects were seen in 15.2% of patients after medical treatment. No meta-analyses were performed for clinical symptom improvement or quality of life due to a lack of sufficient data.

This meta-analysis shows that medication induces cortisol normalization effectively in a large percentage of patients. Medical treatment for Cushing's disease patients is thus a reasonable option in case of a contraindication for surgery.

### Ketoconazole [^111eHC8R]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions associated with unapproved uses**: Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings, and its use for these indications is not approved by the FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether these deaths were related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, has been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, have also been reported.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YSmo2]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

Cushing's syndrome due to endogenous glucocorticoid excess is either adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent or ACTH-independent, both with a variety of underlying causes. Cushing's disease results from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma and has a reported incidence of approximately 1.2–2.4 patients per million each year. Ectopic Cushing's syndrome is a rare condition resulting from a non-pituitary ACTH-producing source. ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome is caused by a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. An excess of glucocorticoids alters body composition and metabolic profile, inducing fat maldistribution, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulability, and increasing the risk of osteoporosis, hypertension, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Transsphenoidal pituitary adenomectomy is a well-established and effective treatment for Cushing's disease. Cushing's syndrome is generally managed by removing the ACTH-producing tumor in ectopic Cushing's syndrome and by adrenalectomy in ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. However, there is increasing experience with first-line medical treatment, both for patients with contraindications for surgery and for patients with recurrent disease. Furthermore, drugs can be used to control cortisol secretion preoperatively and to bridge the time period until control of hypercortisolism is achieved by radiotherapy. Drugs used in medical practice vary per country and underlying cause of Cushing's syndrome and include ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone.

### Prolactinomas, Cushing's disease and acromegaly: Debating the role of medical therapy for secretory pituitary adenomas [^116rbG8A]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenomas are associated with a variety of clinical manifestations resulting from excessive hormone secretion and tumor mass effects, and require a multidisciplinary management approach. This article discusses the treatment modalities for the management of patients with prolactinoma, Cushing's disease, and acromegaly, and summarizes the options for medical therapy in these patients.

- **First-line treatment of prolactinomas**: Pharmacotherapy with dopamine agonists is the initial approach. Recent reports of cardiac valve abnormalities associated with this class of medication in Parkinson's disease have prompted study in hyperprolactinemic populations. Patients with resistance to dopamine agonists may require alternative treatments.

- **First-line treatment of Cushing's disease**: The primary recommendation is pituitary surgery by a surgeon experienced in this condition. **Medical options** for Cushing's disease block adrenal cortisol production but do not address the underlying disease. Pituitary-directed medical therapies are now being explored. In several small studies, the dopamine agonist cabergoline normalized urinary free cortisol in some patients. The multi-receptor targeted somatostatin analogue pasireotide (SOM230) shows promise as a pituitary-directed medical therapy in Cushing's disease; further studies will determine its efficacy and safety. **Radiation therapy**, with medical adrenal blockade while awaiting the effects of radiation, and bilateral adrenalectomy remain standard treatment options for patients not cured with pituitary surgery.

- **In patients with acromegaly**: Surgery remains the first-line treatment option.

Regarding the medical management of Cushing's syndrome, particularly concerning general principles, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend performing a surgical resection of any primary lesion identified as the cause of cortisol excess (pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal). This is considered the first-line and definitive treatment for CS, unless surgery is not possible or is unlikely to significantly reduce corticosteroid excess.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease [^111a3729]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), caused by excess adrenocorticotropin secretion from tumorous pituitary corticotrophs, is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The primary and definitive therapy for patients with CD is selective pituitary adenomectomy, generally performed via a transsphenoidal approach. Medical therapy plays an important adjunctive role in the management of patients with CD, including preoperative patient preparation for severe disease and temporizing management of hypercortisolism while awaiting the effects of radiation therapy in patients who are not in remission postoperatively. Medical therapy is also used in patients with hypercortisolism of unclear origin or in the few patients who decline or are unfit for surgery.

Available medical options for patients with CD include centrally acting agents (cabergoline and pasireotide), steroidogenesis inhibitors (ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, and etomidate), and a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (mifepristone). Pasireotide and mifepristone have recently been granted regulatory approval in some countries for use in patients with CD, whereas other medications are used "off label" in this patient population. Since clinical trials using comparator agents have not been reported, the choice between different medications is based on patient characteristics and preferences.

Despite impressive advances in pharmacotherapy for patients with CD, much remains to be done. The long-term efficacy and safety of medical therapies for hypercortisolism need to be evaluated, and the role of combination therapy should be further explored.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^111EQiHM]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is considered an aggressive pituitary endocrine disorder because of the devastating long-term consequences of untreated hypercortisolemia. Transsphenoidal surgery is clearly the first-line therapy of choice, with remission rates between 65% and 90% for microadenomas, but somewhat lower rates of less than 65% for macroadenomas. This variability relates to the size and location of tumors, neurosurgical expertise, length of follow-up, and the definition of remission. Indeed, this last point is a controversial aspect in the management of CD, as there is no consensus on the most accurate postoperative assessment of remission and its predictive value for long-term prognosis.

Furthermore, despite initial cure after surgery, up to a quarter of patients will experience recurrence within ten years. Due to the significance of morbidity and mortality if the disease is not cured, patients require additional effective treatment if initial surgery does fail. A second surgery can be a desirable choice only in selected cases. Radiotherapy can also represent an alternative in patients with large remnant disease, but can take several months to years to reach biochemical normalization and has inherent adverse effects beyond the risks of panhypopituitarism.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a medical therapy that can effectively reverse clinical features of CD by normalizing CD-associated biochemical parameters acutely — and more importantly during long-term treatment. Although minimally invasive laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy is an effective a

### Cushing's disease: adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors [^115kQRvk]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD), caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor, is the most common form of Cushing's syndrome (CS), accounting for approximately 70% of cases. CD requires a prompt diagnosis, adequate treatment selection, and long-term management to limit the duration of hypercortisolism and prevent long-term complications to improve patient outcomes.

Pituitary surgery is the first-line option; however, it is non-curative in one-third of patients, necessitating additional treatments. Recently, medical therapy has gained an emerging role with several drugs available, each with different therapeutic targets and efficacy and safety profiles. This review focuses on the efficacy and safety of steroidogenesis inhibitors, particularly the historical drugs ketoconazole and metyrapone, and the novel drugs levoketoconazole and osilodrostat, which seem to offer rapid, sustained, and effective disease control.

- **Ketoconazole and levoketoconazole**: Ketoconazole should be preferred in females and in patients without severe liver disease. Levoketoconazole may offer an alternative to classical ketoconazole, with a higher potency and potentially lower hepatotoxicity compared to ketoconazole.

- **Metyrapone**: This drug should be preferred in males and in patients without severe or uncontrolled hypokalemia. Both ketoconazole and metyrapone may be preferred for short-term rather than long-term treatment.

- **Osilodrostat**: Osilodrostat may represent the best choice for long-term treatment, particularly for patients with poor compliance to the multiple daily administration schedule and those without severe or uncontrolled conditions.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of osilodrostat in Cushing's disease: final results from a Phase II study with an optional extension phase (LINC 2) [^113EYtq7]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

Cushing's disease, the most common form of endogenous Cushing's syndrome, is a rare, debilitating disorder characterized by increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by a pituitary tumor and overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Chronic exposure to excess cortisol levels is associated with a broad spectrum of morbidity, including metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychiatric disorders, which negatively impact quality of life (QoL) and mortality. Therefore, normalizing cortisol levels is a key treatment goal in Cushing's disease to alleviate comorbidities, improve QoL, and reduce mortality.

Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is the first-line treatment option for most patients with Cushing's disease. However, approximately one-third of patients require further treatment, such as repeat pituitary surgery, pituitary radiotherapy, bilateral adrenalectomy, or medical therapy, to control cortisol levels due to failure to respond to surgery or disease recurrence. For these patients, and for those who refuse or are not suitable candidates for surgery, medical therapies represent an important therapeutic option. Therefore, understanding the long-term efficacy and safety profile of any medical therapy used to treat this chronic condition is essential.

Osilodrostat is a potent oral inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands. It is approved in the EU, Switzerland, and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome for whom surgery is not an option.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122NkDV]. Pituitary (2018). High credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of FDA/EMA-approved medical treatments for Cushing's syndrome, whether de novo or with persistent disease, were eligible for inclusion. Cabergoline, which has been used for Cushing's syndrome in multiple investigator-initiated clinical trials, was also considered. The medical agents examined included ketoconazole, metyrapone, mitotane, cabergoline, pasireotide, and mifepristone. Articles were excluded if they reported broad inclusion categories without isolating the subgroup of Cushing's patients, or if the study focused solely on children (age < 18 years). To minimize selection bias, studies had to include at least ten patients per treatment group. For multiple articles describing (partially) overlapping populations, the article with the largest study population was included in the analysis. Articles not retrievable online were requested from the authors. Only articles in the English language were considered.

- **Search strategy**: The databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, LWW, and ScienceDirect were systematically searched in March 2017, in cooperation with a specialized librarian (see Online Resource 1 for the complete search strategy). The search was repeated in PubMed in May 2017. Additionally, references of included articles were examined to identify more potentially eligible articles.

### Quality of life in patients after long-term biochemical cure of Cushing's disease [^113AZm5u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the long-term impact of cured Cushing's disease on subjective well-being, we assessed quality of life using validated health-related questionnaires in 58 patients cured from Cushing's disease by transsphenoidal surgery (n = 58), some of whom received additional radiotherapy (n = 11) and/or bilateral adrenalectomy (n = 3). The mean duration of remission was 13.4 ± 6.7 years, with a range of 2–25 years. Patient data were compared with a control group of 98 healthy subjects with the same age and sex distribution and with age-adjusted reference values available from the literature.

General perceived well-being, measured by the Nottingham Health Profile and the Short Form, was reduced compared with controls for all subscales (P < 0.001). Patients with Cushing's disease had worse scores on subscales of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Index) and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Compared with reference values from the literature, quality of life was also reduced in the patients according to all questionnaires and all items, except pain (Short Form), sleep (Nottingham Health Profile), and reduced activity (Multidimensional Fatigue Index).

Despite conventional hormone replacement therapy, hypopituitarism was an important independent predictor of reduced quality of life. Patients without hypopituitarism (n = 28) showed reduced scores on physical items but normal scores on mental items compared with controls. In conclusion, despite the long-term cure of Cushing's disease, patients experience a considerable decrease in quality of life, with physical and psychosocial aspects being affected.

### Cushing's syndrome [^111n3VLr]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Endogenous Cushing's syndrome results from excess glucocorticoid secretion, leading to a myriad of clinical manifestations, comorbidities, and increased mortality despite treatment. Over the last decade, molecular mechanisms and genetic alterations associated with different causes of Cushing's syndrome have been described. Imaging modalities and biochemical testing have evolved; however, both the diagnosis and management of Cushing's syndrome remain challenging. Surgery is the preferred treatment for all causes, but medical therapy has markedly advanced, with new drug options becoming available. Several comorbidities persist even after patient remission, impacting quality of life. Accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment are essential for mitigating chronic complications of excess glucocorticoids and improving patient quality of life. This Seminar aims to update several important aspects of diagnosis, complications, and treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome of all causes.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114EtEfs]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

No difference was shown in the normalization of cortisol between patients using medical agents as primary treatment versus secondary treatment, suggesting that the effectiveness of medical agents is independent of other treatment modalities. A higher percentage of patients reaches normalization of cortisol in studies where a small portion of included patients received medication preoperatively (including patients with contraindications to surgery and patients after previous surgery), compared to studies where a large portion of included patients received medication before elective surgery. The most likely explanation is that in patients with planned surgery, medication is given to control cortisol excess, and surgery is performed before complete normalization of cortisol occurs.

Unfortunately, the average time until cortisol normalization is unknown, as most articles did not report this. Total follow-up time was not different for studies with a high percentage of medical pre-treatment before surgery (average 0.1–11.5 years) compared to all included studies. It would be interesting to determine if the effectiveness of surgery is dependent upon the normalization of cortisol with medical treatment before surgery, compared to presurgical medical treatment without cortisol normalization, and compared to no presurgical medical treatment at all. Particularly in pituitary Cushing's disease, the percentage of patients with preoperative medical treatment that reaches cortisol normalization is low. This might be due to the higher expectations of surgery in pituitary Cushing's disease compared to other etiologies.

### Treatment options for Cushing disease after unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery [^1142vW1T]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Cushing disease is considered an aggressive pituitary endocrinopathy because of the devastating effects of untreated hypercortisolemia. Although they are histologically benign, these adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumors are associated with significant morbidity and premature death. Currently, transsphenoidal surgery is the primary treatment of Cushing disease associated with an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumor, resulting in remission rates ranging from about 50 to 90%. Some patients, however, will not achieve sustained remission after transsphenoidal surgery and can exhibit persistent or recurrent Cushing disease that requires multimodal treatment to achieve remission.

In such patients, options for treatment include repeat transsphenoidal resection, radiation therapy (including conventional fractionated radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery), and medical therapy. Despite undergoing multiple treatment modalities, some patients may ultimately require bilateral adrenalectomy for definitive treatment to eliminate hypercortisolemia associated with Cushing disease. In this article, the authors review the treatment options for patients who have persistent or recurrent Cushing disease after unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery. The indications, results reported in the literature, and complications of each treatment modality are discussed.

### Prolactinomas, Cushing's disease and acromegaly: Debating the role of medical therapy for secretory pituitary adenomas [^116KeFLX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenomas are associated with a variety of clinical manifestations resulting from excessive hormone secretion and tumor mass effects, requiring a multidisciplinary management approach. This article discusses the treatment modalities for managing patients with prolactinoma, Cushing's disease, and acromegaly, summarizing the options for medical therapy in these patients.

- **Prolactinoma treatment**: The first-line treatment of prolactinomas is pharmacotherapy with dopamine agonists. Recent reports of cardiac valve abnormalities associated with this class of medication in Parkinson's disease have prompted studies in hyperprolactinemic populations. Patients with resistance to dopamine agonists may require other treatments.

- **Cushing's disease treatment**: The first-line treatment of Cushing's disease is pituitary surgery by a surgeon experienced in this condition. Medical options for Cushing's disease block adrenal cortisol production but do not treat the underlying disease. Pituitary-directed medical therapies are now being explored. In several small studies, the dopamine agonist cabergoline normalized urinary free cortisol in some patients. The multi-receptor targeted somatostatin analogue pasireotide (SOM230) shows promise as a pituitary-directed medical therapy in Cushing's disease; further studies will determine its efficacy and safety. Radiation therapy, with medical adrenal blockade while awaiting the effects of radiation, and bilateral adrenalectomy remain standard treatment options for patients not cured with pituitary surgery.

- **Acromegaly treatment**: In patients with acromegaly, surgery remains the first-line treatment option when required.

### What is the best approach to suspected cyclical Cushing syndrome? Strategies for managing Cushing's syndrome with variable laboratory data [^115UwS2F]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Cyclical Cushing's syndrome is a pattern of hypercortisolism characterized by rhythmic fluctuations in cortisol production biochemistry. Often, this syndrome is associated with fluctuating symptoms and signs, and it is now being increasingly recognized. Recognizing this phenomenon is important because failure to do so can lead to errors in diagnosing and differentiating the syndrome, as well as in assessing therapeutic outcomes.

The techniques, criteria, protocols, and dynamic biochemical tools for detecting cycling in patients with hypercortisolism are discussed, alongside strategies for diagnosing and managing this important subgroup of patients with hypercortisolism.

### Medical combination therapies in Cushing's disease [^113fWYJo]. Pituitary (2015). Low credibility.

There has been growing interest in medical therapy for the management of Cushing's disease (CD), particularly in cases of persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism. Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of adrenal steroidogenesis, is the most widely used drug, whereas cabergoline and pasireotide are the most promising centrally acting agents. The main purpose of this review article is to highlight the options of medical treatment for CD, with a special emphasis on combination therapies, a topic that has only been addressed by a limited number of studies.

- **Conclusions**: According to the results of these studies, combination therapies involving medications with additive or synergistic effects on ACTH and cortisol secretion seem quite attractive as they yield a higher probability of long-term control of the hypercortisolism at lower doses, a lower incidence of side effects, and possibly a lower rate of treatment escapes. Currently, ketoconazole, cabergoline, and pasireotide are the best drugs to be prescribed in combination.

### New avenues in the medical treatment of Cushing's disease: Corticotroph tumor targeted therapy [^111BCWsB]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is a condition of chronic hypercortisolism caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. First-line transsphenoidal surgery is not always curative, and the disease sometimes recurs. Radiotherapy often requires months or years to be effective, and it is also not curative in many cases. Consequently, effective medical therapies for patients with CD are needed.

Corticotroph adenomas frequently express both dopamine (D2) and somatostatin receptors, predominantly sstr5. Pasireotide, a somatostatin analog with high sstr5 binding affinity, has shown reductions in urinary free cortisol (UFC) in most patients with CD in a large phase 3 trial, with UFC normalization and tumor shrinkage in a subset of patients. Adverse events were similar to other somatostatin analogs, except for the degree and severity of hyperglycemia.

Two small trials (one prospective and one retrospective) have suggested that cabergoline, a D2 receptor agonist, could be effective in normalizing UFC, but long-term data results are conflicting. Combination treatment with pasireotide, plus cabergoline and the adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor ketoconazole, has been successful, but further investigation in larger trials is necessary. Retinoic acid also showed interesting results in a recent very small prospective study.

Glucocorticoid receptor blockade with mifepristone has recently demonstrated improvement in signs and symptoms of Cushing's and glycemic control; however, this modality does not address the etiology of the disease and has inherent adverse events.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: what is the future [^114cP9tt]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

In a recent case report, a dramatic drop of elevated UFC levels in a patient treated with pasireotide 600 μg bid was observed, leading to symptomatic and biochemical hypocortisolism. Prior to pasireotide, the patient demonstrated UFC levels approximately 1.5–2-fold above normal, despite three surgical attempts and radiotherapy. After 10 months of reduced pasireotide therapy (300 μg bid), the patient continued to demonstrate improved mood, stable weight, and normal UFC levels.

- **Case study by Bode et al**: A female patient with a giant adenoma was initially treated by transcranial resection. Due to a symptomatic relapse and tumor recurrence, she received stereotactic radiosurgery, followed by bilateral adrenalectomy. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with a pituitary carcinoma due to the development of several intracranial and spinal metastases. She was started on temozolomide, with another dramatic rise in ACTH levels (from 88).

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112T4RUk]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatment in routine clinical practice for Cushing's syndrome. Medical treatment was effective in normalizing cortisol levels in 35.7% (cabergoline) to 81.8% (mitotane) of patients. Furthermore, the combined use of medical agents, either simultaneously or consecutively, increased the percentage of patients with normalized cortisol secretion to 65.7%. Importantly, medical agents for hypercortisolism can cause severe side effects, leading to therapy adjustment or withdrawal in 4.8% (cabergoline) to 28.4% (mitotane) of patients. These results suggest that medical therapy can be considered a reasonable treatment alternative to the primary surgical option when considering treatment effectiveness and side effects.

This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of all medical agents currently used in clinical practice for Cushing's syndrome. Only one previous study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of two medical agents for Cushing's syndrome. Daniel et al. studied the normalization of cortisol after monotherapy with ketoconazole or metyrapone and found that urinary free cortisol normalized in 60% of patients using ketoconazole, and the normalization of hypercortisolism, as defined by the authors, occurred in 75% of patients using metyrapone. This aligns with the results obtained in this study, showing normalization rates of 49.0–71.1% for ketoconazole and 60.0–75.9% for metyrapone, depending on patient categories. Since our last search in May 2017, one more research article on this topic has been published.

### Cushing's disease: Adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors [^1147Ed4P]. Pituitary (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest changing treatment if cortisol concentrations are persistently elevated after 2–3 months on maximum tolerated doses. If the treatment response is only partially achieved, with cortisol reduction without normalization, or in case of severe disease, a combination therapy approach may be considered. Considering the potential pituitary tumor growth concern, a careful monitoring of ACTH levels and a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging every 6–12 months after initiating treatment, and thereafter every few years, are suggested.

All steroidogenesis inhibitors may be associated with the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency due to transient overtreatment. This is especially true with potent drugs and particularly during the dose-titration period performed to achieve cortisol normalization. Although a clinical condition suggestive of adrenal insufficiency may be induced by a rapid decrease of cortisol levels, often induced by the most potent and rapid drugs, this represents, however, a cortisol withdrawal syndrome more than a real adrenal insufficiency. In patients with severe disease, requiring starting treatment with high doses, and in patients not eligible for surgery, a block-and-replace regimen, consisting of treating patients with a combined medical approach using adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and exogenous glucocorticoids, may be considered. This approach, particularly useful in cases of infrequent routine assessments, may reduce the risk of developing adrenal insufficiency, although caution is required to avoid iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome.

In conclusion, the landscape of medical therapy for Cushing's disease involves critical monitoring and timely adjustments to the treatment regimen to mitigate risks and improve patient outcomes.

### Medical management pathways for Cushing's disease in pituitary tumors centers of excellence (PTCOEs) [^114VXgEZ]. Pituitary (2025). High credibility.

A recent update of consensus guidelines for the management of Cushing's disease (CD) included indications for medical therapy. However, there is limited evidence regarding their implementation in clinical practice. This study aimed to evaluate medical therapy approaches by expert pituitary centers through an audit conducted to validate the criteria of Pituitary Tumors Centers of Excellence (PTCOEs) and provide an initial standard of medical care for CD.

- **Methods**: Based on the activities of nine international PTCOEs between 2018 and 2020, we evaluated patients under medical treatment and their biochemical control rates.

- **Results**: The median number of active patients with CD per center was 117 (35–279), with a median number of 10 new patients with CD managed annually in the endocrinology units of PTCOEs (4–42). The median percentage of patients with CD receiving medical treatment was 13.3% (4.8–82.9). Ketoconazole was the most frequently used drug, with a median rate of usage of 26.5% (5–66.7) of those receiving medical therapy. The median rates of metyrapone and pasireotide use were 17.2% (0–50) and 9.3% (0–51.7), respectively. For cabergoline and osilodrostat therapy, the median rates of use were 2.8% (0–33.3) and 1.7% (0–25), respectively. Combination therapy was reported to be utilized in 13.6% (0–45.5) of medically treated patients. Mifepristone was used in a single center, representing 1.1% of its medically treated patients. Overall, the median control rate in patients with CD receiving medical treatment was 75% (10–100).

- **Conclusion**: Adrenal steroidogenic inhibitors are fundamental in the management of CD across PTCOEs, providing significant biochemical control in treated patients.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: What is the future [^117TJndH]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is caused by a corticotroph, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenoma resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Transsphenoidal surgery is the initial treatment of choice in almost all cases. Remission rates for microadenomas are good, ranging from 65% to 90% with an experienced neurosurgeon. However, remission rates are much lower for macroadenomas. Even after postoperative remission, recurrence rates are high and can be seen up to decades after an initial diagnosis.

Repeat surgery or radiation can be useful in these cases, although both have clear limitations regarding efficacy and/or side effects. Hence, there is a clear unmet need for effective medical treatment.

Currently, most drugs act by inhibiting steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. Most knowledge is based on the effects of ketoconazole and metyrapone. While effective, access to ketoconazole and metyrapone is limited in many countries, the experience with long-term use is limited, and side effects can be significant. Recent studies have suggested a role for pituitary-directed therapy with new multireceptor ligand somatostatin analogs (e.g. pasireotide, recently approved in Europe for the treatment of CD), second-generation dopamine agonists, or a combination. Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is another promising drug recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of hyperglycemia associated with Cushing's syndrome.

We review available medical treatments for CD with a focus on the two most recent compounds referenced above. Our aim is to expand awareness of these developments.

### New avenues in the medical treatment of Cushing's disease: Corticotroph tumor targeted therapy [^114MxQYx]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Medical therapies targeting the corticotroph adenoma represent a relatively new avenue in the long-term treatment of patients with Cushing's disease who are unsuitable for surgery or who fail to achieve long-term disease control post-surgery. Drugs targeting adrenal steroid synthesis have been in use for many years, but they have not been prospectively studied and do not target the underlying pituitary tumor. A glucocorticoid receptor blocker could be a valuable asset for selected patients but is relatively complicated to use due to the absence of a biochemical marker, and there are potential adverse reactions inherent to the mechanism of action.

Pasireotide, a multiligand somatostatin analog, is the first pituitary-directed agent shown to effectively reduce cortisol levels and improve disease symptoms in a large, prospective, phase 3 clinical trial. Further investigation is needed, however, to clarify optimal management approaches for pasireotide-associated hyperglycemia. The dopamine agonist cabergoline has shown some promise in a small, open-label trial and one retrospective trial, but randomized controlled trials with this agent have not been conducted. A combination of lower doses of pasireotide with dopamine agonists or adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors (e.g. a combination of low-dose pasireotide/cabergoline/ketoconazole) may increase the proportion of patients whose disease can be controlled while minimizing adverse effects.

Finally, further research into patterns of receptor expression in corticotroph adenomas may lead to increased understanding.

### Approach to the patient with possible Cushing's syndrome [^116LF6pP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). High credibility.

Clinical decision-making for patients with suspected hypercortisolism involves a complex diagnostic assessment. Cushing's syndrome remains one of the most challenging endocrine pathologies. Most clinical features overlap with those of common diseases found in the general population, and some patients have an atypical clinical presentation with only isolated symptoms. Recently, several studies have suggested that the prevalence of Cushing's syndrome is higher than previously thought. Therefore, efficient screening tests are needed to identify the few uncovered patients, also among unselected high-risk ambulatory patients with disorders potentially related to cortisol excess. The recommended diagnostic tests are 24-hour urinary free cortisol, the 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and late-night salivary cortisol. Once the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established, the next step is the measurement of plasma ACTH. Then, dynamic tests and appropriate imaging procedures are the most useful noninvasive investigations for the differential diagnosis. Patients with Cushing's disease are generally responsive to the CRH test and to high-dose glucocorticoid feedback. Bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling is considered the gold standard for establishing the origin of ACTH secretion and is recommended in patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome whose clinical, biochemical, or radiological studies are discordant or equivocal.

The present clinical case shows that even if rare, the ectopic ACTH secretion should be considered also in those cases where the pretest probability suggests otherwise.

### Cushing's syndrome: Important issues in diagnosis and management [^113qDmdP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of Cushing's syndrome are challenging problems in clinical endocrinology. We focus on critical questions addressing screening for Cushing's syndrome, differentiation of Cushing's subtypes, and treatment options.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid's MEDLINE (1996 through April 2006) was used to search the general literature. We also relied on previously published reviews and a recent monograph and cite a mix of primary articles and recent reviews.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Although this article represents our opinion, it draws heavily on a recent consensus statement from experts in the field and a recent monograph on Cushing's syndrome.

- **Conclusions**: We concluded that: 1) measurement of late-night or bedtime salivary cortisol is a useful approach to screen for Cushing's syndrome; 2) measurement of suppressed plasma ACTH by immunometric assay is useful to differentiate ACTH-dependent and -independent Cushing's syndrome; 3) inferior petrosal sinus sampling for ACTH should be performed in patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in whom a pituitary magnetic resonance imaging is normal or equivocal (in the absence of a pituitary ACTH gradient, prolactin levels should be measured to confirm the integrity of venous sampling); 4) computed tomography of the chest and abdomen and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy should be performed in patients with the occult ectopic ACTH syndrome; and 5) patients with Cushing's disease should be referred to a neurosurgeon with extensive experience operating on corticotroph microadenomas.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1174CXFh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for treating Cushing's syndrome.

- **Participants**: Participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The European Society for Endocrinology co-sponsored the guideline.

- **Evidence**: The Task Force used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

- **Consensus process**: The Task Force achieved consensus through one group meeting, several conference calls, and numerous e-mail communications. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment of Cushing's syndrome is essential to reduce mortality and associated comorbidities. Effective treatment includes the normalization of cortisol levels or action. It also includes the normalization of comorbidities via directly treating the cause of Cushing's syndrome and by adjunctive treatments (e.g. antihypertensives). Surgical resection of the causal lesion(s) is generally the first-line approach. The choice of second-line treatments, including medication, bilateral adrenalectomy, and radiation therapy (for corticotrope tumors), must be individualized to each patient.

### Medical management of Cushing's disease: When and how [^111KoyX6]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Transsphenoidal surgery is the first-line treatment of Cushing's disease. However, medical treatment can be administered to a significant proportion of patients with this rare condition. This is particularly true in cases of severe hypercortisolism, where medical treatment may be given for a short period to prepare the patient for surgery or on a long-term basis after unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery. It may also be used while waiting for the maximal beneficial effect of radiation techniques. These different scenarios require that hypercortisolism be precisely controlled. Severe hypercortisolism is often treated using a block-and-replace approach, where a substitutive treatment is provided following the induction of adrenal insufficiency. In contrast, mild hypercortisolism, which is more common, is generally managed with a titration approach involving progressive dose increases. This method necessitates confirmation of eucortisolism as patients might receive treatment for an extended period. This review outlines the primary situations in which medical treatment should be considered, as well as strategies for monitoring them to prevent the long-term consequences of mild hypo- or hypercortisolism.

### Cushing disease: Highlighting the importance of early diagnosis for both de novo and recurrent disease in light of evolving treatment patterns [^1161CLV2]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to highlight and summarize literature on Cushing disease (CD)-related morbidity and mortality. It focuses on residual complications after "cure" and the changing role of pharmacologic therapy in CD.

- **Methods**: Journal articles on the consequences of untreated or undertreated CD, CD recurrence, and recent trends in CD treatment were collected from PubMed searches. These were analyzed in combination with the authors' clinical experience.

- **Results**: Timely recognition and treatment of de novo and recurrent CD remain a singular clinical challenge. Chronic excess cortisol exposure leads to potentially irreversible sequelae and death, stressing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Disease relapse after primary pituitary adenomectomy is prevalent, and recurrence may manifest decades after initial surgery. Increased risk for mortality and hypercortisolism-related complications in postsurgical CD patients may indicate persistent subclinical disease, underscoring the need for cautious, ongoing observation and testing. Potential long-term pharmacologic treatment options, such as pasireotide and mifepristone, have recently emerged. These may provide biochemical and symptomatic remission for those with refractory CD or for whom surgery is contraindicated.

- **Conclusion**: Delays in CD diagnosis, management, and follow-up are common and lead to increased adverse metabolic complications and mortality. Rapid recognition and treatment, as well as vigilant monitoring, are therefore essential. After surgical treatment, some patients may suffer from persistent issues.

### Clinical consequences of Cushing's syndrome [^111ZH7iT]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that correction of hypercortisolism in Cushing's syndrome (CS) may not lead to complete remission of the clinical abnormalities associated with this condition. In particular, elevated cardiovascular risk may persist in "cured" CS patients long-term after eucortisolism has been reached. This is believed to be related to the maintenance of visceral obesity and altered adipokine secretory patterns, which perpetuate features of metabolic syndrome, including impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and hypercoagulability. Nephrolithiasis and incomplete recovery of bone mineral density have also been described in "cured" CS patients.

Moreover, previous exposure to excess cortisol may have irreversible effects on the structures of the central nervous system controlling cognitive function and mood. Thus, sustained deterioration of the cardiovascular system, bone remodeling, and cognitive function may be associated with high morbidity and poor quality of life in CS patients in remission for many years. Although mortality in "cured" CS patients may not differ from that in the general population, data beyond 20 years of follow-up are very scarce. Therefore, further studies evaluating larger cohorts for longer follow-up periods are needed to draw definitive conclusions on longevity. Life-long monitoring is mandatory in CS patients to control long-term complications of previous cortisol excess and, possibly, normalize life expectancy.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116k6MmB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Cushing's syndrome, particularly with respect to pituitary-directed therapy, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering pituitary-directed medical treatments, such as cabergoline and pasireotide, for patients with Cushing's disease who are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery.

### Effectiveness of medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Ppzwt]. Pituitary (2018). Low credibility.

We used a component approach to assess risk of bias for all included studies. The following components were included, which could potentially bias a reported association between medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome and outcome:

- **Inclusion of patients**: Consecutive inclusion from all patients eligible or a random sample is considered low risk of bias.
- **Loss to follow-up**: Less than 5% is considered low risk of bias.
- **Criteria for diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome adequately reported**: This varies widely over time and by study center and underlying etiology. Adequate reporting is considered a low risk of bias.
- **Outcome measurement for cortisol normalization**: Urinary free cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, or a low dose dexamethasone test is considered low risk of bias.
- **Reporting of outcome definition**: Outcome reporting is considered adequate if the article at least mentions which outcome was studied, which test was used to determine the outcome, and if applicable, which cortisol level had to be measured.
- **Description of protocol for laboratory measurements**: This is deemed adequate if the assay used for measuring cortisol is reported, or the assay for the main outcome if this was not cortisol.
- **Description of dose and duration of intervention**: Adequate if dose (per day or per week) and duration of medical treatment are clearly described.

By ensuring these components, the study seeks to minimize bias and enhance the reliability of reported associations between medical treatment and outcomes in Cushing's syndrome.

### Medical treatment of Cushing's disease [^117HWV9x]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Cushing's disease (CD) is associated with serious morbidity and, when suboptimally treated, increased mortality. Although surgery is the first-line treatment modality for CD, hypercortisolism persists or recurs in an important subset of patients. Considering the deleterious effects of uncontrolled CD, there is a clear need for effective medical therapy.

In this review, we discuss molecular targets for medical therapy, efficacy, and side effects of the currently used drugs to treat hypercortisolism, and focus on recent developments resulting from translational and clinical studies.

Selection of publications related to the study objective was performed via a PubMed search using relevant keywords and search terms. Medical therapy for CD can be classified into pituitary-directed, adrenal-blocking, and glucocorticoid receptor-antagonizing drugs. Recent studies demonstrate that somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (sst(5)) and dopamine receptor subtype 2 (D(2)) are frequently (co-)expressed by corticotroph adenomas.

- **Pituitary-directed therapy**: Pasireotide and cabergoline, targeting sst(5) and D(2) respectively, are successful in approximately 25–30% of patients.
- **Adrenal-blocking therapy**: These drugs can be effective by inhibiting steroidogenic enzyme activity.
- **Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists**: The use of mifepristone induces clinical and metabolic improvement in the majority of patients.

Each drug can have important side effects that may impair long-term treatment. Generally, patients with moderate to severe hypercortisolism require ongoing management to address these issues.

### Pituitary tumor centers of excellence for Cushing's disease [^114BNMfr]. Pituitary (2022). High credibility.

In cases where symptoms of Cushing's disease persist after surgery or radiotherapy, it becomes crucial for the endocrinologist to carefully evaluate and select from the various medical treatments available to manage hypercortisolism. The current options include ketoconazole, cabergoline, mifepristone, metyrapone, and pasireotide. However, staying informed about newly approved drug treatments is essential. Among these new drugs, pasireotide — a novel somatostatin receptor ligand — has been approved and can normalize cortisol levels in about 20% of patients. Unfortunately, serious side effects like hyperglycemia occur in 50% of patients.

- **Therapies targeting adrenal steroidogenesis**: This includes ketoconazole, metyrapone, osilodrostat, mitotane, etomidate, and levoketoconazole.
- **Targeting the peripheral glucocorticoid receptor**: Mifepristone is used for this purpose.

An in-depth understanding of the various mechanisms of action, limitations, and risks associated with these drugs is imperative. The clinical endocrinologist plays a pivotal role starting from the suspicion and diagnosis of the disease to the comprehensive management of treatment — be it surgical or medical — along with the control of complications. A life-long follow-up is mandatory.

The pituitary tumor center of excellence (PTCOE) overseeing the patient may include expert radiotherapists as part of the unit or bring them in externally to manage patients not responding adequately to surgery or medical treatment. The outcomes of radiotherapy can vary and often require several years to become evident. In recent years, highly focused radiation techniques such as stereotactic radiotherapy have been utilized.
