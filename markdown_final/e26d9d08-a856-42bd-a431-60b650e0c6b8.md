## Question

Can gentamicin be used to treat conjunctivitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gentamicin can be used to treat conjunctivitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely etiology of conjunctivitis and whether an antibiotic is even indicated. Then, I should verify whether gentamicin ophthalmic is FDA‑labeled for conjunctivitis and confirm the dosing. Next, I should review the evidence for benefit versus observation, consider comparative options and tolerability, assess safety and stewardship, and finally account for special scenarios like sexually transmitted or neonatal disease before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the etiologic framework because that dictates whether any antibiotic helps at all: most acute conjunctivitis in outpatient settings is viral, and antibiotics do not help viral disease, whereas bacterial conjunctivitis is often self‑limited but may benefit modestly from antibiotics, so I need to avoid overcalling bacterial etiology and overprescribing, especially since distinguishing viral from bacterial clinically is imprecise and often misclassified, leading to unnecessary antibiotic use [^1138Wf4y] [^114aP5sv] [^113eJ6MH] [^112ByJSW] [^117E7fSP].

> I should confirm the formal indication next: gentamicin sulfate ophthalmic solution is FDA‑labeled for topical treatment of ocular bacterial infections, explicitly including conjunctivitis caused by susceptible organisms, so yes, gentamicin can be used for bacterial conjunctivitis when the presentation supports that diagnosis or culture confirms a susceptible pathogen [^115aysg7].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing so I don't misstate it: the FDA labeling recommends instilling one to two drops into the affected eye every four hours, with the option to increase to two drops every hour in severe infections, and I should also remember standard administration hygiene to avoid tip contamination [^112HNxbN] [^notfound].

> I need to check precautions and adverse effects before endorsing use: hypersensitivity to any component is a contraindication, prolonged or unnecessary use can promote overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms and resistance, and common local adverse reactions include burning, irritation, nonspecific conjunctivitis, epithelial defects, and hyperemia, so I should advise patients to stop and seek care if irritation or symptoms worsen during therapy [^114MVBSm] [^116iu1mF] [^1127Kcef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefit; I should review the evidence base: randomized trials and Cochrane reviews show that many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis resolve spontaneously, and antibiotics provide a modest reduction in symptom duration and improved early clinical cure compared with placebo, which supports a shared decision‑making approach that balances small benefits against resistance and cost, especially in mild disease [^116vUc9B] [^115L23qK] [^114aP5sv] [^1138Wf4y].

> Next, I should review comparative options and tolerability because choice of agent can affect comfort and adherence: fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin and ofloxacin have robust conjunctivitis efficacy data from randomized trials and labels, and in vitro kinetics suggest faster kill of common pathogens with moxifloxacin compared to gentamicin or tobramycin, which may translate to quicker symptom relief, though head‑to‑head clinical superiority across topical antibiotics is generally limited; additionally, netilmicin has shown better microbiologic eradication than gentamicin in one randomized trial, but availability varies and this single study should be interpreted cautiously, and I should note that some tolerability comparisons derive from keratitis literature and may not fully generalize to conjunctivitis, so I need to be careful not to overextend those data [^112xFojS] [^115M68nh] [^116yv65c] [^114BMe6s] [^112DDhjs] [^114UfUJX].

> But wait, what if this is not routine bacterial conjunctivitis; I should double‑check special circumstances: viral conjunctivitis should receive supportive care only and no antibiotic, gonococcal conjunctivitis requires urgent systemic therapy with ceftriaxone per CDC guidance rather than topical monotherapy, and neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis requires systemic macrolide therapy, so gentamicin drops would be inadequate or adjunctive at best in these scenarios [^114aP5sv] [^113WmGbR] [^1124hbVt].

> Bringing this together, my clinical recommendation should be cautious and stewardship‑oriented: if the presentation is classic for viral disease, avoid antibiotics; if bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected or confirmed and no STI red flags are present, gentamicin ophthalmic is a legitimate FDA‑approved option with dosing of one to two drops every four hours, escalating to every hour if severe, while monitoring for irritation or hypersensitivity and stopping if symptoms worsen; given the modest absolute benefit of antibiotics and the risk of resistance, consider observation in mild cases and prefer agents with favorable comfort profiles and strong efficacy data when rapid symptom control is desired or adherence is a concern, discussing options such as gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, or moxifloxacin when appropriate and available [^115aysg7] [^112HNxbN] [^116vUc9B] [^115L23qK] [^1127Kcef] [^114aP5sv] [^112xFojS] [^115M68nh] [^116yv65c].

---

Gentamicin ophthalmic solution is indicated for **bacterial conjunctivitis** caused by susceptible organisms, especially gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^115aysg7], though **it is not first-line for mild cases** due to self-limited course [^115L23qK] and resistance concerns; typical dosing is 1–2 drops every 4 hours [^112HNxbN], increasing to hourly in severe infections [^112HNxbN]. Common adverse effects include ocular irritation and hypersensitivity [^1127Kcef]; discontinue if reactions occur, and gentamicin is contraindicated [^114MVBSm] in known hypersensitivity and should be avoided in neonates due to safety concerns [^116iu1mF]. Use is reserved for **severe or resistant cases**, with fluoroquinolones or macrolides preferred for first-line therapy.

---

## Indications and spectrum of activity

Gentamicin ophthalmic solution is indicated for the topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis caused by susceptible organisms [^115aysg7]. Susceptible organisms include gram-positive bacteria — Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes [^115aysg7] — and gram-negative bacteria — Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Serratia marcescens [^115aysg7]. Gentamicin is **particularly effective against gram-negative organisms** [^117XT7Ln], notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common pathogen in contact lens-associated conjunctivitis.

---

## Clinical efficacy

Gentamicin has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK], particularly infections caused by gram-negative organisms, though its efficacy against gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, **may be limited compared to other antibiotics** like fluoroquinolones or macrolides. A randomized controlled trial comparing gentamicin with netilmicin found that netilmicin **had superior clinical and microbiological efficacy**, particularly against gram-positive organisms. In vitro studies also showed that gentamicin demonstrated slower bactericidal activity compared with moxifloxacin [^114BMe6s], a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.

---

## Dosage and administration

For bacterial conjunctivitis, **instill one or two drops into the affected eye(s) every four hours** [^112HNxbN] for mild to moderate infections. For severe infections, instill two drops every hour [^112HNxbN] until improvement, then reduce the dosing frequency before discontinuation. Treatment duration typically ranges from 7 to 10 days, depending on clinical response.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Gentamicin ophthalmic solution is generally well tolerated, but adverse effects may occur, including:

- **Common adverse effects**: Ocular burning, irritation [^1127Kcef], conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival epithelial defects.

- **Rare adverse effects**: Allergic reactions [^1127Kcef], corneal ulcers, fungal superinfections, thrombocytopenic purpura, hallucinations.

- **Systemic toxicity**: Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity are rare with topical administration [^1168VaHE] but may occur with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing renal impairment [^112GZHuu].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Gentamicin ophthalmic solution **is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity** to gentamicin or any of its components [^114MVBSm]. Precautions include:

- **Prolonged use**: May lead to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi [^116iu1mF].

- **Pregnancy**: Use only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to the fetus [^116iu1mF].

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness in neonates have not been established [^116iu1mF].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Gentamicin is effective against gram-negative organisms but may be less effective against gram-positive bacteria [^112DDhjs] than fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin) [^114BMe6s] [^114tmj3N] or macrolides (e.g. azithromycin) [^114RJiQp]. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides are **often preferred as first-line therapy** due to broader spectrum activity and superior clinical efficacy against common bacterial pathogens causing conjunctivitis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **judicious use** of topical antibiotics, including gentamicin, for bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) **advises against indiscriminate antibiotic use**, as many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited and resolve without specific treatment [^114aP5sv]. Antibiotics should be reserved for moderate to severe cases, contact lens-associated infections, or immunocompromised patients.

---

## Resistance patterns and concerns

Resistance to **gentamicin** among ocular pathogens has been reported, particularly among gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Surveillance studies have documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates resistant to gentamicin, raising concerns about its effectiveness as a first-line agent.

---

## Special considerations

In contact lens wearers, gentamicin is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa — a common pathogen in contact lens-associated conjunctivitis — though **fluoroquinolones are often preferred** because of their broader-spectrum activity. In immunocompromised patients with suspected or confirmed gram-negative infections, gentamicin may be considered; however, susceptibility testing [^117XT7Ln] and close monitoring [^117JnV2W] are recommended.

---

Gentamicin ophthalmic solution is effective for bacterial conjunctivitis [^115aysg7], especially gram-negative infections like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is not first-line for mild cases due to resistance concerns and limited efficacy against gram-positive organisms. Use is reserved for **severe or resistant cases**, with fluoroquinolones or macrolides preferred for first-line therapy.

### Topical antibiotics for the management of bacterial keratitis: An evidence-based review of high quality randomised controlled trials [^114UfUJX]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). High credibility.

Severe bacterial keratitis (BK) typically requires intensive antimicrobial therapy. Empiric therapy is usually administered with a topical fluoroquinolone or a fortified aminoglycoside-cephalosporin combination. Trials at the time of writing have not reached any consensus as to which antibiotic regimen most effectively treats BK.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis using Cochrane methodology was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in the management of BK. Outcomes included treatment success, time to cure, serious complications of infection, and adverse effects.

- **Results**: A comprehensive search for trials resulted in 27,956 abstracts for review. This eventually resulted in 16 high-quality trials involving 1,823 participants included in the review. Treatment success, time to cure, and serious complications of infection were comparable among all antibiotic treatments included in the review. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of corneal perforation with any included antibiotics or antibiotic classes. Fluoroquinolones significantly reduced the risk of ocular discomfort and chemical conjunctivitis but increased the risk of white precipitate formation compared with aminoglycoside-cephalosporin. Fortified tobramycin-cefazolin was approximately three times more likely to cause ocular discomfort than other topical antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Results of this review suggest no evidence of difference in comparative effectiveness between fluoroquinolones and aminoglycoside-cephalosporin treatment options in the management of BK.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^116CLz68]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Another factor which may explain the divergence in bacterial conjunctivitis incidence rates between Europe and the U.S. is the medical practice patterns and physicians' attitudes towards the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. American doctors may be more aggressive in treating bacterial conjunctivitis with antibiotics than their European counterparts. The effects of delayed antibacterial treatment may influence the transmission rate of bacterial conjunctivitis and consequently affect the incidence rates.

From a health economics perspective, it is possible to compare the costs obtained in the paper and examine them in relation to other cost-of-illness studies which have been conducted for vision-related disorders in the United States and elsewhere during roughly the same time period. Thus, assuming that the annual cost of treating and managing patients with bacterial conjunctivitis is as given in the base-case analysis, i.e. $589 million, it is possible to contrast this against other cost-of-illness studies to better understand its relative impact.

A review of cost-of-illness studies conducted in eye diseases in 2004 found that the total financial cost of major visual disorders among US residents over 40 years of age was $35.4 billion, with $16.2 billion due to direct medical costs, $11.1 billion due to other direct costs, and $8 billion due to lost productivity. The authors further calculated that the direct medical costs for selected blinding conditions in the United States amounted to $6.8 billion for cataracts, $5.5 billion for refractive errors.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^112Hw1t1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. The use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and there is no evidence demonstrating the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infections and requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

The rapid onset and progression of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis often requires…

### Primary meningococcal conjunctivitis [^111kZUeg]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Neisseria meningitidis is an uncommon cause of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. One case of primary meningococcal conjunctivitis in a healthy 6-year-old boy is reported. The patient was initially treated with a topical instillation of polymyxin B, neomycin, and gramicidin in an ophthalmic solution, followed by systemic rifampin once the diagnosis had been established. No ocular or systemic complications developed.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^112h36Z5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

The literature on the epidemiology of bacterial conjunctivitis indicates its highly contagious nature; however, no overall population-based data exists on its incidence. In the United States, it is estimated that 23% of bacterial conjunctivitis cases occur in the 0–2 year age range, 28% occur in the 3–9 year range, 13% occur in the 10–19 year range, with the remaining 36% occurring in adults.

Existing clinic-based estimates from Norway have calculated the prevalence of the most severe form of acute infective bacterial conjunctivitis to be approximately 30 out of 1000 patients in general medical practice. However, a correct diagnosis was only made in about two-thirds of these cases. Similar clinic-based data from the United Kingdom indicate a rise in the proportion of patients seeking medical attention for conjunctivitis, increasing from 284 per 10,000 in 1981–1982 to 395 per 10,000 in 1991–1992. It is estimated that acute bacterial conjunctivitis represents up to 1% of all visits to general practitioners in the United Kingdom.

General practitioners often over-diagnose bacterial conjunctivitis due to the challenges in differentiating between bacterial and viral forms of the disease. A 2002 survey of general practitioners in the United Kingdom found that only 36% felt confident in correctly differentiating between acute bacterial and viral conjunctivitis. Additionally, 95% of the physicians surveyed indicated they face challenges in accurate diagnosis.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114wjze1]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

We found 312 nonduplicate records from our search of electronic databases and included 12 studies presented as a narrative synthesis or meta-analysis (see Figure 1 for the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram).

Figure 1. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagram of the study-selection process.

- **Characteristics of the studies**: Characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. Of the 12 studies, 9 were nonrandomized. Three studies were randomized controlled trials; however, only 1 group in each study assessed an eligible treatment. Of the 9 nonrandomized studies, 8 collected data prospectively and 1 collected data retrospectively. Two of the studies used the same cohort of neonates but reported different outcomes. Four studies were conducted in the United States, 4 in Sweden, 1 in Kenya, 1 in Mexico, and 2 in Hong Kong.

Table 1. Characteristics of Included Studies

- **Participants**: In total, 292 neonates with a confirmed microbiological diagnosis of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis were included. Sample sizes ranged from 12 to 45. Two studies included older infants, but they comprised less than 10% of the sample size; all other studies included neonates with disease onset in the first month of life. When reported, the distribution of male to female neonates seemed equal within the individual studies. Seven studies reported that neonates had received a previous prophylactic intervention such as topical silver nitrate solution, erythro…

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^114DrM7v]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines and criteria for diagnosing and treating acute infectious conjunctivitis based on natural history and etiology are available. However, greater awareness of and adherence to differential diagnosis should be kept in mind to improve outcomes in patients presenting with suspected acute infectious conjunctivitis.

- **Epidemiology and clinical presentation**: Discriminating features of viral, bacterial, and allergic acute conjunctivitis are synthesized from clinical observations.

	- **Viral conjunctivitis**: Adenoviruses are the cause of most (65–90%) cases of viral conjunctivitis, while the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is responsible for 1.3–4.8% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis. Other viruses associated with conjunctivitis include varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) and Molluscum contagiosum. Adenoviruses are nonenveloped viruses that are relatively resistant to disinfection. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is highly contagious, due in part to the capacity of the virus to survive in a desiccated state at room temperature for several weeks. Transmission risk is 10–50%, and the infection may spread via personal contact or indirectly through shared items. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is self-limiting, with improvement of signs and symptoms within 5–14 days. Often, the condition presents as unilateral in early phases and eventually spreads to both eyes. Adenovirus serotypes are associated with different types of ocular infection, including pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC).

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^112Ch28x]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye infections in childhood and a common cause of pediatric primary care visits and ocular complaints in pediatric emergency departments. Bacterial infection accounts for up to 50% of all conjunctivitis cases in adults and as many as 70–80% of cases in children.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by mucopurulent discharge and conjunctival hyperemia. It is an extremely contagious disease caused by one or more bacterial species and affects both sexes, all ages, ethnicities, and countries. It can also cause epidemics among people in close quarters, including nursery, school, and student populations. Mild cases are generally considered to be self-limiting, resolving in 5–10 days. However, consensus supports the use of topical antibiotics as they provide significantly better rates of early clinical cure and microbiological resolution compared with artificial tears. Topical antibiotics are also known to reduce the rate of reinfection and prevent infection spread.

There are only a few available options for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis with topical antibiotics in children as most available topical antibiotics have been approved based on clinical studies performed only in adults. Although regulatory health authorities worldwide encourage pediatric clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics are yet to be formally tested in this population. Thus, specific clinical data are still required for children with this indication.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^113eJ6MH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (approximately 80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms include allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the U.S. population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for approximately 2% of all medical consultations in the United States and countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate, delay, or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care settings.

### Ocuflox [^115M68nh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial, Ocuflox ophthalmic solution was superior to its vehicle after two days of treatment in patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical improvement rate of 86% (54/63) for the ofloxacin-treated group versus 72% (48/67) for the placebo-treated group after two days of therapy. Microbiological outcomes for the same clinical trial demonstrated an eradication rate for causative pathogens of 65% (41/63) for the ofloxacin-treated group versus 25% (17/67) for the vehicle-treated group after two days of therapy. Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

- **Corneal ulcers**: In a randomized, double-masked, multi-center clinical trial of 140 subjects with positive cultures, Ocuflox ophthalmic solution-treated subjects had an overall clinical success rate (complete re-epithelialization and no progression of the infiltrate for two consecutive visits) of 82% (61/74) compared to 80% (53/66) for the fortified antibiotic group, consisting of 1.5% tobramycin and 10% cefazolin solutions. The median time to clinical success was 11 days for the ofloxacin-treated group and 10 days for the fortified treatment group.

We learned several lessons from conducting this project. Small steps of change are useful when testing an intervention. When designing an intervention, it is important to consider the wider range of healthcare professionals that might be impacted. Healthcare professionals are not lazy or unintelligent; the system they work within limits their time, keeps them busy, and makes them tired. It is unreasonable to expect individuals not to make mistakes in such a high-pressure environment. Therefore, interventions should aim to eliminate human factors that could affect the process.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^111UqhzB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic predominantly used in gram-negative infections, but it also has anti-staphylococcal activity. It is commonly chosen because it lacks diffogenicity. There are recognized issues with its dosing, with time being a major factor. A baseline study demonstrated that dosing was performed correctly only 30% of the time, which has serious consequences for the treatment of infections. This quality improvement project intervened with the use of a gentamicin calculator, enabling users to perform three complex mathematical equations simultaneously without error. Post-measurement demonstrated that correct dosing increased to 92%, which was a significant improvement.

### Bacterial profile of ocular infections: A systematic review [^113G4sFT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria pose threats to ophthalmic tissues. However, Gram-positive bacteria are the major contributors to ocular infections. Bacterial ocular infections involve, but are not limited to, blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, and orbital cellulitis. The distribution and proportion of bacterial isolates vary among the different clinical diagnoses but without exclusive anatomical restriction. To mitigate the burden of bacterial ocular infections, physicians should focus on risk reduction and comply with an etiologic approach to diagnosis.

### Gentamicin [^112GZHuu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Serum concentrations of aminoglycosides should be monitored when feasible to ensure adequate levels and to avoid potentially toxic levels. When monitoring gentamicin peak concentrations, dosage should be adjusted so that prolonged levels above 12 mcg/mL are avoided. Similarly, when monitoring gentamicin trough concentrations, dosage should be adjusted to avoid levels above 2 mcg/mL. Excessive peak and/or trough serum concentrations of aminoglycosides may increase the risk of renal and eighth cranial nerve toxicity. In the event of overdose or toxic reactions, hemodialysis may aid in the removal of gentamicin from the blood, especially if renal function is, or becomes, compromised. The rate of removal of gentamicin is considerably less by peritoneal dialysis than by hemodialysis. In the newborn infant, exchange transfusions may also be considered.

- **Use of other drugs**: Sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs, such as cisplatin, cephaloridine, kanamycin, amikacin, neomycin, polymyxin B, colistin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, vancomycin, and viomycin, should be avoided. Other factors which may increase patient risk of toxicity include advanced age and dehydration.

- **Interaction with diuretics**: The use of gentamicin with potent diuretics, such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide, should be avoided since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity. In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue.

### Zymaxid [^112xFojS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). High credibility.

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trials, patients aged 1 to 89 years were dosed for 5 days. Zymaxid was clinically superior to its vehicle on day 6 in patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures. The clinical outcomes demonstrated clinical success, defined as the resolution of conjunctival hyperemia and conjunctival discharge, in 58% (193/333) of patients treated with gatifloxacin compared to 45% (148/325) in the vehicle-treated groups.

The microbiological outcomes for the same trials showed a statistically superior eradication rate for causative pathogens of 90% (301/333) for the gatifloxacin group versus 70% (228/325) for the vehicle group. Please note that microbiological eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcomes in anti-infective trials.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999 and was updated in 2006 and again in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-masked randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic, and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently checked and reviewed the data.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^116sHGce]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

What is the best treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis? Topical antibiotics expedite recovery from bacterial conjunctivitis. The choice of antibiotic usually does not affect the outcome.

- **Recognition of key distinguishing features**: Identifying the unique signs during history taking and physical examination is crucial.
- **Choice of antibiotic**: While the specific antibiotic may not significantly impact outcomes, appropriate selection is essential.
- **When to refer for specialist treatment**: Recognizing when to escalate to specialist care ensures optimal patient management.

### Comprehensive profile of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in conjunctivitis cases from Niger [^1145FcJ9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a feature of many infectious disease outbreaks, and recognition of the ocular signs and symptoms is critical in minimizing the spread of the disease. In the United States and the developing world, outpatient conjunctivitis is thought to be predominantly viral in etiology. In this setting, the appropriate clinical management is hand hygiene, limitation of social contacts, and conservative care without antimicrobials. In other parts of the world, such as Burkina Faso, a sub-Saharan African country, the pathogen profile is more diverse, and in some cases, antimicrobials may be appropriate and even lifesaving. Thus, the general call to curb antibacterial treatment of acute infectious conjunctivitis to minimize antimicrobial resistance (AMR) may need to be reinterpreted within both social and geographic contexts.

Niger is a low- to middle-income country in West Africa that borders Burkina Faso. It has a high burden of morbidity and mortality, and mass drug distributions for infectious diseases are common. The country has a health system to provide some essential health care, including conjunctivitis. However, because accessibility to laboratory testing is limited, the microbial characterization of pathogens associated with acute conjunctivitis is sparse for Niger. In this context, we aimed to determine 1) the signs and symptoms and 2) the pathogen profile associated with acute infectious conjunctivitis. Furthermore, we characterized the existing AMR determinants, or resistome, in patients at the individual level, demonstrating the potential utilization.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^111tS7Dh]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Gentamicin dosing and prescription are often carried out incorrectly, despite very clear guidelines. Gentamicin is one of the few antibiotics that is weight-dependent in adults. The weight at which gentamicin needs to be prescribed is the patient's own body weight. This requirement changes for obese individuals, where it must be administered according to a corrected body weight, which involves a series of mathematical calculations. These calculations necessitate knowing the patient's height and weight, which can be a significant challenge, especially if the patient is bed-bound.

An additional issue is that the gentamicin prescribing regimen is relative to the patient's renal function. An accurate and acceptable measure of a patient's renal function is their creatinine clearance (CrCl). CrCl is not typically provided with the rest of the blood results and must be manually calculated. Most prescribers use eGFR as a substitute, although it should not be used for its relative inaccuracy. The height and weight of patients are nearly always guessed or approximated, which means that patients can be severely underdosed or overdosed.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.

- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.

- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^117Fn4Gc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

There are concerns about whether antibiotic therapy confers significant clinical benefit in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The aim of this review was to assess the benefit and harm of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SIGLE, NRR, PubMed, and the reference lists of identified trial reports. The Science Citation Index was used to find articles citing the relevant studies. Contact was made with investigators and pharmaceutical companies for information about additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-masked randomized controlled trials in which any form of antibiotic treatment was compared with a placebo in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic, and combination treatments (e.g. antibiotics and steroids).

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author extracted data, and its accuracy was checked by a second author.

- **Main results**: This review includes five trials that randomized a total of 1,034 participants. One additional trial is currently 'awaiting assessment'; it has been published in abstract form and has yet to be fully reported. Three of the trials have been conducted on a selected specialist care patient population, while the two more recent trials have been conducted in a community care setting.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^113snc1u]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The high rate of bacterial resolution noted in this study is consistent with the targeted efficacy of azithromycin 1.5% against the bacterial spectrum found in children. Following azithromycin treatment, the bacteriological cure rate was about 90% (D7), ranging from 76.5% to 100%, depending on the microbe. This is similar to the results previously found with both azithromycin and other topical ophthalmic solutions. Azithromycin effectively eradicated all causative pathogens, including classically resistant species such as Acinetobacteria, Corynebacteria, and Enterobacteria.

Following azithromycin eye drop application, sustained antibiotic concentrations in tears and conjunctival cells are usually much higher than the plasma concentrations reached after oral administration of azithromycin. This could explain why even bacteria resistant to plasma concentrations of azithromycin are susceptible to azithromycin eye drop treatment, which has an antibiotic concentration several times the minimum inhibitory concentration for bacteria usually defined as resistant. The pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin justify the short treatment duration of only one drop twice daily for 3 days for a rapid antibacterial action. The present study has confirmed that this treatment regimen, already established in adults, is also effective in the paediatric population, including children younger than 24 months old.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to the overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

- **Objective**: To determine the relative prevalence of viral versus bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs suggest a viral versus bacterial etiology.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search (January 1946 - March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

- **Study selection**: Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

- **Results**: In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month - 18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was significantly different.

### Gentamicin alone is inadequate to eradicate Neisseria gonorrhoeae from the pharynx [^117CKWNK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend 240 mg gentamicin plus 2 g azithromycin for the treatment of gonorrhea in cephalosporin-allergic patients. However, the efficacy of gentamicin alone for treating pharyngeal gonorrhea is uncertain.

- **Methods**: Between September 2018 and March 2019, we enrolled men who have sex with men diagnosed with pharyngeal gonorrhea via nucleic acid amplification test in a single-arm, unblinded clinical trial. Participants received a single 360-mg intramuscular dose of gentamicin and underwent a test of cure by culture 4–7 days later. The study measured creatinine at enrollment and at the test of cure, as well as serum gentamicin concentration post-dose to establish peak concentration (Cmax), and standard antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by agar dilution. The trial was designed to establish a point estimate for gentamicin's efficacy for pharyngeal gonorrhea. We planned to enroll 50 evaluable participants; assuming gentamicin was 80% efficacious, the trial would establish a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 66%-90%. Interim analyses were planned at n = 10 and n = 25.

- **Results**: The study was stopped early due to poor efficacy. Of 13 enrolled men, 10 were evaluable, and only 2 (20% [95% CI, 2.5%-55.6%]) were cured. Efficacy was not associated with gentamicin Cmax or MIC. No participants experienced renal insufficiency. The mean creatinine percentage change was +5.2% (range, -6.7% to 21.3%). Six (46%) participants experienced headaches, all deemed unrelated to treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Gentamicin alone failed to eradicate Neisseria gonorrhoeae from the pharynx.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis is a common problem. The objective of this review is to examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis, as well as the use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

An evidence review involved a search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible articles were selected following a review of titles, abstracts, and references.

- **Findings**: Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment. The signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow an earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help. Itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.

### Gentamicin [^117XT7Ln]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Specimens for bacterial culture should be obtained to isolate and identify causative organisms and determine their susceptibility to gentamicin.

- **Use in gram-negative infections**: Gentamicin may be considered as initial therapy in suspected or confirmed gram-negative infections, and therapy may be instituted before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. The decision to continue therapy with this drug should be based on the results of susceptibility tests, the severity of the infection, and important additional concepts contained in the boxed warnings above. If the causative organisms are resistant to gentamicin, other appropriate therapy should be instituted.

- **Use in serious infections with unknown causative organisms**: In serious infections when the causative organisms are unknown, gentamicin may be administered as initial therapy in conjunction with a penicillin-type or cephalosporin-type drug before obtaining results of susceptibility testing. If anaerobic organisms are suspected as etiologic agents, consideration should be given to using other suitable antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with gentamicin. Following identification of the organism and its susceptibility, appropriate antibiotic therapy should then be continued.

- **Combination therapy**: Gentamicin has been used effectively in combination with carbenicillin for the treatment of life-threatening infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has also been found effective when used in conjunction with a penicillin-type drug for the treatment of endocarditis caused by group D streptococci.

- **Use in staphylococcal infections**: Gentamicin injection has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^117KwUkn]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic predominantly used in gram-negative infections, though it also possesses anti-staphylococcal activity. Its common usage is attributed to its lack of nephrogenicity. However, recognized issues with its dosing, primarily related to timing, persist.

A baseline study demonstrated that dosing was conducted correctly only 30% of the time, posing serious consequences for the treatment of infections. This quality improvement project introduced a gentamicin calculator, enabling users to perform three complex mathematical equations simultaneously without error.

### Besifloxacin: a novel anti-infective for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis [^111nAcTs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). High credibility.

Bacterial conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is demographically unbiased in its prevalence and can be caused by a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Timely empiric treatment with a broad-spectrum anti-infective, such as a topical fluoroquinolone, is critical in preventing potentially irreversible ocular damage. However, the rise in ocular methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and the patterns of fluoroquinolone resistance for patients with other ocular bacterial infections mandate the need for new agents targeted for ocular use.

Besifloxacin, a novel broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, is approved for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. It has a uniquely balanced dual-targeting activity that inhibits both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and is associated with a lower incidence of resistance development. Besifloxacin is not marketed in other formulations, ensuring that its exposure is limited to bacterial populations in and around the eye. This specifically precludes any bacterial exposure to besifloxacin resulting from systemic use, which further reduces the likelihood of emergence of bacterial resistance.

In vitro, besifloxacin has demonstrated equivalent or superior activity compared with other commonly used topical antibiotics. In clinical trials, besifloxacin has consistently demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis. Besifloxacin is considered safe and is well tolerated with no observed contraindications.

### Microbiological study of dacryocystitis in northwest of Iran [^111xxUvQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, among the various strains, the most effective antibiotics were ciprofloxacin (75.9%), followed by ceftriaxone (73.6%), vancomycin (67.8%), chloramphenicol (60.9%), gentamicin (56.3%), and erythromycin (52.9%). It should be noted that although ciprofloxacin was the most common susceptible antibiotic to isolated bacteria, its greatest effect was on gram-negative microorganisms such as H. influenzae, Pseudomonas, and E. coli, which were not common pathogens of dacryocystitis.

S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pneumoniae, the most isolated bacteria from acute and chronic dacryocystitis, were most susceptible to vancomycin and chloramphenicol. However, because antibiotic resistance to chloramphenicol and vancomycin has been reported between 32% and 39%, determination of the bacterial species and antibiogram seems important in patients with dacryocystitis. According to our findings, after S. epidermidis, the most isolated bacteria in chronic dacryocystitis is Pseudomonas. Given that Pseudomonas shows the highest sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, it seems that in addition to vancomycin, ciprofloxacin is also important in the management of chronic disease. Additionally, in children under the age of 10 years, Pseudomonas and H. influenzae were the most common pathogens, with greatest susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.

The differences among studies indicate that there are obvious variations in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in geographic areas due to the regional pathogens.

### Improving the correct prescription and dosage of gentamicin [^112ZVEXQ]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2012). Low credibility.

When considering the underlying cause of this problem, it became clear that the calculations involved in accurately determining the correct dose of gentamicin were too complex for the busy environment in which healthcare professionals work. The reliance on mentally calculating the dose had to be overcome. The most obvious solution was to automate these calculations and generate the correct dose based on inputting specific parameters. A gentamicin calculator was developed, allowing users to input a patient's height, weight, age, creatinine, and gender, which would then provide a result by pressing a 'dose' button.

### Evaluation of the effect of gentamicin in surgical perfusion solution on cataract postoperative endophthalmitis [^111chJa5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Perioperative instillation of fluoroquinolone is a common approach for preventing endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. The concentration of different quinolone antibiotics in the anterior chamber can reach 1–4 µg/ml. To reduce endophthalmitis incidence, intracameral injection of cefuroxime, moxifloxacin, and vancomycin in the surgical perfusion solution has been adopted in clinical practice. However, adverse reactions due to antibiotics are a serious concern. Gentamicin is a concentration-dependent antibiotic with a superior bactericidal effect on Staphylococcus. Here, we reported that adding gentamicin to the perfusion solution could reduce cataract postoperative endophthalmitis incidence, and no obvious side effects were observed. When gentamicin is administered systemically, significant side effects can occur if Cmax exceeds 12 µg/mL. The safe concentration of gentamicin in the perfusion solution was much higher than the MIC 90, suggesting an excellent bactericidal effect on coagulase-negative pathogens such as Staphylococci strains.

In this study, the drug sensitivity breakpoints of levofloxacin and gentamicin were 4 µg/mL and 80 µg/ml, respectively. Most pathogens, except 4 strains of Enterococci, were sensitive to 80 µg/mL gentamicin. One strain of MRSE and one strain of MRSA were detected in group B samples; however, their MICs of gentamicin were lower than 80 µg/mL. This suggests that postoperative endophthalmitis can be caused by factors other than antibiotic precaution, such as the immune condition or intraocular pharmacokinetics of antibiotics.

### Intravitreal vancomycin and gentamicin concentrations in patients with postoperative endophthalmitis [^111YAFJN]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the intravitreal antibiotic concentrations and the efficacy of an intravitreal dosing regimen in treating patients with postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. This regimen, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations, utilizes a repeat antibiotic injection of a lower dose than is generally used.

- **Methods**: In consecutive patients with suspected postoperative endophthalmitis, a vitreous biopsy for bacterial culture was taken before administering 0.2 mg of vancomycin and 0.05 mg of gentamicin intravitreally. After 3 or 4 days, a second biopsy was conducted for bacteriological culture and to measure intravitreal vancomycin and gentamicin concentrations, followed by a repeat injection of 0.2 mg of vancomycin.

- **Results**: The study included 17 patients. The initial bacterial culture was positive in 11 patients, predominantly showing coagulase-negative staphylococci. All second vitreous biopsies were sterile. Intravitreal vancomycin levels ranged between 2.6 and 18.0 µg/ml (mean 10.3, SD 4.1 µg/ml) after 3 days, and between 3.1 and 16.6 µg/ml (mean 7.5, SD 6.2 µg/ml) after 4 days, which is well above the minimal inhibitory concentration for most micro-organisms. Intravitreal gentamicin concentrations varied between 0.90 and 3.3 µg/ml (mean 1.6, SD 0.72 µg/ml) after 3 days, and between 1.2 and 2.6 µg/ml (mean 1.9, SD 0.99 µg/ml) after 4 days.

- **Conclusion**: This dosing regimen resulted in adequate intravitreal vancomycin and gentamicin levels for over a week and in negative second cultures. This study also provides new information on intravitreal antibiotic pharmacokinetics.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. Clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Gk6kb]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception date to July 14, 2017. The search strategy included keywords and text words for chlamydia, ON, conjunctivitis, and the drug names. We did not impose language or study type restrictions. We also reviewed the reference lists of relevant study, guideline, and systematic review reports (see "Search Strategy" in Supplementary Material). Two investigators independently screened citations according to title and abstract and screened the full text of the relevant articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulting with a third investigator.

We included primary studies on the effects of oral erythromycin, azithromycin, or trimethoprim in treating neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis. Although other oral and topical antimicrobial agents are available, these three antimicrobials were chosen by the WHO guideline panel as a high priority for review because they are used more widely in lower- and middle-income countries, and there is an outstanding question about which of them should be used in practice. We included any dosing regimen but were particularly interested in the effects of doses commonly used in lower- and middle-income countries: erythromycin in four daily divided doses orally for 14 days at 20, 30, or 50 mg/kg body weight per day; azithromycin at 20 mg/kg per day orally (one dose or for three days); and trimethoprim at 40 mg plus sulfa at 200 mg orally, twice daily for 14 days.

### Gentamicin [^117JnV2W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Gentamicin Injection, USP, and other antibacterial drugs, Gentamicin Injection, USP, should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Gentamicin Injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species (indole-positive and indole-negative), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, Citrobacter species, and Staphylococcus species (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative).

Clinical studies have shown Gentamicin Injection to be effective in bacterial neonatal sepsis; bacterial septicemia; and serious bacterial infections of the central nervous system (meningitis), urinary tract, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (including peritonitis), skin, bone, and soft tissue (including burns). Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, are not indicated in uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are susceptible to these antibiotics and are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential for toxicity.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1176Behv]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gonococcal urethritis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend considering single doses of gentamicin IM 240 mg plus azithromycin PO 2 g, or cefixime PO 800 mg, if ceftriaxone is not available.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^112T3UL2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial, as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118XTQ7]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

A World Health Organization (WHO) guideline panel consisting of clinicians, neonatologists, pathologists, researchers, and program managers with expertise in sexually transmitted infections informed our inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. We adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and completed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: Implications for treatment and management [^117E7fSP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (~80%) for infectious conjunctivitis, despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be less than 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3,237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols.

### Vigamox [^116yv65c]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter, controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed three times a day for four days, VIGAMOX® produced clinical cures on Days 5–6 in 66% to 69% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis. Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84% to 94%.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with VIGAMOX or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92% at Day 9.

Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

### Systemic side effects of eye drops: A pharmacokinetic perspective [^1168VaHE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

The following sheds some light on the possible adverse systemic side effects for some drug classes that are frequently prescribed:

- **Antibiotics**: Bacterial inflammations of the eye are indeed much less common than other causes of inflammation, but when present, they can often result in more serious diseases. Most ocular bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, which may also cause systemic reactions. Some antibiotics have a wide therapeutic range; therefore, it is possible to administer these compounds systemically at high doses, and thus they are used for treating the posterior regions of the eye, which are normally difficult to access. Dermatological side effects such as skin irritation, itching, or rashes may be triggered by topical medications, e.g. sulfonamide and sulfacetamide. It is also possible that fluoroquinolone can affect taste. Discontinuation of therapy is usually not necessary, but patients should be informed and warned about these probable side effects before starting or continuing treatment. The most popular aminoglycosides in use are tobramycin and gentamicin, which are often used in combination with a corticosteroid and have a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, as well as neomycin, which is less frequently used. Local intolerances have been reported after the application of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin, such as the contact allergic reactions previously described.

- **Corticosteroids**: Ophthalmic steroids are therapeutically used for allergic or noninfectious conjunctivitis to inhibit inflammation following cataract surgery.

### Ebglyss [^113EwaSj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis and keratitis were common eye disorders reported in the study. Most cases were mild or moderate and resolved without needing treatment interruption or discontinuation.

During the initial 16-week treatment period of the monotherapy trials, conjunctivitis, including allergic conjunctivitis, was reported by 61 subjects (10%) in the EBGLYSS 250 mg every 2 weeks group and by 10 subjects (3%) in the placebo group. In the TCS concomitant therapy trial, conjunctivitis was reported by 7 subjects (5%) in the EBGLYSS 250 mg every 2 weeks + TCS group compared to 0% in the placebo + TCS group. During the 16-week placebo-controlled induction period, 68 subjects reported 73 events of conjunctivitis. All events were nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. Conjunctivitis led to treatment discontinuation in 3 subjects. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of conjunctivitis for subjects treated with EBGLYSS 250 mg every 2 weeks was 30.6 events per 100 patient-years through Week 16.

During the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy trials (ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2) from 16 to 52 weeks, conjunctivitis, including allergic conjunctivitis, was reported by 2 subjects (1.8%) in the EBGLYSS 250 mg every 2 weeks group and by 12 subjects (10.1%) in the EBGLYSS 250 mg every 4 weeks group, compared to 5 subjects (8.3%) in the placebo group. During this period, 14 subjects treated with EBGLYSS reported 18 events of conjunctivitis. All events were mild or moderate.

### Besivance [^117DKF96]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Besivance in infants below one year of age have not been established. The efficacy of Besivance in treating bacterial conjunctivitis in pediatric patients one year or older has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)].

There is no evidence that the ophthalmic administration of quinolones has any effect on weight-bearing joints, even though systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals.

No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.

### Kinetics of kill of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates with moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, compared with the aminoglycosides tobramycin and gentamicin [^114BMe6s]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

To compare the kinetics and speed of kill of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* upon exposure to three topical ophthalmic antibiotic solutions, bacterial conjunctivitis isolates of *S. pneumoniae* and *H. influenzae* were exposed to 1:1000 dilutions of moxifloxacin 0.5%, tobramycin 0.3%, gentamicin 0.3%, and water (control). Aliquots were collected at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after exposure. Cells were cultured, and viable cell counts were determined using standard microbiological methods.

Moxifloxacin achieved 99.9% kill (3-log reduction) at approximately 2 hours for *S. pneumoniae* and at 15 minutes for *H. influenzae*. Tobramycin and gentamicin did not achieve a 3-log reduction of *S. pneumoniae* during the 180-minute study period, and an increase in bacterial growth was noted for these isolates. Gentamicin took more than 120 minutes to achieve the 3-log reduction of *H. influenzae*, and tobramycin did not reach the 3-log reduction of this pathogen during the 180-minute study period.

In conclusion, moxifloxacin killed *S. pneumoniae* and *H. influenzae* in vitro faster than tobramycin and gentamicin, suggesting its potential clinical benefit as a first-line treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis to minimize patient symptoms and limit the contagiousness of the disease.

### Estimate of the direct and indirect annual cost of bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States [^111Vshi7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

The two-way sensitivity analysis examines both the annual incidence and costs associated with treating and managing bacterial conjunctivitis. Assuming a 20% variation in both the annual incidence and treatment costs occurs simultaneously, the estimated cost range is $377 million to $857 million.

Both the one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses show that variations in incidence and unit costs significantly affect the total costs related to treating bacterial conjunctivitis in the United States. This indicates that our economic model is highly sensitive to changes in both incidence and unit cost data.

### Impact of antibiotic resistance in the management of ocular infections: the role of current and future antibiotics [^117XbjAB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

This article reviews the effects of the increase in bacterial resistance on the treatment of ocular infections.

- **Design**: Interpretive assessment.
- **Methods**: Literature review and interpretation.
- **Results**: Ocular bacterial infections include conjunctivitis, keratitis, endophthalmitis, blepharitis, orbital cellulitis, and dacryocystitis. Treatment for most ocular bacterial infections is primarily empirical with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are effective against the most common bacteria associated with these ocular infections. However, the widespread use of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics has resulted in a global increase in resistance among both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to a number of the older antibiotics as well as some of the newer fluoroquinolones used to treat ophthalmic infections. Strategies for the prevention of the increase in ocular pathogen resistance should be developed and implemented. In addition, new antimicrobial agents with optimized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that have low toxicity, high efficacy, and reduced potential for the development of resistance are needed.
- **Conclusions**: New antimicrobial agents that treat ocular infections effectively and have a low potential for the development of resistance could be a part of strategies to prevent the global increase in ocular pathogen resistance.

### Integrated analysis of three bacterial conjunctivitis trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%: Etiology of bacterial conjunctivitis and antibacterial susceptibility profile [^115QTXyk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to report on the bacterial species isolated from patients with bacterial conjunctivitis participating in three clinical trials of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension, 0.6%, and their in vitro antibacterial susceptibility profiles.

- **Methods**: Microbial data from three clinical studies, conducted at multiple clinical sites in the US and Asia, were integrated. Species were identified at a central laboratory, and minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for various antibiotics, including β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides.

- **Results**: A total of 1,324 bacterial pathogens representing more than 70 species were isolated. The most common species were Haemophilus influenzae (26.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.4%). H. influenzae was most frequently isolated among patients aged 1–18 years, while S. aureus was most prevalent among those over 65 years. Drug resistance was prevalent: Of H. influenzae isolates, 25.3% were β-lactamase positive and 27.2% of S. pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-intermediate/resistant. Of S. aureus isolates, 13.7% were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and of these, 65.4% were ciprofloxacin-resistant, while 45.9% of S. epidermidis isolates were methicillin-resistant (MRSE), and of these, 47.1% were ciprofloxacin-resistant. Besifloxacin was more potent than comparator fluoroquinolones overall, and particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. Against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA and MRSE, besifloxacin was four-fold to ≥ 128-fold more potent.

### Treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical netilmicin [^112DDhjs]. Cornea (2002). Low credibility.

This study compares the clinical and microbiologic value of topical netilmicin with that of gentamicin in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

- **Methods**: A double-blind, randomized, prospective, controlled study was performed in 209 patients. One to two drop(s) of either antibiotic was applied to the affected eye(s) four times a day for up to 10 days. Patients were examined at the time of diagnosis and after 3, 5, and 10 days. Clinical efficacy was measured as the cumulative sum score (CSS) of the key signs and symptoms of acute bacterial ocular infection. Sensitivity/resistance was evaluated using the disk diffusion method.

- **Results**: Drug efficacy assessment was restricted only to patients with positive baseline culture results (n = 121). Of the isolated organisms, 96.9% were sensitive to netilmicin, whereas only 75.0% were sensitive to gentamicin (p = 0.00001). Netilmicin provided a broad-spectrum coverage comparable with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Netilmicin also was more effective than gentamicin in eradicating infections (p = 0.001 at day 5 and p = 0.037 at day 10) and in ameliorating the CSS (p = 0.037 at day 3, p = 0.001 at both day 5 and day 10). Only minor adverse events occurred in patients treated with either netilmicin or gentamicin.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that netilmicin is a safe and effective antibiotic that can be used as first-line therapy for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
