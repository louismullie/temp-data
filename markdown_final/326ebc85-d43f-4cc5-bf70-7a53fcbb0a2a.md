## Question

does verapamil affect heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether verapamil affects heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verapamil's pharmacology and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in heart failure. Next, I will examine clinical trial and observational data for signals of harm. After that, I should review FDA labeling for explicit warnings. Then, I will consider special scenarios like atrial fibrillation with reduced ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because mechanism often predicts clinical effect. Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with negative inotropic and negative chronotropic actions; it slows AV nodal conduction and reduces myocardial contractility, which can be problematic in systolic dysfunction where compensatory contractility is already limited, and it also lowers afterload, which in some patients may partially offset the negative inotropy but not reliably in moderate to severe dysfunction [^112D6A25] [^113TPwDL].

> Next, I should review guideline direction, and I need to ensure I'm citing the most current consensus. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline explicitly states that nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not well tolerated in heart failure, and they should be avoided in patients with LVEF less than 40 percent; the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP atrial fibrillation guideline likewise advises that nondihydropyridine CCBs should not be administered in AF patients with LVEF less than 40 percent due to potential to exacerbate HF, and ESC/ESH hypertension guidance lists severe LV dysfunction as a contraindication to verapamil and diltiazem, reinforcing the same message across societies [^113TPwDL] [^113VKrgp] [^114Hx7Xt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without checking outcome data. I will now examine trials and statements for signals of harm. The AHA scientific statement on drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure notes that nondihydropyridines can worsen HF, with diltiazem showing increased adverse cardiac events post-MI in those with baseline pulmonary congestion and verapamil showing no survival benefit post-MI in those who developed HF; the CONVINCE trial found a 30 percent higher rate of heart failure hospitalization with controlled-onset extended-release verapamil compared with atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide, and a 2023 observational analysis in older adults with HFpEF or AF suggested fewer HF hospitalizations with diltiazem/verapamil versus beta-blockers but higher all-cause mortality, which tempers any apparent benefit signal and underscores the need for caution in systolic dysfunction [^115LGPCj] [^112c1vWL] [^111cmhTc].

> I should confirm what regulators say, because labeling often captures recognized risks. Multiple FDA labels for verapamil list congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema as common adverse reactions, and they warn that in patients with moderately severe to severe cardiac dysfunction, acute worsening of heart failure may occur; IV verapamil is contraindicated in severe congestive heart failure unless the HF is secondary to a supraventricular tachycardia amenable to verapamil therapy, and coadministration with IV beta-blockers is contraindicated due to risk of severe myocardial depression and arrest, which is especially relevant in decompensated states [^112DW6fT] [^116yjyo9] [^111vGuHA] [^113wGAbk] [^111j9Kpx].

> Let me consider special scenarios, starting with atrial fibrillation in HFrEF, because clinicians often face this. In AF with rapid ventricular response and LVEF less than 40 percent, guidelines label verapamil and diltiazem as harmful for acute rate control; preferred agents are beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone, with electrical cardioversion if unstable, so I should avoid nondihydropyridine CCBs in this setting unless there is a compelling, guideline-supported exception and careful hemodynamic monitoring is feasible [^114Wfo3r] [^113VKrgp] [^1135qgne].

> But wait, what about hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where verapamil is sometimes used for symptom relief. I need to check the nuance here. Verapamil can improve symptoms in obstructive or nonobstructive HCM via negative inotropy and improved diastolic filling, yet it may be harmful in patients with severe resting obstruction, very high gradients, hypotension, or severe dyspnea at rest, and if HCM evolves into systolic dysfunction, guidelines advise discontinuing negative inotropes including verapamil, so ongoing reassessment of LVEF and symptoms is essential if verapamil is used in HCM [^114sQb7B] [^11468Xaa] [^111aD1fx].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions that amplify risk in heart failure. Combining verapamil with beta-blockers, especially intravenously, can precipitate severe bradycardia, high-grade AV block, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock; labels also caution about additive AV nodal effects with digoxin and additive depressant effects with certain antiarrhythmics, so I need to ensure concomitant cardiodepressants are minimized or avoided in patients with reduced ejection fraction [^113wGAbk] [^116FkwXo] [^111vGuHA].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should verify that it aligns with the strength of evidence. In patients with HFrEF or LVEF less than 40 percent, verapamil should generally be avoided; if a compelling indication exists such as rate control for AF or SVT, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring and only after optimizing guideline-directed medical therapy, and be prepared to stop if symptoms, edema, or biomarkers worsen; in HFpEF without systolic dysfunction, use is not absolutely contraindicated, but caution remains prudent given negative inotropy and observational mortality signals, so shared decision-making and vigilant follow-up are warranted [^113TPwDL] [^113VKrgp] [^111cmhTc].

> Finally, I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. Before and after initiating verapamil in any patient with a history of heart failure, I should check blood pressure, heart rate, ECG for conduction delays, signs of peripheral or pulmonary edema, and consider natriuretic peptides if baseline HF is present; if combined with beta-blockers or digoxin, I should monitor for bradycardia and AV block, and if IV verapamil is contemplated near beta-blocker use, I should avoid coadministration or allow sufficient washout to mitigate the risk of profound myocardial depression [^111fk3jP] [^113wGAbk] [^111vGuHA].

> In summary, yes — verapamil can adversely affect heart failure, particularly in HFrEF, due to negative inotropic effects that may precipitate decompensation; current guidelines advise avoidance in LVEF less than 40 percent, FDA labeling warns of HF exacerbation, and outcome data show increased HF hospitalizations with verapamil-based strategies, so if used at all, it should be in carefully selected patients with close monitoring and a low threshold to discontinue [^113VKrgp] [^111vGuHA] [^112c1vWL].

Verapamil **should be avoided in heart failure** [^1126ELQq] because its negative inotropic effects can worsen symptoms and precipitate decompensation, especially in HFrEF [^115LGPCj]. It is **contraindicated in severe or decompensated HF** [^114Wfo3r] and should not be used for rate control in AF with LVEF < 40% [^113VKrgp]. If absolutely necessary, use only in stable, compensated HF with close monitoring for worsening symptoms, edema, or hypotension [^111vGuHA].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms relevant to heart failure

Verapamil's **negative inotropy** reduces myocardial contractility [^112D6A25], which can impair cardiac output and worsen HF, particularly in HFrEF [^113VKrgp]. Its **vasodilation** lowers afterload, but in severe HF the negative inotropy may predominate, causing decompensation [^112D6A25].

---

## Clinical evidence of verapamil's effects on heart failure

- **CONVINCE trial**: COER verapamil increased heart failure hospitalizations by 30% vs atenolol or HCTZ (3.1% vs 2.4%, HR 1.33) [^112c1vWL].
- **Post-MI studies**: Verapamil did not improve survival or major cardiac events after MI, including in HFrEF [^113TPwDL].
- **Observational data**: Non-DHP CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) are linked to higher HF hospitalization risk in HFrEF.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding verapamil in heart failure** |
|-|-|
| AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 | - Non-DHP CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF [^113TPwDL] <br/> - Avoid in HFrEF [^111CCwEU] |
| ESC 2024 | - Verapamil is effective for AF rate control but should be avoided in moderate-to-severe LV dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r] |
| FDA labeling | - Contraindicated in severe or decompensated HF [^notfound] <br/> - Use cautiously in mild HF; monitor closely [^111vGuHA] |

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

- **HFrEF**: Avoid verapamil due to negative inotropy and risk of decompensation [^111CCwEU] [^113f1FFk].
- **HFpEF**: Use cautiously; limited data, but negative inotropy may still worsen symptoms.
- **AF with rapid ventricular response**: Avoid in LVEF < 40%; use beta-blockers or digoxin instead [^113VKrgp] [^114Wfo3r].
- **Hypertension in HF**: Prefer dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. amlodipine); avoid verapamil [^1162NPsL].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Worsening heart failure**: Increased dyspnea, edema, and decompensation [^112c1vWL].
- **Bradycardia and AV block**: Additive effects with beta-blockers or digoxin [^116FkwXo].
- **Hypotension**: Especially with other vasodilators or in volume-depleted patients [^114Fp3cN].
- **Pulmonary edema**: Particularly in HCM or severe LV dysfunction [^117WDsVr].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Document HF severity, LVEF, and comorbidities before use [^112GdhMQ].
- **Close monitoring**: Watch for worsening symptoms, edema, hypotension, and bradycardia [^111fk3jP].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid with beta-blockers, digoxin, and other negative inotropes when possible [^116FkwXo].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop immediately if decompensation occurs [^notfound].

---

## Alternative medications and therapeutic strategies

- **Beta-blockers**: First-line in HFrEF for mortality benefit and symptom control [^112o3WiX].
- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Core therapy in HFrEF to reduce remodeling and progression [^1113JZUw].
- **Dihydropyridine CCBs**: Consider amlodipine for hypertension in HF when needed [^1162NPsL].
- **Digoxin**: Useful for AF rate control in HF, especially with LV dysfunction [^113VKrgp].

---

Verapamil is **generally contraindicated in heart failure** because of negative inotropy that can worsen symptoms and precipitate decompensation, especially in HFrEF [^113TPwDL]. Use only when absolutely necessary, with close monitoring, and prefer alternatives such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, or dihydropyridine CCBs.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115LGPCj]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blockers in heart failure (HF) — dihydropyridines such as nifedipine have negative inotropic and vasodilating effects by blocking transmembrane calcium influx, and small trials reported marked worsening of HF with nifedipine in which 5 of 21 patients required hospitalization versus 0 of 20 with isosorbide dinitrate. In HF, amlodipine showed no evidence of a favorable or unfavorable effect on mortality (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83–1.13; P = 0.66), with higher frequencies of peripheral and pulmonary edema reported, and it may exacerbate HF. Non‑dihydropyridines diltiazem and verapamil can worsen HF; after myocardial infarction (MI), diltiazem increased adverse cardiac events in the subgroup with baseline pulmonary congestion (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01–1.96) among 2466 total patients with 490 in the subgroup, and risk was directly related to baseline HF severity.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — calcium channel blockers in HF — states that "dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be used for treatment of hypertension in patients who have elevated blood pressure despite optimization of GDMT". It contrasts that "Nonhydropyridine calcium channel blockers — diltiazem and verapamil — are myocardial depressants and generally not well tolerated in HF", and notes that "Verapamil had no impact on survival or major cardiac events post-MI, including in those patients with HFrEF after acute MI".

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^114SF5bp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Beta‐blockers: Metoprolol Extended Release, carvedilol and bisoprolol have shown benefits in HFrEF. Similar to above, their role in HFpEF is limited to treating underlying conditions (eg, atrial arrhythmias). 30

Digoxin: The use of digoxin for chronic heart failure has declined as benefits appear to be limited to symptomatic relief without mortality benefit. Furthermore, appropriate management is difficult due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5 to 0.9 ng/mL) and older adults in particular are at risk for digoxin toxicity secondary to declining renal drug clearance. In this case it is imperative that renal function be monitored frequently to minimize drug accumulation. Prior to initiating digoxin in older adults, optimization of first‐line guideline‐directed medical therapy should be performed. Discontinuation of digoxin should be considered but requires monitoring for signs of worsening symptoms as stopping therapy may be associated with poorer outcomes among patients with heart failure. 41

On‐going goals of care discussions are paramount as patients' heart failure progresses towards advanced stages. Quality of life can be greatly improved by simplification of the medical regimen. Review and assess the tolerability of recommended therapies and eliminate adjuvant agents that can exacerbate heart failure symptoms (sotalol, dronedarone, propafenone, verapamil, diltiazem, cilostazol, metformin, thiazolidinediones, NSAIDs, etc). 42

### Atrial fibrillation in heart failure: what should we do? [^116Kz6Bc]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^11488C8o]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in heart failure (HF) — rate control and rhythm strategy guidance emphasizes rate targets, agent selection, and anticoagulation. Digoxin 'slows atrioventricular conduction more effectively at rest than during exercise', while 'Beta-blockers are more effective than digoxin during exercise… and are preferred because of their favorable effects on the natural history of HF'; verapamil and diltiazem 'should be avoided', and if beta-blockers are 'ineffective or contraindicated… amiodarone may be a useful alternative'. If tachycardia persists, 'Atrioventricular nodal ablation may be needed'. For rate targets, 'every effort should be made to reduce the ventricular response to less than 80 to 90 beats per min at rest and less than 110 to 130 beats per min during moderate exercise'. For stroke prevention in this setting, 'Anticoagulation should be maintained in all patients with HF and a history of atrial fibrillation, regardless of whether sinus rhythm is achieved'. Evidence on rhythm control notes 'a total of 5032 patients in 4 separate trials' with 'no improvement in mortality or morbidity using a strategy of aggressive rhythm control'.

### Heart rate: a prognostic factor and therapeutic target in chronic heart failure. the distinct roles of drugs with heart rate-lowering properties [^114Fu76X]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Heart rate not only predicts outcome but may also be a therapeutic target in patients with chronic heart failure. Several classes of pharmacological agents can be used to modulate heart rate, including beta-blockers, ivabradine, digoxin, amiodarone, and verapamil. Choice of agent will depend on heart rhythm, co-morbidities, and disease phenotype. Beneficial and harmful interactions may also exist. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current body of knowledge regarding the relevance of heart rate as a prognostic factor (risk marker) and particularly as a therapeutic target (risk factor) in patients with chronic heart failure, with a special focus on ivabradine, a novel agent that is currently the only available purely bradycardic agent.

### Calcium channel blockers: an update [^113tMEg3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current literature pertaining to calcium channel blockers, including their classification, properties, and therapeutic indications, in light of several recent trials that have addressed their safety. Calcium channel blockers are a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group of medications that are used widely to control blood pressure and manage symptoms of angina. They are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. As a class, they are well tolerated and are associated with few side effects. The question of whether they may precipitate cardiovascular events has been largely settled by recent trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the International Verapamil Slow-Release/Trandolapril Study (INVEST), and the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) study, in which no such association was found. Even so, the use of these agents has been linked with an increased risk of heart failure. Thus, long-acting calcium channel blockers may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina. However, as a class, they are not as protective as other antihypertensive agents against heart failure.

### Verapamil hci [^111vGuHA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure: When heart failure is not severe or rate related, it should be controlled with digitalis glycosides and diuretics, as appropriate, before Verapamil is used.

In patients with moderately severe to severe cardiac dysfunction (pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mm Hg, ejection fraction less than 30%), acute worsening of heart failure may be seen.

Concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy:

Digitalis: Intravenous Verapamil has been used concomitantly with digitalis preparations without the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, since both drugs slow AV conduction, patients should be monitored for AV block or excessive bradycardia.

Procainamide: Intravenous Verapamil has been administered to a small number of patients receiving oral procainamide without the occurrence of serious adverse effects.

Quinidine: Intravenous Verapamil has been administered to a small number of patients receiving oral quinidine without the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However a few cases of hypotension have been reported in patients taking oral quinidine who received intravenous Verapamil. Caution should therefore be used when employing this combination of drugs.

Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs: Intravenous Verapamil has been administered to patients receiving oral beta blockers without the development of serious adverse effects. However, since both drugs may depress myocardial contractility or AV conduction, the possibility of detrimental interactions should be considered. The concomitant administration of intravenous beta blockers and intravenous Verapamil has resulted in serious adverse reactions (see Contraindications), especially in patients with severe cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or recent myocardial infarction.

Acute decompensated heart failure (HF) hospitalization precipitants — common factors listed include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), uncontrolled hypertension, AF (atrial fibrillation) and other arrhythmias, additional cardiac disease (eg, endocarditis), acute infections (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract), and nonadherence with medication regimen or dietary intake. Additional contributors include anemia, hyper- or hypothyroidism, medications that increase sodium retention (eg, NSAID), and medications with negative inotropic effect (eg, verapamil).

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^116N8Qpv]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are effective for rate control with specific use considerations. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used for treatment of AF and are the only agents associated with improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance; intravenous bolus is effective but usually requires continuous intravenous infusion, these agents should be used cautiously or avoided in HF due to systolic dysfunction, eight randomized studies found heart rate decreases with diltiazem, verapamil decreased heart rate both at rest by 8 to 23 beats per minute and during exercise by 20 to 34 beats per minute, and they may be preferred long term over beta blockers in patients with bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115KtUYC]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115f2DtN]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definitions of evaluation criteria for drug-related heart failure (HF) categorize magnitude as follows: major effects are life-threatening or lead to hospitalization or emergency room visit; moderate effects can lead to an additional clinic visit, change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, change in cardiac function, or worsening cardiovascular disease and can warrant a permanent change in the long-term medication regimen; minor effects lead to increased assessment/surveillance or symptoms that warrant a transient medication change. Levels of evidence are defined as Level A (multiple populations evaluated; data from multiple randomized, controlled trials or meta-analyses), Level B (limited populations evaluated; data from a single randomized, controlled trial or nonrandomized studies), and Level C (very limited populations evaluated; case reports, case studies, expert opinion, and consensus opinion). Onset of effect is defined as immediate when demonstrated within 1 wk of drug administration, intermediate when demonstrated within weeks to months, and delayed when demonstrated within ≥ 1 y of drug administration.

Heart failure is a common, costly, and debilitating syndrome that is associated with a highly complex drug regimen, a large number of comorbidities, and a large and often disparate number of healthcare providers. All of these factors conspire to increase the risk of heart failure exacerbation by direct myocardial toxicity, drug-drug interactions, or both.

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112o3WiX]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of refractory hypertension in HFrEF — Most patients with advanced stage C or D HF do not manifest hypertension, and if a patient with HFrEF has refractory hypertension there are no definitive studies to guide additional antihypertensive approaches when recommended HF therapies are inadequate. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are not recommended as routine treatment for patients with HFrEF, whereas amlodipine and felodipine neither improve nor worsen survival and a dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers could be used to control hypertension only after other medications have failed. There are few data on specific combinations of ≥ 3 drugs, so recommendations are largely empirical or anecdotal; a triple-drug regimen of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a calcium channel blocker, and a thiazide diuretic is effective and can be well tolerated. Among β-blockers, carvedilol, 1 of the 3 β-blockers proven to reduce mortality in HF, is more effective in reducing BP than metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol and may be the β-blocker of choice in patients with HFrEF with refractory hypertension, whereas evidence with nebivolol and labetalol is very limited and they are not the β-blocker of choice for the treatment of HFrEF according to HF guidelines; experience with prazosin or clonidine is very limited and studies suggest potential adverse outcomes with these classes of agents.

Calcium channel blockers — ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and ventricular tachycardia (VT): For the treatment of most VA, nondihydropyridines calcium channel blockers have no role, and intravenous verapamil for sustained VT has been associated with hemodynamic collapse, especially in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI); calcium channel blockers should not be given to patients with VT in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114sQb7B]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have also alleviated symptoms in a subset of patients. The 2020 AHA/ACC HCM guidelines recommend CCB and BB for first‐line use in patients with obstructive and non‐obstructive HCM. The beneficial effects of CCBs are likely mediated through their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, leading to prolonged LV filling time and improved flow towards the LV's subendocardial layers, resulting in reduced myocardial oxygen demand. Verapamil should be used cautiously in patients with severe obstruction, given vasodilatory properties that may contribute to the worsening of the intracavitary gradient. Diltiazem is less studied but has been shown to improve measures of diastolic performance and myocardial ischemia. In patients unable to tolerate BB; CCB can be considered but should be used cautiously in those with severe LVOTO, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and low systemic blood pressure, as their hypotensive effects can trigger worsening obstruction and precipitate pulmonary edema.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension — treatment thresholds, targets, and agents are described as follows: in patients with HFrEF, antihypertensive drug treatment should start (if not already initiated) when BP is > 140/90 mmHg, and because outcomes for patients with heart failure have repeatedly been shown to be poor if BP values are low, it may be wise to avoid actively lowering BP to < 120/70 mmHg; heart failure guideline-directed medications are recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with HFrEF, with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) all effective in improving clinical outcome; if further BP lowering is required, a dihydropyridine CCB may be considered; sacubitril/valsartan lowers BP, has also been shown to improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF, and is indicated as an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs; non-dihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and verapamil), alpha-blockers, and centrally acting agents, such as moxonidine, should not be used.

### Trandolapril and verapamil hydrochloride (tarka) [^112QdwcQ]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Heart Failure

Verapamil Component

Verapamil has a negative inotropic effect which, in most patients, is compensated by its afterload reduction (decreased systemic vascular resistance) properties without a net impairment of ventricular performance. In clinical experience with 4,954 patients, 87 (1.8%) developed congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema. Verapamil should be avoided in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction less than 30%, pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mmHg, or severe symptoms of cardiac failure) and in patients with any degree of ventricular dysfunction if they are receiving a beta adrenergic blocker (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Patients with milder ventricular dysfunction should, if possible, be controlled with optimum doses of digitalis and/or diuretics before verapamil treatment (Note interactions with digoxin under: PRECAUTIONS).

Trandolapril Component

Trandolapril, as an ACE inhibitor, may cause excessive hypotension in patients with congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS - Hypotension).

Hypotension

Verapamil Component

Occasionally, the pharmacologic action of verapamil may produce a decrease in blood pressure below normal levels which may result in dizziness or symptomatic hypotension.

Trandolapril Component

Trandolapril can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, trandolapril has only rarely been associated with symptomatic hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who are salt- or volume-depleted as a result of prolonged treatment with diuretics, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating treatment with trandolapril (see PRECAUTIONS -Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

In controlled studies, hypotension was observed in 0.6% of patients receiving any combination of trandolapril and verapamil HCl ER.

In patients with concomitant congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If symptomatic hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, normal saline may be administered intravenously. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses; however, lower doses of verapamil HCl ER and/or trandolapril or reduced concomitant diuretic therapy should be considered.

### Pharmacotherapeutic approaches for decompensated heart failure: a role for the calcium sensitiser, levosimendan? [^115ZHz81]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Although no universal definition exists, decompensated heart failure may be regarded as either a worsening of chronic heart failure or new-onset heart failure precipitated by an acute incident. Haemodynamic management of patients hospitalised with decompensated heart failure may include the administration of diuretics, vasodilators and positive inotropic agents. Until recently, these latter agents constituted the only drug class to produce a direct increase in stroke volume via enhanced myocardial contractility. However, despite their short-term benefits, the clinical utility of inotropic agents is compromised by their potentially deleterious effects on calcium handling and oxygen consumption, resulting in an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and death. In contrast, calcium sensitisers enhance cardiac performance without affecting calcium movement and, therefore, are potentially associated with a reduced risk of rhythmic disturbances. These agents constitute a heterogeneous group of compounds with different affinities for calcium sensitisation. Levosimendan is a potent calcium sensitiser with vasodilating properties that has been shown to provide symptomatic and haemodynamic improvement with no increase in oxygen consumption. Calcium sensitisation is therefore emerging as a promising treatment approach in this challenging therapeutic area.

Calcium channel blockers for ventricular tachycardia — For the treatment of most VA, nondihydropyridines calcium channel blockers have no role; in fact, intravenous verapamil for sustained VT has been associated with hemodynamic collapse, especially in patients with prior MI, whereas oral and intravenous verapamil are effective in treating idiopathic interfascicular reentrant LVT; calcium channel blockers should not be given to patients with VT in the setting of HFrEF.

In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

### Heart failure drug treatment [^1113JZUw]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is the most common cardiovascular reason for hospital admission for people older than 60 years of age. Few areas in medicine have progressed as remarkably as heart failure treatment over the past three decades. However, progress has been consistent only for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In acutely decompensated heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, none of the treatments tested to date have been definitively proven to improve survival. Delaying or preventing heart failure has become increasingly important in patients who are prone to heart failure. The prevention of worsening chronic heart failure and hospitalisations for acute decompensation is also of great importance. The objective of this Series paper is to provide a concise and practical summary of the available drug treatments for heart failure. We support the implementation of the international guidelines. We offer views on the basis of our personal experience in research areas that have insufficient evidence. The best possible evidence-based drug treatment (including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and β blockers) is useful only when optimally implemented. However, implementation might be challenging. We believe that disease management programmes can be helpful in providing a multidisciplinary, holistic approach to the delivery of optimal medical care.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^111W1t6o]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure arrhythmia management — supraventricular rhythm control — notes that given its relatively rapid onset of action and superior safety profile in HF, intravenous amiodarone for life-threatening arrhythmias during acute HF has gained widespread acceptance, and in acutely ill HF, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter may impose hemodynamic decompensation requiring aggressive therapy; poorly tolerated SVT may be better treated acutely by synchronous cardioversion at relatively low energies (e.g., 50 to 100 J biphasic), verapamil may be effective for recurrent AV node–dependent SVTs but care should be taken due to negative inotropic effects, and intravenous amiodarone may be more effective at rate control of AF or atrial flutter and may restore sinus rhythm; in HF, amiodarone alone or with electrical cardioversion is effective at slowing the heart rate and achieving cardioversion, and for unstable arrhythmia cardioversion is appropriate with amiodarone preferred for longer-term administration and generally well tolerated hemodynamically.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to medications to avoid, ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that verapamil is potentially harmful in patients with obstructive HCM and severe dyspnea at rest, hypotension, very high resting gradients (such as > 100 mmHg), as well as in pediatric patients < 6 weeks of age.

---

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^112D6A25]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Mechanism of Action: Verapamil inhibits the calcium ion (and possibly sodium ion) influx through slow channels into conductile and contractile myocardial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. The antiarrhythmic effect of verapamil appears to be due to its effect on the slow channel in cells of the cardiac conduction system. The vasodilatory effect of verapamil appears to be due to its effect on blockade of calcium channels as well as α receptors.

In the isolated rabbit heart, concentrations of verapamil that markedly affect SA nodal fibers or fibers in the upper and middle regions of the AV node, have very little effect on fibers in the lower AV node (NH region) and no effect on atrial action potentials or His bundle fibers.

Electrical activity in the SA and AV nodes depends, to a large degree, upon calcium influx through the slow channel. By inhibiting this influx, verapamil slows AV conduction and prolongs the effective refractory period within the AV node in a rate-related manner. This effect results in a reduction of the ventricular rate in patients with atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation and a rapid ventricular response.

By interrupting reentry at the AV node, verapamil can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT), including PSVT associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Verapamil does not induce peripheral arterial spasm.

Verapamil has a local anesthetic action that is 1.6 times that of procaine on an equimolar basis. It is not known whether this action is important at the doses used in man.

Verapamil does not alter total serum calcium levels.

Hemodynamics: Verapamil reduces afterload and myocardial contractility. The commonly used intravenous doses of 5 to 10 mg verapamil hydrochloride produce transient, usually asymptomatic, reduction in normal systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and contractility; left ventricular filling pressure is slightly increased. In most patients, including those with organic cardiac disease, the negative inotropic action of verapamil is countered by reduction of afterload, and cardiac index is usually not reduced. However, in patients with moderately severe to severe cardiac dysfunction (pulmonary wedge pressure above 20 mm Hg, ejection fraction less than 30%), acute worsening of heart failure may be seen. Peak therapeutic effects occur within 3 to 5 minutes after a bolus injection.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan PM) [^114JArrw]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Serious adverse reactions are uncommon when verapamil therapy is initiated with upward dose titration within the recommended single and total daily dose. See Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) for discussion of heart failure, hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, AV block, and rapid ventricular response. Reversible (upon discontinuation of verapamil) non-obstructive, paralytic ileus has been infrequently reported in association with the use of verapamil.

The following reactions (Table 1) to orally administered Verelan PM occurred at rates of 2.0% or greater or occurred at lower rates but appeared to be drug-related in clinical trials in hypertension.

In previous experience with other formulations of verapamil (N = 4,954) the following reactions (Table 2) have occurred at rates greater than 1.0% or occurred at lower rates but appeared clearly drug related in clinical trials in 4,954 patients.

In clinical trials related to the control of ventricular response in patients taking digoxin who had atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, ventricular rate below 50/min at rest occurred in 15% of patients and asymptomatic hypotension occurred in 5% of patients.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (verapamil HCl) [^113wGAbk]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Intravenous Verapamil HCI is contraindicated in:

Severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.
Second- or third-degree AV block (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker).
Sick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker).
Severe congestive heart failure (unless secondary to a supraventricular tachycardia amenable to verapamil therapy.)
Patients receiving intravenous beta adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., propranolol). Intravenous verapamil and intravenous beta adrenergic blocking drugs should not be administered in close proximity to each other (within a few hours), since both may have a depressant effect on myocardial contractility and AV conduction.
Patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory bypass tract (i.e. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndromes) are at risk to develop ventricular tachyarrhythmia including ventricular fibrillation if verapamil is administered. Therefore, the use of verapamil in these patients is contraindicated.
Ventricular Tachycardia. Administration of intravenous verapamil to patients with wide-complex ventricular-tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 sec) can result in marked hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. Proper pretherapy diagnosis and differentiation from wide-complex supraventricular tachycardia is imperative in the emergency room setting.
Known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochloride.

Introduction

Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Acute atrial fibrillation resolves spontaneously within 24–48 hours in over 50% of people, however many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions: to prevent embolism; for conversion to sinus rhythm; and to control heart rate in people with recent onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 28 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to management of HFrEF, ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to consider discontinuing previously indicated negative inotropic agents (specifically, verapamil, diltiazem, or disopyramide) in patients with HCM developing systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%).

Second-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers slightly increase cardiac index, left ventricular ejection fraction, and exercise treadmill tests in patients with chronic heart failure, and do not increase norepinephrine levels; these drugs seem to be safe and beneficial in this category of patients. A 6% reduction in mortality was found, which, although not significantly different from 0%, does indicate that these drugs do not increase mortality in this category of patients.

American Heart Association scientific statement — hypertension therapy in heart failure: Antihypertensive treatment thresholds are recommended in individuals with ≥ 140 mmHg SBP or 90 mm Hg diastolic BP (Class I; Level of Evidence C). Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics can be used for blood pressure (BP) control and to reverse mild volume overload in symptomatic heart failure (HF) with volume overload, with this use rated (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). The addition of hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate to background therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a β-blocker may be beneficial in nonblack patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hypertension (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Drugs to avoid in HF with hypertension include nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil and diltiazem) and moxonidine (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C), and α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin should be avoided and might be used only if other drugs for the management of hypertension and HF are inadequate to achieve BP control at maximum tolerated doses (Class III: Harm; Level of Evidence C).

### Allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction in chronic heart failure [^113m889t]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Increased oxidative stress in chronic heart failure is thought to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Xanthine oxidase produces oxidative stress and therefore we examined whether allopurinol improved endothelial dysfunction in chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study on 11 patients with New York Heart Association class II-III chronic heart failure, comparing 300 mg allopurinol daily (1 month) versus placebo. Endothelial function was assessed by standard forearm venous occlusion plethysmography with acetylcholine, nitroprusside, and verapamil. Plasma malondialdehyde levels were also compared to assess significant changes in oxidative stress. Allopurinol significantly increased the forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine (percentage change in forearm blood flow [mean ± SEM]: 181 ± 19% versus 120 ± 22% allopurinol versus placebo; P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in the forearm blood flow changes between the placebo and allopurinol treatment arms with regard to sodium nitroprusside or verapamil. Plasma malondialdehyde was significantly reduced with allopurinol treatment (346 ± 128 nmol/L versus 461 ± 101 nmol/L, allopurinol versus placebo; P = 0.03), consistent with reduced oxidative stress with allopurinol therapy.

Conclusions

We have shown that allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction in chronic heart failure. This raises the distinct possibility that allopurinol might reduce cardiovascular events and even improve exercise capacity in chronic heart failure.

### Verapamil hydrochloride (Verelan PM) [^115Zffay]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Verelan®PM (verapamil hydrochloride extended-release capsules) for oral use is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Verelan PM is a calcium channel blocker indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. (1)

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^117NdQZ7]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity of less than 48 hours' duration. Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The condition resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours in over 50% of people; however, many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent embolism, for conversion to sinus rhythm, and to control heart rate in people with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### Cardiovascular diseases that have emerged from the darkness [^111NJerf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditional pharmacologic options with negative inotropic agents, such as β‐blockers, verapamil, and disopyramide, can control symptoms for variable periods of time in many patients, but rarely alter the long‐term clinical course of HCM. Relevant in this regard is the potential introduction of mavacamten into the HCM treatment armamentarium, a novel small‐molecule selective allosteric inhibitor of cardiac myosin ATPase that mitigates actin‐myosin cross‐bridging, acting clinically as a strong negative inotropic agent to reduce LV contractility, outflow obstruction, and symptoms. Although not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration at the time of this writing, mavacamten and other drugs in this class would potentially have the palliative capability of controlling symptoms and delaying myectomy in some patients, but also with a risk of excessive systolic dysfunction and heart failure.

The current HCM‐related mortality rate has been reduced to only 0.5% per year (10‐year survival after diagnosis 95%), a consequence of contemporary management strategies using implantable defibrillators, septal reduction, and anticoagulant drugs, but also reflecting the diversity of the HCM clinical spectrum, which includes many patients with low lifetime risk; 95% of patients with HCM are in New York Heart Association classes I/II at long‐term follow‐up, including some who experience benign clinical course with extended longevity often without requiring major treatment interventions,(Figure 1, 2, 3). HCM has become an uncommon primary cause of premature death largely due to progressive refractory heart failure in the absence of outflow obstruction. Consequently, the HCM‐related mortality rate is lower than other cardiac (or noncardiac) disease‐related causes that constitute the overall risks of living (eg, cancer or congestive heart failure).

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112naQd1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Conventional Medical Strategies

Traditionally, symptomatic obstructive HCM has been treated by a stepwise approach (Figure), initially with maximal pharmacologic therapy aimed at controlling symptoms of functional limitation (predominantly exertional dyspnea). In patients with refractory symptoms (NYHA‐class III/IV), or those experiencing unacceptable drug‐related side effects, the subsequent recommendation is for surgical myectomy (or selectively, alcohol septal ablation as an operative alternative) (Figure – Panel A). In this respect, drug therapy has always played an important hole in HCM management.

Beta‐Blockers/Verapamil

These drugs have been widely implemented over several decades to control symptoms of exertional dyspnea for varying periods of time, although unsupported by randomized trial data. However, there is little evidence that these drugs consistently alter clinical course or prognosis. Beta‐blockers and verapamil convey only modest negative inotropic properties and do not consistently reduce outflow gradients under resting conditions, although beta‐blockers have capability for blunting latent gradients provoked by physiologic exercise.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to develop guidelines for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death) [^112h48Ry]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — management of symptoms and atrial fibrillation (AF): The mainstay of pharmacological management for the symptomatic patient has been beta blockers or verapamil, and disopyramide has been similarly used presumably for its negative inotropic effect. AF can be especially problematic with sudden clinical deteriorations from high ventricular rates and loss of atrial filling, is associated with increased risk of embolism, heart failure, and death, and the high rate of embolism warrants anticoagulation with warfarin even though this has not been validated by a large randomized trial. Amiodarone is widely used and considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, although large controlled comparative trials are not available.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^115Varue]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with concurrent use of verapamil and beta blockers.

Coadministration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high-degree heart block, and heart failure.

ACE Inhibitors

When combined with beta blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta blockers. Propranolol hydrochloride tablets should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

Alpha Blockers

Prazosin has been associated with prolongation of first dose hypotension in the presence of beta blockers. Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

Reserpine

Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine, should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

Inotropic Agents

Patients on long-term therapy with propranolol may experience uncontrolled hypertension if administered epinephrine as a consequence of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. Epinephrine is therefore not indicated in the treatment of propranolol overdose (see OVERDOSAGE).

### Association of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers versus β-adrenergic receptor blockers with risk of heart failure hospitalization [^111cmhTc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are interrelated and often coexisting conditions in older adults. Although equally recommended, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs), such as diltiazem and verapamil, are less often used than β blockers. Because recent studies suggested that β-blocker use in both HFpEF and AF may increase the risk for HF, we tested whether non-DHP CCBs were associated with lower HF hospitalization risk than β blockers. We examined fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who were aged ≥ 66 years, had HFpEF or AF, and newly initiated a β blocker (n = 83,458) or non-DHP CCB (n = 18,924) from 2014 to 2018. The outcomes of HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression in the full cohort and, separately, in the subset without a recent hospital or skilled nursing discharge. Follow-up was analyzed using 2 frameworks: intention-to-treat and censored-at-drug-switch-or-discontinuation. There was a modestly protective association of non-DHP CCBs for the risk of HF hospitalization. Before drug switch or discontinuation, the use of diltiazem or verapamil was associated with decreased risk of HF hospitalization in the full cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 1.00, p = 0.05) and in the subgroup (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, p = 0.003). However, the association with all-cause mortality tended to favor β blockers, including in the intention-to-treat analysis (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.25, p < 0.001). In conclusion, compared with β blockers, the initiation of diltiazem or verapamil in patients with HFpEF or AF may be associated with fewer HF hospitalization events but also with more all-cause deaths.

ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline — Acute treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) of unknown mechanism: Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT when pharmacological therapy is ineffective or contraindicated (Class I, B-NR). Intravenous diltiazem or verapamil can be effective for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT and have been shown to terminate SVT in 64% to 98% of patients; a slow infusion of either drug up to 20 minutes may lessen the potential for hypotension, and these drugs should be used only in hemodynamically stable patients, not in tachycardia due to VT or pre-excited AF and not in suspected acute heart failure. Intravenous beta blockers are reasonable for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically stable SVT (Class IIa, C-LD).

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

### Comparative influences of beta blockers and verapamil on cardiac outcomes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115UqBLN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines recommend β blockers (BBs) as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, particularly, verapamil, as the second-line therapy, despite the absence of comparison trials between those 2 drugs. Because deleterious effects of verapamil have been reported in this setting, the present analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of BBs and verapamil in a cohort of patients with HCM. From a nationwide cohort of 1,434 patients with a diagnosis of HCM included in the French prospective observational REgistry of hypertrophic cardioMYopathy (REMY), we retrospectively analyzed patients with sarcomeric HCM included in the 3 largest centers and treated either with BBs or verapamil. Patients with a cardiac defibrillator or a pacemaker or who underwent a procedure of atrial fibrillation or septal ablation were excluded. The primary end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for atrial fibrillation. Of 600 patients with HCM, 544 (91%) were treated with BBs and 56 (9%) with verapamil. At inclusion, the 2 groups were comparable concerning the presence/amplitude of obstruction and sudden cardiac death risk factors. At up to 8 years of follow-up (median 3.9 years, interquartile range 2.1 to 5.8), no significant differences were observed in the primary end point (132 [24%] vs 10 [18%] under BBs or verapamil, respectively, hazard ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 3.63). In conclusion, in a real-world cohort of low-risk patients with HCM, verapamil therapy was not associated with a higher incidence of adverse events than β-blocker therapy.

### Atrial fibrillation (acute onset) [^114ZCcRn]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute atrial fibrillation is rapid, irregular, and chaotic atrial activity of recent onset. Various definitions of acute atrial fibrillation have been used in the literature, but for the purposes of this review we have included studies where atrial fibrillation may have occurred up to 7 days previously. Risk factors for acute atrial fibrillation include increasing age, cardiovascular disease, alcohol, diabetes, and lung disease. Acute atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. The condition resolves spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours in more than 50% of people; however, many people will require interventions to control heart rate or restore sinus rhythm.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent embolism, for conversion to sinus rhythm, and to control heart rate in people with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (within 7 days) who are haemodynamically stable? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 26 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amiodarone, antithrombotic treatment before cardioversion, atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, diltiazem, direct current cardioversion, flecainide, metoprolol, nebivolol, propafenone, sotalol, timolol, and verapamil.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114tMtbk]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — vasoreactivity-guided calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy: We suggest that patients with PAH who, in the absence of right-sided heart failure or contraindications to CCB therapy, demonstrate acute vasoreactivity according to consensus definition, should be considered candidates for a trial of therapy with an oral CCB (Ungraded consensus-based statement). We suggest that CCBs should not be used empirically to treat PAH in the absence of demonstrated acute vasoreactivity (Ungraded consensus-based statement). Careful follow-up is advised with long-acting nifedipine or diltiazem, or amlodipine; due to its potential negative inotropic effects, verapamil should be avoided, and the daily doses that have shown efficacy in idiopathic PAH are 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem and up to 20 mg for amlodipine, with an initial reassessment after 3 months of therapy and initiation of additional or alternative PAH therapy if there is not improvement to functional class I or II. Even though a small percentage (< 5%) of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases may be vasoreactive, there are no studies to suggest that CCB have been effective; patients at increased risk during acute vasoreactivity testing include those with FC IV symptoms, a low systemic BP, low CO, or PVOD, and vasoreactivity testing should be performed by individuals with appropriate training in test performance and interpretation.

### Treatment of experimental verapamil poisoning with levosimendan utilizing a rodent model of drug toxicity [^116Zf59B]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Levosimendan is an inotropic agent used in the treatment of heart failure. It is a myocardial calcium sensitizer, binding to cardiac troponin-C, and a vascular K+ATP-channel agonist producing peripheral vasodilatation.

Aims

To assess the effect of levosimendan on cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) in a rodent model of severe verapamil poisoning.

Methods

Male Wistar rats were anesthetized, ventilated, and canulated with jugular and femoral venous catheters and a femoral arterial catheter. CO, systolic BP, MAP, and HR were recorded. Verapamil was infused at 6 mg/kg/h until MAP dropped to 50% of baseline (time-0) and then reduced to 4 mg/kg/h. There were five treatment groups (n = 7 per group): 1) normal saline infusion (control); 2) CaCl2 loading dose and infusion (CaCl2); 3) levosimendan 24 microgram/kg loading dose and 0.6 microgram/kg/min infusion (Levo-24); 4) levosimendan 6 microgram/kg loading dose and 0.4 microgram/kg/min infusion (Levo-6); and 5) levosimendan 0.4 microgram/kg/min infusion with concurrent CaCl2 loading dose and infusion (Levo + CaCl2). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded for 70 minutes. Primary outcome measures were changes observed in CO, BP, and HR with treatments compared to control. Secondary outcome measure was survival. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post-test comparison with the control group.

Results

All groups had similar BP, HR, and CO at base line and peak toxicity. The control group's HR, BP, and CO progressively fell during the verapamil infusion. Levo-24, Levo + CaCl2, and CaCl2 maintained CO compared with control from t = 20 min and Levo6 from t = 30 min (p < 0.05). CaCl2 (from t = 10 min) and Levo + CaCl2 (from t = 20 min) produced significant improvements in BP compared to control. However, BP did not return to pre-toxicity levels. Levo-6 and Levo-24 groups did not recover from the hypotension seen at pre-treatment maximal toxicity. HR was maintained in all treatment groups compared to control animals. Twenty-nine percent (2/7) of control, 86% (6/7) levosimendan, 100% (7/7) CaCl2, and Levo + CaCl2 animals survived to the end of the protocol.

Conclusions

Levosimendan increased CO in this model of verapamil poisoning to a similar degree as CaCl2 alone, but it did not improve BP from time of maximal toxicity. The addition of CaCl2 to Levosimendan did not appear to result in any further improvement in CO and BP compared to CaCl2 alone. The failure of levosimendan to improve BP may result from vasodilation induced by levosimendan peripheral vascular K+ATP-channel agonism. This may compound the vasodilatory effects of verapamil and offset any hemodynamic improvements produced by increased cardiac output.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^111UfjTZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Results from clinical trials

Clinical trials of inotropes in heart failure have reinforced an important lesson: whereas short‐term surrogate endpoints such as haemodynamics might improve with these therapies, this does not necessarily translate into improvements in mortality. Inotropic therapies to date have failed to improve 'hard' clinical outcomes in heart failure, and the majority resulted in worse outcomes (Table 2). 14, 32, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 Furthermore, only a subset of results from trials investigating inotropes have been published, some many years after the results were presented, and the primary data are not available for analysis making a meticulous post‐mortem of disappointing prior results challenging. 58, 59

### Ponesimod (Ponvory) [^111sEr8f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of PONVORY treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia, first-or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].
PONVORY is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of PONVORY in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with PONVORY is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate such as digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during PONVORY initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing PONVORY treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 55 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, PONVORY can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 55 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 55 bpm. Treatment with PONVORY can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after PONVORY has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with PONVORY should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114kw6fZ]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Stress-induced cardiomyopathy — treatment — relies on supportive care focused on managing heart failure (HF) symptoms and treating hypotension and cardiogenic shock with appropriate therapies, while the role of neurohormonal agents is as yet unknown. A catecholamine-mediated process could have implications for management, with agents such as dobutamine theoretically able to worsen stress-induced cardiomyopathy, although this has not been reported or studied clinically; β-blockers can cause stimulus trafficking of β2-adrenergic receptors to Gi protein coupling resulting in negative inotropy. Intra-aortic balloon pump and calcium-sensitizing agents have been suggested as first- and second-line therapies, but the infrequency of this condition and reliance on small series have limited the capacity to develop standardized treatment strategies.

### Drug-disease and drug-drug interactions: systematic examination of recommendations in 12 UK national clinical guidelines [^113m1hUr]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the number of drugs or drug classes recommended as first line (for all or nearly all patients) and second line (for some patients under some circumstances) for each condition(details of the individual drugs are in appendix 1). There were 23 drugs recommended in the type 2 diabetes guideline (four first line), 13 drugs in the depression guideline (one first line), and 11 in the heart failure guideline (two first line).

Table 1
Number of drugs recommended for each condition in each NICE guideline considered

NICE = National Institute of Health and Care Excellence; MI = myocardial infarction.

Drug-disease interactions

Table 2 shows the number of times that a drug recommended for each of the three index conditions would be contraindicated or should be avoided in the presence of any of the other 11 conditions. Drug-disease interactions were not common, with the exception of those related to chronic kidney disease, which occurred with type 2 diabetes in particular. Chronic kidney disease was involved in 27 of the identified 32 drug-disease interactions for drugs recommended in the clinical guideline for type 2 diabetes and all of the six and 10 drug-disease interactions for the guidelines for depression and heart failure, respectively. But the guidelines for type 2 diabetes and heart failure each specifically discussed just one of these identified interactions. For type 2 diabetes this recommendation was regarding the need to avoid treatment with thiazolidinediones in people with comorbid heart failure. In heart failure, it was identified that amlodipine should be considered for the treatment of comorbid hypertension and/or angina in patients with heart failure, but verapamil, diltiazem, or short acting dihydropyridine agents should be avoided. The depression guideline did not discuss any of the identified drug-disease interactions.

### Update on ivabradine for heart failure [^114pgpjH]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite dramatic advances in therapy for heart failure (HF) during the past 3 decades, hospitalization and mortality rates remain relatively high. In recent decades, it has become apparent that HF is divisible into two equally lethal but pathophysiologically different sub-classes, the first comprising patients with LV systolic dysfunction [heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)] and the other, approximately equal in size, involving patients with "preserved" systolic function [heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)]. Evidence-based event reducing therapy currently is available only for HFrEF. With the completion of seminal trials of beta blockers, now part of standard therapy for HFrEF, it was apparent that heart rate slowing is an underlying basis of clinical effectiveness of HFrEF therapy. With the discovery of the "f current" that modulates the slope of spontaneous diastolic depolarization of the sino-atrial node, a non-beta blockade approach to heart rate slowing became available. Ivabradine, the first FDA-approved f-current blocker for HFrEF, markedly reduces hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, while also progressively reducing mortality as pre-therapy heart rate increases, and also promotes beneficial left ventricular remodeling, improves health-related quality of life and is effective despite a wide range of comorbidities. The drug is well tolerated and adverse effects are relatively few. Ivabradine represents an important addition to the armamentarium for mitigation of HFrEF.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and concomitant hypertension — defined by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% — should have at least a systolic blood pressure (SBP) target of < 130 mm Hg, with diuretics added for volume overload; dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) may be used if blood pressure (BP) remains elevated after guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization, whereas nondihydropyridine CCB are not recommended due to potential harm.

### Factors influencing long-term heart failure mortality in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Western Sweden: probable dose-related protection from β-blocker therapy [^111bgSAG]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Effect of therapy on risk of death

Surgical septal myectomy has long been considered the gold standard treatment for therapy-resistant patients with HOCM, and suggested to give superior survival compared with conservative treatment. However, the conservatively treated group was on average 10 years older, and a reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the intervention group could not be substantiated. We have earlier reported that in a geographical cohort of patients with HOCM, neither myectomy nor pacing was significantly associated with improved survival compared with conservative medical therapy, although both treatments improved NYHA class. In the present study, neither univariate nor multivariate Cox hazard analysis could detect that myectomy or pacing was associated with a survival benefit that was independent of other risk factors such as age (tables 2 and 3). Thus, the only therapy associated with significant improvement of survival on multivariate analysis in our cohort was beta-blocker therapy. The observed excess mortality in heart failure in patients with HOCM receiving verapamil/diltiazem is concerning but should be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers receiving calcium-blockers. This merits further study in HCM populations with higher use of calcium channel blockers than ours.

Methods

Study Protocol

Details regarding the INternational VErapamil‐SR/Trandolapril STudy (INVEST) protocol and outcomes have been published elsewhere. – Briefly, INVEST was an international randomized trial that compared the effects of a calcium antagonist (verapamil SR)‐based strategy with a β‐blocker (atenolol)‐based strategy for treatment of hypertension among 22 576 patients ≥ 50 years of age with clinically stable CAD. Since there was no difference between treatment strategies, the entire INVEST cohort was considered in the construction of this risk score.CAD was defined as prior myocardial infarction, abnormal coronary angiogram (≥ 50% stenosis of at least 1 major epicardial vessel), concordant abnormalities on 2 different types of cardiac tests (eg, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or myocardial perfusion study), or classic angina pectoris. The following patients were excluded: unstable angina, coronary revascularization or stroke within the last month, myocardial infarction within the last 3 months, β‐blocker use within the last 2 weeks or within 12 months of a myocardial infarction, sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome or type 2 or 3 heart block without permanent pacemaker, Wolf‐Parkinson‐White, ventricular tachycardia or other serious arrhythmias, severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class IV), severe renal dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 4.0 mg/dL), hepatic dysfunction, contraindication to study medication, or life expectancy < 2 years. Enrollment began September 1997 and follow‐up was completed in February 2003. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Local institutional review boards and ethics committees approved the protocol and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Antiarrhythmic medications — Class III antiarrhythmics and heart failure — In patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%), intravenous ibutilide did not have clinically significant hemodynamic effects, but HF was an independent risk factor for ibutilide-induced torsades de pointes. Among sotalol formulations, a study of d-sotalol in patients surviving an MI with reduced LV function was terminated prematurely because of increased mortality, whereas racemic sotalol did not increase mortality after MI. Sotalol can depress myocardial contractility and exacerbate HF in some patients and should be used cautiously in patients with LV dysfunction; in premarketing studies, the incidence of new or worsened HF over 1 year was 3% in patients without previous HF and 10% in those with a history of HF.

### Keeping your patient with heart failure safe… [^112ZdegJ]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

This was due to an increase in life-threatening arrhythmias and the conversion of ischemic and HF episodes to fatal events. 19, 20 A post hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation trial found that patients with HF in the study who were receiving antiarrhythmic therapy had a greater risk of cardiac death than patients not receiving one of these agents.
21. In one of the larger studies,
5. 0% of patients with a history of HF experienced torsades de pointes when treated with D, L-sotalol compared with 1. 7% of patients without a history of clinical HF. 23 A meta-analysis showed that proarrhythmia was most often experienced by patients taking sotalol who had a history of HF, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and myocardial infarction.

24 However, this increased incidence of torsades de pointes in patients with HF is not surprising, as they are at a higher risk of arrhythmias than the general population. The Survival With Oral D-sotalol trial proved that the pure class III antiarrhythmic action of D-sotalol was associated with a higher relative risk of mortality than placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less. 25 In contrast, a small. Six patients randomized to receive ibutilide developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. All 6 of these patients had a history of decreased LV function. 27 There are no studies available directly evaluating ibutilide in patients with HF. The relative scarcity of data makes complete assessment in this subset of patients difficult. However, it is recommended that ibutilide be avoided in patients with HF because of the suggestion of proarrhythmic effects.

Verapamil has limited data regarding its use in patients with HF because of its known negative inotropic effects and manufacturer's warning of worsening HF. 33 An early open-label trial showed marked hemodynamic and clinical deterioration in patients with an EF of less than 35% treated with verapamil after 1 year. 34 Although diltiazem has less negative inotropy and chronotropy than verapamil, it has also been associated with HF deterioration in patients with an EF of less than 40% at baseline. 35.
