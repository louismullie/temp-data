## Question

Nausea after giving birth

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nausea after giving birth, including how to think about causes, how to evaluate it, and how to manage it safely in the postpartum period. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is immediate postpartum versus later postpartum nausea. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies, including medication effects, anesthesia-related causes, and obstetric complications. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and decide what labs or imaging are warranted. After that, I need to check which antiemetics are safe in breastfeeding and how to dose them. Finally, I will consider nonpharmacologic strategies, monitoring, and when to escalate care, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because immediate postpartum nausea within 24 hours often reflects anesthesia, uterotonic effects, or opioid-related causes, whereas later postpartum nausea beyond a week raises different concerns such as infection, medication effects, or gastrointestinal disease, and I should tailor the workup accordingly [^notfound].

> I will now examine medication-related causes, since opioids for postpartum pain are a common culprit. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of opioid-associated nausea; ACOG's stepwise multimodal analgesia explicitly aims to limit opioid exposure to reduce nausea, constipation, and drowsiness, so NSAIDs and acetaminophen first-line with opioids only as needed is key, and I should also consider that neuraxial opioids can cause nausea and pruritus, which is why multimodal regional strategies are preferred when feasible [^709a83a1] [^215b7d95].

> Next, I should review anesthesia-related contributors, especially for cesarean delivery. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for prophylaxis; 5-HT3 antagonists reduce intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting after regional anesthesia for cesarean, and dopamine antagonists also reduce intraoperative nausea and vomiting, though certainty varies, so prophylactic ondansetron or metoclopramide at the time of cesarean is reasonable in higher-risk patients or when symptoms occur [^12d249f4].

> But wait, what if the nausea is from uterotonic agents used for postpartum hemorrhage prevention or treatment. I need to check the adverse effect profiles; ergometrine-containing regimens increase vomiting and hypertension compared with oxytocin alone, and misoprostol increases fever, so if nausea began after uterotonics, that temporal link supports a drug-induced etiology and reassessment of the regimen may help [^67f42332] [^2aa8a826].

> Let me consider obstetric complications that can masquerade as or cause nausea. Postpartum hemorrhage itself can precipitate nausea via hypovolemia and compensatory responses, and retained products of conception or endometritis can present with nausea alongside fever, pain, or bleeding, so I should confirm vitals, fundal height, lochia, and uterine tenderness, and obtain a CBC and urinalysis when indicated, escalating to pelvic ultrasound if retained tissue is suspected [^notfound].

> I should double-check the differential beyond obstetric and anesthesia causes. Gastrointestinal etiologies like gastritis, GERD, or ileus can occur postpartum, and migraine-associated nausea is not rare. Metoclopramide is effective for migraine-associated nausea and is compatible with lactation, so if headache features are present, that pathway is reasonable to try while I continue evaluation [^30e3ab5a] [^bf3d1737].

> Now, I need to ensure I am choosing antiemetics that are safe in breastfeeding. Let me verify the preferred agents; ondansetron and metoclopramide are preferred antiemetics in pregnancy and lactation, with ondansetron considered compatible with breastfeeding and metoclopramide acceptable when needed, though I should monitor for extrapyramidal effects with metoclopramide and use the lowest effective dose. Diphenhydramine can be used as an adjunct for akathisia or sedation, and promethazine is sometimes used but causes more sedation and should be used cautiously if at all in the immediate postpartum period [^30e3ab5a].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and routes. For ondansetron, 4 mg orally or intravenously every 8 hours is a typical dose, and for metoclopramide, 10 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours is standard, with consideration of non-oral routes if the patient cannot tolerate oral intake. If symptoms persist, combining agents with different mechanisms can be more effective than escalating a single drug, consistent with PONV principles adapted to the postpartum context [^notfound].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic strategies that can meaningfully reduce nausea. Small, frequent, protein-predominant meals, separating liquids from solids, avoiding strong odors, and maintaining hydration with electrolytes are foundational. Ginger can be considered for mild symptoms, and acupressure or P6 wristbands may help some patients, though evidence quality varies and these are best framed as adjuncts rather than replacements for pharmacotherapy when symptoms are moderate to severe [^df479724] [^433f00d8].

> I need to ensure I am not missing red flags that warrant escalation. Persistent vomiting with dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, inability to retain oral medications, or signs of infection or retained products should prompt admission for IV hydration with normal saline plus potassium guided by daily electrolytes, parenteral antiemetics, and targeted therapy for the underlying cause, aligning with inpatient criteria used for severe NVP and adapted to postpartum physiology [^70639cd9] [^6e83c310].

> Let me reconsider the mental health dimension, because women with severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are at increased risk of postpartum depression and anxiety. Even though the user is asking about postpartum nausea, I should screen for mood symptoms and connect patients with support resources, as RCOG highlights the elevated risk of postnatal psychiatric morbidity after hyperemesis gravidarum and recommends proactive psychosocial care and follow-up planning [^e58055cf] [^c15da9e2].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety netting. If nausea persists beyond a week, if new symptoms emerge, or if there is concern for medication intolerance or nonresponse, I should reassess the diagnosis, review medications anew, and consider imaging or specialty referral. At discharge, patients should have clear instructions on antiemetic continuation, hydration targets, and how to access urgent care if symptoms recur or worsen, mirroring best practices for NVP discharge planning and adapted to the postpartum setting [^abbef4cf].

Postpartum nausea is common and multifactorial, most often due to **opioids, anesthesia, or uterotonic side effects** [^709a83a1] [^12d249f4] [^67f42332]. Other causes include **gastrointestinal issues, electrolyte disturbances, or infection** [^bf3d1737] [^0a8752eb]. Management should be **multimodal**: stop or reduce offending drugs, use antiemetics safe in breastfeeding (ondansetron, metoclopramide, dimenhydrinate), correct dehydration/electrolytes, and treat underlying causes. Most cases resolve with supportive care; persistent or severe symptoms need evaluation for complications.

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A thorough clinical evaluation is essential to identify the **underlying cause** of postpartum nausea:

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, associated symptoms (vomiting, headache, fever, abdominal pain), medication use, anesthesia details, dietary intake, and psychological factors.

- **Physical examination**: Vital signs, abdominal examination, assessment of hydration status, and evaluation for signs of infection or complications.

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, renal function tests, liver function tests, urinalysis, and urine culture if indicated.

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan if obstruction or other gastrointestinal pathology is suspected.

---

## Management strategies

Management of postpartum nausea involves a **multimodal approach** tailored to the underlying cause:

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Antiemetics**: Ondansetron, metoclopramide, and dimenhydrinate are safe and effective options compatible with breastfeeding [^notfound].

- **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**: Consider for GERD-related nausea [^4e0be8ba].

- **Laxatives**: For constipation-related nausea.

- **Antibiotics**: For infectious causes such as endometritis or UTI.

---

### Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **dietary modifications** — small, frequent meals; avoidance of spicy, fatty, or strong-smelling foods; and adequate hydration [^bf3d1737]. Acupressure or acupuncture may provide additional benefit [^433f00d8]. Psychological support and counseling should be offered for anxiety or postpartum depression [^c15da9e2].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **minimizing risk factors** and proactively addressing modifiable contributors:

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Limit opioid use and utilize NSAIDs and acetaminophen as first-line agents [^709a83a1].

- **Adequate hydration**: Encourage oral intake and provide intravenous fluids if necessary [^70639cd9].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential side effects of medications and encourage early reporting of symptoms.

---

## Potential complications if untreated

Untreated postpartum nausea can lead to:

- **Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances**: Risk of severe complications such as renal dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Due to persistent vomiting and poor dietary intake.

- **Delayed recovery**: Prolonged hospital stay and delayed maternal-infant bonding.

- **Psychological distress**: Increased risk of anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recovery timeline

The prognosis for postpartum nausea is **generally favorable**, with most cases resolving within a few days to weeks with appropriate management. Persistent symptoms beyond this timeframe warrant further evaluation for underlying chronic conditions or complications.

---

Postpartum nausea is a common and multifactorial condition that requires a **comprehensive evaluation and targeted management**. Most cases resolve with supportive care, but persistent or severe symptoms need further assessment for complications.

### What are the costs associated with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum? A systematic review [^57341c3a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Standardisation of care

The variation in treatment practices and costs across different studies highlights the need for standardised care protocols. Implementing consistent guidelines, which can help reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, improve timely care and reduce associated costs, are important factors in providing effective and cost-effective care. The included studies demonstrated that costs related to NVP and HG escalate as the severity of the disease increases (n = 3 studies). Evidence from another randomised trial indicated that early intervention and treatment have the potential to mitigate the severity of symptoms. Consequently, there is an implication that early intervention may yield cost benefits.

Investigation of the effectiveness of early intervention of treatments and models of care are important, and should include the role of optimal and early management in preventing the progression of NVP and HG. Studies exploring the cost effectiveness of the management of NVP and HG in various models of maternity care in the review were both from the UK. Further research is required to investigate the implementation of these specialised units in an Australian context. Currently, women may not encounter maternity services until 12–16 weeks' gestation, by which time they may have significantly advanced illness. Prior to this, women with NVP/HG are often managed in the general patient population (through emergency departments and/or general practice). Providing earlier specialised pregnancy care with midwives and obstetricians, with specialised knowledge, may be highly effective in managing women's symptoms and complications of illness.

The extent of clinician understanding of care requirements, and adherence to HG guidelines, including education and training needs, is also essential to understand for early and effective treatment. Investing in preventative measures and early interventions can potentially reduce the severity of symptoms and associated costs. This includes knowledge translation strategies for educating healthcare providers and patients about early signs and effective management strategies using evidence-based guidelines for recommended care.

Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between early treatment, including appropriate access to specialised maternity services, and the potential cost benefits. Additionally, addressing issues associated with differences in research methodology and consistency in reporting common outcomes across health economic studies would make comparisons between studies and their implementation more feasible. Further research is needed with more consistent methodological approaches and use of agreed, common outcome measures to facilitate meaningful data synthesis and enable more robust analysis, interpretation and implementation of findings.

Vaginal birth — stepwise multimodal analgesia is explicitly recommended: "A stepwise multimodal approach to analgesia beginning with an NSAID or acetaminophen and, if needed, escalating to an opioid is recommended after vaginal delivery". The rationale notes "Given interindividual differences in pain type and intensity, as well as the concern that a small subset of opioid-naïve patients will become persistent opioid users after postpartum exposure", and endorses an approach "that limits opioid exposure to the lowest, briefest exposure necessary to achieve pain control when NSAIDs and acetaminophen prove inadequate". The text also states that "this approach intends to reduce opioid-associated side effects such as nausea, constipation, and drowsiness".

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^54e15b50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation strategy note common, often transient side effects and a titration approach to mitigate early anxiety. Most SSRIs are generally well-tolerated but can cause nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, agitation or anxiety, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction, with most dissipating over time except sexual dysfunction; some patients report an initial exacerbation of agitation or anxiety that is often mitigated by starting with half of the lowest dose and gradually up-titrating over 4–10 days. Many experts consider dose titration to be a best practice for initiating treatment for perinatal depression, and activating antidepressants such as fluoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion may exacerbate anxiety symptoms, so in someone with moderate-to-severe comorbid anxiety, alternatives to these medications should be considered when appropriate.

### Practice bulletin summary no. 153: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^0f96befe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^48b35627]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) represent a common disorder, reported by 50–90% of pregnant women with a severe form named Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), which is the leading cause of hospitalization during the first trimester. NVP now recognized as a genetic and biological condition, has frequently been misdiagnosed as a mental health disorder. Affected women were often accused of feigning their symptoms, and management approaches that are now deemed unacceptable — such as isolation — were historically employed in the care of women with NVP. It is assumed that serious physical illnesses significantly affect patients' quality of life and cause psychological distress. Indeed, NVP exerts a significant psychological burden and negatively impact quality of life and emotional well-being during and after pregnancy. They are associated with psychiatric conditions including anxiety and depression. Given the comorbidity between several psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it is essential to distinguish between them in order to ensure targeted and effective clinical management.

Furthermore, PPD is the most common post-partum complication and affects 10 to 20% of new mothers. PPD is strongly associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicide remains a leading cause of death during the perinatal period. PPD can have long-term negative effects on the child, the mother and the family environment. Early identification and timely intervention are essential; therefore, recognizing predictive symptoms of postpartum depression is crucial to enable preventive, individualized follow-up and to avert devastating impacts on families and society.

In the literature, although NVP and HG have validated definitions (see Table 1), their descriptions vary among studies. Furthermore, the relationship between nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and PPD is controversial. Some studies have reported this association, but others have not. This could be explained by several reasons: the studies included data gathered with different methodologies and mainly focused on HG and not NVP. PPD was assessed using different tools and at different times after delivery. In addition, the authors often investigated the causal relationship between NVP/HG and psychiatric symptoms.

### Differential diagnosis and… [^5a89e833]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy begins between the fourth and seventh week after the last menstrual period in 80 percent of pregnant women and resolves by the 20th week of gestation in all but 10 percent of these women. 1 The condition has been shown to be more common in urban women than in rural women. 2 One study 3 identified increased risk in housewives and decreased risk in "white collar" or professional white women who consumed alcohol before conception, and in women over 35 years of age with a history of infertility. Hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting, affects one in 200 pregnant women. 4 Although the definition of this condition has not been standardized, accepted clinical features include persistent vomiting, dehydration, ketosis, electrolyte disturbances, and weight loss.

Multiple gestation, gestational trophoblastic disease, triploidy, trisomy 21 syndrome, and hydrops fetalis have been associated with an increased incidence of hyperemesis gravidarum.
5. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction also has been suggested as a cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In one study 6 in which progesterone was prescribed to nonpregnant women, resultant nausea and vomiting suggested that delayed gastric motility caused by progesterone may be responsible for the condition. Another study 7 reviewed many potential gastrointestinal causes of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, including abnormalities of gastric electrical rhythm. Many reports have suggested that hormones may cause nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. In one comparative study.

Maternal and Fetal Outcomes Women with uncomplicated nausea and vomiting of pregnancy have been noted to have improved pregnancy outcomes, including fewer miscarriages, pre-term deliveries, and stillbirths, as well as fewer instances of fetal low birth weight, growth retardation, and mortality. 34 demonstrated a marginally increased risk of major malformation and a 3. 4-fold increased risk of oral cleft in infants exposed to corticosteroids in the first trimester. 1) first, 5 because of the theoretic risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Intravenous fluid may provide relief from nausea and vomiting, but many pregnant women also require an antiemetic administered orally, rectally, or by infusion with the fluid. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, intravenous fluid therapy may be given in the hospital or at home by a visiting nurse.

### The outpatient management and special considerations of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^b0b9849c]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

With 50–90% of pregnant women experiencing nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), the burden of illness can become quite significant if symptoms are under-treated and/or under-diagnosed, thus allowing for progression of the disease. The majority of these women will necessitate at least one visit with a provider to specifically address NVP, and up to 10% or greater will require pharmacotherapy after failure of conservative measures to adequately control symptoms. As a result, initiation of prompt and effective treatment in the outpatient setting is ideal. Once NVP is diagnosed and treatment is started, it is crucial to track symptoms in order to assess for a decrease in or resolution of symptoms as well as an escalation in symptoms requiring additional therapy. Of note, co-existing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori infection, and psychosocial factors may have a negative impact on the management of NVP. Ultimately, every woman has her own perception of disease severity and desire for treatment. It is critical that both the provider and patient be proactive in the diagnosis and management of NVP.

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^baa2ef20]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting around 1%-3% of pregnancies worldwide and is the most common reason for hospital admission in early pregnancy. HG can have lasting consequences for both pregnant individuals and their offspring. Current best-practice management includes symptomatic treatment with anti-emetic pharmacological treatment, rehydration if needed, and psychological support. There is a lack of high-quality evidence on treatment for HG. Future research should focus on understanding the cause, developing effective treatment, and so limiting the burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^30e3ab5a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline — persistent headache in pregnancy states that ACOG recommends metoclopramide 10 mg (intravenous or enteral), alone or in combination with diphenhydramine 25 mg (intravenous or enteral) as additional treatment for persistent headache in pregnancy (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Use of metoclopramide is particularly helpful for women with migraine-associated nausea, and although metoclopramide is preferred because of its better safety profile, other common antiemetics can also be used. Oral diphenhydramine 25 mg may be co-administered with metoclopramide to counter akathisia, and the sedating effects of the antihistamine may also help with migraine resolution.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^215b7d95]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Incisional Pain After Cesarean Section

Incisional pain following cesarean delivery is common and may affect maternal mobility, infant bonding, and breastfeeding. Its etiology is complex, involving surgical trauma, inflammatory responses, and scar tissue formation. Mechanical injury to abdominal and uterine tissues activates local inflammation and cytokine release (IL-6, TNF-α), which sensitize peripheral nerves. Edema and scar adhesion can further activate nociceptors or compress nerves, leading to persistent or referred pain. Postoperative scar tissue formation may also lead to nerve compression, which may lead to intractable incisional pain or referred pain.

The management of incisional pain following cesarean section primarily relies on multimodal analgesia strategies. Among these, neuraxial analgesia — such as epidural or intrathecal administration of morphine — remains one of the most effective approaches. However, it may be associated with adverse effects including pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. In recent years, regional nerve block techniques have gained attention as effective alternatives. Qin et aldemonstrated that approaches such as the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block and the erector spinae plane (ESP) block provide satisfactory postoperative analgesia and significantly reduce opioid requirements. Local anesthetic techniques have also emerged as promising adjuncts. For instance, lidocaine patches and intraoperative fascial infiltration of bupivacaine combined with epinephrine have been explored. A study by de Queiroz et alfound that 5% lidocaine patches effectively reduced pain scores within the first 36 hours postoperatively, although they did not significantly impact opioid consumption, recovery quality, or adverse event rates. A study by Garmi et aldemonstrated that intraoperative wound infiltration with bupivacaine combined with epinephrine significantly reduced incisional pain following cesarean section and decreased the need for rescue opioid analgesics postpartum. No intervention-related adverse effects were observed, indicating favorable safety and analgesic efficacy. This technique may serve as an effective strategy for postoperative pain management after cesarean delivery.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^f265c8cf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the grave ramifications of this condition, many healthcare providers do not meet the needs of their HG patients. This is evident not only from the sheer number of medications that patients are trialing as shown in our data, but also from several studies regarding lessened quality of life and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, we discovered that more than half of the patients who are prescribed medication for their symptoms are experiencing a plethora of side effects. It is vital to reverse this trend; health care providers need to be aware of the high burden NVP/HG and its current treatment places on these patients.

Support and high-quality care are essential for this vulnerable population. However, the lack of a unified standard of care for NVP/HG patients prevents the condition from being widely recognized and downplays the need for effective interventions, which is considered one of the highest priorities of experts in this field regarding this condition. Without fully understanding the etiology of this multifactorial condition, the obstetrics community is at a loss for solutions to the root-cause of this problem. By emphasizing the lack of efficacious, well-tolerated treatment, we hope that this research will inspire the obstetrics community to better understand NVP/HG, including treatments and outcomes. Though pregnant people are a controversial study population, high-quality research is necessary to bridge this gap. Effective therapeutics for NVP/HG will give patients a better outlook on pregnancy, an improved relationship with their healthcare providers, and a higher quality of life during and after pregnancy.

### Evaluation and treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults [^bf3d1737]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.

### Pregnancy and postpartum bowel changes: constipation and fecal incontinence [^8c3c7016]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and the postpartum period are often associated with many gastrointestinal complaints, including nausea, vomiting, and heartburn; however, the most troublesome complaints in some women are defecatory disorders such as constipation and fecal incontinence, especially postpartum. These disorders are often multifactorial in etiology, and many studies have looked to see what risk factors lead to these complications. This review discusses the current knowledge of pelvic floor and anorectal physiology, especially during pregnancy, and reviews the current literature on causes and treatments of postpartum bowel symptoms of constipation and fecal incontinence.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^0a48436c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate the association between nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), including hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and postpartum depression (PPD), and to identify predictive symptoms of PPD to improve preventive care and follow-up.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in six databases from inception to June 25, 2024, using predefined keywords and MeSH terms related to PPD and pregnancy-related vomiting.

Eligible studies included original research articles examining the association between PPD and NVP (any duration or severity, including HG). Articles were restricted to English or French. Diagnostic criteria for NVP and PPD had to be clearly specified.

The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024508214). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent researchers conducted article screening, data extraction, and bias assessment.

Results

Out of 355 identified articles, 18 (mainly prospective and retrospective cohort studies) were included. Analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of PPD in women with NVP, ranging from adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.54 [95% CI 1.42–1.68] for mild NVP to 6.52 [95% CI 3.76–11.30] for severe NVP and 2.26 [95% CI 1.04–4.92] for persistent symptoms. These values represent the lowest and highest aORs reported in individual studies, not a pooled meta-analytic estimate. The association remained significant in large-scale studies after adjusting for confounders.

Conclusions

This review highlights the importance of monitoring the severity and duration of NVP during pregnancy. Identifying these symptoms should prompt systematic PPD screening, especially within the first 6 months postpartum, to facilitate timely intervention and improve maternal mental health outcomes.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^56650507]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — pharmacologic research and combination therapy emphasizes that further investigations of the genetic and internal environment predispositions to PONV could personalize preventive strategies, and that the developing field of pharmacogenomics in relation to antiemetic efficacy is of equal clinical interest. There is yet a paucity of research on PONV risk and management in special patient populations, including children, pregnant patients, and patients having cesarean delivery. The page notes a rising incidence of obesity, bariatric surgery worldwide, and a recent dramatic increase in the use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, with how these factors influence PONV risk assessment and treatment not yet clearly understood. The current armamentarium of antiemetic drugs provides a solid approach to reduce PONV for most patients, but further research could look to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects; the NK-1 receptor antagonist class is of particular interest because of high efficacy and reasonable duration, as well as potential anxiolytic, antidepressant and antipruritic effects. A combination drug of long acting netupitant with palonosetron is approved in the US for CINV, and research in combination or co-administration of drugs for PONV indications should be done focusing on synergistic effects while monitoring clinical and drug-interaction (CYP450) side effects.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^0a8752eb]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^46390491]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy

For this systematic review, studies meeting the following criteria were eligible: (1) original articles (randomized controlled studies, observational studies, retrospective studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and epidemiological studies); (2) articles on the association between PPD and NVP (any duration and severity, including HG); (3) articles involving pregnant women without age restrictions; and (4) articles using epidemiological measures, such as relative risk, odds ratio, hazard ratio, absolute risk difference, or their equivalents.

Non-original articles (reporting data from another study), case reports, reviews, books, non-accessible articles and abstracts, and articles written in a language other than French and English were excluded.

The eligibility of all articles retrieved by the search was confirmed by looking for the use of objective diagnostic criteria, such as a symptom rating system for NVP (e.g. PUQE-24 and scales or questionnaires to assess NVP in terms of duration or severity) and diagnostic scales or questionnaires for PPD (e.g. Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, EPDS). The NVP definition, including the description of severe NVP, used in each study was recorded.

Two researchers (LV and KLF) carried out an exhaustive literature search in six databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Lissa, PsycInfo, and DocCIS'MeF). The initial literature search was conducted from March 18, 2024, and the search was updated on June 25, 2024, prior to data extraction to identify any newly published studies (supplementary material). The reference lists of the articles that met the inclusion criteria were also reviewed. If an article was unavailable, the authors were contacted. No date restriction was applied, but only articles in English and French were included. Before data extraction, the databases were searched again with the same search strings and all newly identified studies were reviewed for inclusion.

Two groups of keywords related to "POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION" and "PREGNANCY-RELATED VOMITING" were defined and then translated into MeSH terms using the Health Terminology/Ontology Portal (HeTOP), including variants and synonyms of each keyword. The primary search string was developed for PubMed with the assistance of a librarian. Several search strings were tested to retain the most relevant one that was then adapted as needed for each database and registry.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^d7df50b1]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common experiences in pregnancy, affecting 70% to 80% of all pregnant women. Various metabolic and neuromuscular factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), an entity distinct from NVP. However, their exact cause is unknown. Consequently, treatment of NVP and HG can be difficult, as neither the optimal targets for treatment nor the full effects of potential treatments on the developing fetus are known. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, outcomes, and treatment of NVP and HG.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^80260398]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and heartburn — prevalence, timing, and initial treatment are outlined: Heartburn, nausea, and vomiting are common during pregnancy, with frequency ranging from 30%–90%. NVP usually begins at 4–6 weeks and peaks at 8–12 weeks. Diet and lifestyle modification are the initial steps in managing these symptoms in pregnancy. H2-receptor blockers are the most used antireflux medications during pregnancy, and cimetidine and famotidine are administered routinely in pregnancy. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or pantoprazole, can be considered if lifestyle modifications and antacids fail to alleviate symptoms; in a meta-analysis of 26 studies, no significant associations between proton pump inhibitor use and abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, and low birth weight were observed, although a nonsignificant increase in the risk of congenital malformations was seen.

### Features of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as predictive factors of post-partum depression: a systematic review [^304923e1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

The association between nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and postpartum depression (PPD) was reported in several studies, with odds ratios for severity of NVP ranging from 1.54 [95% CI (1.42–1.68)] to 6.52 [95% CI (3.76–11.30)]. For persistent NVP, one study reported an odds ratio of 2.26 [95% CI (1.04–4.92)]. It should be noted that these values represent the lowest and highest odds ratios identified in individual studies included in this review; no meta-analysis was performed, and these are not pooled estimates.

The strength of the association between NVP and PPD appears to increase progressively and linearly with the symptom severity. Indeed, the aOR values increased progressively with NVP intensity, becoming particularly high in the presence of HG. Similarly, the association between NVP and PPD tended to intensify during the postpartum period, from 6 weeks to 6 months after delivery.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^c60c0b16]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment, because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially when ondansetron was taken in the first trimester. Consequently, it is recommended as second-line therapy. Phenothiazines are another first-line treatment option, including prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and perphenazine. Studies have not shown increased risk for major malformations. Finally, metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, can also be safely prescribed. However, it crosses the placenta and is considered a second-line treatment option, given its potential extrapyramidal effects on both the fetus (third trimester) and the mother (first trimester).

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy — The following recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B): Treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with ginger has shown some beneficial effects in reducing nausea symptoms and can be considered as a nonpharmacologic option. Treatment of severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum with methylprednisolone may be efficacious in refractory cases; however, the risk profile of methylprednisolone suggests it should be a last-resort treatment.

### Assessment of management approaches for hyperemesis gravidarum and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a retrospective questionnaire analysis [^652f1648]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

HG has far-reaching implications that outlast the physical illness. In a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in Norway, respondents suffering from more severe symptoms were found to have a physical quality of life close to that among patients with breast cancer, and a mental quality of life comparable to that seen among mothers with postpartum depression. In an online survey of 377 patients who experienced HG, 18% met the criteria for posttraumatic stress syndrome. In a study of over 5000 patients with HG, over half (52%) of participants had contemplated terminating a pregnancy due to the severity of their HG symptoms. Two of five (40%) of participants in a separate Norwegian study expressed that they had contemplated abortion, and subjects had a minimum of one elective abortion because of HG. 19% of subjects switched their doctor because they were not receiving satisfactory HG treatment. These patients also expressed confusion about their prescribed pharmacological regimens, and 87.9% used one or more complementary and alternative medicines, but only 12.8% of whom reported any positive effect on HG symptoms. More than half of the interviewees believed their general practitioner had no knowledge of HG.

The limitations of this study include the retrospective and subjective nature of our data collection. We relied on the mothers' memories of pregnancies that may have happened decades in the past. Furthermore, we had did not have the resources to verify the claims of diagnoses of Hyperemesis Gravidarum or Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy or the treatments of said diagnoses. We cannot rule out a self-selection bias due to respondents who have been severely affected with NVP/HG potentially being more willing to participate, therefore leading to the potential overestimation of severity. The use of the internet to disseminate the questionnaire may also isolate a population who do not have access to the internet or have low internet-literacy, though web-based recruitment has been shown to be valid in terms of study design.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^64e25251]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment strategies

Treatment strategies for HG should be based on the severity of symptoms and multimodal in nature (advice, hydration, medication, hospitalization and psychosomatic counselling when necessary; see Figure 3). The severity of the condition can be assessed by numerous questionnaires. Two of the most widely used questionnaires are the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) scoring index, which assesses nausea and vomiting over 12 h, and the PUQE-24, an extension of the original PUQE, which assesses symptoms over 24 h. Another recently developed score is the Hyperemesis Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS) that brings into focus not only physical but also psychosocial factors in order to assess the impact of HG holistically.

Figure 3
Multimodal character of treatment strategies in hyperemesis gravidarum, adapted from reference.

Initial management

For initial management, dietary and lifestyle advice is often sufficient to ameliorate symptoms and improve quality of life. Mild forms of nausea and vomiting can usually be managed by following general nutritional advice such as the intake of small amounts of fluids and food throughout the day rather than eating fewer but larger meals. Foods should be rich on carbohydrates and low in fat and acid. Light snacks, nuts, dairy products, beans and dry and salty biscuits are also frequently recommended. Additionally, electrolyte-replacement drinks and oral nutritional supplements are advisable for ensuring maintenance of electrolyte balance and an adequate intake of calories. Protein-predominant meals have a positive effect because they are eupeptic and are able to reduce nausea more effectively than equicaloric carbohydrate and fat meals or noncaloric meals. If the smell of hot food triggers nausea, cold food should be prepared instead. Lifestyle advice may include avoiding stress and resting in the event of incipient nausea.

Emotional support and, if needed, psychosomatic care administered by a psychologist or a medical doctor with training in psychosomatics can be helpful. Depending on the severity of the symptoms, supportive counselling or crisis intervention might be required.

### The onset of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a prospective cohort study [^80af5b19]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) has been recognised as a feature of early pregnancy for well over 2000 years. Hippocrates who lived from 460 to 370 BC wrote "when a woman who is suffering from neither rigours nor fever, develops amenorrhea and is liable to nausea, she is pregnant". Different national guidelines recommend different approaches to the management of NVP, with a wide range of recommendations.

The precise date and the characteristics of its onset have been more difficult to define. Several papers that describe onset have collected data retrospectively by asking women to describe their onset when they attend their first ante-natal clinic often at around 12 weeks from last menstrual period (LMP). Such retrospective data may be particularly unreliable if symptoms are mild and have subsided by the time of data collection. In the Canadian study, 74% of women reported nausea. A study describing the onset and natural history of NVP that asked women to present when they first thought they were pregnant so as to enter the study as early as possible in order to collect symptoms prospectively, reported entry at a median of day 57 from LMP. In that study 58 (16%) of women out of a study population of 363 reported symptoms before entry, some of them up to 14 days before entry. Using LMP to date onset of pregnancy nausea and vomiting may also be problematic. Some studies have shown that only 32% of women were certain of the date of their LMP. A higher incidence of round number preferences were recorded when women were asked the date of their LMP with the 15th of the month given 2.5 times more often than expected.

A much more accurate way of dating a pregnancy is from using the date of ovulation which can be determined by measuring the surge in luteinising hormone (LH) that stimulates ovulation. The cause of NVP is still largely unknown, but is thought to be multifactorial, with a genetic element in its aetiology. A psychiatric aetiology has been proposed in the past but, although this has been disproven, sufferers feel that this remains an inhibitor to the empathy and care the condition deserves. Women who have experienced severe NVP are very keen to stress the biological nature of the condition. Evidence that there is a very close association between the onset of NVP symptoms and the onset of pregnancy, as measured from the date of ovulation, would provide further evidence for a biological aetiology.

In this paper we study the onset of NVP in relation to the date of ovulation and LMP

### Comparison of dezocine and hydromorphone in post-cesarean epidural analgesia: a retrospective study [^a8659065]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative pain management following cesarean delivery is essential for enhancing maternal recovery, reducing complications, and improving the overall postpartum experience. As one of the most common surgeries worldwide, cesarean sections have a high incidence of postoperative pain, which, if inadequately controlled, can lead to prolonged recovery, increased risk of chronic pain, and higher rates of postpartum depression. Given the significant physical and emotional impacts, effective analgesic strategies are critical in ensuring both short-term and long-term well-being of new mothers.

Neuraxial anesthesia is the predominant technique for cesarean delivery, thereby facilitating the use of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for postoperative pain management. PCEA is widely recognized for its effectiveness in managing post-cesarean pain and, compared with patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), offers superior analgesia while reducing the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. In clinical practice, PCEA regimens typically combine low-concentration local anesthetics with opioids. Ropivacaine is frequently selected for postoperative analgesia due to its rapid clearance, selective sensory-motor blockade, and enhanced cardiovascular safety. However, the optimal opioid for inclusion in PCEA protocols remains a subject of ongoing debate. While morphine-a full µ-opioid receptor agonist-provides effective postoperative analgesia, its hydrophilic nature results in dose-dependent adverse effects, including pruritus, nausea, and vomiting. Hydromorphone, a semi-synthetic µ-opioid receptor agonist derived from morphine, offers a more favorable safety profile with a lower incidence of such adverse effects, yet its clinical outcomes are not uniformly optimal. Striking a balance between achieving effective analgesia and minimizing adverse reactions remains a challenging issue in postoperative pain management.

Dezocine is a unique analgesic with a dual mechanism of action, functioning as a µ-opioid receptor partial agonist, κ-opioid receptor antagonist, and δ-opioid receptor agonist, while also inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake. This pharmacological profile enables it to provide effective pain relief with a lower incidence of opioid-related side effects compared to full µ-opioid agonists. Clinical studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in acute, chronic, and postoperative pain management, with the potential for use as a standalone analgesic or in combination with other opioids to enhance analgesic effects while minimizing adverse effects. These characteristics make dezocine a promising alternative in multimodal pain management strategies. We hypothesize that dezocine, when used in a PCEA regimen, provides comparable analgesic effectiveness to hydromorphone, but with a lower incidence of opioid-related adverse effects in post-cesarean patients.

### Effectiveness of a guided ACT-based self-help resilience training for depressive symptoms during pregnancy: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial embedded in a prospective cohort [^bed50732]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antepartum depressive symptoms and subclinical depression with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20%, often remain unnoticed by maternity care providers during antenatal visits. However, early detection is crucial because symptoms of depression or anxiety may result in antepartum depression with prevalence rates ranging from 5 to 13% or in postpartum depression (PPD) with prevalence rates of 10 to 15%. Because these depressive disorders are associated with reduced family functioning, impaired mother-to-infant bonding, adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth, and cognitive and behavioral developmental delays in the infant, they form an essential treatment target. A potential mechanism underlying these associations is stress-induced neuroendocrine dysregulation of the maternal Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA)-axis reflected by increased maternal cortisol levels that, in turn, affects the functioning of the neonatal HPA-axis.

An important protective factor against the development of depression is resilience: adapting to and recovering from stress. Promoting resilience and positive mental health is a priority of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, little is known about resilience in the antepartum period and its preventive effect on maternal depressive symptoms and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes. In non-pregnant populations, positive associations between resilience and psychological well-being have been observed. To date, only a few small studies have examined associations between levels of resilience (or related factors) and maternal depression and depressive symptoms or infant behavioral and developmental outcomes. More specifically, by examining trajectories of antepartum and postpartum depressive symptoms in association with maternal antepartum resilience, psychological well-being, and developmental outcomes of the young child, a better understanding of individualized treatment options can be gained. Recently, researchers of a prospective cohort study (n = 2466) identified antepartum and postpartum risk factors (e.g. younger age, smoking, nausea, operative delivery, bonding difficulties, and low partner support) of several maternal depressive trajectories. However, to date, additional examination of other psychological characteristics, including resilience and (chronic) neurobiological correlates associated with these trajectories, is lacking. New studies may provide evidence for relevant clinical management and treatment options for the near future.

### Interventions for preventing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section [^12d249f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms which are experienced commonly during caesarean section under regional anaesthesia and in the postoperative period. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions versus placebo or no intervention given prophylactically to prevent nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (16 April 2020), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of studies and conference abstracts, and excluded quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. Our primary outcomes are intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Data entry was checked. Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Eighty-four studies (involving 10,990 women) met our inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine studies, involving 8928 women, contributed data. Most studies involved women undergoing elective caesarean section. Many studies were small with unclear risk of bias and sometimes few events. The overall certainty of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate to very low. 5-HT 3 antagonists: We found intraoperative nausea may be reduced by 5-HT 3 antagonists (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.71, 12 studies, 1419 women, low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in intraoperative vomiting but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.73, 11 studies, 1414 women, very low-certainty evidence). There is probably a reduction in postoperative nausea (aRR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, 10 studies, 1340 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and these drugs may show a reduction in postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.69, 10 studies, 1450 women, low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists: We found dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative nausea but the evidence is very uncertain (aRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.52, 15 studies, 1180 women, very low-certainty evidence). Dopamine antagonists may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.60, 12 studies, 942 women, low-certainty evidence) and postoperative nausea (aRR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79, 7 studies, 601 women, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if dopamine antagonists reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92, 9 studies, 860 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids (steroids): We are uncertain if intraoperative nausea is reduced by corticosteroids (aRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence) similarly for intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.87, 6 studies, 609 women, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids probably reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.73, 6 studies, 733 women, moderate-certainty evidence), and may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, 7 studies, 793 women, low-certainty evidence). Antihistamines: Antihistamines may have little to no effect on intraoperative nausea (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.11, 1 study, 149 women, very low-certainty evidence) or intraoperative vomiting (no events in the one study of 149 women). Antihistamines may reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.64, 4 studies, 514 women, low-certainty evidence), however, we are uncertain whether antihistamines reduce postoperative vomiting (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81, 3 studies, 333 women, very low-certainty evidence). Anticholinergics: Anticholinergics may reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, 4 studies, 453 women, low-certainty evidence) but may have little to no effect on intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.54, 4 studies; 453 women, very low-certainty evidence). No studies looked at anticholinergics in postoperative nausea, but they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 1 study, 161 women, low-certainty evidence). Sedatives: We found that sedatives probably reduce intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.82, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence) and intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.52, 8 studies, 593 women, moderate-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain whether sedatives reduce postoperative nausea (aRR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.71, 2 studies, 145 women, very low-certainty evidence) and they may reduce postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.28, 2 studies, 145 women, low-certainty evidence). Opioid antagonists: There were no studies assessing intraoperative nausea or vomiting. Opioid antagonists may result in little or no difference to the number of women having postoperative nausea (aRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.45, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 1.25, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.43, 1 study, 120 women, low-certainty evidence). Acupressure: It is uncertain whether acupressure/acupuncture reduces intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.74, 9 studies, 1221 women, very low-certainty evidence). Acupressure may reduce intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80, 9 studies, 1221 women, low-certainty evidence) but it is uncertain whether it reduces postoperative nausea (aRR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence) or postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.79, 7 studies, 1069 women, very low-certainty evidence). Ginger: It is uncertain whether ginger makes any difference to the number of women having intraoperative nausea (aRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.21, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), intraoperative vomiting (aRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.00, 2 studies, 331 women, very low-certainty evidence), postoperative nausea (aRR 0.63, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.77, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence) and postoperative vomiting (aRR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.65, 1 study, 92 women, very low-certainty evidence). Few studies assessed our secondary outcomes including adverse effects or women's views.

Authors' Conclusions

This review indicates that 5-HT 3 antagonists, dopamine antagonists, corticosteroids, sedatives and acupressure probably or possibly have efficacy in reducing nausea and vomiting in women undergoing regional anaesthesia for caesarean section. However the certainty of evidence varied widely and was generally low. Future research is needed to assess side effects of treatment, women's views and to compare the efficacy of combinations of different medications.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: an obstetric syndrome [^da3d4501]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Although the cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not known, there is strong evidence linking human chorionic gonadoptropin or estrogens. Evidence is presented to show that the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is linked to temporal and pathologic alterations in these hormones during pregnancy. The way in which the pregnant woman responds to the primary stimulus to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy appears to depend on her susceptibility mediated by vestibular, gastrointestinal, olfactory, and behavioral pathways. Conceiving of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as a syndrome suggests new pathways of investigation and possible therapies.

### Prevalence and associated factors of intraoperative nausea and vomiting of mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis; 2023 [^77b1de50]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study setting, data source, and search strategies

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled prevalence and associated factors of IONV among mothers who gave birth with CS under regional anesthesia. Potential studies were identified with three phases. Initially searching with major databases like PubMed/MEDLINE, Hinari, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE/Science Direct was done with searching terms of "(Magnitude) OR (Prevalence) OR (Incidence) AND (associated factors) OR (predictors) OR (determinants) OR (risk factors) AND (intraoperative nausea and vomiting) AND (cesarean section) OR (Cesarean delivery) OR (Parturients) OR (Mothers) AND (spinal anesthesia) OR (regional anesthesia) OR (neuraxial anesthesia)". In the second phase, searching with these databases was done with another searching phrase like "Intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia". In the third phase of the search process, cross references of all included studies with full text after appraisal was done with Google Scholar and google search. A grey literature search was done to identify Research and Trial registers, theses/dissertations, organizations/websites, data – statistics, circulars, and reports. The search result was filtered with free full text, human species, English language, and published within 10 years. In addition, grey literature was searched with the search phrases "Magnitude/prevalence/incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia" so as not to miss important articles. The search was done on 10–12/12/2023. The topic was checked for duplication in the PROSPERO and it is registered in the PROSPERO with the registration number of CRD42023495124. This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

Research questions

The research questions that this systematic review and meta-analysis answered are;

What is the pooled prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting for mothers who gave birth with cesarean section under regional anesthesia?
What is/are the determinant factors that affect the prevalence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean section?

We used the PEO (Population: All parturient; Exposures - Surgery/cesarean section, spinal Anesthesia; and Outcomes - intraoperative nausea and vomiting, determinant factors) approach to include and exclude studies to answer the research questions.

### Multidisciplinary team efforts to improve the pregnancy outcome of pregnancy complicated with primary hyperparathyroidism: case series from a single hospital [^3625916b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no consensus or management algorithm for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in pregnancy.

Methods

This study comprises a retrospective case series. From August 2014 to December 2020, 9 cases of PHPT in pregnancy were diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultation center of obstetrics in our hospital. Their clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and maternal and infant outcomes were analyzed.

Results

The median onset age of the patients was 32 (25~38) years. PHPT was diagnosed in two cases before pregnancy, in six cases during pregnancy and in one case postpartum. The main clinical manifestations were nausea, vomiting, and other nonspecific symptoms, with anemia as the most common maternal complication. Hypercalcemia crisis was developed in one case. The median levels of preoperative serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were 3.08 (2.77~4.21) mmol/L and 300.40 (108.80~2603.60) pg/ml, respectively. The parathyroid ultrasonography tests were positive in eight cases and negative in one patient who had an ectopic lesion localized by 99m Tc-MIBI. Parathyroidectomy was conducted in 7 cases during the 2nd trimester, including 2 patients diagnosed before pregnancy who refused surgery, 1 patient during the 1st trimester, and 1 patient postpartum, with a significant reduction in serum concentrations of calcium and PTH. A management algorithm was developed.

Conclusion

This case series suggests that pregnant women with PHPT should be managed by MDT according to the algorithm. If PHPT is confirmed in fertile women before pregnancy, parathyroidectomy should be strongly suggested and performed. If PHPT is diagnosed during pregnancy, even in its mild form, surgical treatment, optimally during the 2nd trimester, is effective and safe for pregnancy and neonatal outcome.

### Pain management for postpartum pain: a narrative review [^dc623e40]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Postpartum pain is highly prevalent, diverse in presentation, and exerts a broad impact on women's health. It manifests not only as acute pain, such as incisional or perineal pain, but also as chronic or persistent pain, imposing a sustained burden on maternal physical and mental well-being and overall quality of life. Epidemiological data reveal substantial variation in the incidence of different pain types, yet the overall burden remains considerable. Although recent advances have been made in assessment tools, mechanistic studies, and therapeutic approaches, multimodal management strategies that combine pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have only gradually become a clinical trend. Current practice continues to face major challenges, including a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, insufficient identification of risk factors, and limited implementation of individualized interventions. Future research priorities should include: (1) establishing standardized, multidimensional systems for pain assessment and classification; (2) further elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying different types of postpartum pain; and (3) developing evidence-based, comprehensive management pathways with optimized integration of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Collectively, these efforts may enable earlier identification and more precise interventions for postpartum pain, ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^70e46ab0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy definition, incidence, severity assessment, and hyperemesis gravidarum: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is common with "prevalence rates for nausea of 50–80% and for vomiting and retching of 50%", and "recurrence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy with subsequent pregnancies ranges from 15–81%". Severity has been categorized by daily duration and frequency, assessing "the duration of nausea and vomiting each day (from less than 1 hour in mild cases to more than 6 hours in severe cases)" and "the amount of vomiting and retching per day (up to two times for mild and moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and more than five times in severe cases)". A validated "pregnancy-unique quantification of emesis and nausea (PUQE) assesses the severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy during the first trimester", and "scores from the PUQE index are associated with quality of life measurements", supporting clinical utility. Regarding timing of care, "Early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be beneficial to prevent progression to hyperemesis gravidarum". For hyperemesis gravidarum, "No single accepted definition of hyperemesis gravidarum exists", it "is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion", and commonly cited criteria include "persistent vomiting", "usually large ketonuria", and weight loss "most often at least 5% of prepregnancy weight"; epidemiologically, it "appears to represent the extreme end of the spectrum of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy".

Clinical PONV protocols and algorithms — risk assessment and individualized management — include the recommendation that PONV management protocols or algorithms should make it clear that the individual's risk of PONV should be assessed to identify the high-risk patients who may require additional prophylaxis, and that in addition to the patient's risk the management strategy should take into account patient's choice, cost-effectiveness at the institution, and preexisting conditions such as the risk of prolonged QT, Parkinson, and closed-angle glaucoma.

### Interventions for treating hyperemesis gravidarum [^a1c89886]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy affecting 0.3% to 1.0% of pregnancies, and is one of the most common indications for hospitalization during pregnancy. While a previous Cochrane review examined interventions for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, there has not yet been a review examining the interventions for the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety, of all interventions for hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnancy up to 20 weeks' gestation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register and the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (20 December 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of any intervention for hyperemesis gravidarum. Quasi-randomized trials and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion. We excluded trials on nausea and vomiting of pregnancy that were not specifically studying the more severe condition of hyperemesis gravidarum.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed the eligibility of trials, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (involving 2052 women) met the inclusion criteria but the majority of 18 different comparisons described in the review include data from single studies with small numbers of participants. The comparisons covered a range of interventions including acupressure/acupuncture, outpatient care, intravenous fluids, and various pharmaceutical interventions. The methodological quality of included studies was mixed. For selected important comparisons and outcomes, we graded the quality of the evidence and created 'Summary of findings' tables. For most outcomes the evidence was graded as low or very low quality mainly due to the imprecision of effect estimates. Comparisons included in the 'Summary of findings' tables are described below, the remaining comparisons are described in detail in the main text. No primary outcome data were available when acupuncture was compared with placebo, There was no clear evidence of differences between groups for anxiodepressive symptoms (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.40; one study, 36 women, very low-quality evidence), spontaneous abortion (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.03; one study, 57 women, low-quality evidence), preterm birth (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.26; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence), or perinatal death (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04 to 8.30; one study, 36 women, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to identify clear differences between acupuncture and metoclopramide in a study with 81 participants regarding reduction/cessation in nausea or vomiting (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.49 and RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.48, respectively; very low-quality evidence). In a study with 92 participants, women taking vitamin B6 had a slightly longer hospital stay compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 0.80 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference in other outcomes including mean number of episodes of emesis (MD 0.50, 95% CI -0.40 to 1.40, low-quality evidence) or side effects. A comparison between metoclopramide and ondansetron identified no clear difference in the severity of nausea or vomiting (MD 1.70, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.55, and MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.63 to 1.43; one study, 83 women, respectively, very low-quality evidence). However, more women taking metoclopramide complained of drowsiness and dry mouth (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 4.69, and RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 5.11, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other side effects. In a single study with 146 participants comparing metoclopramide with promethazine, more women taking promethazine reported drowsiness, dizziness, and dystonia (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.69, and RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90, respectively, moderate-quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for other important outcomes including quality of life and other side effects. In a single trial with 30 women, those receiving ondansetron had no difference in duration of hospital admission compared to those receiving promethazine (MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.39 to 1.39, very low-quality evidence), although there was increased sedation with promethazine (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.94, low-quality evidence). Regarding corticosteroids, in a study with 110 participants there was no difference in days of hospital admission compared to placebo (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.70 to 0.10; very low-quality evidence), but there was a decreased readmission rate (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94; four studies, 269 women). For other important outcomes including pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and congenital abnormalities, there was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups (very low-quality evidence for all outcomes). In other single studies there were no clear differences between groups for preterm birth or side effects (very low-quality evidence). For hydrocortisone compared with metoclopramide, no data were available for primary outcomes and there was no difference in the readmission rate (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.28; one study, 40 women). In a study with 80 women, compared to promethazine, those receiving prednisolone had increased nausea at 48 hours (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.72; low-quality evidence), but not at 17 days (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.15, very low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the number of episodes of emesis or subjective improvement in nausea/vomiting. There was insufficient evidence to identify differences between groups for stillbirth and neonatal death and preterm birth.

Authors' Conclusions

On the basis of this review, there is little high-quality and consistent evidence supporting any one intervention, which should be taken into account when making management decisions. There was also very limited reporting on the economic impact of hyperemesis gravidarum and the impact that interventions may have. The limitations in interpreting the results of the included studies highlights the importance of consistency in the definition of hyperemesis gravidarum, the use of validated outcome measures, and the need for larger placebo-controlled trials.

In instances where standard dietary and lifestyle measures fail to control symptoms, timely pharmacological intervention may be warranted. Pharmacological antiemetic therapy is still used with great caution by some patients and health care providers to treat NVP and is erroneously considered to be contraindicated in pregnancy. However, substantial evidence supports the safety and efficacy of specific antiemetics, such as pyridoxine-doxylamine, antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, meclizine), phenothiazines (e.g. promethazine), and ondansetron, when used appropriately.

Beyond pharmacological management, dietary and lifestyle modifications play a significant role in alleviating symptoms. Encouraging patients to consume small, frequent meals with an emphasis on protein rather than fats and carbohydrates while avoiding strong odors, greasy foods, and overly sweet items can help reduce nausea. Proper hydration strategies should also be emphasized, including separating liquid intake from solid meals to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort. For women requiring intravenous hydration, normal saline (0.9% NaCl) with added potassium chloride is recommended, with administration guided by daily electrolyte monitoring. In cases where a single antiemetic is ineffective, a combination of agents should be considered.

### Treatment of nausea in pregnancy: a cross-sectional multinational web-based study of pregnant women and new mothers [^e96bd8eb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is one of the most common pregnancy-related complaints, affecting millions of pregnant women worldwide each year. Approximately 7 out of 10 women experience nausea during pregnancy and 50% experience both nausea and vomiting. For most patients, symptoms appear around the sixth week of pregnancy and gradually decline during the second trimester, peaking at 8–13 weeks. However, 10% of women will still experience symptoms after 20–22 weeks of pregnancy. The most severe form of NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum, is characterised by severe and persistent nausea and vomiting leading to weight loss, ketonuria, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, often so severe as merits hospitalisation, and affects about 1.1% of the pregnant women.

NVP has been shown to greatly impact a woman's life, negatively affecting daily activities, relationship with partner, parenting, occupation and social functioning. Feelings of isolation, fatigue, depression, and helplessness due to nausea have also been described. Nausea has been reported to be responsible for 33% of all sick leave during pregnancy. In the USA and Canada, NVP is a significant economic burden to women and society.

Because NVP is often most intense during the first trimester when organogenesis occurs, teratogenic effects are a concern in treatment. This may lead to caution in prescribing and taking conventional medicines to treat this condition, despite the proven safety of use during pregnancy of many medicines. Pregnant women often overestimate the teratogenic risk associated with the use of medicines in general. Consequently, many women may turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to alleviate their symptoms or choose to not treat their symptoms due to the fear that taking anything during pregnancy may harm the baby. Despite the high prevalence of NVP, little is known about differences in NVP treatments, i.e. conventional and herbal medicines, across countries. An informal survey in various European countries in 1998 found wide variations in the types of treatment used against mild and moderate nausea and vomiting, whereas hyperemesis gravidarum was treated in a similar fashion in the vast majority of countries.

### Managing hyperemesis gravidarum: a multimodal challenge [^6666abe0]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

About 50% - 90% of all pregnancies are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. According to a study of more than 360 pregnant women, only 2% experienced only nausea in the morning whereas, in 80%, complaints persisted throughout the day. The condition is usually self-limiting and peaks at around 9 weeks gestation. At 20 weeks symptoms typically cease. However, in up to 20% of cases, nausea and vomiting may continue until delivery.

This condition is known as nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) or emesis gravidarum and is of no pathological significance as long as the affected women do not feel unwell or restricted in their daily life. There are, however, different grades in the scope of NVP, which range from occasional morning-sickness to excessive vomiting that persists throughout the day. The most severe grade of NVP often leads to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG; see below), but it can be difficult to differentiate between the two conditions.

A prospective study of more than 9000 pregnant women showed that NVP occurred significantly more often in primigravidas and in women who were less educated, younger, non-smokers and overweight or obese. The incidence of NVP was also higher in women with a history of nausea and vomiting in a previous pregnancy.

In order to exclude differential diagnoses the following crucial parameters should be investigated: Onset of nausea and vomiting (nearly all of the cases begin before 9 weeks of gestation), attendant symptoms, underlying chronic disorders or, in rare cases, hereditary diseases (see Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting.

Figure 2
Differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting in respect to abdominal symptoms.

A small percentage of pregnant women experience a severe form of nausea and vomiting that is termed HG (synonym: excessive vomiting during pregnancy). This disorder has an estimated incidence of 0.5% - 2% of all live births. A standard definition of HG is the occurrence of more than three episodes of vomiting per day with ketonuria and more than 3 kg or 5% weight loss. However, the diagnosis is usually made clinically following the exclusion of other causes.

### Treatments for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy… [^df479724]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

No one knows exactly why nausea and vomiting occur during pregnancy, but the symptoms are very common and experienced by more than 85% of pregnant women. The term "morning sickness" is not entirely accurate, as most women have symptoms throughout the day. The symptoms can range from mild to severe, sometimes even requiring hospitalization due to weight loss and dehydration. Hyperemesis gravidarum, the most severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, affects up to 3% of pregnant women. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting are usually worse during early pregnancy. Most women feel better after the fourth or fifth month, but some can have symptoms through the entire pregnancy. Because there is no clear cause for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, the focus of treatment is on reducing the severity of symptoms. The first approach is to prevent symptoms by changing the diet.

For example, it may help to eat foods that are bland, dry, and high in carbohydrates or protein and to avoid foods with strong flavors or odors. It also helps to eat smaller, more frequent meals and to eat before feeling hungry, because an empty stomach can worsen symptoms. Sipping cold fluids and sucking on ice chips can also help. However, if dietary changes are not enough, a variety of over-the-counter and prescription treatments are available. The October 4, 2016, issue of JAMA includes an article that discusses several of these treatment options that have been studied. Overall, the studies done on this topic have not been of the highest quality; therefore, it is hard to say how well each treatment works. The options discussed below have been shown to have at least some benefit, but more high-quality research is needed.

Over-the-counter remedies that have been shown to be useful for mild nausea and vomiting during pregnancy include Ginger Vitamin B6 Acupressure Prescription medications that have been shown to be useful for moderate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy include Vitamin B6/doxylamine combination. Antihistamines Dopamine antagonists Serotonin antagonists Corticosteroids have been used in hyperemesis gravidarum and other severe cases of nausea and vomiting, but their use has not been well studied, and their benefit is not well established.
