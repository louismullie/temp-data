## Question

Proteinuria treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about proteinuria treatment, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming and quantifying proteinuria and establishing baseline risk. Then, I should verify first-line foundational therapies, especially RAAS blockade and blood pressure targets. Next, I will consider second-line add-on therapies for residual proteinuria, including SGLT2 inhibitors, MRAs, and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. After that, I need to check disease-specific immunosuppressive strategies for IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis. I will then examine lifestyle and supportive measures, monitoring and response targets, special populations, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm while acknowledging controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach and baseline risk stratification, because treatment intensity hinges on accurate quantification and etiology. I should double-check that spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio is acceptable for screening, but when immunosuppression is contemplated or the clinical picture changes, a 24-hour urine collection is preferred to quantify total protein excretion and guide therapy decisions, especially in glomerular disease [^114ZHmzt]. Hold on, I should verify that in IgA nephropathy, proteinuria and eGFR are the principal validated prognostic biomarkers, with time-averaged proteinuria strongly predicting kidney failure risk, which justifies aggressive proteinuria lowering as a therapeutic goal [^1157fZev]. I need to ensure I also consider the underlying cause using the CGA framework and, when indicated, pursue biopsy or precision diagnostics to refine diagnosis and tailor therapy, particularly in glomerular diseases where histology changes management [^115Z7uh4].

> Next, I should review foundational therapy, and I need to ensure RAAS blockade is prioritized. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line in patients with CKD and albuminuria or proteinuria because they reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression beyond blood pressure effects, and contemporary guidelines continue to endorse them as core therapy in this setting [^115p2tMG] [^115LuDKt]. Wait, let me verify dosing strategy: in proteinuric IgA nephropathy, KDIGO suggests titrating ACEi/ARB as tolerated to achieve proteinuria less than 1 g/day, which operationalizes proteinuria as a therapeutic target in this disease [^116totNX]. I should confirm that dual ACEi+ARB is not recommended due to increased risks of AKI and hyperkalemia, so I must avoid that combination despite theoretical additive antiproteinuric effects [^111nKzxh].

> I will now examine blood pressure targets, and I should double-check the evolving evidence. Historically, a target of less than 130/80 mmHg has been used in CKD with albuminuria, and ESC 2024 still emphasizes RAS blockers to reduce albuminuria in hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria or proteinuria, supporting a lower BP target in proteinuric CKD [^115p2tMG]. But wait, what if I overstate the target? KDIGO 2021 suggested a systolic BP goal less than 120 mmHg based on cardiovascular data, yet this has been controversial and not uniformly adopted; recent expert reviews emphasize individualized targets and shared decision-making, especially given limited representation of advanced CKD in target trials and concerns about renal adverse events at very low BP [^1141zur6] [^115XSWZi]. I should confirm that in children with CKD and proteinuria, age- and height-adjusted BP targets below the 50th percentile are suggested when feasible, with ACEi/ARB preferred when pharmacotherapy is indicated [^113itK6P].

> For patients with persistent proteinuria despite optimized RAAS blockade, I need to consider second-line agents, and SGLT2 inhibitors are high on the list. Let me verify the magnitude of albuminuria reduction: meta-analyses show about a 25% mean reduction in albuminuria with SGLT2 inhibitors, with larger effects at higher baseline albuminuria, and large outcome trials demonstrate robust kidney protection irrespective of diabetes status, supporting their use as foundational therapy in CKD with albuminuria [^112Pf8eo] [^11689eE4]. Hold on, I should verify that guideline evolution now positions SGLT2 inhibitors alongside RAS blockade as first-line kidney-protective therapy in many patients with CKD, which is reflected in contemporary summaries of the treatment paradigm [^115eowUj].

> I should also review mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as add-on therapy for residual proteinuria, but I need to weigh benefits against risks. Cochrane reviews indicate that adding spironolactone or eplerenone to ACEi/ARB further reduces proteinuria and lowers blood pressure, yet increases hyperkalemia and, with nonselective agents, gynaecomastia; long-term hard renal outcomes remain uncertain due to small, short studies [^116SUhnT] [^115HRjnS]. Let me reconsider: finerenone, a nonsteroidal MRA, has shown kidney and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic CKD and is increasingly used as the preferred MRA when proteinuria persists despite RAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibition, aligning with the current paradigm shift [^115eowUj].

> Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be considered when proteinuria persists and dual RAS blockade is avoided, but I should confirm their role is modest. Evidence suggests verapamil or diltiazem can reduce proteinuria, particularly in diabetic kidney disease, though they do not consistently improve hard renal outcomes and should be positioned after RAAS blockade and SGLT2 inhibitors in most patients [^116Ejx5N]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought nondihydropyridine CCBs might substitute for RAS blockade in intolerance, but I should clarify that they are better viewed as adjuncts rather than replacements for RAAS blockade in proteinuric CKD [^116w15cV].

> Now, I need to check disease-specific immunosuppressive strategies for IgA nephropathy. For patients with proteinuria 1 g/day or more despite optimized supportive care, a short course of systemic corticosteroids probably reduces ESKD risk and increases complete remission, though adverse effects and heterogeneity across trials necessitate careful selection and counseling [^115GBSQf]. Hold on, I should verify the threshold for considering therapy: KDIGO 2025 suggests considering treatment or additional treatment in IgAN when proteinuria is at least 0.5 g/day, which lowers the historical bar and broadens eligibility for intervention, including consideration of newer targeted therapies in high-risk patients [^116hNJN4]. I should also confirm that proteinuria reduction is an accepted surrogate for kidney failure risk in IgAN, enabling accelerated approval frameworks contingent on confirmatory outcomes, which underpins modern trial design and regulatory strategy [^1168xpAV] [^112FQAqp].

> For lupus nephritis, I will now examine response targets and escalation rules, and I need to ensure I align with current rheumatology and nephrology guidance. EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommends aiming for at least a 25% proteinuria reduction by 3 months and at least 50% by 6 months, with a complete response defined as proteinuria less than 0.5 g/g and stabilization of kidney function within 6 to 12 months, which operationalizes early decision points for switching or intensifying therapy [^1122H1mn]. Let me double-check monitoring cadence: ACR 2024 advises quantifying proteinuria every 3 months until sustained remission, then every 3 to 6 months, and measuring complement and anti-dsDNA at each visit to detect flares, while avoiding preemptive treatment solely on serologies without clinical correlation [^115b2a74] [^111iVaDB]. I should confirm biopsy indications, including new proteinuria above 0.5 g/g with otherwise unexplained kidney dysfunction and repeat biopsy for nonresponders or suspected flares, which helps distinguish activity from chronicity and guides immunosuppressive choices [^1167HxwM].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and supportive measures that synergize with pharmacologic therapy. Sodium restriction to less than 2.3 g/day reduces proteinuria and potentiates the antiproteinuric effects of RAAS blockade, and I need to ensure patients receive practical dietary counseling to achieve this target [^111kt87B]. Let me verify protein intake: a moderate protein intake around 0.8 g/kg/day is reasonable in non-dialysis CKD, balancing nutritional needs with the potential hemodynamic and metabolic benefits of avoiding excess protein load [^113ys8KY]. I should confirm that structured exercise is safe and may modestly improve proteinuria, though intensity and mechanisms require further study, so I recommend at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity as tolerated [^111JxndQ] [^113ys8KY]. Hold on, I should verify vitamin D guidance: in CKD with nephrotic-range proteinuria, it is reasonable to replete 25-hydroxyvitamin D when deficient, though this is consensus-based and should be individualized [^113BeSo7].

> I need to ensure monitoring is structured and response-adapted. Let me first confirm that in active glomerular disease, proteinuria should be checked every 1 to 3 months initially, then spaced out once a downward trend is established, with 24-hour collections used when treatment decisions hinge on precise quantification or when spot results are discordant with the clinical picture [^114ZHmzt]. For IgAN, I should target proteinuria less than 1 g/day and, ideally, less than 0.5 g/day if achievable, recognizing that reaching these thresholds correlates with substantially lower long-term risk of kidney failure, which justifies therapy intensification if targets are not met [^114e5kwD] [^1157fZev]. In diabetic kidney disease, I should confirm that failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude clinical benefit, but the magnitude of albuminuria reduction tracks with improved renal and cardiovascular outcomes in observational analyses, reinforcing the value of persistent efforts to lower proteinuria [^11547n5p].

> Special populations require tailored approaches, and I should double-check each. In children with CKD and proteinuria, ACEi/ARB are preferred antihypertensives and BP targets should generally be at or below the 50th percentile for age, sex, and height when feasible, with careful attention to growth and development [^113itK6P]. In sickle cell disease, I need to ensure early initiation of ACEi for microalbuminuria or proteinuria even with normal blood pressure, given the high risk of renal complications and potential for benefit [^111PQhKh] [^113qEJRb]. In kidney transplant recipients, persistent or new proteinuria warrants evaluation for allograft pathology and RAS blockade is appropriate, though effects on graft survival are less certain and biopsy may be indicated when proteinuria exceeds 1 g/day on repeated measurements [^112NmbuH] [^notfound].

> I should also consider drug-induced proteinuria and iatrogenic contributors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as pazopanib can cause proteinuria and even nephrotic syndrome, mandating baseline and periodic urinalysis with dose reduction or discontinuation based on severity, so I need to check medication lists carefully and manage proactively [^1134DkdF] [^1142rXRU]. But wait, I should verify that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like amlodipine can worsen edema and may increase proteinuria in some settings; if proteinuria rises after their initiation, I should consider substitution before escalating immunosuppression, and I must reinforce sick-day rules for ACEi/ARB and diuretics to prevent hemodynamic AKI during volume depletion [^115phxWh].

> Let me synthesize a practical treatment algorithm while keeping the evidence caveats in mind. Start with confirmatory quantification of proteinuria and etiologic assessment, initiate ACEi or ARB and titrate to maximally tolerated doses with attention to potassium and creatinine, target BP less than 130/80 mmHg while individualizing to tolerance and comorbidity, and layer in SGLT2 inhibition for additional antiproteinuric and kidney-protective effects if eGFR is adequate and hyperkalemia risk is acceptable [^115p2tMG] [^115LuDKt] [^112Pf8eo]. If proteinuria remains above 1 g/day or above 0.5 g/day in high-risk phenotypes, consider adding a nonsteroidal MRA such as finerenone, and in selected cases a nondihydropyridine CCB, while avoiding dual ACEi+ARB and reassessing for reversible drivers or adverse effects if proteinuria fails to decline by 25 to 50% within 3 to 6 months [^115eowUj] [^116Ejx5N]. For IgAN with proteinuria at least 0.5 g/day despite optimized supportive care, consider corticosteroids or approved targeted therapies in appropriate risk contexts, and for lupus nephritis, escalate or switch immunosuppression if early proteinuria reduction milestones are not met, guided by serologies and, when indicated, repeat biopsy [^116hNJN4] [^115GBSQf] [^1122H1mn] [^1167HxwM].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and close with a balanced perspective. Proteinuria reduction is a validated surrogate for kidney failure risk in IgAN and correlates with slowed eGFR loss, but it is not universally accepted as a definitive surrogate across all CKD etiologies, so confirmatory outcome trials remain essential and clinical judgment must integrate disease-specific nuances and patient preferences [^1168xpAV] [^112FQAqp] [^111tsMND]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about BP targets either; while lower BP and RAAS blockade are foundational, the optimal systolic target remains debated, and an individualized approach with shared decision-making is prudent until more representative trial data emerge [^1141zur6] [^115XSWZi].

---

Proteinuria treatment centers on **RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitors or ARBs** as first-line therapy [^112qNFFM], with SGLT2 inhibitors added for diabetic or nondiabetic CKD with albuminuria [^11689eE4] [^112Pf8eo]. Target blood pressure is **< 130/80 mmHg** [^115p2tMG] [^115LuDKt]; use loop diuretics for edema and sodium restriction to < 2 g/day to enhance antiproteinuric effects [^115LuDKt] [^113ys8KY]. For IgA nephropathy, add corticosteroids if proteinuria remains ≥ 1 g/day despite RAAS blockade [^115GBSQf] [^116totNX]; for lupus nephritis, use immunosuppression per disease class and activity [^1154m3Wk] [^116ihn3H]. Monitor renal function and potassium closely, and refer to nephrology for persistent proteinuria > 1 g/day or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^112yEMN8].

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapy: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade

- **ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: First-line for CKD with proteinuria [^116w15cV]; reduce proteinuria and slow progression independent of blood pressure [^117Ds6Xq] [^113rVTSC].

- **Blood pressure target**: Aim for < 130/80 mmHg [^114BHbPZ]; lower targets may be considered if tolerated [^117Corcw].

- **Combination therapy**: Avoid ACEi + ARB due to increased risk of hyperkalemia and AKI [^notfound].

---

### Second-line therapy: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g. dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression in diabetic and nondiabetic patients [^11689eE4] [^112Pf8eo]. They are **recommended for CKD with albuminuria**, especially if diabetic [^115eowUj].

---

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)

MRAs (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, finerenone) further reduce proteinuria when added to ACEi/ARB [^116SUhnT] but increase hyperkalemia risk; **monitor potassium closely** [^115HRjnS].

---

### Additional antihypertensive agents

- **Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (NDHP-CCBs)**: Consider if proteinuria persists despite RAAS blockade; modest antiproteinuric effect [^116Ejx5N].

- **Loop diuretics**: Use for edema/volume overload; monitor electrolytes and renal function [^115LuDKt].

---

## Disease-specific immunosuppressive therapies

### IgA nephropathy

In IgA nephropathy, **corticosteroids** are indicated for proteinuria ≥ 1 g/day despite RAAS blockade [^115GBSQf] [^111Z2sJG]; they reduce proteinuria and slow progression. Immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide are reserved for **high-risk or progressive disease** [^111Z2sJG].

---

### Lupus nephritis

In lupus nephritis, **immunosuppression** should be guided by disease class and activity (e.g. mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) [^1154m3Wk] [^114dm3w4]. Response targets include achieving **proteinuria < 0.5 g/day** with stabilized renal function [^1166aJ8B].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day enhances antiproteinuric effects of RAAS blockade [^111kt87B] [^113ys8KY].

- **Protein intake**: 0.8 g/kg/day for non-dialysis CKD; avoid excessive restriction [^113ys8KY] [^112yEMN8].

- **Weight management**: Achieve healthy BMI to reduce proteinuria and cardiovascular risk.

- **Smoking cessation**: Reduces proteinuria and slows CKD progression.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Renal function and electrolytes**: Monitor serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium regularly, especially after initiating or adjusting RAAS blockade or MRAs [^notfound].

- **Proteinuria assessment**: Use spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour collection for quantification [^115b2a74].

- **Referral to nephrology**: Persistent proteinuria > 1 g/day or eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² warrants specialist evaluation [^112yEMN8].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **endothelin receptor antagonists** (e.g. atrasentan), which are under investigation for residual proteinuria in diabetic CKD, and **anti-inflammatory agents** targeting complement and cytokine pathways, which are being explored for glomerular diseases with proteinuria [^115eowUj].

---

Proteinuria management requires a **multimodal approach**: RAAS blockade as foundation, with SGLT2 inhibitors, MRAs, and immunosuppression added based on cause and severity, plus lifestyle measures and close monitoring to preserve renal function and reduce cardiovascular risk [^112qNFFM].

### Early change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression: an individual patient meta-analysis [^111DTC1u]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is controversial whether proteinuria is a valid surrogate end point for randomized trials in chronic kidney disease.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data.

Setting & Population

Individual patient data for 9,008 patients from 32 randomized trials evaluating 5 intervention types.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials of kidney disease progression until 2007 with measurements of proteinuria both at baseline and during the first year of follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Predictor

Early change in proteinuria.

Outcomes

Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results

Early decline in proteinuria was associated with lower risk of the clinical outcome (pooled HR, 0.74 per 50% reduction in proteinuria); this association was stronger at higher levels of baseline proteinuria. Pooled estimates for the proportion of treatment effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria ranged from -7.0% (95%CI, -40.6% to 26.7%) to 43.9% (95%CI, 25.3% to 62.6%) across 5 intervention types. The direction of the pooled treatment effects on early change in proteinuria agreed with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical outcome for all 5 intervention types, with the magnitudes of the pooled treatment effects on the 2 end points agreeing for 4 of the 5 intervention types. The pooled treatment effects on both end points were simultaneously stronger at higher levels of proteinuria. However, statistical power was insufficient to determine whether differences in treatment effects on the clinical outcome corresponded to differences in treatment effects on proteinuria between individual studies.

Limitations

Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many chronic kidney disease clinical trials.

Conclusions

These results provide new evidence supporting the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point, but do not provide sufficient evidence to establish its validity in all settings.

### Proteinuria as a surrogate end point – more data are needed [^111tsMND]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Surrogate end points have the potential to facilitate drug development because effects on surrogate end points can sometimes be demonstrated more rapidly and in smaller studies than can effects on clinical outcomes of interest. Proteinuria has been repeatedly proposed as a surrogate end point for renal outcomes in drug development; however, the FDA has generally not accepted effects on proteinuria as evidence of a drug's effectiveness. Proteinuria is an early marker of some kidney diseases and increases in proteinuria can predict risk of disease progression. Whether or not treatment effects on proteinuria can reliably predict treatment effects on renal outcomes is not known. Nevertheless, it may be reasonable to use effects on proteinuria as a basis for accelerated approval of a drug if certain conditions are met. Approval under this pathway carries with it a requirement to complete a study after drug approval that verifies the anticipated treatment benefit.

### What are the right endpoints to assess the effectiveness of new treatments for IgAN? [^111UCdV4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

IgA nephropathy is a glomerular disease associated with a rapid estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline especially in the presence of severe proteinuria. The change in proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope are accepted surrogate endpoints in clinical trials to establish the efficacy of new interventions for patients with IgA nephropathy. Proteinuria is an established surrogate marker for disease progression with higher levels correlating with worse long-term outcomes. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that treatment effects on proteinuria over 6 to 9 months correlate with treatment effects on eGFR slope. The eGFR slope, particularly over two to three years, provides an indicator of renal function decline and long-term prognosis. Studies have demonstrated robust associations between treatment effects on eGFR slope and clinical kidney outcomes. Based on these studies, recent regulatory considerations support proteinuria change and eGFR slope as clinical trial endpoints for accelerated approval in IgA nephropathy trials, allowing for earlier assessment of treatment efficacy. Future trials can leverage these markers to streamline drug development, providing robust and timely evaluations of novel therapies. This review summarizes recent advances in the validation of clinical trial endpoints in IgA nephropathy and concludes with new developments in this area.

### Proteinuria as a therapeutic target in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116t3fAN]. American Journal of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients excreting large amounts of urinary protein, who are otherwise deemed to be optimally treated, should still be considered at high risk for renal disease progression. The observation that reductions in urinary protein excretion, in a graded fashion over a relatively short period of time, correlate with long-term preservation of renal function supports the idea of using urinary protein excretion as a guide to implementation of renoprotective therapies. The association between residual proteinuria and renal outcomes suggests that minimization of proteinuria is an important therapeutic goal in the management of proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients. This article reviews the evidence for using proteinuria as a target for the implementation of therapies shown to have renal protective effects.

### Should proteinuria reduction be the criterion for antihypertensive drug selection for patients with kidney disease? [^111RVuwX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proteinuria, that is, more than 200 mg/day of urinary albumin, is associated with the presence of kidney disease. Its increase over time is strongly correlated with progression of nephropathy. Retrospective analyses of nephropathy outcome trials show that proteinuria reduction of 30% or more after initiation of blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is associated with slower nephropathy progression than lowering BP without its reduction.

Recent Findings

Retrospective analyses of five large nephropathy outcome trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression slowed by an additional 28–39% over the control or placebo group when proteinuria was reduced in concert with BP. Two separate trials demonstrate that nephropathy progression was slowed to a lesser degree when BP was reduced to a similar degree, but proteinuria reduced less than 30%. These associations do not hold for those with microalbuminuria, in which BP reduction is the key element to slowing nephropathy progression. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials fail to show a relationship between reductions in proteinuria and nephropathy outcomes. This large cardiovascular endpoint trial, however, was not only powered for nephropathy outcomes but also failed to show a benefit between proteinuria reduction and cardiovascular events, a previously established observation.

Summary

All patients with a history of hypertension and either kidney disease or diabetes should have an annual check for albuminuria. If albumin is present in amounts of more than 200 mg/day, strategies for BP-lowering therapy should also focus on a reduction of more than 30% of urinary protein.

### Proteinuria: does vitamin D treatment improve outcomes in CKD? [^111vBDvp]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

In a meta-analysis of randomized trials, de Borst and colleagues report that vitamin D therapy reduces proteinuria and might also slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. In light of the limited options for renoprotective therapy, we evaluate whether this evidence for vitamin D treatment justifies a large, definitive trial.

### Emerging therapies for chronic kidney disease: what is their role? [^114FRDa9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. The best therapies currently available focus on the control of blood pressure and optimization of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade. Currently available agents are only partially effective against hard end points such as the development of end-stage renal disease and are not discussed in this Review. Many other agents have been shown to reduce proteinuria and delay progression in animal models of CKD. Some of these agents, including tranilast, sulodexide, thiazolidinediones, pentoxifylline, and inhibitors of advanced glycation end-products and protein kinase C, have been tested to a limited extent in humans. A small number of randomized controlled human trials of these agents have used surrogate markers such as proteinuria as end points rather than hard end points such as end-stage renal disease or doubling of serum creatinine level. Emerging therapies that specifically target and reverse pathological hallmarks of CKD such as inflammation, fibrosis and atrophy are needed to reduce the burden of this chronic disease and its associated morbidity. This Review examines the evidence for emerging pharmacological strategies for slowing the progression of CKD.

### Proteinuria and clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients [^115TLGYV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

This narrative review focuses on outcomes related to proteinuria in hypertension (HT), and also examines the role of current and future therapeutic strategies. Proteinuria is an independent marker of renal and cardiovascular (CV) disease in hypertensive populations, particularly in high-risk groups such as diabetic patients. Effective blood pressure (BP) control and proteinuria management are associated with significant improvements in the risk of key adverse outcomes, although a causative relationship needs careful assessment. Available antihypertensives have varying effects on proteinuria reduction. Drugs affecting the renin system offer antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects that are probably at least partially independent of their BP effects. Economic evaluations of these interventions confirm their cost-saving benefits relative to other antihypertensives, but outcomes-based research is needed in some settings.

### Management of glomerular proteinuria: a commentary [^113eh5sS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that proteinuria reduction is an appropriate therapeutic goal in chronic proteinuric kidney disease. Based on large randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT), ACE inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy have emerged as the most important antiproteinuric and renal protective interventions. However, there are numerous other interventions that have been shown to be antiproteinuric and, therefore, likely to be renoprotective. Unfortunately testing each of these antiproteinuric therapies in RCT is not feasible. The nephrologist has two choices: restrict antiproteinuric therapies to those shown to be effective in RCT or expand the use of antiproteinuric therapies to include those that, although unproven, are plausibly effective and prudent to use. The goal of this work is to provide the documentation needed for the nephrologist to choose between these strategies. This work describes 25 separate interventions that are either antiproteinuric or may block injurious mechanisms of proteinuria. Each intervention is assigned a level of recommendation (Level 1 is the highest; Level 3 is the lowest) according to the strength of the evidence supporting its antiproteinuric and renoprotective efficacy. Pathophysiologic mechanisms possibly involved are also discussed. The number of interventions at each level of recommendation are: Level 1, n = 7; Level 2, n = 9; Level 3, n = 9. Our experience indicates that we can achieve in most patients the majority of Level 1 and many of the Level 2 and 3 recommendations. We suggest that, until better information becomes available, a broad-based, multiple-risk factor intervention to reduce proteinuria can be justified in those with progressive nephropathies. This work is intended primarily for clinical nephrologists; therefore, each antiproteinuria intervention is described in practical detail.

### Meta-analysis: effect of monotherapy and combination therapy with inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system on proteinuria in renal disease [^117Ds6Xq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Reduction of proteinuria is associated with delayed progression of chronic kidney disease. Reports suggest that angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce proteinuria, but results are variable. The relative effect of ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and their combined administration, remains uncertain.

Purpose

To establish the effect of ARBs versus placebo and alternative treatments, and the effect of combined treatment with ARBs and ACE inhibitors, on proteinuria.

Data Sources

English-language studies in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1990 to September 2006), reference lists, and expert contacts.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of ARBs versus placebo, ACE inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers, or the combination of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with or without diabetes and with microalbuminuria or proteinuria for whom data were available on urinary protein excretion at baseline and at 1 to 12 months.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently searched and abstracted studies.

Data Synthesis

Forty-nine studies involving 6181 participants reported results of 72 comparisons with 1 to 4 months of follow-up and 38 comparisons with 5 to 12 months of follow-up. The ARBs reduced proteinuria compared with placebo or calcium-channel blockers over 1 to 4 months (ratio of means, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.68] and 0.69 [CI, 0.62 to 0.77], respectively) and 5 to 12 months (ratio of means, 0.66 [CI, 0.63 to 0.69] and 0.62 [CI, 0.55 to 0.70], respectively). The ARBs and ACE inhibitors reduced proteinuria to a similar degree. The combination of ARBs and ACE inhibitors further reduced proteinuria more than either agent alone: The ratio of means for combination therapy versus ARBs was 0.76 (CI, 0.68 to 0.85) over 1 to 4 months and 0.75 (CI, 0.61 to 0.92) over 5 to 12 months; for combination therapy versus ACE inhibitors, the ratio of means was 0.78 (CI, 0.72 to 0.84) over 1 to 4 months and 0.82 (CI, 0.67 to 1.01) over 5 to 12 months. The antiproteinuric effect was consistent across subgroups.

Limitations

Most studies were small, varied in quality, and did not provide reliable data on adverse drug reactions. Proteinuria reduction is only a surrogate for important progression of renal failure.

Conclusion

The ARBs reduce proteinuria, independent of the degree of proteinuria and of underlying disease. The magnitude of effect is similar regardless of whether the comparator is placebo or calcium-channel blocker. Reduction in proteinuria from ARBs and ACE inhibitors is similar, but their combination is more effective than either drug alone. Uncertainty concerning adverse effects and outcomes that are important to patients limits applicability of findings to clinical practice.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^117U8Rd2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Diabetes and CKD — albuminuria/proteinuria change and clinical outcomes — secondary analyses from the RENAAL trial and IDNT have directly correlated albuminuria/proteinuria reduction with clinical benefit, yet in the opinion of the Work Group, there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in clinical outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and to be considered efficacious, potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death.

### Effects of exercise training on proteinuria in adult patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JxndQ]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although the effects of the different exercise intensities on proteinuria are still unclear, exercise training with vigorous intensity is safe for adult CKD patients not receiving renal replacement therapy who have proteinuria. Further research is warranted in the future to determine the effectiveness of exercise training on proteinuria and to explore the mechanisms by which exercise training influences proteinuria.

### Proteinuria reduction as a surrogate end point in trials of IgA nephropathy [^1168xpAV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is an important cause of ESKD for which there are no approved therapies. A challenge for evaluating treatments for IgAN is the usual long time course for progression to ESKD. The aim of this Kidney Health Initiative project was to identify surrogate end points that could serve as reliable predictors of a treatment's effect on long-term kidney outcomes in IgAN and be used as a basis for approval. Proteinuria was identified as the most widely recognized and well studied risk factor for progression to ESKD in IgAN. The workgroup performed a critical review of the data on proteinuria reduction as a surrogate end point for a treatment's effect on progression to ESKD in IgAN. Epidemiologic data indicate a strong and consistent relationship between the level and duration of proteinuria and loss of kidney function. Trial-level analyses of data from 13 controlled trials also show an association between treatment effects on percent reduction of proteinuria and treatment effects on a composite of time to doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, or death. We conclude that data support the use of proteinuria reduction as a reasonably likely surrogate end point for a treatment's effect on progression to ESKD in IgAN. In the United States, reasonably likely surrogate end points can be used as a basis for accelerated approval of therapies intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, such as IgAN. The clinical benefit of products approved under this program would need to be verified in a postmarketing confirmatory trial.

### Antihypertensive therapy in the presence of proteinuria [^116w15cV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The presence of proteinuria is a well-known risk factor for both the progression of renal disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreases in urine protein excretion level were associated with a slower decrease in renal function and decrease in risk of cardiovascular events. Increased blood pressure has a major role in the development of proteinuria in patients with either diabetic or nondiabetic kidney disease, and all recent guidelines recommend a blood pressure goal less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients with proteinuria to achieve maximal renal and cardiovascular protection. Drugs interfering with the renin-angiotensin system, ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, should be used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in patients with proteinuria because they seem to have a blood pressure-independent antiproteinuric effect, and if blood pressure levels are still out of goal, a diuretic should be added to this regimen. A combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker or other classes of medications shown to decrease protein excretion, such as nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists or aldosterone receptor blockers, should be considered to decrease proteinuria further. This review provides an extended summary of current evidence regarding the associations of blood pressure with proteinuria, the rationale for currently recommended blood pressure goals, and the use of various classes of antihypertensive agents in proteinuric patients.

### The KDIGO practice guideline on glomerulonephritis: reading between the (guide) lines – application to the individual patient [^116fX5yt]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guideline for glomerulonephritis is designed to assist health-care providers in treating patients with glomerular diseases. A guideline is not a set of rules but is intended to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on the available evidence. Due to its general nature and the variability of strength of the available studies, it is often difficult to directly apply a guideline to the care of an individual patient. This commonly relates to the limited generalizability of the evidence, i.e., does not cover every clinical scenario. To underscore this point, we have introduced within the context of the glomerulonephritis guideline cases with specific features to illustrate the constant need for clinical judgment. These vignettes are intended to demonstrate how the best treatment plans should be individualized and take into account patient preference and clinical acumen, as well as the best available evidence.

### Long-term outcomes in IgA nephropathy [^112X2W7b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions are first, the extent to which such short-term proteinuria and eGFR data predict the long-term rate of eGFR loss and risk of kidney failure in IgA nephropathy, and second, the degree of proteinuria reduction that would be associated with slowing eGFR decline so that kidney failure is not reached during a patient's lifetime. According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases, a reduction of proteinuria to < 1 g/d is considered as a reasonable treatment target in patients with IgA nephropathy. However, long-term outcomes for patients with proteinuria < 1 g/d need to be better understood.

To address these issues, we studied clinical data from patients with IgA nephropathy enrolled into the UK National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases (RaDaR), a national registry with validated end points and no withdrawals from follow-up. We analyzed the characteristics and outcomes of patients with IgA nephropathy and delineated the burden of disease progression by age at diagnosis to gain insight into the magnitude of proteinuria change and rate of eGFR loss required of new treatments to prevent kidney failure in a patient's lifetime. We assessed the relationships among key parameters including baseline and time-averaged proteinuria, rate of eGFR loss, and kidney survival. Finally, we assessed the value of short-term changes in proteinuria and eGFR slope, typically measured in IgA nephropathy RCTs, for predicting longer-term clinical outcomes. Through these analyses, we aim to improve understanding of current outcomes and begin discussion on how lifetime kidney failure risk should be evaluated and management strategies developed such that no patient with IgA nephropathy reaches kidney failure.

### Supratherapeutic doses of angiotensin receptor blockers to decrease proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115YDyDn]. American Journal of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

An important endpoint in treating chronic kidney disease, a prevalent disease that can lead to kidney failure and cardiovascular disease, is reducing proteinuria. Proteinuria is an independent risk factor for disease progression and the development of cardiovascular disease and is a key factor that can be used to guide therapy designed to maximize kidney protection. Proteinuria is targeted by using pharmacologic agents that suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a regulator of intravascular volume and blood pressure; this has been shown to decrease proteinuria, slow disease progression, and improve coronary disease outcome, independent of effects on blood pressure. The efficacy of RAAS blockers, including angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may be limited by currently recommended doses, which are based on treatment of hypertension. Data are now emerging from clinical trials demonstrating that use of 'supratherapeutic doses' (doses greater than those approved for lowering blood pressure), compared with standard doses, has favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy in reducing proteinuria in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic kidney disease. Supratherapeutic dosing may be a valuable approach for optimizing RAAS blockade and providing renoprotection.

### Primary care approach to proteinuria [^114Jxx65]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common finding in primary care practice. Most adolescents who are diagnosed with proteinuria through screening urinalysis do not have renal disease, and the proteinuria will usually resolve on repeat testing. In contrast, proteinuria is suggestive of kidney disease in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, primary renal disease, or other systemic illnesses. Quantification of proteinuria can be used longitudinally to monitor therapeutic effects of treatment of the underlying disease. Given the multitude of clinical settings in which proteinuria can occur, we suggest an algorithm that may help clinicians differentiate between benign and serious etiologies of proteinuria.

Outcome measures in glomerular disease — practice points are limited; goals for proteinuria reduction vary by disease, and a drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40% over 2–3 years may be a surrogate outcome measure for kidney failure. The document states: "The specific practice points in this section are limited: Practice Point 1.9.1 states that goals for proteinuria reduction vary by disease and Practice Point 1.9.2 reports that a drop in eGFR ≥ 40% over 2–3 years may be a surrogate outcome measure for kidney failure".

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) — risk assessment and proteinuria targets indicate that dynamic assessment of patient risk over time should be performed, and proteinuria reduction to under 1 g/d is a surrogate marker of improved kidney outcome in IgAN with reduction to under 1 g/d a reasonable treatment target. The commentary notes that proteinuria > 0.75 g/d despite optimized supportive care correlates with high risk of disease progression and at the same time suggests that a value of < 1 g/d should be the target.

### Aldosterone antagonists in addition to renin angiotensin system antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116SUhnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.

Main Results

Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

KDOQI commentary — blood pressure targets and renin–angiotensin system blockade in CKD: The guideline notes that the recommended target blood pressure for patients with CKD without albuminuria is ≤ 140/90 mm Hg, and the 2004 KDOQI guideline recommended ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for all patients with CKD, while the blood pressure goal of ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for individuals with albuminuria is based on relatively low-quality evidence (2D). It further states that in patients with CKD, JNC 8 recommended initiation of treatment for blood pressures ≥ 140/90 mm Hg for patients of all ages without differentiation of targets by level of proteinuria. Additionally, the KDIGO guideline recommends an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with diabetes whose urinary albumin excretion is 30–300 mg/24 h and for all patients, with and without diabetes, whose urinary albumin excretion is > 300 mg/24 h, and it agrees to use an ACE inhibitor or ARB and not the combination due to accumulating evidence of harm with combination therapy.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^115WstSF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

What are the preferred drug classes for combination regimens?

A range of mostly two-drug antihypertensive SPCs is available. Preferred drug classes for combination regimens target the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), such as ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs and diuretics, with selection dependent on individual patient factors, including additional CV risk factors and comorbidities. For example, in patients with diabetes and high-normal BP or overt hypertension, which together confer a greater risk of renal damage, combination therapy with a RAS blocker is preferred because these agents offer a superior protective effect against initiation and progression of nephropathy. In patients with renal disease, antihypertensive therapy should aim to target a range of markers of renal (and CV) risk, such as serum creatinine, urine albumin:creatinine ratio, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, usually by RAS blockade, with a view to reducing and slowing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CV events. Microalbuminuria in particular is a marker of global CV risk and is very common in patients with hypertension. Several position statements also recommend combined therapy that includes RAS blockers. The American Society of Hypertension indicated a preference for RAS blockers in combination with either a diuretic or CCB, with SPCs rather than separate agents preferred when convenience outweighs all other considerations. In addition, the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks (IHSB) recommend a RAS blocker-diuretic or CCB combination in patients with BP > 15/10 mmHg above the target goal. IHSB guidance extends to recommending combination with CCB over diuretics where appropriate (in absence of oedema and/or volume-overload states) due to superiority for hard clinical outcomes.

KDOQI commentary — referral refinements for albuminuria and ACE-inhibitor/ARB issues: We agree that the consideration of both GFR and albuminuria will guide appropriate referrals and that referral of all patients with CKD stage 4 or worse will promote interventions to delay progression and reduce CKD complications; in the opinion of the commentary work group, 2 groups of patients who should be referred are those with side effects or contraindications to ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy, but albuminuria > 300 mg/g or nephrotic-range albuminuria or proteinuria; we suggest modifying the list above to add questions about the etiology of albuminuria and difficulty with decreasing level of albuminuria despite institution of ACE-inhibitor or ARB therapy.

### Early change in urine protein as a surrogate end point in studies of IgA nephropathy: an individual-patient meta-analysis [^111MYwv2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The role of change in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for randomized trials in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) has previously not been thoroughly evaluated.

Study Design

Individual patient-level meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Individual-patient data for 830 patients from 11 randomized trials evaluating 4 intervention types (renin-angiotensin system [RAS] blockade, fish oil, immunosuppression, and steroids) examining associations between changes in urine protein and clinical end points at the individual and trial levels.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials of IgAN with measurements of proteinuria at baseline and a median of 9 (range, 5–12) months follow-up, with at least 1 further year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Predictor

9-month change in proteinuria.

Outcome

Doubling of serum creatinine level, end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results

Early decline in proteinuria at 9 months was associated with lower risk for the clinical outcome (HR per 50% reduction in proteinuria, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32–0.48) and was consistent across studies. Proportions of treatment effect on the clinical outcome explained by early decline in proteinuria were estimated at 11% (95% CI, -19% to 41%) for RAS blockade and 29% (95% CI, 6% to 53%) for steroid therapy. The direction of the pooled treatment effect on early change in proteinuria was in accord with the direction of the treatment effect on the clinical outcome for steroids and RAS blockade. Trial-level analyses estimated that the slope for the regression line for the association of treatment effects on the clinical end points and for the treatment effect on proteinuria was 2.15 (95% Bayesian credible interval, 0.10–4.32).

Limitations

Study population restricted to 11 trials, all having fewer than 200 patients each with a limited number of clinical events.

Conclusions

Results of this analysis offer novel evidence supporting the use of an early reduction in proteinuria as a surrogate end point for clinical end points in IgAN in selected settings.

### Posttransplantation proteinuria: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112NmbuH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common problem encountered in the treatment of renal transplant recipients, occurring in up to 45% of patients. Proteinuria from native kidneys falls rapidly after renal transplantation, and persistent or worsening proteinuria is usually indicative of allograft pathology. Biopsy studies of transplant patients with proteinuria have confirmed that transplant-specific diagnoses (transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and acute rejection) are more commonly found than other proteinuric conditions, such as glomerulonephritis. As in the nontransplant setting, proteinuria is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including an increased risk for death, cardiovascular events, and graft loss. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers will reduce proteinuria, but the long-term effect of these medications on patient and graft survival remains unknown.

### Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers for the treatment of proteinuria: a review of the literature [^116Ejx5N]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective: To review the use of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) for the treatment of proteinuria in diabetic and nondiabetic kidney disease. Data Sources: A search using PubMed and MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed from 1964 through February 2019 using the following search terms alone or in combination: verapamil, diltiazem, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, proteinuria, albuminuria, microalbuminuria, kidney disease, renal disease. Study Selection and Data Extraction: All prospective English-language trials examining one or more non-DHP CCB for the treatment of proteinuria were evaluated. Data Synthesis: A total of 13 clinical trials examining the use of non-DHP CCBs to treat proteinuria alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) were included in the evaluation. Most studies evaluated patients with macroalbuminuria secondary to diabetes and hypertension. Verapamil was the most common agent studied. Non-DHP CCBs were effective in reducing proteinuria in diabetic kidney disease but did not reduce renal or cardiovascular outcomes in the one trial that evaluated clinical end points. They were generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse effect reported being constipation. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review evaluates and summarizes the available evidence on non-DHP CCBs for treatment of proteinuria in patients with existing kidney disease. Conclusion: Non-DHP CCBs may be a reasonable therapeutic option for patients with diabetic kidney disease and persistent proteinuria despite maximum doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Additionally, they may be reasonable alternatives to ACE inhibitors or ARBs if a contraindication or intolerance exists.

### Tailored management strategies for IgA nephropathy based on clinical presentations [^116aAQh5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The treatment landscape for immunoglobulin A nephropathy is rapidly evolving with the introduction of novel therapies targeting diverse disease pathways. Some have already been approved in different countries, while others are under investigation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with encouraging results. However, almost all performed RCTs have included only patients with refractory non-nephrotic proteinuria and preserved renal function. Other clinical presentations (rapidly progressive forms, malignant hypertension, thrombotic microangiopathy, nephrotic syndrome) have received less attention and are systematically excluded from RCTs. In contrast, certain aspects, such as the impact of haematuria or management in special populations (e.g. pregnant patients or transplant recipients), remain underexplored. This review proposes therapeutic algorithms to guide treatment decisions in different clinical scenarios while highlighting gaps in current research.

### Immunosuppressive agents for treating IgA nephropathy [^115GBSQf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis world-wide. IgA nephropathy causes end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 15% to 20% of affected patients within 10 years and in 30% to 40% of patients within 20 years from the onset of disease. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and updated in 2015.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of immunosuppression strategies for the treatment of IgA nephropathy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 9 September 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of treatment for IgA nephropathy in adults and children and that compared immunosuppressive agents with placebo, no treatment, or other immunosuppressive or non-immunosuppressive agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study risk of bias and extracted data. Estimates of treatment effect were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. Treatment effects were expressed as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Risks of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Fifty-eight studies involving 3933 randomised participants were included. Six studies involving children were eligible. Disease characteristics (kidney function and level of proteinuria) were heterogeneous across studies. Studies evaluating steroid therapy generally included patients with protein excretion of 1 g/day or more. Risk of bias within the included studies was generally high or unclear for many of the assessed methodological domains. In patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria > 1 g/day, steroid therapy given for generally two to four months with a tapering course probably prevents the progression to ESKD compared to placebo or standard care (8 studies; 741 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.65; moderate certainty evidence). Steroid therapy may induce complete remission (4 studies, 305 participants: RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.01; low certainty evidence), prevent doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) (7 studies, 404 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.65; low certainty evidence), and may lower urinary protein excretion (10 studies, 705 participants: MD -0.58 g/24 h, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.33; low certainty evidence). Steroid therapy had uncertain effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), death, infection and malignancy. The risk of adverse events with steroid therapy was uncertain due to heterogeneity in the type of steroid treatment used and the rarity of events. Cytotoxic agents (azathioprine (AZA) or cyclophosphamide (CPA) alone or with concomitant steroid therapy had uncertain effects on ESKD (7 studies, 463 participants: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.20; low certainty evidence), complete remission (5 studies; 381 participants: RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.30; very low certainty evidence), GFR (any measure), and protein excretion. Doubling of serum creatinine was not reported. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) had uncertain effects on the progression to ESKD, complete remission, doubling of SCr, GFR, protein excretion, infection, and malignancy. Death was not reported. Calcineurin inhibitors compared with placebo or standard care had uncertain effects on complete remission, SCr, GFR, protein excretion, infection, and malignancy. ESKD and death were not reported. Mizoribine administered with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor treatment had uncertain effects on progression to ESKD, complete remission, GFR, protein excretion, infection, and malignancy. Death and SCr were not reported. Leflunomide followed by a tapering course with oral prednisone compared to prednisone had uncertain effects on the progression to ESKD, complete remission, doubling of SCr, GFR, protein excretion, and infection. Death and malignancy were not reported. Effects of other immunosuppressive regimens (including steroid plus non-immunosuppressive agents or mTOR inhibitors) were inconclusive primarily due to insufficient data from the individual studies in low or very low certainty evidence. The effects of treatments on death, malignancy, reduction in GFR at least of 25% and adverse events were very uncertain. Subgroup analyses to determine the impact of specific patient characteristics such as ethnicity or disease severity on treatment effectiveness were not possible.

Authors' Conclusions

In moderate certainty evidence, corticosteroid therapy probably prevents decline in GFR or doubling of SCr in adults and children with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria. Evidence for treatment effects of immunosuppressive agents on death, infection, and malignancy is generally sparse or low-quality. Steroid therapy has uncertain adverse effects due to a paucity of studies. Available studies are few, small, have high risk of bias and generally do not systematically identify treatment-related harms. Subgroup analyses to identify specific patient characteristics that might predict better response to therapy were not possible due to a lack of studies. There is no evidence that other immunosuppressive agents including CPA, AZA, or MMF improve clinical outcomes in IgA nephropathy.

### Aldosterone antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115HRjnS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is increasingly used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of aldosterone antagonists (both selective (eplerenone) and non-selective (spironolactone)) alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including major cardiovascular events, hospitalisation and all-cause mortality; kidney function (proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, and need for renal replacement therapy; and adverse events (including gynaecomastia and hyperkalaemia).

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 30 January 2013 using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists alone or in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) with other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We tested for heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using the Cochran Q test and I² statistic. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used.

Main Results

We identified 27 studies (1549 participants) that were eligible for inclusion. These studies provided no data relating to aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi or ARB (or both) on patient-level outcomes including major cardiovascular events and mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation. Compared with ACEi or ARB (or both), non-selective aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) combined with ACEi or ARB (or both) significantly reduced 24-hour protein excretion (11 studies, 596 participants): SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.13). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) at the end of treatment with additional non-selective aldosterone antagonist therapy (systolic BP (10 studies, 556 participants): MD -3.44 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.05 to -1.83) (diastolic BP (9 studies, 520 participants): MD -1.73 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.62). However, we found that aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on GFR (9 studies, 528 participants; MD -2.55 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.67 to 0.51), doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, 632 patients): RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 7.2, 95% CI 3.4 to ∞) and increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared to ACEi or ARB (or both) (4 studies, 281 patients): RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23; NNTH: 14.1, 95% CI 8.7 to 37.3). Most studies enrolled few patients (range 12 to 268) and were powered to observe differences in surrogate end points rather than patient-focused outcomes. Nine studies had a cross-over design and the majority of studies did not adequately report study methods to assess methods and study quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Aldosterone antagonists reduced proteinuria and blood pressure in adults who had mild to moderate CKD and were treated with ACEi or ARB (or both), but increase hyperkalaemia and gynaecomastia. Whether adding aldosterone antagonists to ACEi or ARB (or both) reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or ESKD in this population is unknown.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

### IgA nephropathy in adults-treatment standard [^1157fZev]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT STANDARDS

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for the management of IgAN was last updated in October 2021. Rare variants of IgAN including minimal change disease (MCD) with IgA deposition, rapidly progressive IgAN and secondary forms of IgAN, are handled as distinct disease entities in KDIGO guidelines, and are not included in this review, which will focus on typical primary IgAN in adults.

Kidney biopsy is required to make a diagnosis of IgAN. While blood pressure, proteinuria and kidney function primarily determine prognosis, addition of the MEST-C histological score can improve outcome prediction. The KDIGO guidelines recommend that in adults the International IgAN Prediction Tool (IIgANPT), which incorporates the MEST-C score, be applied at the time of kidney biopsy to facilitate prognostication. Variants of this tool have also been validated for use in children, and during follow-up. However, consensus regarding how best to apply components of the MEST-C score to guide decisions around drug therapy is lacking. As such, the role of repeat biopsy to guide treatment decisions is limited, unless the disease follows an unexpected course or development of another kidney disease is suspected.

Proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the only validated biomarkers, early and late respectively, for kidney failure prognostication and assessment of treatment efficacy in IgAN. Compared with patients with time-averaged proteinuria of < 0.5 g/day, those with 0.5–1.0 g/day have a 9.1-fold, and those with > 1.0 g/day a 46.5-fold increased hazard of kidney disease progression. Trial-level analyses have concluded that change in proteinuria in response to treatment is a valid surrogate endpoint, which associates closely with clinically important outcomes such as kidney failure. Recent acceptance of proteinuria as a reasonably likely surrogate biomarker of progression to kidney failure by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been a strong stimulus for drug development in IgAN.

### Slowing nephropathy progression: focus on proteinuria reduction [^117JryXP]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Blood pressure control reduces decline of kidney function. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers offer renoprotection to a small extent beyond that attributable to blood pressure lowering. These agents also reduce proteinuria, a risk marker for renal disease progression. Accumulating evidence indicates that their antiproteinuric effect correlates with their additional renal benefits.

Class V lupus nephritis — treatment approach includes a suggested algorithm that divides patients into those with low-level proteinuria, whose treatment should be guided by extrarenal manifestations of SLE, and those with nephrotic syndrome, for whom corticosteroids in combination with another immunosuppressive agent may be more appropriate. Immunosuppressive therapy for isolated membranous LN (class V) depends on the level of proteinuria and should be given universally in patients with nephrotic syndrome.

### The effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on albuminuria and proteinuria in diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Pf8eo]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in western countries. New therapeutic agents are needed to delay its onset and progression. Recent literature suggests that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors may have renoprotective effects. Our aim was to systematically review the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on albuminuria and proteinuria in patients with diabetes mellitus. Studies were identified by search in major electronic databases, clinical trial registers, and sources of gray literature. We included randomized controlled trials of currently approved SGLT-2 inhibitors with a duration of at least 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the between-groups difference in the proportional (%) change of albuminuria or proteinuria between baseline and end of treatment. SGLT-2 inhibitors were associated with statistically significant reduction in albuminuria compared to placebo or active control [weighted mean difference (WMD) -25.39%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -34.17 to -16.62] (15 studies, N = 17540 patients). When trials were stratified according to the level of baseline albuminuria, reduction in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was more prominent in randomized controlled trials in patients with moderately (WMD -40.78%, 95% CI -63.21 to -18.34) or severely increased albuminuria (WMD -36.40%, 95% CI -51.53 to -21.26). Only one study reported data for urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. Finally, SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4.43mmHg (95% CI -5.24 to -3.63) and 1.81mmHg (95% CI -2.38 to -1.23), respectively.

### Mechanisms and treatment of CKD [^113rVTSC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

As CKD continues to increase worldwide, along with the demand for related life-saving therapies, the financial burden of CKD will place an increasing drain on health care systems. Experimental studies showed that glomerular capillary hypertension and impaired sieving function with consequent protein overload play a pathogenic role in the progression of CKD. Consistently, human studies show that proteinuria is an independent predictor of progression and that its reduction is renoprotective. At comparable BP control, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), more effectively than non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduce proteinuria, slow progression to ESRD, and even improve the kidney function achieving disease regression in some cases. In participants with diabetes, RAS inhibitors delay the onset of microalbuminuria and its progression to macroalbuminuria, and ACE inhibitors may reduce the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with diabetic renal disease. In addition to RAS inhibitors, however, multimodal approaches including lifestyle modifications and multidrug therapy will be required in most cases to optimize control of the several risk factors for CKD and related cardiovascular morbidity. Whether novel medications may help further improve the cost-effectiveness of renoprotective interventions is a matter of investigation.

### Long-term outcomes in IgA nephropathy [^117FLABw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis and a major cause of CKD and kidney failure worldwide. Most patients are diagnosed before age 40 years. – Life expectancy in countries where IgA nephropathy is commonly encountered varies from 70 to 85 years. Current perceptions of risk of progression are based on outcome data typically spanning 10 or 15 years, a relatively short period that represents less than half the remaining lifespan of the typical patient with IgA nephropathy.

To facilitate investment in new therapies, a focus of recent research has been to identify surrogate end points that predict long-term clinical outcomes. Reduction in proteinuria has recently been accepted by regulatory authorities as a reasonably likely surrogate end point for IgA nephropathy. The design of ongoing phase 2 and 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focuses on generating data over a 1- to 2-year period for proteinuria and rate of eGFR loss. After the inception of this approach, more than 15 phase 2 or 3 RCTs for new therapeutic approaches for IgA nephropathy are in progress in 2022.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) albuminuria reduction — observational analyses from RENAAL and IDNT found that the magnitude/degree of albuminuria/proteinuria reduction predicted reduced risk for CVD and kidney end points; however, the Work Group states there currently is insufficient evidence to assume that lowering albuminuria levels will necessarily lead to improvements in outcomes such as progression to CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death, and therefore potential treatments for DKD must demonstrate benefits not only on albuminuria reduction but also on clinical end points such as CKD stage 5, CVD events, or death. Conversely, the failure to reduce albuminuria does not preclude a beneficial clinical effect on DKD from a potential intervention.

### Proteinuria: increased angiotensin-receptor blocking is not the first option [^111vd6n4]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Candesartan doses in excess of the recommended antihypertensive maxima have been reported to lead to greater reductions of proteinuria than the advised doses. High-dose angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, however, are at least as effective as high-dose angiotensin blockers and less expensive. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition is thus the first-line strategy to halt kidney disease progression.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^115LuDKt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

KDOQI clinical utility — targets and agents for blood pressure control in CKD: Based on meta-analyses of well-designed clinical trials, an SBP target ≤ 130 mm Hg seems reasonable for individuals with CKD stages 1, 2, 3a, and 3b, with stronger evidence for persons without DM or persons with moderate to severely increased urine albumin excretion; in contrast, although potentially reasonable, the DBP target remains opinion based. For individuals with CKD stages 4 and 5 not receiving dialysis, there are insufficient data because most trials, including SPRINT, excluded patients with advanced CKD. The recommendation for treatment with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is graded as IIa and IIb, respectively, meaning that the strength of the recommendation is moderate for ACE-inhibitor use and weak for ARB use. Meta-analyses have shown that use of an ACE inhibitor compared to placebo significantly reduces the risk for kidney failure, but this benefit appears driven by trials limited to persons with high levels of urine albumin excretion. For individuals without moderate or severely increased urine albumin excretion, any first-line BP-lowering agent can be used, and among patients with CKD, often multiple medications will be required. Options for BP reduction, even at low eGFRs, may include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, or CCBs. In addition, volume control with the use of loop diuretics may be needed in patients with advanced CKD with signs of volume overload and in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. The initial selection of an antihypertensive agent should be based on an assessment of potential risks and benefits, particularly in patients with advanced CKD (Fig 1).

### Association of treatment effects on early change in urine protein and treatment effects on GFR slope in IgA nephropathy: an individual participant meta-analysis [^112FQAqp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

An early change in proteinuria is considered a reasonably likely surrogate end point in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and can be used as a basis for accelerated approval of therapies, with verification in a postmarketing confirmatory trial. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope is a recently validated surrogate end point for chronic kidney disease progression and may be considered as the end point used for verification. We undertook a meta-analysis of clinical trials in IgAN to compare treatment effects on change in proteinuria versus change in estimated GFR (eGFR) slope.

Study Design

Individual patient-level meta-analysis.

Setting & Study Populations

Individual data of 1,037 patients from 12 randomized trials.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized trials of IgAN with proteinuria measurements at baseline and 6 (range, 2.5–14) months and at least a further 1 year of follow-up for the clinical outcome.

Analytical Approach

For each trial, we estimated the treatment effects on proteinuria and on the eGFR slope, computed as the total slope starting at baseline or the chronic slope starting 3 months after randomization. We used a Bayesian mixed-effects analysis to relate the treatment effects on proteinuria to effects on GFR slope across these studies and developed a prediction model for the treatment effect on the GFR slope based on the effect on proteinuria.

Results

Across all studies, treatment effects on proteinuria accurately predicted treatment effects on the total slope at 3 years (median R² = 0.88; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 0.06–1) and on the chronic slope (R² = 0.98; 95% BCI, 0.29–1). For future trials, an observed treatment effect of approximately 30% reduction in proteinuria would confer probabilities of at least 90% for nonzero treatment benefits on the total and chronic slopes of eGFR. We obtained similar results for proteinuria at 9 and 12 months and total slope at 2 years.

Limitations

Study population restricted to 12 trials of small sample size, leading to wide BCIs. There was heterogeneity among trials with respect to study design and interventions.

Conclusions

These results provide new evidence supporting that early reduction in proteinuria can be used as a surrogate end point for studies of chronic kidney disease progression in IgAN.

Monitoring lupus nephritis activity — The gold standard for assessing proteinuria, the 24-hour urine collection, is challenging to implement in clinical practice; random urine protein-to-creatinine ratios are usually adequate. The first void of the day sample is the most accurate for the spot urine collection but may not be feasible, and unexpected results on random testing should be followed by a 24-hour collection, especially before any change in therapy. In people with LN who have not achieved CRR, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria at least every 3 months; in people with LN in sustained clinical renal remission, we strongly recommend quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^111SDRyo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

The view that thiazide diuretics reduce GFR and have lower efficacy in the renally impaired may also impact the efficacy and renoprotective outcome of combined therapy. Consequently, loop diuretics rather than thiazide diuretics are specifically recommended in patients with ESRD/proteinuria because they more readily increase diuresis at lower GFRs.

These findings suggest that a RAS blocker, combined with a CCB rather than HCTZ, may be the combination of choice for high CV risk hypertensive patients, such as those with coronary artery disease with or without stable angina, patients with a metabolic risk profile (e.g. diabetes, obesity or metabolic syndrome) and, in particular, those with renal disease. In addition, it should be noted that some data suggests thiazide diuretics may impair glucose homeostasis and that treatment is associated with a greater incidence of diabetes compared with other antihypertensives. Furthermore, compared with olmesartan/HCTZ, olmesartan/amlodipine treatment was associated beneficial metabolic and inflammatory effects and a lower-risk of new onset diabetes in non-diabetic patients with metabolic syndrome. These data reinforce the suggestion that ARB/CCB combinations may be a preferred treatment combination, especially in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders, such as diabetes.

The renoprotective effects of ARBs and ACE inhibitors are mediated via their ability to block RAS activity. This makes RAS blockers the treatment of choice in patients with diabetic kidney disease and non-diabetic kidney disease with proteinuria. For the ARBs, evidence for guideline recommendations came from a number of clinical trials (predominantly in patients with chronic kidney disease) that showed ARBs to be renoprotective, independent of their BP-lowering effects (Table 4). For example, the IRbesartan in patients with type II diabetes and MicroAlbuminuria (IRMA2) study demonstrated that irbesartan, added to other antihypertensive agents, could prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with T2DM and persistent microalbuminuria. Also in patients with T2DM, the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) demonstrated that irbesartan significantly reduced the risk of the composite primary endpoint of a doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD or death compared with placebo and amlodipine. Losartan also demonstrated renoprotective effects in the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study. In addition, the MicroAlbunuria Reduction with VALsartan (MARVAL) study showed greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion rate with valsartan than amlodipine for the same BP reduction.

### Improving treatment decisions using personalized risk assessment from the international IgA nephropathy prediction tool [^111Z2sJG]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppression in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) should be reserved for patients at high-risk of disease progression, which KDIGO guidelines determine based solely on proteinuria 1g or more/day. To investigate if treatment decisions can be more accurately accomplished using individualized risk from the International IgAN Prediction Tool, we simulated allocation of a hypothetical immunosuppression therapy in an international cohort of adults with IgAN. Two decision rules for treatment were applied based on proteinuria of 1g or more/day or predicted risk from the Prediction Tool above a threshold probability. An appropriate decision was defined as immunosuppression allocated to patients experiencing the primary outcome (50% decline in eGFR or ESKD) and withheld otherwise. The net benefit and net reduction in treatment are the proportion of patients appropriately allocated to receive or withhold immunosuppression, adjusted for the harm from inappropriate decisions, calculated for all threshold probabilities from 0–100%. Of 3299 patients followed for 5.1 years, 522 (15.8%) experienced the primary outcome. Treatment allocation based solely on proteinuria of 1g or more/day had a negative net benefit (was harmful) because immunosuppression was increasingly allocated to patients without progressive disease. Compared to using proteinuria, treatment allocation using the Prediction Tool had a larger net benefit up to 23.4% (95% confidence interval 21.5–25.2%) and a larger net reduction in treatment up to 35.1% (32.3–37.8%). Thus, allocation of immunosuppression to high-risk patients with IgAN can be substantially improved using the Prediction Tool compared to using proteinuria.

KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO hepatitis C in chronic kidney disease — posttransplant management and antiviral therapy indicates that all conventional current maintenance immunosuppressive regimens can be considered for use in HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients more than 6 months after transplantation have their liver disease evaluated at least annually. It is suggested that HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients be screened for the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation and be tested at least every 3 to 6 months for proteinuria. It is suggested that patients who develop new-onset proteinuria (either urine protein/creatinine ratio > 1 or 24-hour urine protein greater than 1 g on 2 or more occasions) have an allograft biopsy with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy included in the analysis. For HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients in whom the benefits of antiviral treatment clearly outweigh the risks, monotherapy with standard IFN is suggested, and because of the risk of rejection, kidney transplant recipients with HCV-associated glomerulopathy not receive IFN-based therapy unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks of treatment. After transplantation, HCV-infected kidney transplant recipients should be monitored for the development of liver disease, hyperglycemia, and proteinuria.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^115phxWh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Management of hypertension and proteinuria reduction in glomerular disease — patients on renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system agents should receive explicit "sick day" instructions, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may worsen edema and proteinuria; if proteinuria increases on these agents, discontinuation or substitution should be considered before escalating to immunosuppression. Practice Point 1.5.6 states: "Counsel patients to hold ACEi or ARB and diuretics when at risk for volume depletion". The commentary adds that it is important "to discuss and reinforce these 'sick day' rules to avoid hemodynamic- and volume-related acute kidney injury (AKI) in settings of diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating, or inadequate fluid intake". It further notes that "the widely used dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine and nifedipine) not only exacerbate edema but also have little impact on proteinuria and may even increase proteinuria", and therefore "discontinuation and/or substitution with another antihypertensive should be considered prior to concluding that immunosuppression is necessary".

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for lupus nephritis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to define response to treatment in patients with LN as follows:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|

### 2024 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the screening, treatment, and management of lupus nephritis [^111iVaDB]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Lupus nephritis — proteinuria and serologic monitoring: In people with LN who have sustained complete renal response, quantifying proteinuria every 3–6 months will minimize the risk of missing an LN flare that would require more aggressive treatment. For people with LN, serum complement and anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody should be measured at every clinic visit (but not more frequently than monthly); while hypocomplementemia and elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies have only modest sensitivity and specificity for LN activity, several studies suggest they may herald new onset LN or LN flare, changes in these levels should prompt careful clinical and laboratory assessment but should not necessarily trigger preemptive treatment in the absence of clinical manifestations, and anti-C1q antibodies are potentially useful biomarker but this antibody test may not be universally available.

### Importance of baseline distribution of proteinuria in renal outcomes trials: lessons from the reduction of endpoints in NIDDM with the angiotensin II antagonist losartan (RENAAL) study [^1133u8zS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

A key issue in the analysis of outcome trials is the adjustment for baseline covariates that influence the primary outcome. Imbalance of an important covariate between treatment groups at baseline is of considerable concern if one treatment group is favored over another with respect to the hypothesis testing outcome. With the use of the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study database as an example, the influence of baseline proteinuria on the primary composite endpoint, ESRD, and ESRD or death after adjusting for baseline proteinuria as a continuous covariate was examined. Increasing baseline proteinuria was associated with increased risk for renal events, confirming that proteinuria is an important covariate for renal outcomes. When the randomization was stratified according proteinuria < 2000 mg/g or ≥ 2000 mg/g, within the higher proteinuria stratum (≥ 2000 mg/g), patients in the losartan group had a higher baseline mean proteinuria value. When the imbalance was adjusted, an increase in the magnitude and the significance of the risk reduction with losartan for each outcome was observed. No apparent interaction between treatment effect and baseline proteinuria was found, and there was no heterogeneity in the treatment response in patients with different baseline proteinuria levels. After proteinuria was adjusted as a continuous variable, greater treatment effects were observed in the RENAAL study. This effect was due solely to the imbalance in baseline proteinuria. Considering the importance of proteinuria as a risk factor, adjustment for baseline proteinuria as a continuous covariate should be prespecified in the design and analysis of clinical trials involving renal outcomes, even when patients are stratified on the basis of level of proteinuria.

### Aldosterone antagonists for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^116R8tnE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is increasingly used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). But some patients do not attain complete resolution of proteinuria and might have higher aldosterone levels within few months of treatment. The addition of aldosterone antagonists may be beneficial to these patients for reduction of progression of renal damage.

Objectives

We evaluated the benefits and harms of adding aldosterone antagonists in patients with CKD currently treated with ACEi and/or ARB.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and hand-searched reference lists of textbooks, articles and scientific proceedings for relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi and/or ARB versus ACEi and/or ARB alone were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model and heterogeneity was tested formally using the Cochran Q and I² statistic. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Ten studies (845 patients) were included. Compared to ACEi and/or ARB plus placebo, non-selective aldosterone antagonists along with ACEi and/or ARB significantly reduced 24 hour proteinuria (7 studies, 372 patients; MD -0.80 g, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.38). There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of treatment with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB. This did not translate into an improvement in glomerular filtration rate (5 studies, 306 patients; MD -0.70 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -4.73 to 3.34). There was a significant increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with the addition of non-selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi and/or ARB (8 studies, 436 patients; RR 3.06, 95% CI 1.26 to 7.41). In two studies, the addition of selective aldosterone antagonists to ACEi resulted in an additional reduction in 24 hour proteinuria but without any impact on BP and renal function. Data on cardiovascular outcomes, long-term renal outcomes and mortality were not available.

Authors' Conclusions

Aldosterone antagonists contribute to reduction of proteinuria in patients with CKD who are already on ACEi and ARB but increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. Available studies are small and have short follow-up. Long-term effects on renal outcomes, mortality and safety are unknown.

### Recent advances in diabetic kidney disease [^113ys8KY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What are the general treatment options for DKD?

Intensive glycemic control is critical in the prevention of DKD in the early course of the disease. However, a number of studies have shown that intensive glucose control may not reduce the risk of CKD progression or cardiovascular mortality in advanced stages of DKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend a target HbA1c ranging from < 6.5 to < 8.0%, with the choice of an exact target guided by the extent of hypoglycemia risk in each patient.

For glycemic control, current guidelines suggest using both metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors for patients with DKD and GFR > 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists can be added to manage hyperglycemia if needed. Uncontrolled hypertension can worsen DKD and increase the risk of progression to ESKD. The KDIGO guidelines recommend using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to maintain blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg in all patients with CKD and albuminuria regardless of their diabetic status. Prior studies showed that ACEis and ARBs offer kidney protection by lowering proteinuria and slowing the rate of CKD progression. Combination regimens with ACEis and ARBs are not recommended due to an increased risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.

Regarding the non-pharmacological therapies, KDIGO guidelines recommend the implementation of lifestyle modification among DKD patients, including low sodium intake (< 2 g/day), maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/day for patients who are not on dialysis, and moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 min per week as tolerated.

### Renin inhibitors: novel agents for renoprotection or a better angiotensin receptor blocker for blood pressure lowering? [^112FMqR1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Direct renin inhibitors are the newest antihypertensive therapeutic class. The review describes their antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects and possible renoprotective capabilities.

Recent Findings

Clinical trials demonstrate direct renin inhibitors reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure comparable with other commonly used antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. They also reduce proteinuria and are renoprotective in experimental models of kidney disease. Direct renin inhibitors, when used with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, offer incremental blood pressure reduction far greater than that observed when an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker are used together. This suggests that renin inhibitors possess a unique and distinct mechanism of action compared with the other two therapeutic classes.

Summary

Direct renin inhibitors, due to their antihypertensive and antiproteinuric effects, and the unique mechanism of action resulting in reduction in plasma renin activity and suppression of angiotensin II levels, may offer a unique opportunity to facilitate blood pressure reduction with both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as well as other commonly used therapeutic classes. More effective blood pressure and proteinuria reduction coupled with a unique means of suppressing the renin angiotensin system may offer improved opportunity for renoprotection.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^114BHbPZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In response to the 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for blood pressure management in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, the National Kidney Foundation organized a group of US experts in hypertension and transplant nephrology to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy in the context of current US clinical practice and concerns. The overriding message was the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations. For patients with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria, goal blood pressure has been relaxed to ≤ 140/90 mm Hg for both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. In contrast, KDIGO continues to recommend goal blood pressure ≤ 130/80 mm Hg for patients with chronic kidney disease with moderately or severely increased albuminuria and for all renal transplant recipients regardless of the presence of proteinuria, without supporting data. The expert panel thought the KDIGO recommendations were generally reasonable but lacking in sufficient evidence support and that additional studies are greatly needed.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: a deeper dive into their renal protective properties beyond glycemic control and proteinuria reduction [^11689eE4]. American Journal of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and associated with increasing burden on patients and healthcare system. Its complex causes and diverse manifestation pose considerable challenge in slowing the disease progression. Over the last few decades, the pharmacotherapeutic strategies have primarily focused on reducing albuminuria, managing complications, and alleviating symptoms. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, known for their glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits in diabetic patients, have shown promise in renal protection, offering hope for slowing CKD progression in a broader patient population.

Summary

The DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY trials have provided compelling evidence that dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced the risk of a series of renal events and slowed the chronic decline of eGFR in patients with CKD, irrespective of diabetic status. The results of these trials strongly support the notion that SGLT-2 inhibitors are effective in renal protection across CKD patients with diverse primary diseases and in varying CKD risk categories. EMPA-KIDNEY also demonstrated that empagliflozin can potentially slow CKD progression in patients without albuminuria, a finding collaborated by results from several other studies. The long-term cardiorenal benefits of empagliflozin were further demonstrated in the post-trial follow-up sub-study of EMPA-KIDNEY. The synergistic effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors with other drugs that have different mechanisms of action is being researched for broader applications.

Key Messages

Emerging evidence underscores the potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors to benefit a wide range of CKD patients, regardless of causes and albuminuria status. Further research in this area will improve our understanding of the roles of this new class of drug in renal protection and potentially shift the paradigm of CKD management.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Upcoming drug targets for kidney protective effects in chronic kidney disease [^115eowUj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 800 million people worldwide and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. For decades, the first-line treatment for kidney protection in people with CKD was limited to blockade of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAS), using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers. While effective at lowering the rate of kidney function decline and proteinuria, individuals remained at high risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). More recently, kidney outcome trials employing composite endpoints that include substantial, sustained declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), ESKD and death due to kidney disease have demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA) delay CKD progression, with ∼38% and 23% relative risk reductions in kidney outcomes with these drug classes, respectively. Hence, the current treatment paradigm, based on KDIGO 2024 guidelines, supports initiation of RAS inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors as first-line therapies for CKD, with nsMRAs as second-line adjunctive therapies for residual proteinuria in individuals who have diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Despite these advancements in CKD treatments, the risk for CKD progression is not fully attenuated (Fig. 1). Thus, identifying novel therapies aimed at reducing residual cardiorenal risk associated with CKD has been an active area of investigation. The current review summarizes recent evidence of emerging therapies for CKD and DKD beyond current guideline-recommended treatments. This includes glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and other incretin-based therapies, aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASI), endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activators, and monoclonal antibodies targeting inflammatory pathways (Table 1).

Primary and Secondary Outcomes

There will be a composite endpoint in which a patient will be classified as having a positive response if both of the following criteria are satisfied:

- **Reduction in proteinuria (expressed as the protein**:creatinine ratio in a first morning urine specimen) at 6 months by ≥ 50% of the value at the time of screening, AND

- Estimated GFR (eGFR) at 6 months ≥ 75% of the value at the time of randomization in those with an initial eGFR < 75 mL/min/1.73 m² OR eGFR persistently ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m² in those whose renal function was ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m² at the time of randomization.

The proteinuria at the time of screening will be used to determine eligibility and efficacy. While an eGFR ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73 m² at screening will be used to determine eligibility, the eGFR at the time of randomization will be used to determine efficacy to account for the hemodynamic impact of intensified combination therapy with ACEi and ARB agents during the Run-In Phase (see below).

The proteinuria endpoint is an objective variable that can be quantitated in a bias-free manner. Although controversy remains over the potential use of proteinuria as a surrogate end point in definitive Phase III clinical trials, proteinuria is an ideal marker for use as an intermediate outcome in earlier phase trials. In particular, proteinuria responds to many therapies within several months, providing an outcome whose response can be assessed in relatively short-term studies. The proteinuria component of the composite was formulated to require a large change (≥ 50% reduction) to increase the likelihood that changes classified as a positive outcome are clinically relevant and to reduce the influence of small perturbations as might be induced by minor hemodynamic changes. However, due to concerns that reductions in proteinuria may be the result of steadily declining kidney function rather than improvement in glomerular permselectivity, stabilization of eGFR is included in a composite primary endpoint. eGFR will be calculated using the Schwartz equation in patients ≤ 18 years of age at screening or the Cockroft Gault equation adjusted for body surface area in patients older than 18 years of age, in accord with procedures adopted in the FONT Phase I studies.

The composite primary outcome will be assessed in all patients enrolled in the trial and who are randomized to one of the three study treatments. In a subgroup analysis, the primary endpoint will be evaluated in the patients in the three experimental groups whose Palb at the time of enrollment exceeds 0.5.

The results of this post-hoc analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial corroborate the hypothesis that empagliflozin could offer a safe and effective treatment option to slow kidney disease progression and improve clinical outcomes in a population of patients with T2DM who are at very high risk for rapid loss of kidney function due to residual NRP despite optimised conservative treatment. These findings need confirmation in other trials, including the ongoing randomised EMPA-KIDNEY (NCT03594110) trial on treatment effects of empagliflozin in adults with and without diabetes but with CKD at more advanced stages.

KDOQI — type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria and blood pressure status — angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) effects and treatment recommendation are as follows: In type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria, ARB treatment reduces the risk of clinical outcomes; a 300-mg daily dose of irbesartan reduced proteinuria and the risk of doubling of serum creatinine compared with 10 mg of amlodipine or placebo, and losartan reduced the albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and risks of CKD stage 5 and doubling of serum creatinine versus placebo. These trials included very few normotensive participants, but overall evidence for ACE-inhibitor or ARB treatment in macroalbuminuric patients with normal blood pressure was considered moderate to weak; nevertheless, the Work Group recommends treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in this group, and there was no significant difference in treatment effect between normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^116SbRUr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

What is the preferred combination therapy for patients with renal impairment?

RAS blockers are the recommended choice of treatment for patients with renal impairment. When faced with hypertensive patients with evidence of renal damage, the physician should consider the use of an ARB-based SPC, for tolerability reasons. Choices are numerous but often result in a choice between ARB/CCB and ARB/HCTZ, and it is therefore prudent to consider the evidence for these two combination types in patients with renal impairment.

In a randomised, open-label study that compared urinary albumin excretion in 207 hypertensive patients during treatment with the ARB, olmesartan, in combination with either HCTZ or the CCB, azelnidipine, ARB/HCTZ decreased UACR significantly more. This was clearly associated with greater reductions in night-time SBP, suggesting that the differential renal effects were due to differences in BP lowering. In the Avoiding Cardiovascular events through COMbination therapy in Patients LIving with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial involving 11,506 patients, treatment with the ACE inhibitor, benazepril, combined with amlodipine was associated with a significant risk reduction for renal disease progression, as well as CV disease events, compared with benazepril/HCTZ in hypertensive patients at high risk for CV events. Indeed, 2.0% of patients experienced chronic kidney disease progression in the benazepril/amlodipine group compared with 3.7% in the benazepril/HCTZ group (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41–0.65; p < 0.0001). Around 18% of patients enrolled in the ACCOMPLISH trial had an estimated GFR of < 60 ml/min/1.73 m², suggestive of renal disease and 6.1% were defined as having renal disease based on serum creatinine levels or the presence of macroalbuminuria. The differences in the renoprotective effects of the two combinations are unlikely to be due to differences in the level of BP control because 24-hour ambulatory BP control was comparable in the two treatment arms. The significantly greater renoprotective effects provided by the RAS blocker combined with amlodipine rather than HCTZ are more likely due to metabolic or haemodynamic properties of the specific combination.

5.14 Proteinuria

In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), proteinuria occurred in 9% of 290 patients who received VOTRIENT. In 2 patients, proteinuria led to discontinuation of VOTRIENT.

In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), proteinuria occurred in 1% of 240 patients and nephrotic syndrome occurred in 1 patient. Treatment was discontinued in the patient with nephrotic syndrome.

Perform baseline and periodic urinalysis during treatment with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Withhold VOTRIENT then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of proteinuria. Permanently discontinue in patients with nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.15 Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Cases of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), including fatal cases, have been reported in RCC and STS patients treated with VOTRIENT [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients may be at risk of TLS if they have rapidly growing tumors, a high tumor burden, renal dysfunction, or dehydration. Closely monitor patients at risk, consider appropriate prophylaxis, and treat as clinically indicated.

5.16 Infection

Serious infections (with or without neutropenia), including some with fatal outcome, have been reported. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. Institute appropriate anti-infective therapy promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of VOTRIENT for serious infections.

5.17 Increased Toxicity With Other Cancer Therapy

VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in combination with other agents. Clinical trials of VOTRIENT in combination with pemetrexed and lapatinib were terminated early due to increased toxicity and mortality. The fatal toxicities observed included pulmonary hemorrhage, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and sudden death. A safe and effective combination dose has not been established with these regimens.

5.18 Increased Toxicity in Developing Organs

The safety and effectiveness of VOTRIENT in pediatric patients have not been established. VOTRIENT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Based on its mechanism of action, pazopanib may have severe effects on organ growth and maturation in patients younger than 2 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Proteinuria and hypertension with tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^1142rXRU]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Tyrosine kinases are important for the development of pathological angiogenesis, a critical factor for survival and proliferation of tumor cells. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases either through targeted binding of its ligands or inhibition of its receptor has led to significant hindrance in angiogenesis and has improved survival for several cancers. Several of these antibodies or small molecules have been approved for treatment of recurrent and resistant cancers over the last decade. Although generally well tolerated, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been linked with development of hypertension and proteinuria. We review the literature for incidence and severity of hypertension and proteinuria among several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, their pathophysiologic mechanisms, and provide a guide for screening and management.

### Do severe systemic sequelae of proteinuria modulate the antiproteinuric response to chronic ACE inhibition? [^113CrtJN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

ACE inhibition exerts an antiproteinuric and renoprotective effect. However, residual proteinuria is often present. As residual proteinuria is associated with a poor renal outcome, identification of its determinants is important. We found previously that the systemic sequelae of proteinuria enhance renal damage in untreated nephrotic rats. The impact of systemic nephrosis on renal therapy response, however, is unclear. In the present study we therefore investigated whether the severity of systemic nephrosis, estimated from plasma cholesterol, predicts residual proteinuria during ACE inhibition.

Methods

Sixty male Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis were studied. Six weeks after the induction of nephrosis, rats were stratified for proteinuria and treated for 2 weeks with lisinopril (75 mg/l) or vehicle.

Results

At the start of treatment, median proteinuria was 744 mg/day (95% confidence interval (CI) 609–860) and plasma cholesterol was 10.4 mmol/l (95% CI 8.0–12.6), reflecting the state of systemic nephrosis. Lisinopril, but not vehicle, reduced blood pressure and proteinuria (-62%; range -70 to -48; P < 0.001). Residual proteinuria was 275 mg/day, with a wide range (47–1119 mg/day). Pre-treatment proteinuria and pre-treatment cholesterol correlated positively with residual proteinuria. By multivariate analysis (r² of model = 0.92), both pre-treatment cholesterol and pre-treatment proteinuria were independent predictors of residual proteinuria. The quantitative impact of this multivariate analysis is illustrated by the difference in residual proteinuria between rats with a cholesterol:proteinuria ratio less than, compared with greater than, the median (residual proteinuria 298 mg/day (CI 129–496) vs 439 mg/day (CI 158–670), respectively). Blood pressure response was not predicted by the tested predictor variables.

Conclusions

In this model of proteinuria-induced renal damage, not only proteinuria as such, but also the concomitant nephrotic alterations predict residual proteinuria. Further studies, applying specific interventions, are needed to determine which components of the systemic derangements could play a causal role in the modulation of therapy response.

### Representation of real-world adults with chronic kidney disease in clinical trials supporting blood pressure treatment targets [^115XSWZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study quantifies the population representativeness of 3 landmark trials of BP treatment targets using 2 real‐world populations with hypertension and CKD in the United States. We estimate that 4 out of 5 adults with CKD and hypertension have a BP above the 2021 KDIGO guideline‐recommended target. Yet, these trials were representative of fewer than 1 in 4 adults with CKD and hypertension overall, and fewer than 1 in 6 adults with either CKD and diabetes, < 50 years of age, or stage 4 CKD. In other words, 3 out of 4 adults with BP above the guideline‐recommended target would not meet eligibility criteria for the trials that formed the basis for BP targets in CKD.

It may be surprising that BP target trials have limited external validity to the broad population of adults with CKD, because CKD is both a well‐recognized risk factor for hypertension and an end‐organ affected by hypertension. We found 3 main categories of exclusion that resulted in limited representation in real‐world adults with CKD: (1) exclusion for BP that was either well controlled or difficult to control; (2) exclusion for adults with diabetes and either low kidney function, older age, or low cardiovascular risk; and (3) exclusion for end‐organ damage from hypertension such as proteinuria and dementia. The low population representativeness of these clinical trials leaves behind a large population of patients for whom treatment decisions remain unaddressed, and as a consequence, renders them susceptible for undertreatment or overtreatment of hypertension and the complications that follow.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^117HHgyx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases represents the first update to this set of recommendations since the initial set of KDIGO guideline recommendations was published in 2012. The pace of growth in our molecular understanding of glomerular disease has quickened and a number of newer immunosuppressive and targeted therapies have been introduced since the original set of guideline recommendations, making such an update necessary. Despite these updates, many areas of controversy remain. In addition, further updates since the publication of KDIGO 2021 have occurred which this guideline does not encompass. With this commentary, the KDOQI work group has generated a chapter-by-chapter companion opinion article that provides commentary specific to the implementation of the KDIGO 2021 guideline in the United States.

### Additive effects of intensive BP control and ACE inhibition on suppression of proteinuria in patients with CKD [^116WRMyD]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Previous studies have shown that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering are both effective in lowering proteinuria. However, up titration of RAAS inhibitors can be limited due to drug-related side effects such as hyperkalemia, and residual proteinuria can be present even with maximal doses of RAAS inhibitors. Intensive BP lowering may also be effective in reducing proteinuria, but the comparative effects of RAAS blockade and intensive BP lowering used as either independent versus synergistic interventions to lower proteinuria have not been well characterized. Our objective was to quantify the effect of RAAS inhibition, with or without intensive BP lowering on the reduction of proteinuria leveraging trial data from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) Trial.

The data in this study were derived from the AASK Trial which are publicly available in the NIDDK Central Repository. Briefly, the AASK Trial was a 2 × 3 factorial design trial which tested the effect of two BP targets (mean arterial pressure 102–107 mmHg versus < 92 mmHg) and three different BP agents (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I, ramipril), a calcium channel blocker (CCB) (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol)) on the progression of kidney disease. To achieve the assigned BP targets, AASK Trial permitted the use of other anti-hypertensive agents besides the randomized intervention. Our primary analysis only included patients with baseline proteinuria (defined by AASK as having a protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) > 0.22 g/g.

Our primary exposures were modeled as a six-category variable that accounted for both the randomly assigned BP target and agent, treating those receiving ACE-I and usual BP control as the reference group. The primary outcome in our study was the ratio of proportional change in PCR between baseline and month 6 compared to the reference group. The rationale for examining change in proteinuria over a 6-month period was because the AASK Trial aimed to achieve the assigned BP target over this timeframe and re-ascertained proteinuria at month 6 of study.

Our primary analysis was unadjusted given the preservation of randomization in the definition of our exposure. However, in secondary analysis, we also included a minimally adjusted model (Model 1) adjusting only for baseline proteinuria, and a fully adjusted model (Model 2) that was additionally adjusted for baseline age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and systolic (BP).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2018 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hepatitis C [^113nqmgK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Treatment of HCV-associated glomerular disease — graded directives: We recommend that patients with HCV-associated glomerular disease be treated for HCV (1A). We recommend that patients with HCV-related glomerular disease showing stable kidney function and/or non-nephrotic proteinuria be treated initially with DAA (1C). We recommend that patients with cryoglobulinemic flare, nephrotic syndrome, or rapidly progressive kidney failure be treated, in addition to DAA treatment, with immunosuppressive agents with or without plasma exchange (1C). We recommend immunosuppressive therapy in patients with histologically active HCV-associated glomerular disease who do not respond to antiviral therapy, particularly those with cryoglobulinemic kidney disease (1B). We recommend rituximab as the first-line immunosuppressive treatment (1C).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^113KEpBt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients of all ages throughout the world. Because these disorders are relatively rare, it is difficult to perform randomized clinical trials to define optimal treatment for many of the specific glomerulopathies. In the absence of high-grade evidence to guide the care of glomerular diseases, in June 2012, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) published an international clinical guideline for GN. The Work Group report represents an important review of the literature in this area and offers valid and useful guidelines for the most common situations that arise in the management of patients with glomerular disease. This commentary, developed by a panel of clinical experts convened by the National Kidney Foundation, attempts to put the GN guideline into the context of the US health care system. Overall, we support the vast majority of the recommendations and highlight select areas in which epidemiological factors and medical practice patterns in this country justify modifications and adjustments in order to achieve favorable outcomes. There remain large gaps in our knowledge of the best approaches to treat glomerular disease and we strongly endorse an expanded clinical research effort to improve the health and long-term outcomes of children and adults with GN.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the KDIGO clinical practice guideline for CKD evaluation and management [^112yEMN8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We congratulate the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) work group on their comprehensive work in a broad subject area and agreed with many of the recommendations in their clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. We concur with the KDIGO definitions and classification of kidney disease and welcome the addition of albuminuria categories at all levels of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the terminology of G categories rather than stages to describe level of GFR, the division of former stage 3 into new G categories 3a and 3b, and the addition of the underlying diagnosis. We agree with the use of the heat map to illustrate the relative contributions of low GFR and albuminuria to cardiovascular and renal risk, though we thought that the highest risk category was too broad, including as it does people at disparate levels of risk. We add an albuminuria category A4 for nephrotic-range proteinuria and D and T categories for patients on dialysis or with a functioning renal transplant. We recommend target blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg regardless of diabetes or proteinuria, and against the combination of angiotensin receptor blockers with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We recommend against routine protein restriction. We concur on individualization of hemoglobin A1c targets. We do not agree with routine restriction of sodium intake to < 2g/d, instead suggesting reduction of sodium intake in those with high intake (> 3.3g/d). We suggest screening for anemia only when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73 m². We recognize the absence of evidence on appropriate phosphate targets and methods of achieving them and do not agree with suggestions in this area. In drug dosing, we agree with the recommendation of using absolute clearance (ie, milliliters per minute), calculated from the patient's estimated GFR (which is normalized to 1.73 m²) and the patient's actual anthropomorphic body surface area. We agree with referral to a nephrologist when GFR is < 30mL/min/1.73m(2) (and for many other scenarios), but suggest urine albumin-creatinine ratio > 60mg/mmol or proteinuria with protein excretion > 1g/d as the referral threshold for proteinuria.

Further to the beneficial outcomes on BP, the addition of telmisartan has been shown to reduce the incidence of peripheral oedema induced by amlodipine. This effect is thought to be mediated by the reduction of CCB-induced renal hyperfiltration and proteinuria - in a recent clinical study, where a 70% decrease in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was seen in those patients treated with a telmisartan and amlodipine combination compared with amlodipine monotherapy (Figure 1).

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis: management of glomerulonephritis in adults [^112GNdAT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guideline for management of glomerulonephritis was recently released. The Canadian Society of Nephrology convened a working group to review the recommendations and comment on their relevancy and applicability to the Canadian context. A subgroup of adult nephrologists reviewed the guideline statements for management of glomerular disease in adults and agreed with most of the guideline statements developed by KDIGO. This commentary highlights areas for which there is lack of evidence and areas in need of translation of evidence into clinical practice. Areas of controversy or uncertainty, including the choice of second-line agents, are discussed in more detail. Existing practice variation also is addressed. The relevance of treatment recommendations to the Canadian practitioner is discussed.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^113itK6P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO recommendations — Children with chronic kidney disease, non–dialysis-dependent (CKD ND) state: We recommend that in children with CKD ND, BP-lowering treatment is started when BP is consistently above the 90th percentile for age, sex, and height (1C). We suggest that in children with CKD ND (particularly those with proteinuria), BP is lowered to consistently achieve systolic and diastolic readings less than or equal to the 50th percentile for age, sex, and height, unless achieving these targets is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension (2D). We suggest that an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) be used in children with CKD ND in whom treatment with BP-lowering drugs is indicated, irrespective of the level of proteinuria (2D).

### Effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on proteinuria and progression of chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oC8uE]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Literature search was performed independently by two authors (GC, AT) using PubMed (1966–1st Dec 2014), EMBASE (1947–1st Dec 2014) and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Database. Search strategy is shown in Appendix 1 (see Additional file 1).

Trial type

We analysed randomised controlled trials in humans published in English of both selective and non-selective MRAs performed in CKD stage 1–5 where MRA was compared to placebo or open label trials where MRA was additional therapy compared to the non-MRA arm. Trials were eligible if MRA was used alone or combined with ACE-I alone, ARB alone, or both ACE-I and ARB, performed in CKD patients or for prevention of CKD progression. The first period of randomised crossover trials was also considered eligible. Trials directly comparing MRA to other antihypertensive agents were excluded.

Participants

Trials enrolling patients with CKD stages 1–5 not requiring RRT, with albuminuria or proteinuria were included. Our search included haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation ensure all appropriate trials were identified but RRT studies were excluded from the main analysis to minimise the confounding effect of dialysis on blood pressure and potassium.

Interventions

Trials using selective and non-selective MRAs with placebo, ACE-I, ARB or both were included. Minimum trial duration was 4 weeks.

Outcome measures

Analysis plan included effects of MRAs on the following measures:
End of treatment urinary albumin or protein excretion (24-h proteinuria or albuminuria, or urinary protein ratio or albumin creatinine ratio)
End of treatment renal function: serum creatinine (μmol/L); eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m²); creatinine clearance (ml/min); doubling of serum creatinine; need for RRT. When several measures of kidney function were available this was meta-analysed following the hierarchy- isotopic GFR, creatinine clearance from 24 h urine collection, eGFR (MDRD or CKD-EPI formulae), formula estimated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault)
End of treatment SBP and DBP (mmHg)
Hyperkalaemia (serum potassium above trial protocol limit)
Death, need for RRT, cardiovascular events.

EVALUATION OF CKD

Advances in nephroprotective and targeted treatments for CKD, along with the increased availability of precision diagnostic tools such as genetic testing, immunology panels and new biomarkers, have called for a renewed approach towards the evaluation of CKD. The CGA classification, which considers the cause of CKD (C), the glomerular filtration rate (G) and the degree of albuminuria (A), introduced by the KDIGO 2012 CKD Guideline, remains the cornerstone of CKD assessment.

Cause of CKD

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline places specific emphasis on the often-overlooked cause (C) component of the CGA classification. While histology should be obtained whenever possible, other precision diagnostic tools, such as genetic testing, are also promoted. More than 10% of people with CKD have an underlying genetic cause, and identifying actionable genes through genetic testing can significantly impact the clinical management of these patients. Additionally, obtaining such a diagnosis in one person can facilitate early detection and appropriate management in other family members. This approach will require a well-educated workforce with expertise in kidney genetics. It should also be recognized that while costs of genetic testing are decreasing, accessibility may still be limited in some regions, and interpreting variants of uncertain significance can present challenges. Over time, the importance of making a genetic diagnosis may increase as more directly targeted therapies emerge. This is illustrated by inaxaplin, a small molecule that significantly reduces proteinuria in individuals with gain of function variants in the genes encoding two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk alleles (G1 or G2).
