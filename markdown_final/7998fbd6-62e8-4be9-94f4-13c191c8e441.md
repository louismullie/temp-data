## Question

Questions to ask about patient who may have FMF, but also r/o other cause of relapsing fever like tick-borne illnesses.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions to ask about a patient who may have Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) while also ruling out other causes of relapsing fever, including tick-borne illnesses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about demographic and geographic risk anchors. Then, I should characterize fever periodicity and duration. Next, I will parse hallmark clinical features such as serositis versus tick-bite eschar and patterns of arthritis. After that, I should weigh family history and genetics. I will then examine exposure history, therapeutic response, complications, laboratory diagnostics, overlapping syndromes, and finally integrate a management and follow-up plan with key differentiators.

> Let me first confirm the demographic and geographic pretest probabilities. FMF classically clusters in people of Mediterranean ancestry but is no longer confined to that basin, which means ethnicity increases suspicion but does not define boundaries of occurrence, so I need to be careful not to over- or under-weight it in a diverse population context [^113dfEnA] [^112TTeQ7]. For tick-borne diseases, seasonality and outdoor exposures matter; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about attachment time though: I initially thought all tick-borne pathogens require 24–48 hours of attachment, but wait, I should verify because TBRF is transmitted by Ornithodoros soft ticks that feed briefly at night, so the prolonged attachment rule applies more to some hard tick–borne infections than to TBRF, which often leaves patients unaware of the bite [^113HfHxg].

> Next, I should review fever periodicity and episode length with a stopwatch mentality. FMF attacks typically last 6–72 hours with full resolution between bouts, a cadence embedded in the Tel-Hashomer and Livneh frameworks, so if the episodes consistently fall in that window, my suspicion rises for FMF; I should double-check that the intervals are not longer than three days most of the time [^111yWGQ8] [^116gWuNe]. In contrast, TBRF has spirochetemic waves with febrile periods around three days followed by approximately seven days afebrile and then relapses, a pattern that should prompt me to specifically ask about cyclical week-long breaks between high fevers, which is biologically tied to spirochete dynamics [^115Q88zC]. If the patient has sustained fever without clear periodicity and a rash following Mediterranean travel, I need to consider Mediterranean spotted fever rather than TBRF or FMF, since MSF fever is less periodic and can be prolonged compared with FMF's short paroxysms [^112gyz97] [^115nzaz2].

> I will now examine cardinal clinical features during attacks. FMF's hallmark is acute serositis — peritonitis-like abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, sometimes pericarditis — often severe enough to mimic a surgical abdomen; erysipelas-like erythema on the lower extremities can be highly suggestive, and mono- or oligoarthritis of large lower-limb joints that resolves in days fits the pattern, so I need to ask point-blank about rebound tenderness and pleuritic pain during febrile hours [^111yWGQ8] [^111o9gCL]. But wait, what if the patient has an inoculation eschar, the tache noire, at a bite site with a febrile illness after tick exposure; that points me away from FMF and toward spotted fever group rickettsioses, as FMF lacks an eschar entirely; finding or photographing any crusted necrotic lesion can be decisive when present [^115nzaz2] [^1163vdXz].

> Hold on, I should verify inheritance clues and genetics next. FMF is classically autosomal recessive with strong enrichment for MEFV exon 10 variants like M694V that track with earlier onset and severity, but I need to remember that penetrance is incomplete and heterozygotes can be symptomatic, so the absence of biallelic variants does not exclude FMF, and consanguinity or a family history of similar attacks lifts the prior substantially [^113qimKt] [^117WF2YF] [^112PVi1s]. Let me consider the role of testing: SHARE/EULAR guidance emphasizes that MEFV testing should support, not exclude, a clinical diagnosis because up to 30% of clinically diagnosed FMF cases may lack conclusive genetic evidence, meaning I should interpret results with caution and in phenotype context; in contrast, TBRF is not inherited and family clustering would argue against it [^1134fGQN] [^111qQUX9] [^115Q88zC].

> I need to check environmental and exposure history with granularity. Nighttime stays in rustic cabins or rodent-infested buildings in endemic regions, sudden nocturnal onset after sleeping, or brief nocturnal bites suggest TBRF from Ornithodoros, and many patients do not recall a bite, so I should probe for rodent exposure, older cabins, and camping details rather than relying on bite recall alone [^115Q88zC]. FMF has no vector; instead, patients sometimes report triggers like stress, cold, or even menses-associated clustering of attacks, so eliciting pattern triggers can help anchor FMF when exposure history is otherwise negative [^115SU6mP].

> Let me now contrast therapeutic test-responses pragmatically. A robust, preventive response to daily colchicine that reduces attack frequency and prevents amyloidosis is a major Tel-Hashomer criterion and is reinforced by EULAR guidance to start colchicine once a clinical diagnosis is made; lack of response should make me reconsider the diagnosis or adherence, though a minority are colchicine-resistant [^111yWGQ8] [^115iffYt]. Conversely, TBRF typically defervesces within 24–48 hours of doxycycline or macrolides, but I should warn about Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions soon after starting therapy; importantly, visualization of spirochetes on a peripheral smear during fever is pathognomonic for TBRF and should be sought when feasible [^115Q88zC].

> Next, I should review complications to refine probabilities and urgency. FMF carries a risk of AA amyloidosis leading to proteinuria and renal failure, particularly in M694V homozygotes or exon 10–heavy genotypes, which is a key reason to institute lifelong colchicine for most patients; if I see persistent proteinuria or renal dysfunction in this context, FMF likelihood climbs and urgency of control intensifies [^113qimKt] [^115iffYt]. Tick-borne diseases, including MSF and TBRF, rarely cause chronic complications if treated promptly, but MSF severity and mortality can be meaningful in delayed or severe cases, so I should not defer empiric doxycycline when clinical suspicion is high after relevant travel or exposure [^112gyz97] [^112w4GVu] [^115cnGVE].

> I should double-check laboratory pathways and diagnostic confirmation. In FMF, diagnosis is primarily clinical with supportive MEFV testing; inflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP, and SAA surge during attacks and typically normalize between episodes, so obtaining on-attack labs and between-attack labs can be informative for pattern recognition alongside exclusion of infection and autoimmunity per AAAAI/ACAAI guidance [^1134fGQN] [^113kvRAS] [^1136Hz4U]. In TBRF, the definitive diagnostic step is microscopy demonstrating spirochetes on Giemsa-stained thin or thick smears during febrile peaks; meanwhile, for rickettsioses like MSF, PCR is more specific than serology given cross-reactivity issues, and empiric therapy should not wait for confirmatory results if suspicion is high [^115Q88zC] [^112gyz97].

> But wait, what if overlapping or mimicking conditions are in play. PFAPA can coexist with FMF, especially in Mediterranean populations, and a dramatic single-dose steroid response points toward PFAPA rather than classic FMF; I need to ask about aphthous ulcers, pharyngitis, and adenitis during flares, and be aware that colchicine can also help in PFAPA-FMF overlap cohorts, complicating interpretation of response [^115dj5CD] [^114RUdwM]. I should also remember that heterozygous MEFV carriers may show autoinflammatory phenotypes without meeting strict recessive expectations, which argues for an integrated clinicogenetic diagnosis rather than a genetics-only rule-in or rule-out approach; for tick exposures, characteristic rash patterns for Lyme or RMSF should steer me accordingly when present [^115DJ26p] [^113HfHxg].

> I need to ensure the management and follow-up plan aligns with the working diagnosis. For high-suspicion FMF — Mediterranean ancestry or not — with classic serositis and 6–72 hour fevers, I should initiate colchicine promptly, titrate to attack suppression, monitor for toxicity, and escalate dose or consider IL-1 blockade such as canakinumab in colchicine-resistant disease under specialist guidance; continuing colchicine during attacks and dose adjustment for residual inflammation are standard per EULAR [^115iffYt] [^113rHHnT] [^114jf9HY] [^114FMcoC] [^111ZeTAb]. For suspected TBRF or other serious tick-borne infections, I should obtain a smear during fever whenever possible but not delay doxycycline pending labs, and I must anticipate and manage Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions; involving infectious diseases is prudent, while FMF should ideally be managed by clinicians experienced in autoinflammation per EULAR recommendations [^115Q88zC] [^113HfHxg] [^113QzaVC].

> Finally, let me integrate the key differentiators so I do not miss the forest for the trees. The convergence of Mediterranean ancestry or family history, short 6–72 hour paroxysms, acute serositis, and a strong prophylactic response to colchicine makes FMF the leading diagnosis, especially when genetic testing supports but does not solely determine the call; sustained control with colchicine and prevention of amyloidosis further validate that path [^111yWGQ8] [^1134fGQN]. In contrast, a history of rustic cabin or rodent exposure in endemic regions, nocturnal brief tick feeds, cyclical three-day fevers with week-long afebrile intervals, visualization of spirochetes on smear during fever, rapid response to tetracyclines, and a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction anchor TBRF and should trigger immediate antimicrobial treatment while confirmatory testing proceeds [^115Q88zC].

---

For a patient with relapsing fever, ask about **ethnicity, family history, and colchicine response** to support FMF [^113kvRAS] [^115iffYt], and about **tick exposure, travel, and animal contact** to assess tick-borne risk [^113HfHxg] [^115Q88zC]. Characterize the **fever pattern** and associated symptoms (serositis, arthritis, rash); review medication use and immunosuppression; and order CBC, ESR/CRP, LFTs, urinalysis, blood cultures, and MEFV testing [^1134fGQN] [^113dfEnA]. Consider **serology/PCR** for tick-borne pathogens [^112gyz97] if exposure is possible, and use clinical criteria (Tel-Hashomer, Livneh) to guide diagnosis and management [^111yWGQ8] [^116gWuNe].

---

## Clinical history

### Demographic and family history

- **Ethnicity**: Mediterranean descent (Armenian, Turkish, Arab, Sephardic Jewish) increases FMF likelihood [^111yWGQ8].
- **Family history**: Recurrent fever, serositis, or amyloidosis supports FMF [^113kvRAS].
- **Genetic testing**: MEFV mutations (especially M694V) support FMF but are not definitive alone [^1134fGQN] [^117WF2YF].

---

### Fever characteristics

- **FMF**: Short (12–72 h), self-limited, with symptom-free intervals [^112XVVq8].
- **Tick-borne**: Longer (3–7 d), relapsing, often with chills/rigors [^115Q88zC].
- **Pattern**: Regular attacks favor FMF; irregular relapses favor tick-borne disease [^113kvRAS] [^113HfHxg].

---

### Associated symptoms

FMF typically presents with **serositis** (abdominal/chest pain), **arthritis** (large joints), an **erysipelas-like rash**, and **scrotal pain/swelling** [^113dfEnA], whereas tick-borne illnesses more often cause **headache**, **myalgia**, **arthralgia**, **rash** (erythema migrans, petechial, eschar), and **neurologic symptoms** [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97].

---

### Exposure history

- **Tick exposure**: Bites, outdoor activities, travel to endemic areas [^113HfHxg].
- **Animal contact**: Rodents, livestock, pets [^112gyz97].
- **Travel**: Recent travel to endemic regions [^112w4GVu].

---

### Medication and immunosuppression

Medications such as **immunosuppressants** or **biologics** may predispose to infection, and a rapid **colchicine response** that prevents attacks supports FMF [^112DjDK3] [^111yWGQ8].

---

## Physical examination

FMF may show **serositis** (abdominal/pleuritic), **arthritis** (large joints), an **erysipelas-like rash**, and **scrotal swelling** [^113dfEnA], whereas tick-borne illnesses may present with **rash** (erythema migrans, petechial, eschar), **lymphadenopathy**, **hepatosplenomegaly**, and **neurologic deficits** [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97].

---

## Laboratory and diagnostic tests

| **Test** | **FMF** | **Tick-borne illnesses** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC | - Leukocytosis <br/> - Neutrophilia <br/> - Thrombocytosis [^113kvRAS] | - Leukopenia <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Anemia [^113HfHxg] |
| ESR/CRP | Elevated during attacks [^115iffYt] | Elevated [^113HfHxg] |
| LFTs | Mild elevation [^111hPiXr] | Marked elevation [^112gyz97] |
| Urinalysis | - Proteinuria <br/> - Hematuria [^111o9gCL] | Usually normal [^113HfHxg] |
| Blood cultures | Negative [^115cW19G] | Positive in some |
| Serology/PCR | MEFV mutations [^1134fGQN] | - Borrelia <br/> - Rickettsia <br/> - Ehrlichia <br/> - Anaplasma [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97] |
| Imaging | - Serositis <br/> - Arthritis [^111hPiXr] | Organ involvement [^112gyz97] |
| Response to colchicine | Positive [^115iffYt] [^111yWGQ8] | Negative [^113HfHxg] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The **Tel-Hashomer criteria** include major features (serositis, colchicine response, amyloidosis) and minor features (recurrent fever, erysipelas-like erythema, family history) [^111yWGQ8], and the **Livneh criteria** include typical attacks, colchicine response, and family history [^116gWuNe].

---

## Management considerations

FMF is managed with **colchicine** as first-line therapy, with **IL-1 inhibitors** for colchicine-resistant disease [^115iffYt] [^114FMcoC], whereas tick-borne illnesses are treated with **doxycycline** or other appropriate antibiotics; early treatment prevents complications [^113HfHxg] [^112gyz97].

---

## Key questions summary

Ask about **ethnicity and family history** to assess FMF risk [^111yWGQ8]; characterize the **fever pattern** (short, self-limited attacks versus longer, relapsing fevers) [^112XVVq8] [^115Q88zC]; and screen associated symptoms (**serositis, arthritis, rash** versus **headache, myalgia, and neurologic symptoms**) [^113HfHxg]. Elicit exposure history (tick bites, animal contact, travel) [^113HfHxg] [^112w4GVu] and review medication use (immunosuppressants), and note any colchicine response [^115iffYt]. On examination, look for serositis, arthritis, rash, and neurologic deficits; obtain CBC, ESR/CRP, LFTs, urinalysis, blood cultures, and serology/PCR as indicated [^1134fGQN] [^112gyz97]; apply Tel-Hashomer or Livneh criteria [^111yWGQ8] [^116gWuNe]; and manage with colchicine or IL-1 inhibitors for FMF versus appropriate antibiotics for tick-borne disease [^114FMcoC] [^113HfHxg]. A structured approach that integrates **history, exam, labs, and criteria** helps distinguish FMF from tick-borne illnesses and guides management.

### Criteria for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever [^116gWuNe]. Arthritis and Rheumatism (1997). High credibility.

The Simplified Livneh Diagnostic Criteria for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a clinical calculator used to diagnose this hereditary inflammatory disorder. This calculator applies to individuals of all ages who present with recurrent febrile episodes and are suspected of having FMF, particularly those of Mediterranean descent, including Armenians, Arabs, Turks, and Jews.

The diagnostic criteria are clinically useful in identifying patients with FMF, which can help guide appropriate treatment and management strategies. It considers factors such as frequency and duration of fever episodes, presence of specific symptoms like abdominal pain or arthritis, response to colchicine treatment, and family history of FMF.

Exclusion criteria for using this calculator include the presence of other conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or other rheumatic diseases. Additionally, it may not be as accurate in populations where FMF is less common.

The diagnostic criteria involve evaluating specific symptoms and responses to treatment, assigning numerical scores to determine if diagnostic criteria for FMF are met. This tool considers information on eight possible factors:

- **Typical attacks of generalized peritonitis**: Further symptoms must be evaluated to assign scores.

### Tick-borne relapsing fever [^115Q88zC]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne relapsing fever is characterized by recurring fevers separated by afebrile periods and is accompanied by nonspecific constitutional symptoms. It occurs following a patient has been bitten by a tick infected with a Borrelia spirochete. The diagnosis of tick-borne relapsing fever requires an accurate characterization of the fever and a thorough medical, social, and travel history of the patient. Findings on physical examination are variable; abdominal pain, vomiting, and altered sensorium are the most common symptoms. Laboratory confirmation of tick-borne relapsing fever is made by detection of spirochetes in thin or thick blood smears obtained during a febrile episode. Treatment with a tetracycline or macrolide antibiotic is effective, and antibiotic resistance is rare. Patients treated for tick-borne relapsing fever should be monitored closely for Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Fatalities from tick-borne relapsing fever are rare in treated patients, as are subsequent Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Persons in endemic regions should avoid rodent- and tick-infested areas and use insect repellents and protective clothing to prevent tick bites.

### Familial Mediterranean fever: From the clinical syndrome to the cloning of the pyrin gene [^111yWGQ8]. Scandinavian Journal of Rheumatology (1998). High credibility.

The Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator used for the diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is a genetic disorder that causes recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation, primarily affecting populations of Mediterranean descent, such as Armenians, Arabs, Turks, and Jews.

The Tel-Hashomer criteria are divided into two categories: major and minor. **Major criteria**: Include typical attacks of fever and serositis, response to colchicine treatment, and amyloidosis of AA type without a known cause. **Minor criteria**: Include febrile episodes, erysipelas-like erythema, and a positive family history of FMF.

This calculator aids in the diagnosis of FMF, particularly in cases where genetic testing is inconclusive or unavailable. It also helps guide treatment decisions, as a positive diagnosis may warrant the use of colchicine, a drug that can prevent FMF attacks and complications.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria. However, it should be noted that this calculator is less effective in populations where FMF is less common and may not be as accurate in diagnosing atypical or milder forms of the disease.

The Tel-Hashomer diagnostic criteria calculator for FMF evaluates the likelihood of a diagnosis based on specific clinical inputs. It considers six important factors.

### Tick-borne disease [^113HfHxg]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Tick-borne diseases in the United States include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, and relapsing fever. It is important for family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. A petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Various other rashes or skin lesions accompanied by fever and influenza-like illness also may signal the presence of a tick-borne disease.

Early, accurate diagnosis allows treatment that may help prevent significant morbidity and possible mortality. Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases.

### Old paradigms and new concepts in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): an update 2023 [^113dfEnA]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a hereditary autoinflammatory disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and polyserositis. Its first description as a new entity was published by Siegal in 1945. Colchicine has been the treatment of choice for this disease since 1972. Significant progress has been made over the years in understanding FMF's clinical features, diagnosis, mode of inheritance, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approach.

However, many old paradigms related to FMF have proven inaccurate, leading to the emergence of new concepts that provide more precise insights. The term "FMF" is no longer appropriate, as the disease is found beyond the Mediterranean basin. The concept of diagnosis based only upon clinical grounds proved to be wrong. The paradigm that MEFV mutations in FMF lead to loss of function of the encoded peptide pyrin turned out to be a gain of function mutation. Finally, the concept that as a genetic disease, FMF should be treated for life was found to be inaccurate for the subpopulation of heterozygote patients.

Thus, the breakthroughs of identifying the gene associated with the disease (MEFV) and deciphering its pathogenesis have revolutionized our old paradigms and replaced them with new and more precise insights.

### Mediterranean spotted fever with multiorgan involvement [^111Tuccp]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) is an uncommon disease in travelers returning to the UK. Most patients experience a short, self-limiting illness even without antibiotics. However, untreated disease can lead to severe complications and may be fatal. Worldwide rates of rickettsial diseases have been increasing, presumably due to climate change and greater contact between humans, animals, and the vectors that transmit rickettsiae. It is crucial for clinicians to consider rickettsial diseases as a possible cause of fever and rash in returned travelers from endemic regions such as the Mediterranean basin. In such cases, empiric treatment with doxycycline can be life-saving.

### 8th international congress of familial Mediterranean fever and systemic autoinflammatory diseases [^116oZ6MS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Within the 5Mb region identified from the homozygosity mapping, a missense variant of interest in a mitochondrial chaperone-like protein was discovered, which segregated with the disease in the family. This variant was rare or absent in ethnically matched and other healthy controls. Knockdown of this gene in macrophage-like THP1 cells led to increased mitochondrial ROS production, while wild-type protein overexpression resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial ROS; this reduction was not observed with mutant protein overexpression.

### Diagnosis and management of familial Mediterranean fever: Integrating medical genetics in a dedicated interdisciplinary clinic [^111hW4EX]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by febrile polyserositis, especially prevalent in individuals of Mediterranean descent. It can have nonspecific manifestations that mimic many common acquired disorders such as infections, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and arthritis, which can delay diagnosis for many years and subject patients to extensive evaluations and even unnecessary surgery. Untreated familial Mediterranean fever can result in serious complications such as end-stage renal disease, malabsorption secondary to amyloid deposition in the kidneys and digestive tract, male and female infertility, and growth retardation in children. These significant sequelae, along with the episodic acute attacks, are readily preventable by treatment with oral colchicine. This underscores the necessity of early detection and treatment from a medical, psychosocial, and economic standpoint.

We describe our comprehensive approach to the accurate diagnosis and effective management of this disorder by means of a dedicated familial Mediterranean fever clinic that incorporates medical genetics on equal footing with general medicine. In addition to providing the clinician with the presenting features of familial Mediterranean fever and methods of diagnosis including molecular testing, and management based on our extensive experience with hundreds of affected individuals, we also advance this approach as a model for the incorporation of medical genetics practice into the more traditional domains of general medicine.

### PFAPA syndrome: A review on treatment and outcome [^114RUdwM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, the steroid response may be useful in distinguishing attacks of PFAPA from familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or other hereditary periodic fever syndromes (HPF) and can be used as an additional criterion for diagnosis. In fact, HPF attacks, except for periodic fever associated with mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), usually do not show a dramatic response to a single dose of steroids like PFAPA.

- **Reduction of flare frequency**: The precise mechanism of action of colchicine in reducing inflammation is unknown. Colchicine binds to tubulin, forming a tubulin-colchicine complex. This complex can change the structure and function of the cytoskeleton, thereby influencing neutrophil and lymphocyte migration and adhesion. The rationale for the use of colchicine as a prophylactic treatment for PFAPA is based primarily on clinical and laboratory similarities between FMF and PFAPA and the long-term experience with this drug in the treatment of FMF. For these reasons, when colchicine is effective in PFAPA patients, an alternative diagnosis of FMF has to be considered.

In a 6-month open-label, randomized, controlled study, Aviel et al. showed a significant increase in intervals between attacks in 8 PFAPA patients on colchicine therapy compared with 10 patients treated only with corticosteroids. Among the 18 treated patients, 8 carried FMF mutations; 6 out of 8 in the colchicine group and 2 out of 10 in the steroid group.

Padeh et al. described 10 PFAPA patients previously diagnosed as FMF; 6 out of 10 were heterozygous for an MEFV gene mutation (M694V), but the study details were not fully elaborated.

### Canakinumab for the treatment of autoinflammatory recurrent fever syndromes [^114FMcoC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency (also known as the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome), and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) are monogenic autoinflammatory diseases characterized by recurrent fever flares.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with genetically confirmed colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, mevalonate kinase deficiency, or TRAPS at the time of a flare to receive 150 mg of canakinumab subcutaneously or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients who did not have a resolution of their flare received an add-on injection of 150 mg of canakinumab. The primary outcome was complete response (resolution of flare and no flare until week 16). In the subsequent phase up to week 40, patients who had a complete response underwent a second randomization to receive canakinumab or placebo every 8 weeks. Patients who underwent a second randomization and had a subsequent flare and all other patients received open-label canakinumab.

- **Results**: At week 16, significantly more patients receiving canakinumab had a complete response than those receiving placebo: 61% vs. 6% of patients with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (P < 0.001), 35% vs. 6% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency (P = 0.003), and 45% vs. 8% of those with TRAPS (P = 0.006). The inclusion of patients whose dose was increased to 300 mg every 4 weeks yielded a complete response in 71% of those with colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever, 57% of those with mevalonate kinase deficiency, and 73% of those with TRAPS.

### Unresolved issues in familial Mediterranean fever: Is p.R202Q MEFV variant potentially pathogenetic in unleashing inflammation [^111qQUX9]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

The association between mutations in the MEFV gene and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was reported for the first time in 1997. Variants in exon 10 account for almost 80% of typical FMF cases. Genetic analysis may be performed to confirm FMF diagnosis since it increases the sensitivity of the criteria recently proposed by Eurofever/PRINTO; however, the previous diagnostic criteria did not include genetic testing as part of the standard work-up. Indeed, there is a lack of conclusive genetic evidence for around 30% of patients diagnosed with clinical FMF.

This study focused on the p.R202Q gene variation, which is commonly considered a polymorphism according to the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Currently, there are limited data about the significance of this alteration; however, recent studies have shown that it may be a disease-causing mutation.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of the MEFV p.R202Q alteration in a cohort of patients who received a diagnosis of probable FMF based on the Tel Hashomer criteria. In these patients, several aspects linked to inflammasome activation and inflammation were evaluated: the patients' clinical profile, alteration of plasma cytokines, response of monocytes/whole blood to PKN inhibition, and cytological evaluation of leukocytes.

Our p.R202Q carriers shared clinical similarities with canonical FMF, including a positive response to colchicine, with no differences between p.R202Q homozygous or heterozygous patients.

We observed a marked increase in IL-1β levels in both FMF and FMF-like cases.

### Autoinflammatory diseases: A review [^116HBTqr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory disease (AID) encompasses a vast spectrum of disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of sterile inflammation. Since the first cloning of the familial Mediterranean fever gene in 1997, there has been a rapid discovery of new AIDs. As of 2022, there have been 485 inborn errors of immunity documented by the International Union of Immunological Societies, many of which display aspects of autoinflammation.

The pathophysiology of AIDs is complex. While many are caused by rare mutations in genes governing innate immunity, others are polygenic, where disease expression is believed to be triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed hosts. AIDs vary in prevalence from common entities like gout to ultra-rare monogenic diseases. Initially studied in pediatric populations, it is now evident that AIDs can present in adulthood and even in the elderly.

AIDs can be clinically challenging due to their rarity and the heterogeneity in presentation and underlying etiology. Although the care of AIDs spans multiple medical disciplines, rheumatologists often play a central role given the inflammatory nature of these illnesses. In this review, we explore the understanding of the pathophysiology of these complex conditions and propose a classification system for AIDs. We emphasize AIDs that present to adult rheumatologists and discuss important AIDs that can mimic more classic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and inflammatory arthritis. Finally, we offer an approach to the clinical assessment.

### Unusual presentation of familial Mediterranean fever: Role of genetic diagnosis [^112stFTp]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

To describe the role of molecular analysis in the diagnosis of an unusual presentation of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), two patients presenting with prolonged fever without signs and symptoms of serositis are described. FMF was diagnosed by genetic analysis, which disclosed that both patients were homozygous for the M694V mutation of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene.

Molecular analysis of FMF should complement the investigation of patients with fever of unknown origin. This test enables a definite diagnosis of the disease and may promote the diagnosis and treatment of patients with an unusual or incomplete clinical picture of FMF.

### Familial Mediterranean fever without fever as a cause of monoarthritis [^113DsbkZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease. FMF-related arthritis affects large joints, especially in the lower extremities. It starts with acute pain and swelling, affecting one joint at a time. While fever is the most common symptom in FMF, monoarthritis as the sole symptom is relatively rare. This rarity can lead to a delayed diagnosis for patients suffering from monoarthritis for several years. Genetic analysis showing typical mutations in the patient eventually resulted in a correct diagnosis, even though classical clinical diagnostic criteria were not met. The patient received appropriate therapy with colchicine, which led to remission of the symptoms.

### The spectrum of MEFV clinical presentations — is it familial Mediterranean fever only [^115QDM82]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease associated with a single gene named MEFV. This gene is traditionally considered to be responsible only for FMF. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the MEFV gene is associated with or responsible for clinical conditions other than FMF.

- **Methods**: We sought patients presenting with signs and symptoms not typical of FMF but who carried MEFV mutations. Additionally, we searched the English medical literature for reports of similar conditions and surveyed the 'Infevers' website for MEFV mutations associated with 'atypical FMF'.
- **Results**: We identified three patients carrying MEFV mutations who exhibited distinct clinical presentations not characteristic of FMF. Furthermore, we discovered additional reports of MEFV-related non-FMF disease entities such as palindromic rheumatism. Our screening of the 'Infevers' website revealed 13 cases with MEFV mutations defined as 'atypical FMF' and 4 cases categorized as 'reArthritis'.
- **Conclusions**: These findings suggest that the MEFV gene is associated with clinical conditions beyond FMF. This necessitates a reconsideration of the role of the MEFV gene in linking to such clinical phenotypes, calling for greater awareness of additional autoinflammatory diseases. A correct diagnosis of these MEFV gene mutation-associated syndromes will warrant a therapeutic trial with colchicine, thereby alleviating the suffering of many patients previously misdiagnosed.

### A taste of periodic fever syndromes [^114K8wRJ]. Pediatric emergency care (2013). Low credibility.

Periodic fevers are acquired or inherited disorders of innate immunity, first described in the 1940s. Patients are typically young at onset and experience regularly recurring fevers lasting from a few days to a few weeks, alongside systemic inflammatory symptoms, which alternate with symptom-free periods. Clinical manifestations include gastrointestinal complaints, myalgias, arthralgias, and rash. Differential diagnoses may consider reinfections, other inflammatory disorders, and neoplastic diseases.

This clinical review examines a selection of autoinflammatory disorders including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1-associated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome. We review the basics, relevant clinical and laboratory features, and management of each entity.

### Tick-borne infections [^116DLQ66]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

There are many tick-borne infections that affect children and adolescents in the United States. These illnesses often begin with non-specific flulike symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Therefore, obtaining a good travel history is important. Most people do not even realize that they were bitten by a tick, so identification of the specific tick is not necessary. Often, treatment should commence before formal illness identification, as delays may cause more severe disease, and rapid laboratory confirmation is difficult. One of the most important issues is prevention of tick bites with insect repellents, accompanied by thorough tick checks after being outdoors in a tick-infested region.

Rickettsial disease has recently undergone an important evolution, particularly in the field of molecular genetics. This development includes Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), a tick-borne disease caused by Rickettsia conorii. Important changes have occurred in the ecological and epidemiological understanding of the disease, and in the occurrence of severe forms. However, many questions still remain, including the identity of the real vector and reservoir of R. conorii, and whether other risk factors exist for a severe form of MSF.

### Patient management and the association of less common familial Mediterranean fever symptoms with other disorders [^11467oZS]. Genetics in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we present clinical data from 16,000 familial Mediterranean fever patients. We also discuss the clinical manifestation of a subset of these patients and their potential symptom associations with other disorders.

Familial Mediterranean fever patients were confirmed using Tel-Hashomer criteria and were tested for the 12 most common mutations using the familial Mediterranean fever StripAssay. A total of 100 samples were selected, and their MEFV gene exons and intron junctions were completely sequenced. We observed that in children, severe phenotypes with polyserositis, erysipelas-like erythema, splenomegaly, and vasculitis are associated with high penetrance of exon 10 mutations, particularly M694V. Several forms of arthritis were associated with familial Mediterranean fever, including acute mono/oligoarthritis in the lower extremities, destructive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, arthritis of the hip joint, and juvenile chronic arthritis. Severe life-threatening complications, such as adhesive intestinal obstruction, renal amyloidosis, and uncommon/rare symptoms, were sometimes the only form of familial Mediterranean fever manifestation.

We suggest performing familial Mediterranean fever genetic testing for patients presenting with rare/uncommon symptoms also common in other disorders, to prevent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. In our experience, the most effective patient management for familial Mediterranean fever was its rapid diagnosis through genetic testing and initiation of colchicine therapy.

### Tick-borne illnesses: A CME update [^114vYBex]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

North American tick-borne illnesses are a group of important emerging diseases whose incidence has been increasing for the past decade. Emergency physicians may be the first contact for patients with symptoms of tick-borne illness; thus, it is important that these diseases remain on a physician's differential diagnosis when presented with an appropriate clinical presentation. This CME activity provides an overview of the most common tick-borne illnesses in North America and will help physicians evaluate their clinical presentation, order appropriate diagnostic tests, develop pediatric treatment recommendations, and prepare to include tick-borne illnesses in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients presenting with multisystem disease.

### Familial Mediterranean fever is commonly diagnosed in children in Israel with periodic fever aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis syndrome [^115dj5CD]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

To describe a cohort of pediatric patients diagnosed with periodic fever aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis (PFAPA) and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), we compared them with children diagnosed solely with PFAPA (sPFAPA). Clinical, laboratory, and genetic data of all pediatric patients diagnosed with sPFAPA or PFAPA/FMF were retrospectively collected from two primary Israeli medical referral centers and compared.

Of 270 patients with PFAPA, more than one-half were of Mediterranean ancestry. Among patients with PFAPA, 51 (18.9%) were also diagnosed with FMF (PFAPA/FMF). Genetic data on the nine most common MEFV variants were available for 45 children (88%) in the PFAPA/FMF group. Two variants were found in 15 children (33.3%), one variant was found in 27 patients (60%), and three patients (6.6%) had no variants. Abdominal pain, myalgia, and arthralgia were more commonly reported in the PFAPA/FMF group compared with the sPFAPA group (90% vs 49% [p < 0.0001]; 46% vs 23% [P = 0.02]; and 30% vs 17% [P = 0.049], respectively). Colchicine was more commonly prescribed for the PFAPA/FMF group compared with the sPFAPA group (82% vs 29%; p < 0.0001), but the alleviation of PFAPA symptoms with colchicine was similar between groups (75% vs 63% [P = 0.23]).

We show a strong association between two common autoinflammatory syndromes, PFAPA and FMF, in patients from Mediterranean ancestry. Clinicians should be aware that the presentation of one disease may clinically evolve into another. The association between PFAPA and FMF poses the question of similar pathogenesis.

### Performance of different diagnostic criteria for familial Mediterranean fever in children with periodic fevers: Results from a multicenter international registry [^116qnE6o]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Our aims were to validate the pediatric diagnostic criteria in a large international registry and to compare them with the performance of previous criteria for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

- **Methods**: Pediatric patients with FMF from the Eurofever registry were used for the validation of the existing criteria. Other periodic fevers served as controls: mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome (PFAPA), and undefined periodic fever from the same registry. The performances of Tel Hashomer, Livneh, and the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria were assessed.

- **Results**: The FMF group included 339 patients. The control group consisted of 377 patients (53 TRAPS, 45 MKD, 32 CAPS, 160 PFAPA, 87 undefined periodic fevers). Patients with FMF were correctly diagnosed using the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria with a sensitivity rate of 87.4% and a specificity rate of 40.7%. On the other hand, Tel Hashomer and Livneh criteria displayed a sensitivity of 45.0% and 77.3%, respectively. Both of the latter criteria exhibited better specificity than the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria: 97.2% and 41.1% for Tel Hashomer and Livneh criteria, respectively. The overall accuracy for the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria was 65% and 69.6% (using 2 and 3 criteria), respectively. Ethnicity and residence had no effect on the performance of the Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria.

- **Conclusion**: The Yalcinkaya-Ozen criteria yielded a better sensitivity.

### Periodic fever syndromes: Beyond the single gene paradigm [^115DJ26p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease in Canada and is characterized by a clinical syndrome of episodic inflammatory symptoms. Traditionally, the disease is defined by autosomal recessive inheritance of MEFV gene variants; yet, FMF also not uncommonly manifests in individuals with only one identified disease-associated allele. Increasing availability and affordability of gene sequencing has led to the identification of multiple MEFV variants; however, they are often of unknown clinical significance. Variants in other genes affecting overlapping or distinct inflammatory signaling pathways — together with gene-environment interactions, including epigenetic modulation — likely underlie the significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity seen among patients with this disease.

We review recent evidence of the expanding spectrum of FMF genotype and phenotype and suggest that drug funding schemes restricting biologic agents to patients with homozygous mutations have not kept pace with our biological understanding of the disease.

### Reliability of a generative artificial intelligence tool for pediatric familial Mediterranean fever: Insights from a multicentre expert survey [^112QqZW5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Despite the growing interest in understanding the possibilities of AI for medical scope, particularly for rare diseases such as FMF, there is currently no consensus from medical organizations on related benefits and risks. Our multicentric survey aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a popular generative AI tool for inquiries about pediatric FMF.

Several considerations can be made about the responses provided. For example, despite the fact that responses are generally fluent, well-written, and rich in details, information is often inaccurate or incomplete. When prompted about what FMF is, the popular generative AI tool responded that "genetic testing is not the only way to diagnose FMF"; however, according to the EuroFever/PRINTO classification criteria, this definition could be acceptable but it should be specified that genetic investigations should always be performed, when available, to achieve a diagnosis with higher levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than clinical classification criteria.

The popular generative AI tool repeated in various responses that "people with FMF inherit a faulty copy of this gene from each parent" or "this mutation is passed from parents to their children in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both parents must be carriers for a child to have the disease"; nevertheless, patients with a heterozygous phenotype with likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants may be diagnosed with FMF. Other inaccuracies could be found, such as "the gene mutation causes pyrin to be…

### Mutations in the gene for familial Mediterranean fever: Do they predispose to inflammation [^115UHsnc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

To analyze 70 individuals who were found to have the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene for the presence of definite familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and to assess if they were prone to clinical and laboratory inflammation, we also prospectively evaluated 72 patients with childhood rheumatic diseases for the presence of MEFV mutations.

- **Methods**: Seventy patients with one MEFV gene mutation were reevaluated for the presence of a clinical FMF phenotype using a new set of criteria. They were also questioned for the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms and rheumatic diseases. Sampling was done for erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels. A second group with childhood rheumatic diseases was diagnosed according to international criteria.

- **Results**: The median age of the 70 heterozygous individuals was 12 years. About one-third (34.3%) were classified with a clinical FMF phenotype according to the suggested criteria. Fifteen individuals (21.4%) were classified as normal, and three (4.3%) had recurrent abdominal pains but did not fulfill all criteria for clinical FMF. Overall, 28 individuals (40.0%) had some form of rheumatic complaint, and 15 (21.4%) had developed a rheumatic disease, including Behçet's disease, a vasculitis, or acute rheumatic fever. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were 45.47 ± 33.05 mm/h and 4.00 ± 6.73 mg/dl, respectively. Among the 72 patients with rheumatic diseases of childhood, 22 (30.5%) carried one or two mutations of the MEFV gene. The mutated allele frequency among patients with rheumatic diseases was significantly higher than in controls (p < 0.05).

### Unilateral lymphocytic pleuritis as a manifestation of familial Mediterranean fever [^114QC3Sp]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease predominantly affecting populations surrounding the Mediterranean basin. It is the most prevalent hereditary periodic fever syndrome, characterized mainly by recurrent short attacks of fever and serositis, including pleuritis, arthritis, and peritonitis. Unilateral polymorphonuclear exudative pleuritis associated with fever has been reported as the solitary manifestation of the first FMF attack in less than 10% of patients.

This case study describes a 30-year-old Greek man who experienced repeated episodes of lymphocytic exudative pleuritis associated with fever. After a thorough workup involving clinical criteria and molecular genetic testing, which identified homozygosity polymorphisms of the FMF gene, a diagnosis of FMF was established. Treatment with colchicine, at a dosage of 2 mg per day, eliminated FMF attacks. To our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case report of a patient with FMF presenting with a lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion.

These findings aid in the early and efficient initiation of treatment for patients.

### Unresolved issues in familial Mediterranean fever: Is p.R202Q MEFV variant potentially pathogenetic in unleashing inflammation [^114iP7wv]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes for pyrin. Although genetic testing is commonly employed for FMF diagnosis, the interpretation of genetic results is often challenging. Therefore, we aimed to functionally characterize the p.R202Q MEFV alteration. Furthermore, we hypothesized that inflammation may affect genomic stability and neutrophilic (N) subsets.

A cohort comprising patients with FMF (n = 4), p.R202Q variant (n = 18), and FMF-like (n = 8) were selected from the Outpatient Clinic for Autoinflammatory Diseases of Padova University Hospital. Primary monocytes were incubated for 3 hours in the presence of LPS or LPS+PKN1/2 inhibitor (UCN-01). Colchicine pretreatment was applied to assess its anti-inflammatory effect. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA, and leukocytes were examined using May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining on blood smears.

We did not find significant differences in IL-1 and IL-18 levels in monocytes treated with LPS+UCN-01 between p.R202Q patients and healthy donors (HDs). The levels of IL-1β released from LPS-stimulated patients were higher in p.R202Q patients than in HDs. We found that immature and hypersegmented neutrophils were higher in p.R202Q patients than in HD. Nuclear abnormalities were higher in FMF and p.R202Q patients than in HD. Finally, we found a higher cell rate in leukocytes from p.R202Q patients than in HDs. The p.R202Q variant did not appear to affect pyrin function, although these patients presented cytological alterations similar to those observed in FMF patients. These changes may continue to be significant in understanding the pathogenesis of FMF.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^112w4GVu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The fluctuation of incidence of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) in Italy and Portugal, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in the United States is documented by year. Such variations have also been noted for RMSF. In the United States, the disease is experiencing its third emergence since 1920 after peaking from 1939 to 1949, and again from 1974 to 1984. The causes of these variations in the incidence of MSF and other SFG rickettsioses remain unknown.

In most countries, national epidemiologic surveillance of MSF cases is not conducted. Only Italy and Portugal have a formal surveillance program; however, these programs are passive and not mandatory. In many countries, reported cases depend on individual observers and can be influenced by factors such as the need for international publications by physicians. For instance, the dramatic increase in MSF cases in Oran, Algeria, is mainly due to the renewed interest in the disease by one physician. In countries that do have a surveillance program, the incidence of MSF cases actually varies over time.

Another factor limiting the study of MSF incidence in European countries is the use of nonspecific serologic tests for diagnosis, which may also detect other SFG rickettsioses. In Oran, when specific tests such as Western blot and molecular tools are used, R. conorii conorii appears to be the main etiologic agent of SFG rickettsioses.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^115cnGVE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Our knowledge regarding MSF has undergone notable changes within the past 10 years. Molecular tools have allowed us to better discriminate rickettsial species and subspecies of the SFG. We now know that more than one rickettsiosis can be present in the same country. Patients who have been included in series of MSF cases may have had other rickettsioses. Moreover, MSF has a wider distribution than previously described. The disease has emerged and reemerged in several countries in the Mediterranean basin. New clinical features, such as multiple eschars, previously suggested in the early description, have now been confirmed in MSF. MSF is becoming an increasingly severe disease with death rates ranging from 3.2% to 32%. However, questions persist regarding the vector and reservoir for this disease, which need to be addressed.

### Periodic fever syndromes: Beyond the single gene paradigm [^117KmEib]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Many heritable monogenic autoinflammatory diseases present with recurring fever episodes, often beginning in childhood. These disorders — characterized by clinical and biological evidence of inflammation in the absence of antigen-specific immunity — include familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes, and mevalonate kinase deficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome.

FMF is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease worldwide and in Canada, characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of fever and inflammation involving serous and synovial membranes. Inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, its prevalence is highest among populations of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean origin, and it is variable in other populations; the exact prevalence of this condition is uncertain.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and further supported by genetic testing for disease-associated variants in the MEFV gene. MEFV encodes pyrin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein that senses perturbations in intracellular homeostasis such as microbial inactivation of Rho GTPases. Its association with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) leads to activation of a multiprotein inflammasome complex and downstream production of the potent pro-inflammatory and pyrogenic cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and synovial fibroblasts.

Recent data suggest a key role for the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor.

### Familial Mediterranean fever — a review [^111hPiXr]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There are two phenotypes: types 1 and 2. Familial Mediterranean fever type 1 is characterized by short episodes of inflammation and serositis, including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to renal failure, is the most severe complication.

Familial Mediterranean fever type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation in an otherwise asymptomatic individual. Routine treatment of end-stage renal disease, including renal transplantation, is advised. Lifelong treatment with colchicine is required for homozygotes for the p. Met694Val mutation or compound heterozygotes for p. Met694Val and another disease-causing allele; this prevents the inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Individuals who do not have the p. Met694Val mutation and who are only mildly affected should either be treated with colchicine or monitored every 6 months for the presence of proteinuria.

Molecular genetic testing of the MEFV gene, the only gene currently known to be associated with familial Mediterranean fever, can be offered to family members, especially when the p. Met694Val allele is present, since renal amyloidosis can be prevented by colchicine.

### Familial Mediterranean fever presenting as recurrent acute pelvic inflammatory disease [^116vUf6g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Acute episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) often present a diagnostic dilemma. The differential diagnosis should include reinfection, appendicitis, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, persistent ovarian cyst, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.

A young Palestinian woman presented with recurrent episodes of pelvic pain accompanied by rebound tenderness, fever, and elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. The patient underwent extensive workup, multiple courses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, and diagnostic laparoscopies, with continued recurrent episodes. Treatment with colchicine for suspected familial Mediterranean fever resulted in resolution of symptoms.

In conclusion, in patients of Mediterranean ancestry who have symptoms of recurrent PID that are refractory to conventional treatment, familial Mediterranean fever should be included in the differential diagnosis.

### Symptomatic patients with P369S-R408Q mutations: Familial Mediterranean fever or mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome [^112wMskf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old South African female of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was admitted with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and fever. She had vague abdominal and calf pains for 30 years. Her monozygotic twin was investigated independently for abdominal pain. Despite initially responding to antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, she developed recurrent fevers and pleuritic chest pain. After thorough investigation without significant findings, she returned days after discharge with similar symptoms.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) was suggested as she met diagnostic criteria and responded to colchicine, though FMF typically presents before 20 years old. Genetic testing showed no pathogenic mutations but identified heterozygous P369S and R408Q mutations. The significance of these mutations remains unclear, as they are found in asymptomatic patients, suggesting incomplete penetrance.

She remains well, with full symptom resolution, but mixed auto-inflammatory syndrome may be a more appropriate diagnosis in symptomatic patients with both P369S and R408Q mutations.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^1163vdXz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Typical eschar and spots are often found on the leg of a patient with Mediterranean spotted fever. Eschars are rarely multiple, though this observation was reported in the early description of the disease by Olmer. More recent studies in Sicily identified multiple eschars in 7 (1.08%) of 645 children and in 6 (1.4%) of 415 children, respectively. In Spain, multiple eschars were found in 3%–11.5% of patients, predominantly among children.

These findings should be interpreted with care. The role of R. aeschlimannii, circulating in Hyalomma spp. in Spain, must be considered in the cases of multiple eschars. Indeed, Rh. sanguineus has a low probability of biting humans, and the infection rate by rickettsiae is low (< 10%). Consequently, the probability of being bitten simultaneously by several infected Rh. sanguineus is low. Conversely, H. marginatum ticks readily bite humans, facilitating multiple simultaneous tick bites. Furthermore, in Spain, Fernandez-Soto et al. reported R. aeschlimannii in 6 species frequently feeding on humans; a total of 4,049 ticks were removed from 3,685 asymptomatic patients. In this study, R. conorii conorii was isolated from only 1 Rh. sanguineus.

In this context, we can hypothesize that cases of spotted fever acquired in southern Europe, associated with the presence of several eschars, may be caused by R. aeschlimannii. Nevertheless, multiple eschars also exist in Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF). In 2004, our laboratory confirmed a diagnosis of MSF in 9 patients using PCR; among them, 3 had multiple eschars, and 2 of these 3 had a severe form of MSF.

Familial Mediterranean fever is a heritable illness typically characterized by recurrent fevers and serositis. Triggers of this illness include various factors such as cold or stress.

- **Case**: This case describes a teenager who initially presented to the gynecologist's office due to recurrent fevers associated with menses. Since her symptoms only occurred during menses, she was healthy between attacks and fulfilled the Livneh criteria. Treatment with colchicine and combined oral contraceptive pills was initiated, leading to an improvement in her symptoms.

- **Summary and conclusion**: There are multiple etiologies for febrile illness during menses, and one should consider familial Mediterranean fever as a possible cause of cyclic fevers.

### Unravelling the clinical heterogeneity of undefined recurrent fever over time in the European registries on autoinflammation [^1135Erdy]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Systemic autoinflammatory disorders (SAIDs) represent a growing spectrum of diseases characterized by the dysregulation of the innate immune system. Since the introduction of the concept of autoinflammation in 1999, several previously known diseases have been reassigned due to a new genetic background or newly identified as monogenic autoinflammatory diseases. Diseases like systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) have been linked to an autoinflammatory pathophysiology, although lacking a monogenic background. Approximately half of the patients with recurrent inflammation do not fit the clinical profile of any well-defined SAIDs or lack pathogenic mutations associated with known hereditary SAIDs.

Patients experiencing recurrent fever without a molecular diagnosis are often diagnosed with Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, which is the most prevalent pediatric autoinflammatory fever syndrome, especially in children up to 5 years of age. PFAPA can persist into adulthood, with symptoms continuing for years, and its clinical diagnostic criteria are well-established.

Nevertheless, some patients do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria of PFAPA. These individuals have been referred to variably as having atypical PFAPA, undefined autoinflammatory disease or disorder, or syndrome of undifferentiated recurrent fever (SURF). Due to the rarity of SAIDs, the clinical characteristics of such patients are not extensively detailed in the literature.

It remains unclear whether these patients represent distinct, unrecognized conditions within the autoinflammatory spectrum.

### Characterization of new mutations in the 5'-flanking region of the familial Mediterranean fever gene [^116fwbKb]. Genes and Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive autoinflammatory disease commonly found in Mediterranean populations. Genetic diagnosis has evolved since the discovery of the causative gene, MEFV, in 1997. As many patients could not be confirmed genetically by routine exon screening, we searched for mutations in the 5'-flanking region of this gene. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, we screened DNA from 108 patients with clinical FMF and 91 asymptomatic individuals.

We found six novel sequence variants in a region extending -825 bp upstream of the first translated codon. To investigate the potential role of these variants in altering MEFV gene expression, we first characterized the MEFV promoter. Promoter mapping assays revealed that the region located between nucleotides -949 and -152 of the initiation codon was important for regulating gene expression. We identified a putative enhancer element between -571 and -414.

Investigation of the sequence variants found in two patients demonstrated that c.-614C > G resulted in a 70% decrease in promoter activity, whereas c.-382C > T induced a 100% increase in activity compared to the wild type. We observed specific DNA-protein binding to both wild-type sites, suggesting that transcription factors may bind to these sequences to modulate MEFV expression.

### Recurrent peripheral facial palsy in a child with familial Mediterranean fever [^115oy8sq]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Peripheral facial palsy is uncommon in children. It mostly occurs as an idiopathic disorder and to a lesser extent in the setting of some infectious, genetic, or systemic disorders. However, its association with familial Mediterranean fever has not been reported before.

- **Patient**: We present a 14-year-old girl who experienced three episodes of right-sided peripheral facial palsy during a 9-month interval. She had a diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (homozygous with M694V mutation), and she had been receiving colchicine for 8 years. Peripheral facial palsy could be a neurological manifestation of vasculitis in familial Mediterranean fever.

- **Conclusion**: Peripheral facial palsy may be a manifestation of familial Mediterranean fever in children.

### Unexplained recurrent fever: When is autoinflammation the explanation [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever (reFever) can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases, including malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines for the approach to patients with reFever exist. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases is often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated with a variety of divergent presentations, differentiating them from other causes of febrile illnesses can be difficult.

In this article, we first review disease entities that frequently present with the symptom of reFever. Next, we summarize their characteristic patterns of disease presentation. Finally, we analyze key features of autoinflammatory diseases that are helpful in distinguishing this group from other causes of reFever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

### Hidradenitis suppurativa and Mediterranean fever gene mutations [^112tY4dG]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest the report by Iannone et al. and would like to contribute to the discussion in light of recent findings in the field.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) itself is a disease with prominent autoinflammatory features. HS may also be a component of systemic autoinflammatory syndromes like pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, pyogenic arthritis, and suppurative hidradenitis (PAPASH) and pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis (PASH), which are associated with mutations in the proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 gene (PSTPIP1). In patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), the most common hereditary autoinflammatory disease, HS may present with a severe phenotype and overlapping PAPASH-like features.

Moreover, the rates of FMF and heterozygous Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) mutations were found to be increased in a cohort of patients with severe HS compared with the normal population. Notably, in 2 of the 4 patients with HS and pyoderma gangrenosum, double pathogenic mutations in MEFV without clinical FMF and promoter elongation in PSTPIP1 coexisted.

A molecular link between FMF and PASH/PAPASH was proposed in patients with complex HS, especially when accompanied by pyoderma gangrenosum, as the products of MEFV and PSTPIP1 interact with each other. MEFV mutations were also found to be more frequent than those in the normal population, associated with disease severity, and of prognostic importance in many inflammatory diseases other than HS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, and vasculitides.

### Recurrent fevers of unknown origin [^112DjDK3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever of unknown origin is mostly caused by rather rare diseases, and many cases remain unexplained. The very limited literature data do not allow one to construct a diagnostic algorithm. A number of general principles should be kept in mind before starting the investigation for this rare subtype of fever of unknown origin.

### A new set of criteria for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever in childhood [^112XVVq8]. Rheumatology (2009). High credibility.

The Yalcinkaya-Ozen's diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in children. Familial Mediterranean fever is a genetic autoinflammatory disorder that causes recurrent fevers and painful inflammation of the abdomen, chest, and joints. This calculator is particularly useful in pediatric populations where FMF is suspected, especially in regions where the disease is prevalent such as the Mediterranean region.

The Yalcinkaya-Ozen's diagnostic criteria include parameters such as typical clinical symptoms, response to colchicine treatment, and presence of MEFV mutations. It helps clinicians to establish a diagnosis of FMF, particularly in cases where genetic testing is not available or inconclusive.

The exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator would be the presence of other diseases that can mimic FMF symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or other rheumatic diseases. Also, it may not be as applicable in populations where FMF is rare.

The evaluator for childhood familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) explores two key aspects: symptoms and family history. These inputs help determine the likelihood of meeting the diagnostic criteria for FMF.

How the evaluation works:

- **More than or equal to 3 attacks of the following each lasting 6 to 72 hours**: Users are asked if they've had at least three episodes of specific symptoms, each lasting between 6 and 72 hours.

### The significance of paired MEFV mutations in individuals without symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever [^114CWPDz]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) have identifiable mutations in both alleles of the MEFV gene, while some individuals with paired MEFV mutations do not have clinical symptoms of the disease. During family studies, we identified nine such individuals from six kindreds, most of whom either subsequently developed FMF or had other clinically significant inflammatory disease; one case benefited substantially from colchicine therapy. Four individuals remained asymptomatic. Two further asymptomatic subjects with paired MEFV mutations were identified among 49 healthy controls from western Turkey, of whom a further 18.4 percent were simple heterozygotes. This carrier rate was higher than would be expected from the prevalence of FMF in this region, suggesting that penetrance of paired recognized pathogenic MEFV mutations may frequently be incomplete. MEFV genotyping results must be interpreted with due caution, and follow-up of apparently asymptomatic subjects with paired mutations is advisable.

### Familial Mediterranean fever in Arabs [^1169cRZm]. Lancet (2006). Low credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases are a group of disorders characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation in the absence of high-titre autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. These diseases include the hereditary periodic fever syndromes. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an archetypal autoinflammatory disorder, which is autosomal recessive and has a high prevalence in non-Ashkenazi Jews, Armenians, Turks, and Arabs. The classic clinical picture comprises acute, short-lived febrile, and painful attacks with variable periods of remission. In a subset of patients, the disorder is complicated by amyloidosis that leads to renal failure. The gene responsible for FMF, MEFV, has been identified, and its role in inflammation is being assessed.

There seems to be a distinctive clinical picture in Arab patients with FMF, and the range and distribution of MEFV mutations is different from those noted in other affected ethnic groups. This discussion focuses on the clinical and molecular aspects of FMF in Arabs.

### Evidence-based recommendations for genetic diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever [^117WF2YF]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for familial Mediterranean fever, specifically with respect to genetic testing, the SHARE initiative 2015 guidelines recommend that patients with FMF carrying two of the common mutated alleles (homozygotes or compound heterozygotes), especially for the M694V mutation or mutations at position 680–694 on exon 10, should be regarded as being at risk of having more severe disease.

### Familial Mediterranean fever is no longer a rare disease in Italy [^115PJfZi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by short, recurrent attacks of fever accompanied by abdominal, chest, or joint pain, and erysipelas-like erythema. It is an ethnically restricted genetic disease commonly found among Mediterranean populations, as well as Armenians, Turks, Arabs, and Jews. Traditionally, Italians have been considered less affected by FMF despite their geographical position in the northern Mediterranean basin and the migratory changes in their population.

The objective was to characterize the demographic, clinical, and genetic features of FMF in Italy. Patients of Italian origin were recruited from those referred to Italian-French medical centers for fever of unknown origin (FUO) or 'surgical' emergencies. Clinical history, genealogy, and physical examination were recorded; all other possible infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases were excluded. Mutational analysis of the gene responsible for FMF (MEFV on 16p13.3) was performed, after which geno-phenotypical correlations were established.

Italian FMF patients, consisting of 40 women and 31 men aged from 3 to 75 years, exhibited all the clinical manifestations indicative of FMF described in the literature, but with a lower incidence of amyloidosis. The genetic tests were contributive in 42% of cases. The frequency of each different mutation was similar to that found in a series of 'endemic' countries. The geno-phenotypical correlations suggested the existence of genetic and/or environmental modifier factors. Among Italians, FMF seems to be more frequent.

Autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by seemingly unprovoked inflammation. They can be categorized into several groups: hereditary (monogenic) autoinflammatory diseases, complex (polygenic/multifactorial) autoinflammatory diseases, and diseases where the course is affected by mutations in the defined autoinflammatory disease genes. The identification of the inflammatory pathways involved has opened up new areas of research with implications for the treatment of these disorders and the pathogenesis of common inflammatory diseases.

### Questions on Mediterranean spotted fever a century after its discovery [^115nzaz2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical description of Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) has not significantly changed since it was first described. MSF is characterized, like other rickettsioses, by fever, headaches, and a maculopapular rash. Many studies reporting series of patients with MSF could have been affected by various factors. Descriptions of the initial clinical cases, which were diagnosed based solely on serologic test results, likely included infections related to other species of rickettsiae. Clinical descriptions involving a series of patients are also subject to biased observations.

For example, the eschar (Figure 5) can be difficult to identify and may sometimes appear atypical, resembling a furuncle, which is challenging to recognize. This difficulty could account for the wide variations in the reported presence of an eschar, ranging from 20% to 86%.

### The spectrum of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) mutations [^116MU5Gp]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the prototype of a group of inherited inflammatory disorders. The gene associated with this disease, MEFV, comprises 10 exons and 781 codons. Twenty-nine mutations, most located in the last exon, have been identified so far. It is unclear whether all are true disease-causing mutations. Five founder mutations — V726A, M694V, M694I, M680I, and E148Q — account for 74% of FMF chromosomes from typical cases, including Armenians, Arabs, Jews, and Turks. Rare mutations are preferentially found in populations not usually affected by FMF, such as Europeans not from the aforementioned ancestries.

Various combinations of MEFV mutations define genotypes ranging from severe to mild. The trend is that genotypes including two mutations located within mutational "hot-spots" (codons 680 or 694) of the gene are associated with severe phenotypes, whereas mild phenotypes are associated with other mutations, with E148Q being the mildest and least penetrant. Understanding the correlation between the FMF phenotype and genotype is further obscured by the existence of complex alleles, modifier loci, genetic heterogeneity, and possible epigenetic factors. Additionally, mutations in the MEFV gene are thought to be involved in non-FMF disorders.

Carrier rates for FMF mutations may be as high as 1:3 in some populations, suggesting that the disease is underdiagnosed. This review update emphasizes that both clinical and genetic features should be considered for patient diagnosis, colchicine treatment, and prognosis.

### Improvement of MEFV gene variants classification to aid treatment decision making in familial Mediterranean fever [^117VFbm4]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

The development of reliable functional assays able to assess precisely the effects of MEFV gene variants on the pyrin inflammasome should also help in expanding the set of variants with a robust classification.

The ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines recommend that the usage of in silico predictors should have only a supporting role in establishing the pathogenic role of variants identified during genetic testing. In addition, these widely followed guidelines suggest that concordance among multiple algorithm-based predictions should be sought. However, while several metapredictors incorporating many of these older algorithms have been demonstrated to perform robustly in large heterogeneous datasets, first-generation algorithms such as SIFT, Polyphen, Mutation Taster, CADD, and Provean are still used even in recent work.

A further consideration should be mentioned about the thresholds used from the in silico tools to predict functional consequences. Most of these predictors return both a score and a prediction for the submitted variant. However, many others simply return a numeric value without any suggestion on the forecasted impact. Therefore, it is up to the submitters to frame the returned score in a putative pathogenic classification and translate it into clinical recommendations for specialists and patients. REVEL belongs to the second class of predictors, and two different threshold values for pathogenicity have been proposed by authors using this metapredictor in their studies, while a threshold was not given in the original paper.

### Update in familial Mediterranean fever [^112fyfFf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the prototypic autoinflammatory disease. Although the gene associated with the disease was identified 24 years ago, we still have much to learn about the pathogenesis of its inflammation and the variation in the phenotype. This review discusses some recent findings in FMF, such as changes in our understanding of genetics, aims to define new criteria, and factors contributing to the disease presentation.

- **Recent findings**: We have finally learned why a mutation causing this disease was selected in ancient times; MEFV gene mutations confer resistance to the plague microbe. A group of experts has outlined recommendations for the analysis of the genetics of FMF. These recommendations complement the new classification criteria, which includes genetic results. In the past year, a number of studies have addressed the contributing factors to the inflammation caused by mutations in pyrin; this has included epigenetic studies as well. Finally, we have long-term data for the use of anti-IL1 treatment in colchicine-resistant patients.

- **Summary**: We now have recommendations for assessing genetic analysis of the MEFV gene and how to reliably classify a patient as FMF. We await further data to understand the contributing genetic and environmental factors that affect the inflammation and final phenotype in FMF and the extent of the disease presentation.

### Severe liver involvement in two patients with long-term history of fever: Remember familial Mediterranean fever [^116HpEPG]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterized by recurrent, self-limited fever attacks and serositis. Severe liver involvement has rarely been reported. We present two FMF cases: a 55-year-old man and a 20-year-old woman, whose prevailing manifestations were unexplained episodes of anicteric hepatitis and severe jaundice, respectively. Both patients reported a long-term history of self-limited episodes of fever.

After excluding infectious, malignant, autoimmune, liver, and biliary diseases, FMF was confirmed through molecular analysis. The patients began treatment with colchicine at a dose of 1 mg/day, resulting in an immediate resolution of symptoms. During follow-up, there have been no new episodes of fever or exacerbation of liver biochemical parameters for 5 and 1 years.

Physicians should keep FMF in mind in patients with episodes of unexplained severe liver impairment and fever, especially in regions like the Mediterranean basin where hereditary periodic fever syndromes are common.

### Improvement of MEFV gene variants classification to aid treatment decision making in familial Mediterranean fever [^113Uatjy]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Next, we used REVEL, which has been demonstrated to outperform most of the available predictors, to score both classified and unclassified variants of the MEFV gene. When using the originally reported best threshold, REVEL scores were almost perfect in identifying the benign and likely benign variants (97.2%) while only 13 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (31.7%) demonstrated a score above the threshold for pathogenicity. We hypothesized that mechanisms conferring pathogenic effects to MEFV variants are subtler than mechanisms of disease-causing variants used to train many prediction algorithms, including REVEL.

Indeed, the reasons why MEFV variants cause symptoms onset are poorly understood. In a mouse model, human MEFV knock-in variants act as gain-of-function mutations, although severity varied inversely with respect to human phenotypes. More recently, in FMF patients, a small set of MEFV pathogenic variants have been shown to act as hypermorphic mutations with a gene dosage effect. Surprisingly, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that FMF mutations (including M694V) render pyrin inflammasome insensitive to colchicine, while this drug is the mainstay treatment in FMF patients. Although many variants with a putatively pathogenic role lie in the C-terminus of the pyrin protein, no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have emerged so far.

Further proof of the complex mechanisms leading to pathogenicity in FMF is demonstrated by the markedly different REVEL scores for variants affecting the same amino acid. For instance, the well-known polymorphism E148Q has a REVEL score.
