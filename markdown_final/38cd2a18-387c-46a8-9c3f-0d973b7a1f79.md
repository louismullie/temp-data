## Question

can oral estrogen be used with hepatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral estrogen can be used in patients with hepatitis and how to approach this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the type of hepatitis and the severity of liver disease. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about estrogen-containing therapies in liver disease. Next, I will review FDA labeling for oral estrogens and combined hormonal contraceptives. After that, I need to examine the evidence for specific scenarios like chronic viral hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular adenoma. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline safer alternatives and monitoring if estrogen is unavoidable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "hepatitis" spans acute and chronic viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and hepatitis due to drugs or alcohol, and the safety of estrogen depends heavily on disease severity and hepatic reserve, so I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing across these very different states.

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The AASLD reproductive health guidance advises that menopausal hormone therapy should not be used in women with decompensated liver function, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or hepatocellular adenomas, and that estrogen-containing agents should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis, BCS, HCAs, and transplant recipients with graft failure, which already signals a strong caution against oral estrogen in significant liver disease [^1177diRo] [^114yGjPG].

> I will now examine FDA labeling for oral estrogens. Multiple labels advise against use in hepatic impairment or chronic liver disease of any severity, including estradiol oral products and conjugated estrogen combinations, and some explicitly state "do not use", which is a clear regulatory signal of unacceptable risk in this setting [^111GJrgN] [^117Beobq] [^111m8F4Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all estrogen exposures being the same. Combined hormonal contraceptives are categorized by CDC's U.S. MEC: compensated cirrhosis is Category 1 (no restriction), but decompensated cirrhosis is Category 4 (do not use), and for chronic viral hepatitis without cirrhosis, initiation and continuation are Category 1, indicating no increased risk of fibrosis progression or HCC in that specific context, which is important but not directly interchangeable with menopausal oral estrogen therapy [^114bKetC] [^111n2uRk].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for viral hepatitis specifically. Systematic reviews and cohort data suggest that combined oral contraceptives do not worsen the course of chronic viral hepatitis or increase HCC risk, and observational data in HCV-infected women suggest slower fibrosis progression with hormone therapy, though these are largely ethinyl estradiol–based contraceptive studies and not definitive for menopausal oral estradiol, so I should be cautious extrapolating to oral menopausal therapy [^112TAAYp] [^1162XjMz] [^113rs3Kw].

> I need to check absolute contraindications. Across multiple CHC labels, acute viral hepatitis, severe (decompensated) cirrhosis, and benign or malignant liver tumors are listed as contraindications, and there is a specific, high-risk drug–drug interaction with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir ± dasabuvir that can cause marked ALT elevations when combined with ethinyl estradiol, requiring discontinuation of estrogen-containing products during that therapy, which reinforces avoiding oral estrogens in these scenarios [^116pmDVt] [^112ProjT] [^1142BYnV] [^115cHjEW].

> Let me consider tumor risks next. Hepatic adenomas are strongly associated with estrogen exposure, with an estimated attributable risk around 3.3 per 100,000 CHC users and clear guidance to discontinue estrogen-containing contraception in patients with HCAs. Case series also show regression after stopping estrogen, so in the presence of known or suspected HCA, oral estrogen is contraindicated [^115cHjEW] [^112EdmE3] [^116dnTEE].

> But wait, what if the liver disease is mild and stable. In women with compensated cirrhosis or chronic viral hepatitis without advanced fibrosis, CHCs are considered acceptable by MEC, yet this does not automatically translate to safety for oral menopausal estrogen, which undergoes first-pass hepatic metabolism and has different risk profiles; thus, even in compensated disease, many experts prefer to avoid oral estrogen and favor transdermal routes if estrogen therapy is truly indicated [^114bKetC] [^1161VBcw].

> I should double-check the mechanistic rationale. Oral estrogens increase hepatic synthesis of clotting factors and binding proteins via first-pass effects, raising thrombotic risk and potentially worsening cholestasis in susceptible livers, whereas transdermal estradiol largely bypasses the liver and has been associated with fewer gallbladder and cholestatic complications in observational data, supporting a route-specific risk signal that favors transdermal over oral in liver disease when estrogen is necessary [^1161VBcw] [^116V1p8B].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For acute viral hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular adenoma, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or active treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir ± dasabuvir, oral estrogen is contraindicated and should be avoided. For compensated chronic viral hepatitis without cirrhosis, oral estrogen is not absolutely contraindicated, but given labeling cautions and potential hepatic effects, it is reasonable to avoid oral formulations and consider transdermal estradiol if menopausal therapy is indicated, with close monitoring of liver enzymes and symptoms. If any cholestasis, jaundice, or enzyme elevations occur, estrogen should be stopped and the cause investigated [^1177diRo] [^111GJrgN] [^116pmDVt] [^114bKetC].

> I need to ensure safer alternatives are clear. Progestin-only contraception or menopausal therapy avoids estrogen-related hepatic risks, and transdermal estradiol, when estrogen is necessary, is preferred over oral because it minimizes first-pass hepatic exposure; in postmenopausal women with chronic viral hepatitis, prolonged transdermal estradiol with cyclic norethisterone did not worsen liver enzymes in a small study, though this does not replace robust RCTs and should be individualized with hepatology input [^111kgKAY] [^111V8KmD].

> Hold on, I should verify drug–drug interactions that could tilt the balance. Beyond the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir regimen, many HIV and HCV protease inhibitors alter ethinyl estradiol exposure, and CYP3A inhibitors can increase estrogen levels, so if any estrogen-containing therapy is contemplated, a careful medication review for interactions and hepatic metabolism effects is essential before prescribing [^111RzP1h] [^113MqknL].

> In summary, I should confirm that oral estrogen is generally not recommended in patients with hepatitis, especially if there is decompensated disease, hepatic tumors, or high-risk antiviral regimens. In select cases of compensated chronic viral hepatitis, use may be considered only if benefits clearly outweigh risks, with a strong preference for transdermal rather than oral estrogen and with explicit monitoring plans and shared decision-making documented [^1177diRo] [^114bKetC] [^1161VBcw] [^115cHjEW].

---

Oral estrogen is **contraindicated in acute viral hepatitis** and **decompensated cirrhosis** due to risks of severe liver injury, cholestasis, and hepatic tumors [^1177diRo] [^114bKetC]. In chronic viral hepatitis with preserved liver function, oral estrogen may be used with caution and close monitoring, but transdermal estrogen is preferred to minimize hepatic exposure [^1161VBcw]. Avoid oral estrogen in **hepatic adenomas**, **Budd-Chiari syndrome**, or when using **ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir** regimens [^1177diRo] [^116pmDVt]. If liver enzymes rise or symptoms develop, stop estrogen and reassess.

---

## Hepatic effects of oral estrogen

Oral estrogen undergoes **first-pass hepatic metabolism**, which can cause or worsen liver dysfunction, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease [^1161VBcw]. Key hepatic risks include:

- **Cholestasis**: Estrogen-induced impairment of bile flow, presenting as pruritus, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes [^115VFX4k].

- **Hepatic adenomas**: Benign liver tumors associated with long-term estrogen use, with risk of rupture and hemorrhage [^115YVD1Z].

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: Rare but reported with prolonged estrogen exposure [^117Lmypv].

- **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)**: Estrogen-related liver injury, including hepatocellular and cholestatic patterns [^115jjKzr].

---

## Clinical evidence in hepatitis patients

### Acute viral hepatitis

In acute viral hepatitis, oral estrogen is **contraindicated** due to the risk of severe liver injury, cholestasis, and impaired hepatic metabolism [^114bKetC]. Estrogen use during acute hepatitis can exacerbate liver inflammation and delay recovery.

---

### Chronic viral hepatitis

In chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), oral estrogen may be used cautiously if liver function is preserved, but **close monitoring is essential**. Evidence suggests:

- **Progression of fibrosis**: Estrogen may slow fibrosis progression in chronic HCV, possibly due to antifibrotic effects [^113rs3Kw].

- **Hepatic enzyme elevation**: Estrogen use can cause mild, transient liver enzyme elevations, typically resolving after discontinuation [^112TAAYp].

- **Hepatic tumors**: Increased risk of hepatic adenomas with long-term estrogen use, particularly in chronic liver disease [^notfound].

---

### Autoimmune hepatitis

In autoimmune hepatitis, estrogen use is **generally discouraged** due to potential immune modulation and hepatotoxicity. Estrogen may exacerbate immune-mediated liver injury and should be avoided in active disease.

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Oral estrogen use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute viral hepatitis | Contraindicated | Risk of severe liver injury and cholestasis [^115WxZmw] |
| Chronic viral hepatitis (compensated) | Use with caution | Monitor liver enzymes closely; transdermal preferred [^111V8KmD] |
| Decompensated cirrhosis | Contraindicated | Risk of worsening liver function and complications [^1177diRo] |
| Hepatic adenomas | Contraindicated | Risk of tumor growth and rupture [^112EdmE3] |
| Budd-Chiari syndrome | Contraindicated | Risk of thrombosis and liver congestion [^1177diRo] |
| Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir therapy | Contraindicated | Risk of severe ALT elevations [^116pmDVt] |

---

## Alternative therapies

When oral estrogen is contraindicated or poorly tolerated, **transdermal estrogen** is preferred because it avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism, reducing hepatic exposure and risk of liver injury [^1161VBcw]. Progestin-only contraceptives or non-hormonal alternatives may also be considered [^111kgKAY].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If oral estrogen is used in patients with hepatitis, **strict monitoring is essential**:

- **Liver function tests**: Baseline and periodic ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase.

- **Clinical symptoms**: Watch for jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, and fatigue.

- **Imaging**: Consider ultrasound for hepatic masses if symptoms or enzymes suggest pathology [^notfound].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop estrogen if significant enzyme elevations or symptoms occur.

---

Oral estrogen is **contraindicated in acute viral hepatitis** and decompensated cirrhosis due to risks of severe liver injury, cholestasis, and hepatic tumors. In chronic viral hepatitis with preserved liver function, it may be used cautiously with close monitoring, but transdermal estrogen is preferred. Avoid oral estrogen in hepatic adenomas, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or when using ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir regimens. If liver enzymes rise or symptoms develop, stop estrogen and reassess.

3. Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Loestrin is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience).

Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women (42–45). However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

4. Hepatic Neoplasia

Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use (46). Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (47, 48).

Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (49–51) in long-term (greater than 8 years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S., and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.

5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Loestrin prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see Contraindications). Loestrin can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.

Results

We identified 360 women who met the inclusion criteria for our study. Of all selected patients, a total of 287 patients (80%) returned the female hormonal status questionnaire (Radboudumc: 222, UK Leuven: 65) and were, therefore, eligible for analysis.

Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics for the whole group are presented in Table 1. Mean age at first available imaging was 50.2 years. Median hTLV was 2,095 mL/m (interquartile range: 1,419–3,015), and patients were classified as mild (30%), moderate (48%), and severe PLD (21%). Baseline characteristics for premenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups are presented in Table 2. Patients with imaging in the premenopausal phase were taller and more frequently had been breastfed compared with women who were included after menopause. Premenopausal women had significantly larger liver volumes. We were unable to use regularity of menstruation cycle as a potential confounder, due to missing data and unclear provided answers.

Baseline characteristics

Characteristics for menopausal status subgroups

Nonresponder analysis

Baseline characteristics of those who returned the questionnaire were not different compared with nonresponders.

Estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives

Patients who were exposed to estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives had a higher natural logarithmic (Ln) hTLV, although this association did not reach statistical significance in an unadjusted linear regression analysis (B = 0.0061; P = 0.09; Figure 1 a and Table 3). Menopausal status was the only confounder that altered the effect of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives on Ln hTLV by > 10%. After adjustment for this confounder, the correlation coefficient was 0.0068 (P = 0.06). Based on our hypothesis that disease progression differs before and after menopause, we repeated our analysis for both subgroups independently.

### Esterified estrogens, methyltestosterone (esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone) [^113KrP7u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Large doses of estrogen (5 mg esterified estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolic and thrombotic adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear risk.

b. Hepatic adenoma. Benign hepatic adenomas appear to be associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Although benign and rare, these may rupture and may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations but should be considered in estrogen users having abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or hypovolemic shock. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen- containing oral contraceptives. The relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is not known at this time.

c. Elevated blood pressure. Increased blood pressure is not uncommon in women using oral contraceptives. There is now a report that this may occur with use of estrogens in the menopause and blood pressure should be monitored with estrogen use, especially if high doses are used.

d. Glucose tolerance. A worsening of glucose tolerance has been observed in a significant percentage of patients of estrogen- containing oral contraceptives. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving estrogens.

### Sex differences in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: state of the art and identification of research gaps [^117Af2MW]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite tremendous research advancements in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), our understanding of sex differences in NAFLD remains insufficient. This review summarizes the current knowledge on sex differences in NAFLD, identifies gaps, and discusses important considerations for future research. The prevalence and severity of NAFLD are higher in men than in women during the reproductive age. However, after menopause, NAFLD occurs at a higher rate in women, suggesting that estrogen is protective. Sex differences also exist for the major risk factors of NAFLD. In general, animal models of NAFLD recapitulate the sex differences observed in patients, with more severe steatosis and steatohepatitis, more proinflammatory/profibrotic cytokines, and a higher incidence of hepatic tumors in male than female subjects. Based on computer modeling, female and male livers are metabolically distinct with unique regulators modulating sex-specific metabolic outcomes. Analysis of the literature reveals that most published clinical and epidemiological studies fail to examine sex differences appropriately. Considering the paucity of data on sex differences and the knowledge that regulators of pathways relevant to current therapeutic targets for NAFLD differ by sex, clinical trials should be designed to test drug efficacy and safety according to sex, age, reproductive stage (i.e., menopause), and synthetic hormone use. Conclusion: Sex differences do exist in the prevalence, risk factors, fibrosis, and clinical outcomes of NAFLD, suggesting that, while not yet incorporated, sex will probably be considered in future practice guidelines; adequate consideration of sex differences, sex hormones/menopausal status, age, and other reproductive information in clinical investigation and gene association studies of NAFLD are needed to fill current gaps and implement precision medicine for patients with NAFLD.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This was a randomized, single-center, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in healthy HIV-negative women, conducted within 1 menstrual cycle. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before the performance of any study-specific procedures. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice, all applicable subject privacy requirements, and the ethical principles that are outlined in the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the study site (Independent Investigational Review Board, Plantation, FL).

Healthy women, 18 to 40 years old, with body mass index 19 to 30 kg/m², body weight ≥ 50 kg and < 114 kg, and alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal were eligible. Women of childbearing potential were required to use NGM/EE in combination with 1 of the following contraceptive methods: complete abstinence from intercourse for at least 14 days before the first dose of study medication until after study monitoring, a barrier method plus a spermicide, or sterilization of male partner. Those positive for hepatitis B or C within 3 months of screening, those with current or chronic history of liver disease, and those with positive prestudy drug/alcohol or HIV test results as well as those who were pregnant or lactating, unwilling or unable to follow the protocol, and not using appropriate methods of contraception or abstaining from tobacco were excluded from the study. Women who had conditions or who were taking concurrent medications that would adversely affect hormone levels were also excluded.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114yGjPG]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Contraception in adolescents and women with chronic liver disease or transplant — Adolescents have an increased risk of unplanned pregnancy, and long-acting reversible contraceptives have advantages in this population. Pregnant adolescents with chronic liver disease require increased psychosocial support, necessitating close collaborations between pediatric and adult hepatologists, patient support (e.g., social workers), and maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Estrogen-containing agents should be avoided in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, BCS, hepatocellular adenomas, and transplant recipients with graft failure. Patients using agents other than long-acting reversible contraceptives are encouraged to combine these with a barrier method given their higher failure rates; this is particularly important for women taking teratogenic medications, such as mycophenolic acid (MPA) products. All forms of emergency contraception may be used in the setting of chronic liver disease.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115gjbqr]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Contraceptive options in chronic liver disease — contraceptive discussions should incorporate shared decision making with patients to maximize their adherence and satisfaction with selected methods; a common reference for contraceptive safety in women with medical conditions is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC), and this guidance provides recommendations for contraception use in female patients with medical conditions, including those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), and solid-organ transplant, and notes instances in which the AASLD guidance recommendations may differ from the MEC.

### Progestin-induced liver injury in an asymptomatic patient [^114rT8SF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

We report a case of a female in her mid-40s diagnosed as norethisterone-induced liver injury. Our patient presented to the medical gastroenterology clinic with an incidental finding of progressively increasing transaminases. A detailed evaluation strongly supported our suspicion of progestin-induced liver disease with prompt reversal after discontinuation of norethisterone. Various clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of norethisterone suggest that liver injury is not a common adverse event associated with norethisterone use. Oestrogens are more commonly, and progestogens are less frequently, associated with a spectrum of liver abnormalities, including hepatocellular or cholestatic types of injury, peliosis hepatitis and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. It may be a completely incidental finding, as in our patient. Our patient lacks cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia, which are typically associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), or alcohol use. Awareness of rare adverse drug reactions, as in this case with norethisterone, is vital for prompt diagnosis and effective management and hence prevention of potential morbidity and mortality. We discuss the various aspects of evaluating suspected drug-induced liver injury, combining clinical assessment with the use of diagnostic tools such as Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method to aid in identifying the offending agent.

Regarding specific circumstances for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to patients with specific phenotypes (liver tumors), EASL 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- oral contraceptives are risk factors for the development of hepatic adenoma.

- androgens and androgenic steroids are risk factors for the development of liver tumors, particularly in the context of treating bone marrow failure.

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^1137MWTH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Female patients with polycystic liver disease (PLD) are more at risk to develop severe hepatomegaly compared with men. It is thought that exposure to estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and a history of pregnancies influence the disease course in PLD. However, the evidence in literature is contradicting.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ We assessed whether estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and/or pregnancies are associated with PLD severity expressed as height‐adjusted total liver volume (hTLV) menopausal and postmenopausal patients.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ In this large cross‐sectional cohort study, we demonstrate that use of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives worsens PLD severity in premenopausal patients. Every year of exposure correlates with a 1.45% higher hTLV, which corresponds to a 15.5% higher hTLV for every 10 years of use, compared with unexposed women.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ With these findings, we legitimize our current counseling advice in the outpatient clinic with evidence and underline the importance to avoid estrogen use in patients with PLD. Clinicians should advise their patients to use nonhormonal contraceptives.

### Safety of hormonal contraception among women with liver disease: an updated systematic review [^1162XjMz]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to assess whether, among women with liver disease, there is an increased risk of adverse health effects with use of hormonal contraception (HC).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of six databases from database inception through December 13, 2022. We searched for articles that examined changes in liver lesions and acute and chronic liver disease with use of HC or after discontinuation of HC. We assessed risk of bias for each study and certainty of evidence for all outcomes.

Results

Thirteen articles met inclusion criteria, one with low risk of bias and the others with high risk of bias: three studies (four articles) were of women with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), five studies were of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and four studies were of acute or chronic hepatitis. The size and/or number of FNH lesions were generally not influenced by HC use. HCA progression was generally higher among current combined oral contraception (COC) users than those who discontinued, and lesions were stable or regressed in most women who discontinued COC or used progestin-only contraception. Studies found that viral hepatitis generally did not progress or increase in severity with use of COC.

Conclusion

Overall, a limited body of evidence suggested changes in FNH lesions were independent of hormonal contraceptive use. Estrogen-containing contraceptive method use was associated with HCA lesion progression; lesions generally remained stable with progestin-only contraceptive use. COC use did not increase progression or severity of disease among those with viral hepatitis. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low.

Implications

Liver conditions such as liver lesions, viral hepatitis, and cirrhosis are increasingly common in women of reproductive age. Information in this review can be used by health care providers when counseling women with liver disease about safe use of contraception.

VIORELE®can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1173DhAG]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Menopause and hormone therapy in liver disease — Menopause is the process of reproductive aging, characterized by ovarian senescence, hormonal changes, and cessation of menses. Hormonal therapy is effective for menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone loss and fractures, and hormone replacement therapy is used in the management of menopausal symptoms and bone health. There is concern about cholestatic effects of estrogens, particularly in women with existing cholestatic liver disease; however, topical, oral, and parenteral forms of estrogen-containing hormone therapy appear to be safe in women with PBC.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112CMips]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Hepatic disease and viral hepatitis screening before hormonal contraceptive initiation — evidence and U.S. epidemiology — notes that a systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptive use. Reported U.S. data include that during 2012 among women the percentage with liver disease was 1.3%, during 2013 the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was 1.3 per 100,000 U.S. population, and during 2002–2011 the incidence of liver cancer among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111n2uRk]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — viral hepatitis, chronic: Initiation is category 1 and continuation is category 1. Evidence indicates that in women with chronic viral hepatitis, COC use does not increase the risk or severity of fibrosis or the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and does not appear to trigger severe liver dysfunction.

### Thyroid, porcine [^117V1SYm]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives — Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine (T4) may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient's thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free levothyroxine (T4) will result in a compensatory increase in levothyroxine (T4) output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions — The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine-containing preparations, and the numerous preparations containing salicylates.

Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine (T3) values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens, and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase TBg concentrations. TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly, and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9,000. The binding of levothyroxine by TBPA is inhibited by salicylates.

### Conjugated estrogens / bazedoxifene (Duavee) [^117Beobq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

DUAVEE is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of DUAVEE have not been evaluated in women with hepatic impairment. In a pharmacokinetics study of bazedoxifene 20 mg alone, the Cmaxand AUC of bazedoxifene increased 67% and 143%, respectively, in women with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A), compared to healthy women. The Cmaxand AUC of bazedoxifene increased 32% and 109%, respectively, in women with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B). The Cmaxand AUC of bazedoxifene increased 20% and 268%, respectively, in women with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C).

No pharmacokinetic studies with conjugated estrogens were conducted in women with hepatic impairment.

8.8 Body Mass Index (BMI)

Following DUAVEE administration, the systemic exposures of conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene were lower in obese subjects, compared to non-obese subjects [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

A single dose of DUAVEE (conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg) was administered to 12 obese BMI ≥ 30 [mean (SD) = 32.7 (2.7) kg/m²] and 12 non-obese BMI < 30 [mean (SD) 25.3 (2.6) kg/m²] postmenopausal women. In obese subjects, systemic exposures of total estrone, total equilin, and bazedoxifene were 2%, 32%, and 13% lower, respectively, compared to non-obese subjects.

A greater reduction in bazedoxifene exposure compared to conjugated estrogens may be associated with decreased protection from endometrial hyperplasia. Monitor and evaluate women with postmenopausal or unexplained genital bleeding for possible endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^114kuNYf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal

In postmenopausal women, cumulative exposure to estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives was not correlated with Ln hTLV (B = 0.0018; P = 0.67; Figure 1 c). Center, age at menarche, breastfeeding duration, hysterectomy, and intrauterine device (IUD) use were confounders as they changed the correlation coefficient by > 10%. After adjustment for these confounders, the association was not different (B = 0.0017; P = 0.70). Sensitivity analysis, excluding patients with imputed menopausal status, did not change results (B = −0.0012; P = 0.80; Table 3).

There were no differences in estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives use among disease severity groups in postmenopausal women (Figure 2 b).

Pregnancy

Pregnancy duration

Duration of pregnancy (in months) was not correlated with Ln hTLV in the univariable analysis (B = −0.0024; P = 0.40) or after adjustment for the confounders diagnosis, age, fertility treatment, and hysterectomy (B = −0.0011; P = 0.69). Similar results were found in a subgroup analysis as no correlation was found in premenopausal (B = −0.0026; P = 0.54) or postmenopausal women (B = −0.0011; P = 0.80; Table 3).

Parity

In an unadjusted analysis, nulliparous women (n = 50) had a 3.19% higher hTLV compared with parous women (n = 236; B = 0.0314; P = 0.71). After adjustment for center, diagnosis, age at scan, estrogen‐containing oral contraceptive use, fertility treatment, and hysterectomy, the difference was 4.97% (B = 0.0485; P = 0.56).

### Tamoxifen for hepatocellular carcinoma [^112F5Zkd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is the third commonest cause of cancer mortality world-wide. Survival is poor for patients with advanced disease. Trials of tamoxifen for hepatocellular carcinoma have conflicting results.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the effect of tamoxifen on overall survival, quality-of-life, tumour response, and treatment toxicity in people with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Search Strategy

We identified trials from The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (January 2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003), and MEDLINE database (1966 to November 2003). We searched bibliographies of review articles and identified trials, and hand-searched abstracts from relevant other meetings.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials of treatment with tamoxifen compared to a control treatment without tamoxifen in people with hepatocellular carcinoma, including trials of tamoxifen versus placebo, tamoxifen versus best supportive care, and tamoxifen plus other treatment versus the same other treatment alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent reviewers selected studies for inclusion, rated them for methodologic quality components (generation of allocation sequence; allocation concealment; blinding; and follow-up), and extracted data on the specified outcomes. Hazard ratios were derived for overall survival where possible. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Ten randomised trials randomising 1709 patients were included. Tamoxifen versus placebo/no intervention had no significant effect on overall survival (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16; P = 0.4). This comparison showed no statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.2 and I² = 25.9%). Subgroup analysis showed that tamoxifen tended to increase mortality in trials with three adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 1.15; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.34; P = 0.06), showed no significant effect in trials with two adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18; P = 0.98), and tended to reduce mortality in trials with one or less adequate/three methodological components (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; P = 0.2), although this may have been confounded by the use of higher doses of tamoxifen in the better quality trials. Tamoxifen was associated with adverse effects. One trial measured patient quality of life, but the results were not reported in detail.

Reviewers' Conclusions

These data do not support the use of tamoxifen for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Further research on the effects of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma does not seem warranted.

### Hepatic complications of oral contraceptive pills and estrogen on MRI: controversies and update-adenoma and beyond [^1114TZKK]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatic complications of oral contraceptive pills and exogenous estrogens include intrahepatic canalicular cholestasis, neoplasm formation and vascular pathologies. While it remains controversial as to whether estrogen plays a role in focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma or hamartoma, exposure to oral contraceptive pills and estrogen has a strong association with hepatic adenomas. Four different subgroups of adenomas have been described: Inflammatory, HNF-1α-mutated, β-catenin-mutated and unclassified. Vascular complications may include Budd-Chiari syndrome, vascular thrombosis, dilated sinusoids and peliosis.

### Raloxifene hydrochloride is an adjuvant antiviral treatment of postmenopausal women with chronic hepatitis C: a randomized trial [^115isGpn]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Early menopause in women with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a low likelihood of a sustained virological response (SVR) in conjunction with their antiviral treatment. This is potentially related to their reduced estrogen secretion. The study was done to determine whether selective estrogen receptor modulator administration might improve the efficacy of the current standard of care (SOC) treatment, pegylated interferon (PegIFN) α2a plus ribavirin (RBV), for postmenopausal women.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-three postmenopausal women with genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: raloxifene hydrochloride (RLX) (60 mg/day) plus SOC (PegIFNα2a 180 μg/week and RBV 600–1,000 mg/day) (n = 62) or SOC only (n = 61). Genotyping was performed of the polymorphism in the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene region (rs8099917) of DNA collected from each patient.

Results

One RLX-treated patient discontinued RLX because of a systemic rash following 2 weeks of treatment. Twenty-four weeks after treatment, the SVR rate was significantly higher for RLX plus SOC patients (61.3%) than for SOC only patients (34.4%) (p = 0.0051). Further, the SVR rate was significantly higher for RLX plus SOC patients with IL28B TT (72.5%) than for SOC only patients with IL28B TT (39.2%) (p = 0.0014), but no such relationship was observed in patients carrying the minor IL28B allele.

Conclusions

RLX improved the efficacy of SOC in the treatment of postmenopausal women with chronic hepatitis C. RLX shows promise as an adjuvant to the standard antiviral treatment of such patients.

### Elagolix (Orilissa) [^1128qd5b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hepatic Transaminase Elevations

In clinical trials, dose-dependent elevations of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at least 3-times the upper limit of the reference range occurred with ORILISSA. Use the lowest effective dose of ORILISSA and instruct patients to promptly seek medical attention in case of symptoms or signs that may reflect liver injury, such as jaundice. Promptly evaluate patients with elevations in liver tests to determine whether the benefits of continued therapy outweigh the risks [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5 Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives

Advise women to use effective non-hormonal contraceptives during treatment with ORILISSA and for 28 days after discontinuing ORILISSA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Increase in Estrogen Exposure and Potential Associated Increased Risks When ORILISSA 200 mg Twice Daily is Taken With Combined Hormonal Contraceptives

Co-administration of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) (containing 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/0.1 mg levonorgestrel) following administration of ORILISSA 200 mg twice daily for 14 days increases the plasma ethinyl estradiol concentration by 2.2-fold compared to this COC alone. ORILISSA 200 mg twice daily co-administered with a COC containing ethinyl estradiol may lead to increased risk of ethinyl estradiol-related adverse events including thromboembolic disorders and vascular events and is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Potential for Reduced Efficacy of Progestin -Containing Hormonal Contraceptives

Co-administration of ORILISSA 200 mg twice daily and a COC containing 0.1 mg levonorgestrel decreases the plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel by 27%, potentially affecting contraceptive efficacy. Co-administration of ORILISSA with COCs containing norethindrone acetate did not show reduction in plasma concentrations of norethindrone [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Co-administration of ORILISSA with progestin-containing intrauterine contraceptive systems has not been studied.

Reduced efficacy of ORILISSA

Based on the mechanism of action of ORILISSA, estrogen-containing contraceptives are expected to reduce the efficacy of ORILISSA. The effect of progestin-only contraceptives on the efficacy of ORILISSA is unknown.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^113zK6uD]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Sex hormone — binding globulin and free T — determinants and clinical associations: Concentrations of sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) are a major determinant of total T levels, with increases seen with aging, hyperthyroidism, estrogens, HIV disease, hepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis, and anticonvulsant use, and low SHBG in obesity, DM2, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, acromegaly, and androgenic steroid use; visceral adiposity and insulin resistance–related low SHBG is not well understood but is key to understanding low T in men with AOH. SHBG production is controlled by numerous metabolic and hormonal factors, SHBG is low in inflammatory states including obesity and insulin resistance and low levels predict development of MetS and DM2, whereas high SHBG levels are found with hyperthyroidism, hepatitis C, and oral estrogen treatments.

### The effects of hormonal contraceptive use among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver: a systematic review [^112TAAYp]. Contraception (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This report evaluates the effects of hormonal contraceptive use among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver.

Methods

PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to June 2008 for publications that examined the use of hormonal contraceptives among women with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver.

Results

Six studies met the inclusion criteria. In one study of acute hepatitis, combined oral contraceptive (COC) use did not affect duration of hospitalization or successful disease resolution. The remainder of the studies examined chronic hepatitis or its sequelae. Women recovered from hepatitis experienced transaminase elevation with COC use which resolved after 4 weeks in one study or increased slightly over 6 months in another study. Hepatitis B virus carriers using COCs had similar transaminase levels as nonusing carriers over 6 months. Studies of chronic hepatitis C infection demonstrated no influence of COC use on progression or severity of liver fibrosis or development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Conclusion

Data from one study suggest that COCs do not affect the course of acute hepatitis. Limited data from studies on chronic hepatitis or its sequelae suggest that COC use does not affect the rate of progression or severity of cirrhotic fibrosis, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in women with chronic hepatitis, or the risk of liver dysfunction in hepatitis B virus carriers.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1161VBcw]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Gallbladder and liver effects of hormone therapy: Postmenopausal use of estrogen is associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and cholecystectomy, without an associated risk of biliary cancer demonstrated, and the transdermal route, which bypasses first-pass metabolism, has been associated with less risk of gallbladder disease in observational studies. In the WHI, the attributable risk for gallbladder disease as self-reported was an additional 47 cases per 10,000 women per year for CEE plus MPA and 58 cases per 10,000 women per year for CEE, both statistically significant (P < .001). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is more common after the menopause transition when the prevalence surpasses men, and older women have higher rates of severe hepatic fibrosis and greater mortality compared with men. Key points note that observational studies report lower risk of gallstones with transdermal hormone therapy than with oral, and with oral estradiol compared with CEE, but neither observation is confirmed in RCTs (Level II), and that in women with hepatitis C and with fatty liver, a slower fibrosis progression has been observed with use of hormone therapy, but RCTs are needed (Level II).

### Cancers attributable to exposure to hormones in the UK in 2010 [^117Lmypv]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Liver cancer

Although thereview concluded that combined oral oestrogen–progestogen contraceptives are carcinogenic for the liver, the conclusion was based on a selected group of case–control studies (in populations with 'low prevalence of hepatitis B viral infection and chronic liver disease'), with no cohort studies providing a conclusive result. A more recent meta-analysis of case–control studies did not obtain a conclusive result based on 12 case–control studies (pooled estimate of ORs 1.57 (95% CI = 0.96–2.54, P = 0.07)), or eight studies reporting adjusted ORs (in addition to age and sex) – the pooled estimate was 1.45 (95% CI = 0.93–2.27, P = 0.11).

In any case, liver cancer is rare in UK, and there were only some 190 cases below age 50 in UK in 2005; therefore, the number of cases possibly attributable to OC use is trivial.

Risks of post-menopausal hormone therapy

Breast cancer

The magnitude of the risk of postmenopausal hormone therapy for the risk of breast cancer has been quantified based on studies in the USA, Europe and the UK. In the Million Women Study for example, the RR of breast cancer in current users of HRT was 1.66 (95% CI 1.58–1.75, P < 0.0001). Incidence was significantly increased for current users of preparations containing oestrogen only (1.30), progestogen only (2.02), oestrogen–progestogen (2.00) and tibolone (1.45). Results varied little between specific oestrogens and progestogens or their doses, or between continuous and sequential regimens. Past users of HRT were, however, not at an increased risk of disease (1.01 (0.94–1.09)). In past users, the risk of breast cancer did not differ significantly from that of never users of HRT, for use that ceased at < 5 years, 5–9 years and ⩾10 years previously, although among women who ceased use of HRT in the previous year, the RR of breast cancer was slightly increased (1.14 (1.01–1.28)). The ERRs are shown in Table 4.

### Fibrinogen storage disease without hypofibrinogenemia associated with estrogen therapy [^116L9nha]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cytoplasmic inclusions in hepatocytes are encountered in a wide range of clinical conditions including chronic hepatitis B, α₁-antitrypsin deficiency, type IV glycogenosis, Lafora's disease, fibrinogen storage disease, and in drug reactions. Endoplasmic Reticulum Storage Disease (ERSD) of the liver is a pathological condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of proteins destined for secretion in the endoplasmic reticulum. The term ERSD encompasses α 1 -antitrypsin deficiency, the prototype disorder, plus fibrinogen storage disease and α₁-antichymotrypsin deficiency. ERSD can be congenital or acquired. The congenital form is associated with the accumulation of only one protein, due to its altered structure. The accumulation is permanent and affects mainly the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The most common cause of this condition is α1-antitrypsin deficiency. Acquired [secondary] form occurs due to exogenous agents or in the presence of concomitant diseases such as infections, and therefore structurally normal proteins accumulate in several cellular organelles.

In this article, we report a case of fibrinogen storage disease of the liver secondary to the use of oral contraceptives. This is the first reported case of fibrinogen storage disease secondary to estrogen ingestion. Informed consent was obtained from the patient regarding her recruitment in this case study.

### Estrogens, esterified and methyltestosterone (Covaryx) [^1167XaCo]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

There is evidence that the risk of several of these adverse reactions is related to the dose of the drug.32,33 An increased risk of postsurgery thromboembolic complications has also been reported in users of oral contraceptives.34,35 If feasible, estrogen should be discontinued at least 4 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. While an increased rate of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease in postmenopausal users of estrogens has not been found,18–36 this does not rule out the possibility that such an increase may be present or that subgroups of women who have underlying risk factors or who are receiving relatively large doses of estrogens may have increased risk. Therefore estrogens should not be used in persons with active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders, and they should not be used (except in treatment of malignancy) in persons with a history of such disorders in association with estrogen use. They should be used with caution in patients with cerebral vascular or coronary artery disease and only for those in whom estrogens are clearly needed. Large doses of estrogen (5 mg esterified estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men37 to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolic and thrombotic adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear risk. Hepatic Adenoma: Benign hepatic adenomas appear to be associated with the use of oral contraceptives.38–40 Although benign and rare, these may rupture and may cause death through intra abdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations but should be considered in estrogen users having abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or hypovolemic shock. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.30 The relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is not known at this time.

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^115EKhYe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and history of pregnancies with disease severity in women with polycystic liver disease (PLD) is unclear. We performed a cross-sectional cohort study to assess this association by selecting female patients with PLD of which imaging was available prior to any liver volume-reducing therapy. Patients received a questionnaire to collect detailed information on estrogen use and pregnancies. Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed on premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. The questionnaire was returned by 287 of 360 selected patients (80%). There was no significant association between estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and height-adjusted total liver volume (hTLV) in the total group (P = 0.06) and postmenopausal subgroup (P = 0.7). By contrast, each year of exposure corresponds with a 1.45% higher hTLV (P = 0.02) in the premenopausal subgroup, equivalent to a 15.5% higher hTLV for every 10 years of use. Pregnancy duration was not associated with hTLV. In conclusion, patients with PLD should avoid exogenous estrogens.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol [^1142BYnV]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with and without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as CHCs. Discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications (4)]. Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111kgKAY]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Progestin-only contraceptives in liver disease — Progestin-only pills, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections, and the subcutaneous implants do not have estrogen-associated risks. Failure rates with progestin-only pills are approximately 9% and require strict adherence to timing of daily dosing. DMPA injections, administered every 12 weeks, have a typical failure rate of approximately 6% and delay return to fertility up to 18 months; DMPA has a black box warning for decreased bone density, which normalizes with cessation of use. The subcutaneous implant is considered a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) and has the lowest failure rate (0.05%); it is associated with minimal to no bone loss and may be used for up to 3 years. No prospective studies have evaluated HCA growth with progestin-only agents.

### Estradiol pellet (estra-50) [^117YR4MY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Large doses of estrogens (5mg conjugated estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men37to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolicand thrombotic adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear risk.

b. Hepatic adenoma. Benign hepatic adenomas appear to be associated with the use of oral contraceptives.38–40Although benign, and rare, these may rupture and may cause death through intraabdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations but should be considered in estrogen users having abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or hypovolemic shock. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.39The relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is not know at this time.

c. Elevated blood pressure. Increased blood pressure is not uncommon in women using oral contraceptives. There is now a report that this may occur with the use of estrogens in menopause41and blood pressure should be monitored with estrogen use, especially if high doses are used.

d. Glucose tolerance. A worsening of glucose tolerance has been observed in a significant percentage of patients on estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving estrogen.

4. Hypercalcemia. Administration of estrogens may lead to severe hypercalceemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. If this occurs, the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.

### Fibrinogen storage disease without hypofibrinogenemia associated with estrogen therapy [^112xtXUn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

We ascribed the findings of chronic hepatitis and mild fibrotic activity in our patient to fibrinogen storage. Indeed, cases without hypofibrinogenemia, as well as those with hereditary hypofibrinogenemia and those that have a mutational basis, were shown to develop chronic hepatitis, fibrosis or cirrhosis, in the literature. Importantly, low levels of fibrinogen does not necessarily accompany the hepatic storage of fibrinogen, which was the case in our patient. This may also support the secondary, acquired nature of the disease.

Relying on the results explained above, we conclude that, in our patient an oral regimen of estrogen is associated with fibrinogen storage disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported to date to show hepatic fibrinogen storage secondary to estrogen ingestion. The liver biopsies of patients with idiopathic liver enzyme abnormalities should be carefully evaluated for cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and, although rare, fibrinogen deposits.

### Natural history and management of hepatitis C: does sex play a role? [^112Rijpk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus infection is a disease that disproportionately affects men more than women. After initial HCV infection, women are more likely to clear the virus spontaneously. Women also have slower rates of liver disease progression than men if they become chronically infected. However, this rate of disease progression changes over time in women. Postmenopausal women have increased rates of fibrosis compared with women of reproductive age because they have lost the protective effects of estrogen. Estradiol and estrogen receptors in the liver protect hepatocytes from oxidative stress, inflammatory injury, and cell death, which all contribute to fibrosis. As a consequence of the overall slower liver disease progression and increased viral clearance in women, the disease burden from HCV infection is found predominantly in men. Although some studies have suggested higher sustained virologic response rates in HCV-infected women receiving dual therapy for HCV infection, this seems to be less important in the direct-acting antiviral era, when response rates for HCV therapy have increased so substantially that baseline demographic factors seem to have less of an effect on overall rates of cure.

### Repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19: an endocrinology perspective [^116V1p8B]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

However, while COVID-19 has been extensively correlated with thrombotic events of different natures through a range of underlying mechanisms, and has become a major player in the COVID-19 pathogenesis, estrogens have been historically correlated with increased thromboembolic events, which could be a limiting argument for its use in COVID-19. Nonetheless, while endogenous estradiol is only correlated with this nature of events when associated with increased free testosterone and decreased se hormone binding globulin (SHBG), the correlation of exogenous estrogens and thromboembolism is largely justified by the route of administration, orally administered estrogens lead to increased hepatic production of pro-coagulants induced by its first liver first-passage effect, that does not occur in non-oral regimens. Indeed, large observational studies and a meta-analysis have shown no increased risk of thromboembolism among women taking non-oral estrogen replacement therapies.

Collectively, the prevailing possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19 indicates this as a potential therapeutic target for the first and second stages of COVID-19 to prevent more severe complications, although oral regimens must be avoided to prevent synergistic effects with the pro-thrombotic stage inherent to COVID-19.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as a major independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, while the level of glucose control on T2DM may be one of the drivers of severity of COVID-19, particularly before hospitalization, through glucose and non-glucose mediated. Overall, in addition to the glucose lowering effects, anti-diabetic drugs may exhibit additional pleiotropic effects specific to each class, that offer unspecific and viral-specific protection patterns, and have been hypothesized as potential agents against COVID-19.

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^1131Vwku]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Premenopausal

Unadjusted linear regression analysis showed an association (B = 0.0156; P < 0.01) between estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and Ln hTLV in premenopausal patients (Figure 1 b). Diagnosis, duration of breastfeeding, and fertility treatment were identified as confounders as they changed the correlation coefficient by > 10%. After adjustment for these confounders, the association between use of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and Ln hTLV remained significant (B = 0.0144; P = 0.02; Table 3). After back‐transforming, this association can be interpreted as an estimated 1.45% higher hTLV per year of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptive use compared with women who never used estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives. We performed a sensitivity analysis using the same model, in which we excluded patients with imputed menopausal status. In 111 patients, the correlation coefficient remained unchanged (B = 0.0143; P = 0.05; 1.44% higher hTLV per year of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptive use).

When dividing all premenopausal patients into disease severity groups, total years of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives use was significantly higher in the severe group when compared with the mild group (P = 0.001) and significantly higher in the moderate group when compared with the mild group (P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between the severe and moderate groups (P = 0.17; Figure 2 a).

### Combined small molecule and loss-of-function screen uncovers estrogen receptor alpha and CAD as host factors for HDV infection and antiviral targets [^115PtwDC]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infects human hepatocytes and causes acute acerbation of liver disease in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Among HBV-infected patients, 5%–10% are coinfected with HDV.HDV coinfection or surinfection in HBV carriers induces more severe disease compared with infection with HBV alone. This includes a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure and a more rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with a markedly increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, chronic hepatitis D is considered as one of the most severe forms of viral hepatitis. Treatment with HBV nucleos(t)ide analogues is not effective at reducing HDV replication or disease. Moreover, the virus is only poorly controlled by the current interferon (IFN)-based therapies. To date, no treatment allows efficient cure of hepatitis D with eradication of the virus and its associated disease. Thus, there is a major unmet medical need for curative therapies.

### Estrogen replacement reduces risk and increases survival times of women with hepatocellular carcinoma [^116srPCc]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Environmental factors have been identified that affect risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about the effects of sex hormones on liver cancer development or outcome. The authors investigated whether menopause hormone therapy (MHT) affects risk, age at onset, or outcome of HCC.

Methods

We performed a case-control study of 234 female patients treated for HCC at a tertiary medical center and with 282 healthy women (controls) from January 1, 2004 through May 31, 2015. We collected detailed information on environmental exposures, ages of menarche and menopause, hysterectomies, and uses of birth control and MHT. We performed multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses to determine the independent effects of factors associated with women on risk and clinical outcome in HCC. The primary outcomes were effect of MHT on HCC risk, the relationship between MHT with hepatitis virus infection on HCC development, and effect of MHT on age at HCC onset or survival after diagnosis of HCC.

Results

The estimated adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for HCC in women who ever used estrogen was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32–0.88). This association was supported by the older age of HCC onset among estrogen users (mean, 64.5 ± 0.9 years) vs nonusers (mean 59.2 ± 1.1 years; p = 0.001) and the reduced risk of HCC among long-term users (more than 5 years) (AOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.63). Users of estrogen also had a reduced risk for hepatitis-associated HCC: AOR for users, 4.37 (95% CI, 1.67–11.44) vs AOR for nonusers, 17.60 (95% CI, 3.88–79.83). Estrogen use reduced risk of death from HCC (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.40–0.77; p = 0.01). Median overall survival times were 33.5 months for estrogen users (95% CI, 25.7–41.3 months) and 24.1 months for nonusers (95% CI, 19.02–29.30 months; p = 0.008).

Conclusion

In a case-control study of women with HCC vs female control subjects at a single center, we associated use of estrogen MHT with reduced risk of HCC and increased overall survival times of patients with HCC. Further studies are needed to determine the benefits of estrogen therapy for women and patients with HCC, and effects of tumor expression of estrogen receptor.

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^113vFcaX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

This study comes with several limitations. First, the cross‐sectional nature of this study complicates drawing firm conclusions on the true effect size of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives use on PLD severity. However, because of the growing body of evidence and the already widely accepted management advice, it is very unlikely that a prospective controlled trial will be conducted in the future. Second, we were not able to analyze the effect of different types of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives or dosage because of missing data and recall bias. Most patients reported used combined oral contraceptives (estrogen and progestin); therefore, we cannot exclude a potential effect of progestins on liver volume. Third, we could not exclude selection bias, as these findings are solely based on patients from national referral centers in which imaging was performed. Despite this limitation, we were able to collect data from a large, clinically representative cohort.

In conclusion, the use of estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives is associated with a higher liver volume in premenopausal patients with PLD. With these findings, we legitimize our current counseling advice in the outpatient clinic with evidence and underline the importance to avoid estrogen use in patients with PLD. Clinicians should advise their patients to use nonhormonal contraceptives. We advise clinicians to counsel daughters of patients with PLD to avoid exogenous estrogen exposure until it has been confirmed that they did not inherit the disease.

### Neutral effect of prolonged transdermal hormone therapy on liver function of postmenopausal women with chronic active hepatitis [^111V8KmD]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To test whether transdermal hormone therapy can be safely administered to postmenopausal women with chronic viral hepatitis B and/or C.

Design

Eighty-one postmenopausal women with chronic viral hepatitis B and/or C and with severe vasomotor symptoms were treated for 5 years with transdermal estradiol (50 microg/day) continuously and with transdermal norethisterone (250 microg/day) for 14 days of every 28-day cycle. Another 95 women with viral chronic hepatitis but without climacteric symptoms were used as controls. Liver enzymes (glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, gamma-glutamine-transferase, and alkaline phosphatase) were measured every year.

Results

At baseline, liver enzymes were similar in the two groups, with the exception of gamma-GT, which was slightly higher in untreated women (P < 0.01). Liver enzymes did not significantly vary with time in hormone-treated and untreated women. No significant difference was observed between the two groups.

Conclusions

Transdermal estradiol and norethisterone can be safely administered for a prolonged period to postmenopausal women with chronic viral B and/or C hepatitis.

### Porphyria cutanea tarda unmasked by supratherapeutic estrogen during gender-affirming hormone therapy [^114hcJTW]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we report a case of PCT arising in a male-to-female transgender patient on gender-affirming HT. In PCT, decreased uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase activity in hepatocytes leads to the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, provoking photosensitivity. PCT is uncommon but has been associated with estrogen, iron accumulation, hepatotoxins, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, hepatitis C, HIV, and mutations in the hemochromatosis alleles, HFE C282Y and H63D.

A growing number of patients are seeking out gender-affirming HT to achieve physical, emotional, and social characteristics consistent with their gender identity. The prolonged need to suppress endogenous sex hormone secretion and maintain hormone levels within the range consistent with gender identity exposes transgender patients to higher hormone doses relative to other indications for hormone administration. Lack of strong evidence-based guidelines and inadequate provider training regarding the optimal drugs, dosage, and routes lead to significant variability in gender-affirming HT regimens. Treatment is often guided by patients eager to maximize resultsand based on social media reports of what has worked for others. Pharmacokinetic variability is further driven by cost and drug shortages, which prompt changes in formulation and potential use of black-market products.

Our patient had PCT after 23 years taking 1 to 4 mg oral estradiol therapy daily. She had intermittently been on progesterone, and immediately prior to the onset of her symptoms simultaneously increased her estradiol and began a trial of oral micronized progesterone. Her subsequent supratherapeutic serum estrogen prompted discontinuation of micronized progesterone and a 1-month break in estradiol followed by dose reduction. The timeline suggests that supratherapeutic estrogen may have combined with other risk factors (HFE heterozygosity and tobacco and alcohol use) to trigger PCT. She previously tolerated 4 mg estradiol daily, raising concern that combination with micronized progesterone (selected for promotional pricing and reported anxiolytic effects) may have also contributed. Although total estrogen was elevated (goal, 600–1000 pg/mL), serum estradiol and prescribed HT dosing were within published expert opinion–based guidelines.

The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available. There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs. However, based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs, clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested.

Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations.

No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives.

Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs:

Table 4 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs:

Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:

Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with some HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir), some HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir), and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine).

In contrast, significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) and with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., etravirine).

3. Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Kariva®is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing Experience).

Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in some populations of women (48). However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

4. Hepatic neoplasia

Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose (49). Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (50, 51).

Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (43 to 45) in long-term (> 8 years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the US and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.

5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Kariva®prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Kariva®can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.

Clinical Trials Data Regarding Safety of Testosterone

Short-term safety

Testosterone preparations, specifically IM, subcutaneous implants, and oral formulations (methyltestosterone 1.25–2.5 mg or testosterone undecanoate 40 mg), often in combination with estrogen therapies, have been evaluated in RCTs with relatively few participants and followed for relatively short periods of time. The longest duration placebo-controlled trial (24 months) included 331 subjects. These preparations are not commonly used currently. IM administration is associated with wide excursions of serum testosterone concentrations well beyond physiological levels; subcutaneous implants occasionally yield markedly elevated testosterone levels with erratic release over time and difficulty locating for removal if necessary. Oral testosterone undecanoate was associated with unpredictable absorption and blood levels in the male range, even at the lowest dose studied.

In a meta-analysis of 36 trials enrolling 8,480 women with duration of 12 weeks–2 years, testosterone administration (oral preparations in approximately half the trials; IM injection, subcutaneous pellets, and transdermal preparations in the remainder) increased the risk of developing acne (relative risk 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.92) and hair growth (relative risk 1.69; 95% CI 1.33–2.14). Findings were comparable with a prior meta-analysis. No significant improvement was noted for bone mineral density, body composition, or cognitive measures, although an overall increase in weight was recorded with testosterone treatment. Lipid effects included reduction in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels along with a statistically significant increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with oral but not with transdermal testosterone preparations. Also, these older oral formulations are no longer recommended because of concerns with negative hepatic effects such as peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma.

### Tamoxifen for adults with hepatocellular carcinoma [^114wu7nL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 70% to 85% of individuals with primary liver cancer. Tamoxifen has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials in people with hepatocellular cancer. The reported results have been inconsistent.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus any other anticancer drugs compared with no intervention, placebo, any type of standard care, or alternative treatment in adults with hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of sex, administered dose, type of formulation, and duration of treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and major trials registries, and handsearched reference lists up to 26 March 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

Parallel-group randomised clinical trials including adults (aged 18 years and above) diagnosed with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Had we found cross-over trials, we would have included only the first trial phase. We did not consider data from quasi-randomised trials for analysis.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. Our important outcomes were disease progression, and adverse events considered non-serious.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods and Review Manager. We meta-analysed the outcome data at the longest follow-up. We presented the results of dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous data as mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. We summarised the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Included Studies

We included 10 trials that randomised 1715 participants with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Six were single-centre trials conducted in Hong Kong, Italy, and Spain, while three were conducted as multicentre trials in single countries (France, Italy, and Spain), and one trial was conducted in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand). The experimental intervention was tamoxifen in all trials. The control interventions were no intervention (three trials), placebo (six trials), and symptomatic treatment (one trial). Co-interventions were best supportive care (three trials) and standard care (one trial). The remaining six trials did not provide this information. The number of participants in the trials ranged from 22 to 496 (median 99), mean age was 63.7 (standard deviation 4.18) years, and mean proportion of men was 74.7% (standard deviation 42%). Follow-up was three months to five years.

Synthesis Of Results

Ten trials evaluated oral tamoxifen at five different dosages (ranging from 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day). All trials investigated one or more of our outcomes. We performed meta-analyses when at least two trials assessed similar types of tamoxifen versus similar control interventions. Eight trials evaluated all-cause mortality at varied follow-up points. Tamoxifen versus the control interventions (i.e. no treatment, placebo, and symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in mortality between one and five years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 8 trials, 1364 participants; low-certainty evidence). In total, 488/682 (71.5%) participants died in the tamoxifen groups versus 487/682 (71.4%) in the control groups. The separate analysis results for one, between two and three, and five years were comparable to the analysis result for all follow-up periods taken together. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on serious adverse events at one-year follow-up (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.06; 1 trial, 36 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A total of 5/20 (25.0%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 9/16 (56.3%) participants in the control group experienced serious adverse events. One trial measured health-related quality of life at baseline and at nine months' follow-up, using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of tamoxifen versus no treatment on health-related quality of life (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.51; 1 trial, 420 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A second trial found no appreciable difference in global health-related quality of life scores. No further data were provided. Tamoxifen versus control interventions (i.e. no treatment, placebo, or symptomatic treatment) results in little to no difference in disease progression between one and five years' follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.14; 4 trials, 720 participants; low-certainty evidence). A total of 191/358 (53.3%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 198/362 (54.7%) participants in the control group had progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Tamoxifen versus control interventions (i.e. no treatment or placebo) may have little to no effect on adverse events considered non-serious during treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.06; 4 trials, 462 participants; very low-certainty evidence). A total of 10/265 (3.8%) participants in the tamoxifen group versus 6/197 (3.0%) participants in the control group had adverse events considered non-serious. We identified no trials with participants diagnosed with early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. We identified no ongoing trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the low- and very low-certainty evidence, the effects of tamoxifen on all-cause mortality, disease progression, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, and adverse events considered non-serious in adults with advanced, unresectable, or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with no intervention, placebo, or symptomatic treatment could not be established. Our findings are mostly based on trials at high risk of bias with insufficient power (fewer than 100 participants), and a lack of trial data on clinically important outcomes. Therefore, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Trials comparing tamoxifen administered with any other anticancer drug versus standard care, usual care, or alternative treatment as control interventions were lacking. Evidence on the benefits and harms of tamoxifen in participants at the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma was also lacking.

### Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are associated with polycystic liver disease severity in premenopausal patients [^116HWcBn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and history of pregnancies with disease severity in women with polycystic liver disease is unclear. We performed a cross‐sectional cohort study to assess this association by selecting female patients withof which imaging was available prior to any liver volume‐reducing therapy. Patients received a questionnaire to collect detailed information on estrogen use and pregnancies. Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed on premenopausal and postmenopausal patients. The questionnaire was returned by 287 of 360 selected patients (80%). There was no significant association between estrogen‐containing oral contraceptives and height‐adjusted total liver volume in the total group (P = 0.06) and postmenopausal subgroup (P = 0.7). By contrast, each year of exposure corresponds with a 1.45% higher(P = 0.02) in the premenopausal subgroup, equivalent to a 15.5% higherfor every 10 years of use. Pregnancy duration was not associated with. In conclusion, patients withshould avoid exogenous estrogens.

### Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol (tri-Lo-estarylla) [^115cHjEW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Liver Tumors

Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.

5.4 High Blood Pressure

Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)]. For women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly.

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin.

### Progression of liver fibrosis in women infected with hepatitis C: long-term benefit of estrogen exposure [^113rs3Kw]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Female sex is a protective factor for the progression of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Experimental data suggest that estrogens may have an antifibrotic effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of past pregnancies, oral contraceptives, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected women. Four hundred seventy-two HCV-infected women received a survey regarding prior pregnancies, menopause, and the use of oral contraceptives and HRT. The impact of these variables on liver fibrosis and its progression were evaluated using multivariate analyses considering all putative confounding factors. Two hundred one women completed the survey (43% response rate), 157 of whom had an estimated date of HCV infection (96 postmenopausal women, 96 women with previous pregnancies, and 105 women with past use of oral contraceptives). Through multivariate analyses, the estimated rate of fibrosis progression was higher in postmenopausal (P < .05) and nulliparous (P = 0.02) women and was associated with greater histological activity (P < .001). Prior use of oral contraceptives had no significant influence. Among postmenopausal women, the estimated rate of fibrosis progression (± SE) was lower in women who received HRT compared with untreated patients (0.099 ± 0.016 vs. 0.133 ± 0.006 METAVIR units/yr; p = 0.02) and was similar to that of premenopausal women (0.093 ± 0.012 METAVIR units/yr; P value not significant). In conclusion, menopause appears to be associated with accelerated liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected women, an effect that may be prevented by HRT. Pregnancies may have a beneficial impact on the long-term progression of liver fibrosis.

### Estrogens, esterified and methyltestosterone (Eemt) [^111KqETs]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Large doses of estrogen (5 mg esterified estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men37 to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolic and thrombotic adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear risk.

b. Hepatic adenoma. Benign hepatic adenomas appear to be associated with the use of oral contraceptives. 38–40 Although benign and rare, these may rupture and may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations but should be considered in estrogen users having abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or hypovolemic shock. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.39 The relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is not known at this time.

c. Elevated blood pressure. Increased blood pressure is not uncommon in women using oral contraceptives. There is now a report that this may occur with use of estrogens in the menopause41 and blood pressure should be monitored with estrogen use, especially if high doses are used.

d. Glucose tolerance. A worsening of glucose tolerance has been observed in a significant percentage of patients of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving estrogens.

### Influence of age and gender before and after liver transplantation [^116P1p4z]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Women constitute a particular group among patients with chronic liver disease and in the post-liver transplantation (LT) setting: they are set apart not only by traditional differences with respect to men (ie, body mass index, different etiologies of liver disease, and accessibility to transplantation) but also in increasingly evident ways related to hormonal changes that characterize first the fertile age and subsequently the postmenopausal period (eg, disease course variability and responses to therapy). The aim of this review is, therefore, to evaluate the role of the interplay of factors such as age, gender, and hormones in influencing the natural history of chronic liver disease before and after LT and their importance in determining outcomes after LT. As the population requiring LT ages and the mean age at transplantation increases, older females are being considered for transplantation. Older patients are at greater risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and a worse response to antiviral therapy. Female gender per se is associated with a greater risk for osteoporosis because of metabolic changes after menopause, the bodily structure of females, and, in the population of patients with chronic liver disease, the greater prevalence of cholestatic and autoimmune liver diseases. With menopause, the fall of protective estrogen levels can lead to increased fibrosis progression, and this represents a negative turning point for women with chronic liver disease and especially for patients with hepatitis C. Therefore, the notion of gender as a binary female/male factor is now giving way to the awareness of more complex disease processes within the female gender that follow hormonal, social, and age patterns and need to be addressed directly and specifically.

### Patient sex, reproductive status, and synthetic hormone use associate with histologic severity of nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis [^116zP8iq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Sex and sex hormones can affect responses of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic stress and development of hepatocyte injury and inflammation.

Methods

We collected data from 3 large U.S. studies of patients with NAFLD (between October 2004 and June 2013) to assess the association between histologic severity and sex, menopause status, synthetic hormone use, and menstrual abnormalities in 1112 patients with a histologic diagnosis of NAFLD. We performed logistic or ordinal logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates relevant to an increase of hepatic metabolic stress.

Results

Premenopausal women were at an increased risk of lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory-Denk bodies than men and also at an increased risk of lobular inflammation and Mallory-Denk bodies than postmenopausal women (P < .01). Use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of lobular inflammation and Mallory-Denk bodies in premenopausal women, whereas hormone replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk of lobular inflammation in postmenopausal women (P < .05).

Conclusions

Being a premenopausal woman or a female user of synthetic hormones is associated with increased histologic severity of hepatocyte injury and inflammation among patients with NAFLD at given levels of hepatic metabolic stress.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113wTnS2]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Menopause and sex hormones in NAFLD — postmenopausal women have higher NAFLD prevalence than premenopausal women, and limited data suggest hormonal contributors: higher free testosterone in premenopausal women is associated with increased risk of prevalent NAFLD after menopause, and there is a 25% likelihood of NAFLD in higher testosterone quintiles with an association between lower serum estradiol and NASH. Limited studies demonstrate benefit of hormone replacement therapy on NAFLD, but adverse hepatic effects attributed to progesterone were reported. Increased abdominal adiposity in postmenopausal women closely relates to NAFLD severity and progression, although direct causality has not been established.

### Levonorgetsrel and ethinyl estradiol [^115YVD1Z]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

3. Malignant Neoplasms

Breast Cancer

Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4)]. Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (< 6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].

Cervical Cancer

Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer in some populations of women. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.

4. Hepatic Neoplasia

Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral-contraceptive use, although the incidence of these benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use. Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) oral-contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral-contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.

5. Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.

### Estrogen-androgen replacement therapy and liver… [^113eXZHF]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Androgen deficiency may underlie menopausal symptoms such as loss of libido, fatigue and loss of the sense of well-being, but there is concern about the potential for masculinizing effects and hepatic abnormalities with the addition of androgens to hormone replacement therapy. However, most of the reports of androgen-related hepatic dysfunction are derived from studies of men or of androgen dosages higher than the 1. 25 mg to
2. 5 mg per day of methyltestosterone used in combination with estrogen. To compare the hepatic biochemical changes with estrogen alone versus estrogen-androgen replacement therapy, Gitlin and associates performed a meta-analysis of eight double-blind studies of hormone replacement therapy in 641 women. The eight randomized, double-blind trials included 511 women who had undergone surgical menopause and 130 women who experienced natural menopause. Oophorectomy was performed in 79. 7 percent of the surgical group.

Liver function tests were compared at baseline and after one, three, six, 12, 18 and 24 months of therapy. No differences were found in hepatic biochemical levels in women who received estrogen alone or the combination of estrogen and methyltestosterone over a period of 24 months. No statistically significant changes were found in albumin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase values. None of the patients exhibited features of drug hepatotoxicity or significant elevation of liver biochemistry. The authors conclude that, with appropriate dosage and indications, the combination of estrogen and methyltestosterone produces the same liver biochemical changes as estrogen alone or placebo in postmenopausal women. The authors cite a 1998 report by Ettinger and Fireman in which no cases of hepatic dysfunction developed in 3, 016 person-years of use of estrogen-methyltestosterone formulations.

The findings were the same whether patients were older or younger. editor's note: This meta-analysis provides reassurance about hepatic biochemical function during estrogen-androgen replacement therapy. However, it does not address the risk of adverse effects such as androgenic hair changes, deepening of the voice and a reduction in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level with long-term use. Because serum androgen levels do not always correlate with symptoms, decisions about androgen supplementation are based on clinical assessment. Until specific recommendations about androgen replacement can be made, it is prudent to prescribe methyltestosterone for short-term therapy and then reevaluate the need to continue such therapy. — b. a.

### Tools for making correct decisions regarding hormone therapy. part I: background and drugs [^116uKFnY]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review existing scientific data related to the biology of estrogen in the aging process of women, and to understand the pharmacology, physiology, and diversity of sex hormones.

Design

A MEDLINE computer search was performed to identify relevant articles.

Result(S)

Estrogen and progesterone have been prescribed for postmenopausal women over the last 60 years. Various formulations have had divergent properties, which are related to dissimilarities in the molecule structure, metabolism, plasma carrier, distribution, receptor binding, and the specific localizations of the different receptors in the various organs.

Conclusion(S)

Extensive data are available on the various characteristics of sex-hormone formulations, which are related to clinical consequences. The drugs and means of application have resulted in fundamental differences in activity, such as variance between oral and transdermal applications resulting in different forms of liver involvement. This information could assist in understanding why certain formulations may either prove harmful or beneficial to specific women.

### Vesiculobullous skin lesions on the hands and face [^116nn9m2]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the following triggers is NOT commonly associated with exacerbation of this condition?
A. Alcohol consumption
B. Hepatitis C infection
C. Exposure to sunlight
D. Hydroxychloroquine intake
E. Estrogen-based contraception

Answers:
A. Alcohol consumption – Incorrect. Alcohol consumption is a well-known trigger for exacerbation of PCT due to its effect on hepatic metabolism.
B. Hepatitis C infection – Incorrect. Hepatitis C infection is commonly associated with PCT and can exacerbate the condition. In the case presented herein, laboratory tests revealed elevated liver function tests (aspartate transaminase 228 IU/L and alanine transaminase 198 IU/L) with positive serology for hepatitis C. This patient had multiple potential triggers: underlying, and previously unknown, liver disease with hepatitis C infection, hyperferritinemia, and alcohol consumption.
C. Exposure to sunlight – Incorrect. Exposure to sunlight is a known trigger for exacerbation of PCT, as it can induce porphyrin production in the skin.
D. Hydroxychloroquine intake – Correct. Conversely, the treatment of PCT can be achieved using very low doses of synthetic antimalarial drugs, which remove excess porphyrins from the liver and increase their excretion in the urine. For this patient, hydroxychloroquine was deemed unnecessary and treatment for hepatitis C was initiated alongside guidance for photoprotection to manage PCT cutaneous manifestations.
E. Estrogen-based contraception – Incorrect. Estrogens, such as contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies, are a known trigger for PCT and may cause cutaneous signs that may warrant discontinuation during a vesiculobullous episode.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available. There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs. However, based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs, clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested.

Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations.

No drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives

Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs

Table 4 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs

Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin component of COCs.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors

Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with some HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir), some HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir), and some non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., nevirapine).

In contrast, significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and/or progestin have been noted when COCs are co-administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) and with other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., etravirine).

### Esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone (estratest FS) [^116poVbE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Large doses of estrogen (5 mg esterified estrogens per day), comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast, have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men37to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and thrombophlebitis. When estrogen doses of this size are used, any of the thromboembolic and thrombotic adverse effects associated with oral contraceptive use should be considered a clear risk.

b. Hepatic adenoma. Benign hepatic adenomas appear to be associated with the use of oral contraceptives.38–40Although benign and rare, these may rupture and may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Such lesions have not yet been reported in association with other estrogen or progestogen preparations but should be considered in estrogen users having abdominal pain and tenderness, abdominal mass, or hypovolemic shock. Hepatocellular carcinoma has also been reported in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.39The relationship of this malignancy to these drugs is not known at this time.

c. Elevated blood pressure. Increased blood pressure is not uncommon in women using oral contraceptives. There is now a report that this may occur with use of estrogens in the menopause41and blood pressure should be monitored with estrogen use, especially if high doses are used.

d. Glucose tolerance. A worsening of glucose tolerance has been observed in a significant percentage of patients of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. For this reason, diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving estrogens.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115jjKzr]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) in liver disease and transplantation — CHCs are considered safe in women with compensated cirrhosis but should be avoided in decompensated cirrhosis due to concerns of impaired estrogen metabolism; these agents are considered acceptable in LT recipients but not in those with graft failure because of estrogen-associated risks such as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Women with HCAs should also avoid CHCs, and CHCs are not advised in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). CHCs affect P450 metabolism; thus, a review for potential drug interactions is warranted, and CHCs should be avoided in women with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requiring careful metabolic review. CHCs are acceptable in women with prior liver-related events such as resolved cholestasis of pregnancy and gallstones who are otherwise stable and have normal liver enzymes. Higher-dose CHCs increased the risk of liver enzyme elevations, although current regimens carry no greater risk than placebo, and rare cholestatic liver injury has been reported, particularly with higher-dose estrogens.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115VFX4k]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — hormone replacement and pregnancy: Estrogens promote cholestasis, so oral contraceptive pills and estrogen supplements may induce or worsen pruritus; during pregnancy, itching may become severe even early and may fail to resolve completely after delivery in patients with PBC. There are limited data about fertility or infant outcome in PBC patients. For women with cirrhosis who become pregnant, it is advisable to check for varices in the second trimester; treatment with beta blockers is safe in pregnancy, and a short second stage of labor is optimal because the Valsalva maneuver may precipitate variceal hemorrhage.

### Anastrozole-related acute hepatitis with autoimmune features: a case report [^114193JF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Two cases of acute hepatitis occurring during treatment with anastrozole have previously been reported, but the underlying mechanisms of liver injury are still uncertain. We report the case of anastrozole-related acute hepatitis with some autoimmune features.

Case Presentation

A 70-year-old woman developed acute hepatitis associated with serum antinuclear antibodies during anastrozole treatment; after drug withdrawal, liver function parameters rapidly improved and serum auto-antibodies were no longer detectable.

Conclusions

Anastrozole-induced hepatotoxicity is a very rare event. Drug-drug interactions or metabolically-mediated damage might be involved, with a possible role of individual susceptibility. Our report suggests that an immune-mediated mechanism may also be considered in anastrozole-related liver injury.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^112PfBW8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipids: Screening for dyslipidemias is not necessary for the safe initiation of injectables because of the low likelihood of clinically significant changes with use of hormonal contraceptives. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with lipid measurement before initiation of hormonal contraceptives. During 2015–2016, among women aged 20–39 years in the United States, 6.7% had high cholesterol, defined as total serum cholesterol > 240 mg/dL. Studies have reported mixed results about the effects of hormonal methods on lipid levels among both healthy women and women with baseline lipid abnormalities, and the clinical significance of these changes is unclear.

Liver enzymes: Although patients with certain liver diseases generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3), screening for liver disease before initiation of DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of these conditions and the high likelihood that patients with liver disease already would have had the condition diagnosed. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with liver enzyme tests before initiation of hormonal contraceptives. During 2012, among U.S. women, the percentage with liver disease (not further specified) was 1.3%. During 2013, the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, or C was ≤ 1 per 100,000 U.S. population. During 2002–2011, the incidence of liver cancer among U.S. women was approximately 3.7 per 100,000 population.

Thrombophilia: Patients with thrombophilia generally should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 3). However, studies have demonstrated that routine thrombophilia screening in the general population before contraceptive initiation is not cost-effective because of the rarity of the condition and high cost of screening.

Clinical breast examination: Although patients with current breast cancer should not use DMPA (U.S. MEC 4), screening asymptomatic patients with a clinical breast examination before initiating DMPA is not necessary because of the low prevalence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age. A systematic review did not identify any evidence regarding outcomes among women who were screened versus not screened with a clinical breast examination before initiation of hormonal contraceptives. The incidence of breast cancer among women of reproductive age in the United States is low. During 2020, the incidence of breast cancer among women aged < 50 years was approximately 45.9 per 100,000 women.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113noNxP]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Perioperative and emergency contraception in transplant settings — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend discontinuation of estrogen-containing contraception following major surgeries in the absence of prolonged immobility and advises that all other agents be continued regardless of postsurgical mobility status; this contraceptive strategy is reasonable for LT recipients and living donors. Emergency contraception can reduce the likelihood of pregnancy in the first 5 days following sexual intercourse; options include the copper IUD and hormonal contraceptive pills, with the copper IUD having the highest efficacy (< 1% failure rate). Progestin-only emergency contraception pills should be avoided if body mass index (BMI) is greater than 30 mg/kg². There are no data on estrogen-containing emergency contraception in specific liver conditions, and given the short duration of use, these are unlikely to pose harm, although non-estrogen-containing options are preferable in patients with HCAs, BCS, decompensated cirrhosis, or graft failure.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^112ProjT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Ethinyl Estradiol Exposure

Higher estrogen exposure may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including venous thromboembolism (VTE). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for ethinyl estradiol (EE) is approximately 60% higher in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system compared to oral contraceptives containing EE 35 mcg. In contrast, the peak concentration (Cmax) for EE is approximately 25% lower in women using norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system if jaundice develops. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded.

Liver Tumors

Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

5.4 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment

During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as CHCs. Discontinue norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications (4)]. Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen.
