Workup and treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the workup and treatment of an 80-year-old woman with dizziness and a remote heat-associated syncope, focusing on orthostatic hypotension and a stepwise workup and treatment plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical problem and immediate safety risks. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation priorities, including history, exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis in older adults and how the history steers toward orthostatic hypotension. After that, I should confirm diagnostic criteria and thresholds for orthostatic hypotension and its subtypes. Then, I will outline targeted testing to distinguish neurogenic from non-neurogenic causes. Finally, I will synthesize a treatment plan emphasizing nonpharmacologic measures, medication optimization, and when to consider pharmacotherapy, and close with disposition and follow-up considerations, making sure each step aligns with guideline-based care and is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and risk framing. In an 80-year-old with dizziness and a history of syncope, I need to ensure I am not missing high-risk cardiac or neurologic causes, because older adults with syncope have higher rates of adverse outcomes and multifactorial etiologies are common, so a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is prudent, and I should not anchor prematurely on a single cause without corroboration [^113nFkiH] [^114omyDc] [^1114QL5J].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation priorities before jumping to tests. The foundation is a careful history, including circumstances, prodrome, triggers, eyewitness account, medication review, and comorbidities, followed by a focused exam with orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements and a 12-lead ECG, because these steps define the diagnosis in a substantial proportion of patients and guide risk stratification and disposition [^112w51bx] [^113iy3LK] [^115JuM62].

> I will now examine the history for features that steer the diagnosis. Positional dizziness on standing or with prolonged standing, a recent heat exposure, and no exertional or supine symptoms make orthostatic hypotension more likely than primary cardiac arrhythmia or vasovagal syncope, but I should double-check for red flags such as exertional syncope, supine events, palpitations, chest pain, or family history of sudden death that would push me toward urgent cardiac evaluation instead [^1125zDB3] [^1136nf6u].

> Hold on, I should verify the medication and comorbidity context because polypharmacy and autonomic dysfunction are common in older adults and can mimic or cause orthostatic syndromes. I need to check for antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, and alpha-blockers, and I should consider neurodegenerative disease or diabetic neuropathy if neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is suspected, as these factors frequently coexist and complicate presentation in the elderly [^115w7quT] [^1114QL5J] [^113xCgxV].

> Next, I should review the physical examination priorities. I need to ensure accurate orthostatic vital signs measured after 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes upright, because classic orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, and I should also look for signs of volume depletion, cardiac murmurs or gallops suggesting structural disease, and neurologic deficits that would redirect the workup [^1175WD3D] [^112ZH7wi].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis in this age group and how the story maps. Orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, vasovagal syncope, and cardiac arrhythmias are the leading considerations in older adults, and the positional nature of symptoms and heat exposure favor orthostatic hypotension, although I should keep in mind that vasovagal presentations in older adults are often atypical and may present as unexplained falls, so I must not dismiss reflex syncope solely due to absent classic prodrome [^115w7quT] [^1166xEvs] [^1114QL5J].

> I should confirm the diagnostic criteria and subtypes of orthostatic hypotension to avoid misclassification. Classic orthostatic hypotension is a sustained drop of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic within 3 minutes of standing, initial orthostatic hypotension is a transient drop within 15 seconds, and delayed orthostatic hypotension manifests after 3 minutes and is particularly relevant in older adults; neurogenic orthostatic hypotension implies autonomic failure with an inadequate heart rate response and often coexists with neurodegenerative disease [^1175WD3D] [^116htDvS] [^115ip7JA].

> But wait, what if the active stand is negative yet the history remains compelling. I need to check whether head-up tilt testing would help, especially for delayed orthostatic hypotension or reflex syncope, and I should remember that tilt testing is generally safe and well tolerated in older adults, with nitroglycerin provocation increasing diagnostic yield when passive tilt is nondiagnostic, so a tilt protocol can be reasonable when active standing is unrevealing or impractical [^115ip7JA] [^113X7GTQ] [^114NJR5c].

> Next, I should review targeted testing to distinguish neurogenic from non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. If the heart rate rise with standing is blunted, suggesting impaired baroreflex function, or if there are features of autonomic failure, I should consider autonomic function testing including Valsalva, deep breathing, and prolonged tilt with continuous blood pressure monitoring, and I should also obtain basic labs such as electrolytes, glucose, renal function, and a complete blood count to exclude metabolic contributors before labeling the case as neurogenic [^113xCgxV] [^1156ADPY] [^112ZH7wi].

> I will now examine carotid sinus massage because it is particularly important in patients over 40 with unexplained syncope compatible with a reflex mechanism. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is present with a pause of at least 3 seconds or a systolic blood pressure drop of at least 50 mmHg during massage, and given the age and presentation, this test can be both diagnostic and therapeutically informative if positive [^113j3Q8J] [^116hfFKJ].

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis here. Based on positional dizziness, heat exposure, and the absence of exertional or supine symptoms, orthostatic hypotension is the leading diagnosis, with a differential that includes vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and cardiac arrhythmias, and I should confirm with orthostatic vitals and proceed to tilt testing if needed to clarify delayed orthostatic hypotension or reflex mechanisms [^1114QL5J] [^115ip7JA] [^1175WD3D].

> Now, I should outline treatment, starting with nonpharmacologic measures that are first-line for orthostatic hypotension. I need to ensure education on slow positional changes, liberalize salt and fluid intake if not contraindicated, use compression stockings or abdominal binders, employ physical counter-maneuvers such as leg crossing and squatting, and consider acute water ingestion before orthostatic stress, while also reviewing and deprescribing hypotensive or psychotropic medications whenever feasible [^115wxatG] [^113XSwHB] [^114GYrpR].

> Hold on, I should verify medication optimization specifics because this is often the highest-yield intervention in older adults. I will review all antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, and alpha-blockers for temporal correlation with symptom onset and consider dose reduction, switching to shorter-acting agents, or discontinuation if clinically safe, as medication modification is a Class IIa recommendation in older patients with syncope or unexplained falls [^115nd6nd] [^1114QL5J].

> If symptoms persist despite conservative measures, I need to consider pharmacotherapy tailored to the mechanism. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, can be used for orthostatic hypotension with attention to supine hypertension risk and urinary retention in older men, fludrocortisone can expand plasma volume but requires monitoring for edema and hypokalemia, and droxidopa is appropriate for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension when other measures fail, with clinical improvement documented in autonomic testing cohorts [^1155tvRn] [^113XSwHB] [^1156ADPY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to add a beta-blocker for reflex syncope, but I should double-check the evidence. Beta-blockers have not consistently reduced vasovagal syncope recurrences and are not first-line for orthostatic hypotension, so I should avoid reflexively prescribing them here and instead prioritize volume expansion, vasoconstrictors, and medication optimization based on the underlying mechanism [^notfound].

> Next, I should review disposition and follow-up. If the initial evaluation reveals orthostatic hypotension without high-risk cardiac features, outpatient management with close follow-up is appropriate, whereas hospitalization is indicated for serious medical conditions, traumatic injury, high-risk ECG findings, or suspected arrhythmic syncope requiring telemetry, and I should arrange early reassessment of orthostatic vitals, medication reconciliation, and consider referral to a syncope clinic or geriatrician for multidisciplinary care in older adults [^111oHn7v] [^1114QL5J] [^111sCg55].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety counseling and prevention planning. I should advise on hydration, heat avoidance, slow positional transitions, use of assistive devices if unsteady, and teach physical counter-maneuvers to abort prodromal symptoms, because injury is common after syncope and simple behavioral strategies can meaningfully reduce recurrence and harm in older adults [^114GYrpR] [^111KGqSi].

The most likely diagnosis is **orthostatic hypotension** [^112X4rJU] due to dehydration and heat exposure, with possible neurogenic or medication-induced contributors [^115KkHZg]. The workup should include a focused history, medication review, orthostatic vitals, ECG, and targeted labs (CBC, electrolytes, glucose, renal function) [^112w51bx] [^112UZS1F]. If the cause remains unclear, consider tilt testing or ambulatory monitoring [^115ip7JA] [^111KGqSi]. Management centers on **hydration, salt intake, and medication review** [^115wxatG]; add midodrine or fludrocortisone if symptoms persist, and use compression stockings or abdominal binders for additional support [^113XSwHB]. Educate on slow positional changes and fall prevention, and refer to cardiology or neurology if syncope recurs or autonomic dysfunction is suspected [^115LapQm] [^113xCgxV].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH)**: Sustained drop in SBP ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing [^1112CZBK]; consider classic, delayed, or neurogenic OH [^1175WD3D].

- **Vasovagal syncope**: Common in older adults; often triggered by heat, dehydration, or prolonged standing [^1166xEvs].

- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: Consider if palpitations, abnormal ECG, or structural heart disease are present [^1125zDB3].

- **Medication-induced hypotension**: Review for antihypertensives, diuretics, antidepressants, or antipsychotics [^115nd6nd].

- **Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension**: Suggests autonomic dysfunction (e.g. Parkinson's, diabetes) [^113xCgxV].

---

## Recommended diagnostic workup

### Initial evaluation

- **Focused history**: Circumstances, prodrome, witnesses, medication use, comorbidities [^113ShVvr].

- **Physical examination**: Orthostatic vitals (supine and standing at 1 and 3 minutes) [^notfound], cardiac and neurologic exams [^112UZS1F].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify arrhythmias or ischemia [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, renal function [^notfound].

---

### Additional testing (if initial evaluation is inconclusive)

Consider **tilt-table testing** for unexplained syncope or suspected reflex mechanisms [^1144SqAR], and **ambulatory ECG monitoring** (Holter or event monitor) if arrhythmia is suspected [^notfound]. Use echocardiography when structural heart disease is suspected [^112w51bx].

---

## Management strategies

### Non-pharmacological interventions

- **Hydration**: Increase fluid intake to 2–3 liters/day [^notfound].

- **Salt intake**: Increase dietary salt if not contraindicated [^113XSwHB].

- **Physical counter-maneuvers**: Leg crossing, squatting, isometric exercises [^117AD298].

- **Compression stockings**: Reduce venous pooling [^113XSwHB].

- **Education**: Slow positional changes, fall prevention [^113XSwHB].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

- **Midodrine**: Alpha-agonist; first-line for persistent OH [^1156ADPY].

- **Fludrocortisone**: Mineralocorticoid; consider if midodrine is ineffective [^notfound].

- **Droxidopa**: For neurogenic OH refractory to standard therapy [^113D1zKx].

---

### Medication review and adjustment

Review and adjust medications by identifying and modifying or discontinuing **hypotensive or psychotropic drugs** [^115nd6nd].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Cardiology**: Suspected arrhythmias, structural heart disease, or recurrent syncope [^115LapQm].

- **Neurology**: Suspected neurogenic OH or autonomic dysfunction [^113xCgxV].

- **Geriatrics**: Multifactorial etiologies, falls, or complex comorbidities [^113nFkiH].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize **education** on recognizing prodromal symptoms, hydration, and fall-prevention strategies [^114GYrpR]. Arrange **follow-up** to monitor response, adjust therapy, and reassess for underlying causes [^114eVWS1].

---

The patient's dizziness and syncope are most consistent with **orthostatic hypotension** from heat exposure and dehydration, with possible neurogenic or medication-related contributors. A structured workup and guideline-directed therapy — including hydration, salt loading, medication review, and selective pharmacologic therapy — are recommended, with specialist referral as needed [^115wxatG].

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^115ip7JA]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Moving from supine to upright posture rarely induces syncope in normal healthy patients but may cause minor worrisome symptoms. For instance, a transient sensation of 'greying out/dizziness/light-headedness/unsteadiness' is common immediately after upright postural change (so-called 'initial' or 'immediate' OH). While usually harmless, this sensation may cause alarm/instability in some patients. Active standing is sufficient to document this problem and initiate treatment. Thus, active standing should be seen as a necessary, complementary aspect of cardiovascular autonomic workup in unexplained syncope, optimally with beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring for diagnostic accuracy.

Delayed OH is a far more important clinical problem, especially in older patients, debilitated patients, those with neurogenic OH, or in diseases that affect neurological responses, such as diabetes or alcohol abuse. In these cases, OH may be considerably delayed after change of posture that can result in fall injury. Active standing may not be tolerated for sufficient time to be diagnostic with additional fall injury risk during testing. TT avoids injury risk while providing the possibility of defining the diagnosis.

### Vasovagal syncope in the older person: differences in presentation between older and younger patients [^1166xEvs]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Background

vasovagal syncope (VVS) has been diagnosed with increasing frequency in older people since the description of the head-up tilt table test (HUTT). There is, however, a paucity of research describing the clinical features of VVS in this group. To address this issue, we investigated the age distribution and differences in clinical characteristics associated with age in patients diagnosed with VVS by HUTT at our tertiary referral centre.

Methods

1,060 consecutive patients with tilt-positive VVS were identified from a prospective database containing the demographic and clinical information of individuals assessed in our unit over a 10-year period. VVS was diagnosed with appropriate haemodynamic changes during HUTT and accompanying symptom reproduction.

Results

we found a bimodal age distribution with a small peak at 20–29 years and a larger peak at 70–79 years. Patients aged ≥ 60 years were less likely to report total loss of consciousness [odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38–0.64], near loss of consciousness (OR 0.53, 95% CI = 0.40–0.70) or palpitations (OR 0.45, 95% CI = 0.28–0.72) and more likely to present with unexplained falls (OR 2.33, 95% CI = 1.36–4.32). The typical provoking factors of prolonged standing (OR 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40–0.72), posture change (OR 0.61, 95% CI = 0.46–0.82) and hot environments (OR 0.57, 95% CI = 0.42–0.78) were also less common in older patients.

Conclusion

in our large study population, VVS was more common in older patients. The clinical presentation differed significantly between the two groups. Older patients were less likely to give a typical history and therefore clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion when evaluating the older patient presenting with collapse or unexplained falls.

### Selecting appropriate diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with syncope / collapse [^113iy3LK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The investigation of syncope is challenging and physicians have an ever-increasing array of diagnostic tools at their disposal. There are two essential goals that drive investigation: risk stratification and identification of etiology. In this review, we outline our approach while providing a synopsis of the available supportive evidence. The key to syncope is in the story as told by the patient and a bystander, since this drives both risk assessment and diagnostic testing. All patients should initially be evaluated with a systematic history and physical examination as well as an ECG. The initial evaluation provides an estimation of risk and directs whether inpatient or outpatient evaluation is appropriate. In a substantial proportion of patients, the etiology will be evident after initial evaluation and no further investigation is required. In the remaining, targeted use of additional investigations in the form of cardiac imaging, provocative testing and/or ambulatory ECG monitoring should be performed. A thoughtful and systematic approach to the investigation of syncope optimizes the diagnostic yield but also ensures efficient usage of limited health care resources.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^112w51bx]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Approach to syncope in the emergency department [^114Wx1zD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Syncope is a common reason for ED attendance and it presents a major management challenge with regard to the appropriate workup and disposition. Nearly 50% of patients are admitted, and for many this is unnecessary; clinical decision rules have not proven to decrease unnecessary admissions. The European Society of Cardiology has recently developed guidance for managing syncope in the ED. This article highlights the key steps in evaluating syncope in the ED, factors involved in determining risk of a cardiac cause, and considerations for admission, observation or discharge.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^115w7quT]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope in the elderly — causes and assessment: The most common causes of syncope in the elderly are orthostatic hypotension (OH), reflex syncope, especially carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), and cardiac arrhythmias, and different forms may co-exist in one patient, complicating diagnosis. Polypharmacy is frequent and relevant to evaluation: "One-third of individuals over 65 years are taking three or more prescribed medications, which may cause or contribute to syncope", and "Medication history should include the time relationship with onset of syncope". Cognitive issues and witness availability affect history quality: "Cognitive impairment is present in 5% of 65 year olds and 20% of 80 year olds", and "it is important to pursue a witness account of episodes, although this is not available in up to 60% of cases". Examination priorities are specified: "Evaluation of neurological and locomotor systems, including observation of gait and balance, is useful. If cognitive impairment is suspected, the Mini–Mental State Examination should be performed". Etiologic frequencies include: "Cardioinhibitory CSS is the recognized cause of symptoms in up to 20% of elderly patients with syncope. CSH of predominantly vasodepressor form is equally prevalent, but its potential role in syncope is much less clear".

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^113pfgR9]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope — epidemiology and outcomes — emergency department cohorts generally feature older patients with mean ages around 60–65 years, and approximately 35% of patients with syncope remain undiagnosed. Approximately 30%–50% of patients with syncope are diagnosed with an autonomically mediated form, most of which are vasovagal. The overall 1-year recurrence rate is approximately 25%–35%, and this rate can be predicted by the number of syncopes in the year prior to assessment. Most patients stop fainting after assessment and in the absence of specific therapy.

### The assessment and management of the dizzy patient [^115eywpM]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

A significant number of individuals are affected by symptoms of dizziness. It is the most common complaint among patients over 75 years of age. A large number of these patients seek counsel from their physicians. It is imperative for the evaluating physician to obtain a thorough history and perform a complete physical exam. The proper diagnostic studies must also be obtained to confirm or rule out particular diagnoses. The physician should never assume that the dizziness is the result of normal aging prior to ruling out pathologic conditions.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113yqfDP]. Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Autonomic evaluation — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension notes that syncope due to neurogenic OH is common in patients with central or peripheral autonomic nervous system damage or dysfunction, and its causes should be sought so as to provide efficient, accurate, and effective management. Symptoms that may distinguish neurogenic OH include persistent and often progressive generalized weakness, fatigue, visual blurring, cognitive slowing, leg buckling, and the coat hanger headache, and these symptoms may be provoked or exacerbated by exertion, prolonged standing, meals, or increased ambient temperature. Confirmation of specific neurogenic OH conditions causing syncope often requires additional autonomic evaluation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^114xAoye]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Management of syncope in the Emergency Department (ED) focuses on risk stratification with clear disposition goals. "The evaluation of syncope in the setting of ED has changed from attempts to make a diagnosis of the cause of syncope to risk stratification (Table 8) in order to:" "(i) recognize patients with life-threatening conditions and admit them to the hospital; (ii) recognize patients with non serious conditions to be discharged and referred later to local syncope facilities; (iii) recognize those who do not need any further evaluation and treatment; and (iv) choose a timing and setting where further diagnostic tests should be performed in patients with inconclusive initial evaluation".

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^112UUGnd]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance — pathophysiology and symptoms — are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

### Syncope in older adults: challenges, approach and treatment [^114u9F4K]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Syncope can have devastating consequences, resulting in injuries, accidents or even death. In our ageing society, the subsequent healthcare usage, such as emergency room presentations, surgeries and hospital admissions, forms a significant and growing socioeconomic burden. Causes of syncope in the older adult include orthostatic hypotension, carotid sinus syndrome, vasovagal syncope, structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. As stated in the recently published World Falls Guidelines, syncope in older adults often presents as falls, which is either due to amnesia for loss of consciousness, or pre-syncope leading to a fall, especially in those prone to falls with several other risk-factors for falls present. This difference in presentation can hinder the recognition of syncope. In patients with unexplained falls, or in whom the history comprises red flags for potential syncope, special attention to (pre)syncope is therefore warranted. When syncope is mistaken for other causes of a transient loss of consciousness, such as epileptic seizures, or when syncope presents as falls, patients are often referred to multiple specialists, which may in turn lead to excessive and unnecessary diagnostic testing and costs. Specialist services that are able to provide a comprehensive assessment can improve diagnostic yield and minimise diagnostic testing, thus improving patient satisfaction. Comprehensive assessment also leads to reduced length of hospital stay. Increasingly, geriatricians are involved in the assessment of syncope in the older patient, especially given the overlap with falls. Therefore, awareness of causes of syncope, as well as state-of-the-art assessment and treatment, is of great importance.

Exclude other causes of OH/nOH

If blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination, as well as electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, should be focused on ruling out non-neurogenic causes of OH, including cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies. Table 2 lists recommended tests to conduct when evaluating a patient for OH/nOH. Cardiac disorders (e.g. pacemakers, dysrhythmias, ablation, etc.) can preclude heart rate augmentation; therefore, a cardiac history, an electrocardiogram, and medication review (as noted above) should consistently be performed. Due to variability among patients, including age, disease status, and current medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always be an accurate indicator of nOH in patients with OH; therefore, clinical scenario and specific presentation need to be considered.

Vasovagal syncope diagnosis — key clinical features and tilt-table testing include that there are 4 categories of key diagnostic features (predisposing situations, prodromal symptoms, physical signs, and recovery time and symptoms), and "Prolonged" can mean as little as 2–3 minutes distinguishing vasovagal syncope from initial orthostatic hypotension. During events, fine and coarse myoclonic movements have been observed in approximately 10% of cases, and unconsciousness usually lasts less than 1–2 minutes with patients often feeling very tired for minutes to hours after the episode. Tilt-table tests feature prolonged passive postural stress and the vasovagal reflex is often triggered by adjunctive agents such as isoproterenol, nitrates, and clomipramine, with a positive response defined as clinically reminiscent presyncope or syncope associated with hypotension and usually bradycardia. When patient populations with strong presumptive evidence are studied, the sensitivity approaches 78%–92%, and the currently recommended protocols have specificities of approximately 90% compared with the response of asymptomatic patients, but the use of high doses of isoproterenol during tilts exceeding 10 minutes at 80° head-up tilt is accompanied by reduced specificity. The tilt test has not been prospectively validated with populations with rigorously defined vasovagal syncope, there is no "ideal" protocol given the inexorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, and tilt testing, when positive, suggests a tendency or predisposition to vasovagal syncope and does not establish it as the cause of the patient's syncope.

Conclusion

The first-ever syncope incidence in patients with unexplained syncope has a bimodal lifetime pattern with peaks at 15 and 70 years. The majority of older patients experience their first syncope when older and orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome are more common in this group. In older patients with early-onset syncope, prodromes, vasovagal and complex syncope are more common. A detailed syncope history remains essential in elderly patients evaluated for syncope and impacts the final diagnosis.

Syncope epidemiology and demographics — population prevalence, distributions, etiologies, and emergency department (ED) burden are quantified. Reported prevalence is as high as 41%, with recurrent syncope occurring in 13.5%. In a cross-sectional sample of 1925 residents, 364 reported a lifetime episode, yielding an estimated prevalence of 19%, and females had higher prevalence (22% versus 15%, P < 0.001). Incidence shows a trimodal pattern with first episodes around 20, 60, or 80 years and a third peak occurring 5 to 7 years earlier in males. Reflex syncope was most common (21%), followed by cardiac syncope (9%) and orthostatic hypotension (OH) (9%), with the cause unknown in 37%. In New York Heart Association class III–IV heart failure, syncope is present in 12% to 14% of patients. In U.S. ED data, there were 6.7 million syncope visits (0.77% of all ED patients), and among patients > 80 years, 58% were admitted; syncope as a presenting ED symptom ranged from 0.8% to 2.4%.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Syncope can have a variety of aetiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries.

Syncope is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery.

Standing for 2 to 3 min is usually sufficient to see the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope, however in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 min of standing. Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management (table 1). A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

Table 1
Potential causes of syncope

Neurogenic OH (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (eg, hypovolaemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope and falls. Neurogenic OH is commonly comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

In those cases in which the aetiology of a patient's syncope is unclear after initial evaluation and an ECG has ruled out a cardiac cause of syncope, referral for autonomic testing may aid in pinpointing the cause and guide decisions of the most appropriate steps in treating and managing the symptoms of the patient. In this context, autonomic testing should include continuous BP monitoring during prolonged head-up tilt (HUT) on a tilt table, HR in response to paced breathing and BP in response to the Valsalva manoeuvre. Decreased autonomic function, if observed, in this battery of tests indicates a neurogenic origin of OH and that the syncope is neurally mediated. Such a diagnosis should suggest a course of treatment.

When the cause of syncope has been identified as OH or nOH, pharmacological management of the condition may be necessary. Droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, is the only drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat symptoms of nOH in adults, whereas midodrine, an alpha−1 adrenergic agonist, is approved to treat symptoms of OH.

Key points

There is no consistent evidence in the current literature that positivity rates of the head-up tilt test (HUTT) differ between older (≥ 65 years) and younger patients presenting with unexplained syncope.
Nitroglycerin provocation yields more diagnoses than passive HUTT, with low rates of false positives, and is safe to perform in older patients.
The vasodepressive response is the most frequently seen during HUTT in this population.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance and syncope in young adults [^116zwWUS]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Current clinical guidelinesemphasise the need for careful history taking when evaluating patients with unexplained syncope. VVS is by far the most common cause of syncope in young patientsand it is suggested by some authors that VVS may be diagnosed solely by careful history taking. In this study, none of the clinical features such as the total number of attacks, how many years ago the first syncope occurred, dizziness on standing and palpitations or typical prodrome preceding syncope was highly specific for any diagnosis. Of interest, the proportion of patients with POTS that reported palpitations was low (3 of 10), and this proportion was the same among patients with VVS. Furthermore, even though the proportion of patients reporting dizziness on standing was slightly lower among VVS compared with other diagnoses, 6 of 10 patients with VVS still reported this symptom. The history is without doubt a powerful tool in diagnosing syncope, in particular when taken by a trained expert. In this study, patients were asked to fill a standard questionnaire prior to tilt testing. Self-reported history obtained by filling a questionnaire is similar to history taking by a non-expert yielding around 60% accuracy. While it has been shown that a level of accuracy when an expert takes history is very high, as much as 90%. We believe that these results indicate that tilt testing with non-invasive beat-to-beat monitoring should be considered in unexplained syncope associated with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, especially in the absence of a syncope expert. When an expert is available, tilt testing may be seen as a diagnostic tool for confirmation of diagnosis and an additional test in unresolved cases.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### Tilt testing evolves: faster and still accurate [^1156Y9jL]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The shortened protocol is sufficiently easy, safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, and well tolerated that it could be implemented in most clinics, requiring less infrastructure than a stress test. Early use of this protocol might reduce the need for expensive implantable loop recorders. In countries with less established syncope units, this might significantly expand the number of treating physicians, who would use it simply as another diagnostic test. This would change the paradigm completely, from highly specialized and few syncope specialists, to numbers more able to meet the diagnostic demand. Syncope assessment could become generalized, moving out of large referral sites to the community — a pattern demonstrated repeatedly for successful and valuable medical procedures. Moreover, one standardized methodology would facilitate international collaboration and multicentre studies, so desperately needed for an effective reflex syncope treatment.

The shortening of the protocol by the Russo group rightly focuses on syncope diagnosis, of course after a clinical history. Its wide acceptance may generate a need for different protocols: one for patients with a history of unexplained syncope and high likelihood of reflex mechanism, and another for orthostatic intolerance with underlying cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction but without history of syncope (Graphical Abstract). The latter includes common dysautonomic conditions such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and orthostatic hypotension, especially the delayed (slowly progressing) form, where an active standing test may be impractical, inconclusive, or imprecise to confirm the diagnosis. The details of this potential second tilt protocol have yet to be clarified, but prolonged passive upright tilt may be needed if the haemodynamic changes demonstrate an obvious tendency without meeting the pre-defined diagnostic criteria of autonomic dysfunction. For some patients, the volume shift produced by tilt testing (Graphical Abstract) may be slower to develop as their compensatory mechanisms are more effective, justifying prolonged orthostatic challenge for correct diagnosis. Finally, we should bear in mind that tilt testing might be applied as a part of a more comprehensive cardiovascular autonomic workup and can augment the effects of other provocatory tests such carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre, or deep breathing test, as recommended by the current European syncope guidelines and autonomic societies. For the syncope protocol, these additions may be unnecessary, unless a comprehensive autonomic workup is indicated by the patient's history and/or the referring physician's request.

This report presents the case of a 90-year-old female with a 54-year history of dizziness, which has been exhaustively investigated. Over the years, the patient made 59 visits to her family doctor and 18 visits to various specialists, as well as emergency department visits and hospitalisations. In detailing the exhaustive investigations and referrals that the patient has undergone over many years (with inconclusive results), this case illustrates the myriad challenges in diagnosing and treating chronic dizziness in the older. The authors suggest that, in complex cases characterised by multimorbidity and polypharmacy, a function-oriented approach is indicated. In place of the conventional 'diagnose and treat' model, a functional approach to ongoing care emphasises the symptom management, improvement of function and quality of life. To optimise patient outcomes, an interprofessional team approach is preferred.

### Dizziness: state of the science [^115tXFhD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Dizziness is prevalent in all adult populations, causing considerable morbidity and utilization of health services. In the community, the prevalence of dizziness ranges from 1.8% in young adults to more than 30% in the elderly. In the primary care setting, dizziness increases in frequency as a presenting complaint; as many as 7% of elderly patients present with this symptom. Classification of dizziness by subtype (vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium, and other) assists in the differential diagnosis. Various disease entities may cause dizziness, and the reported frequency of specific diagnoses varies widely, depending on setting, patient age, and investigator bias. Life-threatening illnesses are rare in patients with dizziness, but many have serious functional impairment. Dizziness can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly persons, in whom it often represents dysfunction in more than one body system. Given the relatively underdeveloped state of the empirical literature on dizziness, investigators would benefit from use of consistent criteria to describe dizziness symptoms and establish diagnoses. Investigation of the effects of testing and treatment should focus on diagnoses that are life threatening or lead to significant morbidity. In the elderly, a function-oriented approach should be studied and compared with current diagnosis-focused strategies. Alternative therapies for chronic and recurrent dizziness also merit investigation.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10 mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1 mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6 min, which dropped to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 min of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100 mg, two times per day; titrated to 100 mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1 year of follow-up.

### Syncope risk assessment in the emergency department and clinic [^1112FkU1]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The initial assessment of patients who present with presumed syncope is challenging. Syncope has many possible causes ranging from relatively benign to potentially life-threatening, and sorting through the possibilities may not be feasible given time limitations in an urgent care setting. Therefore, the physician almost always must determine whether the affected individual needs in-hospital evaluation or can be safely referred to an outpatient syncope evaluation clinic. In instances when the etiology of syncope has been diagnosed with confidence at the initial clinical evaluation, the hospitalization question is readily addressed and the appropriateness of hospitalization versus timely outpatient evaluation (preferably in a dedicated syncope management clinic) is clear. In those cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, risk stratification schemes such as those summarized in this communication become more essential. However, at present no single risk assessment protocol appears to be satisfactory for universal application. The development of a consensus recommendation is an essential next step.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Syncope definitions and diagnostic thresholds — carotid sinus hypersensitivity and postural (orthostatic) tachycardia syndrome (POTS) criteria are specified. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is present when a pause ≥ 3 s and/or a decrease of systolic pressure ≥ 50 mm Hg occurs upon stimulation of the carotid sinus. POTS is characterized by an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm with positional change from supine to standing (or ≥ 40 bpm in those 12–19 y of age) with the absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) (> 20 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP), and the standing heart rate is often ≥ 120 bpm.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^116HwKrv]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 62-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of syncope, collapse and fluctuating blood pressure (BP). His medications included midodrine (10mg, three times per day) and fludrocortisone (0.1mg, two times per day), but neither treatment afforded symptomatic relief. Autonomic testing was performed. Head-up tilt table testing revealed a supine BP of 112/68mm Hg (heart rate, 74 beats per minute (bpm)) after 6min, which dropped to 76/60mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2min of 80° head-up tilt. Findings from a heart rate with deep breathing test and a Valsalva test were consistent with autonomic dysfunction. The patient was diagnosed with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and treated with droxidopa (100mg, two times per day; titrated to 100mg, one time per day). After initiating treatment with droxidopa, the patient no longer reported losing consciousness on standing and experienced improvement in activities of daily living. These improvements were maintained through 1year of follow-up.

The standing heart rate in POTS "is often ≥ 120 bpm, and undergoes greater increases in the morning than in the evening", and orthostatic heart rate increases "gradually decrease with age and not abruptly at age 20". The document also notes that "the diagnoses of POTS and vasovagal syncope are not mutually exclusive".

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet under diagnosed disorder. It may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign, and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change. Evidence based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and the therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright position are necessary. OH is defined as fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 min in upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH, or in patients with motor impairment. The management initially consists of education, advice and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

### Autonomic function testing: an important diagnostic test for patients with syncope [^111Rcton]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem with a large differential diagnosis. The initial history and physical examination often provide initial clues; however, some cases warrant further testing to determine the underlying cause. Autonomic function testing is a safe way to evaluate patients with syncope further, and to assess their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Autonomic testing can help to diagnose several conditions, including orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome and neutrally mediated syncope. Thus, when the cause of syncope is unclear, autonomic testing can help to assess the autonomic nervous system, stratify the risk of future episodes and to guide treatment decisions.

### Do patients with a negative emergency department evaluation for syncope require hospital admission? [^112app5G]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Is hospitalization needed for patients in whom an underlying cause of syncope is not detected in the Emergency Department (ED)? To answer this question, we conducted a prospective, short-term outcomes study of consecutive patients ≥ 50 years old presenting to our ED after a syncopal episode. All subjects received a structured ED evaluation. Forty-five patients met inclusion criteria, 67% were hospitalized. None of the patients experienced a life-threatening event or required significant therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization. No patient had a new diagnosis relevant to syncope. Follow-up interviews 1 month later revealed no repeat ED visits, hospitalizations, or deaths (95% upper CI, 6.5%). One patient reported a recurrent syncope (recurrence 2.2% [95% upper CI, 10%]). This pilot study suggests that a negative structured ED evaluation may identify patients ≥ 50 years of age who may be safely discharged from the ED. Further validation is required before this observation is applied to clinical practice.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of syncope in the emergency department [^112rsqeq]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

With a careful history, physical examination, and directed investigation, physicians can determine the likely cause of syncope in more than 50% and perhaps up to 80% of patients. Understanding the cause of syncope allows clinicians to determine the disposition of high- and low-risk patients. Patients with a potential malignant cause, such as a cardiac or neurologic condition, should be treated and admitted. Those with benign causes can be safely discharged. This article reviews the diagnosis and ED work-up of syncope, the different classifications of syncope, and prognosis.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111KGqSi]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope in older adults — diagnostic testing and device use emphasize that orthostatic hypotension (OH) is not always reproducible in older adults; therefore, orthostatic BP appraisal should be repeated, preferably in the morning and/or promptly after syncope, and carotid sinus massage (CSM) is particularly important even if non-specific carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) is frequent without history of syncope. In evaluation of reflex syncope, tilt testing is well tolerated and safe with positivity rates similar to younger patients, and Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP recordings may be helpful if instability of BP is suspected. Due to the high frequency of arrhythmias, an implantable loop recorder (ILR) may be especially useful in the elderly with unexplained syncope. Being old is not a contraindication to assessment and treatment, and orthostatic BP measurements, CSM, and tilt testing are well tolerated even in the frail elderly with cognitive impairment. There is some evidence that modification of cardiovascular risk factors for falls/syncope reduces the incidence of subsequent events in community-dwelling frail elderly, even in those with dementia, but not in institutionalized elderly.

### Evaluation of syncope in older adults [^114eVWS1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The older adult patient with syncope is one of the most challenging evaluations for the emergency physician. It requires clinical skill, patience, and knowledge of specific older adult issues. It demands care in the identification of necessary resources, such as medication review, and potential linkage with several multidisciplinary follow-up services. Excellent syncope care likely requires reaching out to ensure institutional resources are aligned with emergency department patient needs, thus asking emergency physicians to stretch their administrative talents. This is likely best done as preset protocols prior to individual patient encounters. Emergency physicians evaluate elders with syncope every day and should rise to the challenge to do it well.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

Presyncope — epidemiology, prodrome, and counterpressure maneuvers: Syncope has an estimated lifetime prevalence of ≈35% and injury is present in 30% of patients treated in an ED after syncope; syncope results in 2% to 6% of hospital admissions and accounts for at least $2.4 billion in annual hospital costs in the United States, with vasovagal and orthostatic syncope responsible for 21.2% and 9.4% of syncopal episodes, respectively. Vasovagal syncope is preceded by prodromal symptoms in about two-thirds of cases, and presyncope is the prodrome of syncope that may last for a few seconds with symptoms including lightheadedness or dizziness, blurry or tunnel vision, nausea, a sensation of warmth, diaphoresis, and pallor. This prodrome represents a short time in which a first aid intervention may be used to prevent syncope; physical counterpressure maneuvers (PCMs) are a first aid intervention demonstrated to help prevent syncope, and PCMs include contraction of muscles in the legs, arms, abdomen, or neck causing a rise in blood pressure and alleviating near-syncope symptoms from vasovagal or orthostatic causes. Evidence reviews are noted, with a systematic review in 2020, an evidence update in 2022, and an updated literature search in 2023.

### Evaluation of syncope [^1146a5i6]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Syncope is a transient and abrupt loss of consciousness with complete return to preexisting neurologic function. It is classified as neurally mediated (i.e., carotid sinus hypersensitivity, situational, or vasovagal), cardiac, orthostatic, or neurogenic. Older adults are more likely to have orthostatic, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, or cardiac syncope, whereas younger adults are more likely to have vasovagal syncope. Common nonsyncopal syndromes with similar presentations include seizures, metabolic and psychogenic disorders, and acute intoxication. Patients presenting with syncope (other than neurally mediated and orthostatic syncope) are at increased risk of death from any cause. Useful clinical rules to assess the short-term risk of death and the need for immediate hospitalization include the San Francisco Syncope Rule and the Risk Stratification of Syncope in the Emergency Department rule. Guidelines suggest an algorithmic approach to the evaluation of syncope that begins with the history and physical examination. All patients presenting with syncope require electrocardiography, orthostatic vital signs, and QT interval monitoring. Patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal electrocardiography, or family history of sudden death, and those presenting with unexplained syncope should be hospitalized for further diagnostic evaluation. Patients with neurally mediated or orthostatic syncope usually require no additional testing. In cases of unexplained syncope, further testing such as echocardiography, grade exercise testing, electrocardiographic monitoring, and electrophysiologic studies may be required. Although a subset of patients will have unexplained syncope despite undergoing a comprehensive evaluation, those with multiple episodes compared with an isolated event are more likely to have a serious underlying disorder.

Orthostatic hypotension — pathophysiology and presentation are summarized as excessive venous pooling with impaired compensatory responses and characteristic upright-position syncope. OH involves excessive pooling of blood volume in the splanchnic and leg circulations, causing decreased venous return and cardiac output on standing. In neurogenic OH, vasoconstrictor mechanisms may be inadequate due to neurodegenerative disorders or autonomic peripheral neuropathies. Neurogenic OH may present clinically as classic or delayed OH, and most commonly OH is due to dehydration or medications such as diuretics and vasodilators, with syncope from OH occurring in the upright position.

### Diagnosing severe dizziness in older adults… [^117ScaTS]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common symptom in older adults; it is also associated with a greater risk of disability. Appropriate treatment or referral depends on accurate diagnosis, which is usually undertaken at the primary care level. Lawson and associates conducted a prospective case control study of the clinical features of dizziness in elderly patients to determine if diagnosis of this condition can be improved. Fifty patients older than 60 years of age who presented with dizziness were matched with 22 control subjects who did not have dizziness. All patients were interviewed and examined by a single clinician. A description of the symptoms associated with the dizziness, provoking factors and medical history were sought during the interview. The clinical examination included mental status testing, a full neurologic examination and psychiatric screening, as well as routine laboratory tests. Patients were then referred to a neurocardiovascular investigation unit and an otolaryngology department.

At that point, all patients had electrocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and orthostatic blood pressure measurements. Tilt testing, otoscopy, Weber and Rinne testing, and audiometry were also done. If indicated, patients had echocardiograms, carotid Doppler studies and computed tomography of the head. After completion of the work-up, an attributable diagnosis was made. The initial history and physical examination were used to determine which factors predicted the eventual diagnosis. Dizziness was classified, when possible, into one of the following diagnoses: peripheral vestibular disorder; orthostatic hypotension; arrhythmia; carotid sinus hypersensitivity; vasovagal syncope; or central neurologic disorders. In the patients with dizziness, symptoms had been present for two weeks to 30 years and occurred an average of three times per week.

Symptoms lasted three minutes on average, but in some patients as long as 180 minutes. About 26 percent of patients also had syncope, 16 percent had unexplained falls and 4 percent experienced both syncope and falls. A cardiovascular disorder was the attributable diagnosis for the dizziness in 28 percent of patients, while 18 percent were diagnosed with a peripheral vestibular problem and 14 percent had a central neurologic cause. Multiple diagnoses were present in 18 percent of patients, and no diagnosis was made in 22 percent. A variety of associated symptoms or descriptions made a cardiovascular diagnosis more likely: syncope, a "lightheaded" dizziness, pallor with the dizziness or a history of other cardiovascular problems. Dizziness during prolonged standing was also associated with a cardiovascular diagnosis. When the patient described the dizziness as vertigo, the diagnosis was more likely to be peripheral vestibular dysfunction.

Some physical examination maneuvers, namely visual acuity testing, the Weber and Rinne tests and the Hallpike maneuver, did not help to predict the attributable diagnosis. Similarly, routine laboratory testing, which included urinalysis, did not lead to a diagnosis. The authors conclude that a thorough history, a focused examination and appropriate referral may allow appropriate risk factor modification and treatment in elderly patients with dizziness. Cardiovascular assessment is much more likely to lead to an accurate diagnosis of dizziness than is otolaryngologic evaluation.

### Abstract… [^113kyVtK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

With episodic triggered symptoms, patients have brief episodes of intermittent dizziness lasting seconds to hours. Common triggers are head motion on change of body position. Episodic triggered symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. With spontaneous episodic symptoms, patients have episodes of dizziness lasting seconds to days. Because these episodes have no trigger, the patient's history establishes the diagnosis. Common diagnostic considerations for spontaneous episodic symptoms include Meniere disease, vestibular migraine, and psychiatric diagnoses such as anxiety disorders. Symptoms associated with lying down are more likely vestibular. With continuous vestibular symptoms, patients have persistent dizziness lasting days to weeks. The symptoms may be due to traumatic or toxic exposure.

Classic vestibular symptoms include continuous dizziness or vertigo associated with nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, gait instability, and head-motion intolerance. In the absence of trauma or exposures, these findings are most consistent with vestibular neuritis or central etiologies. However, central causes can also occur with patterns triggered by movement. Physicians should determine whether the vertigo is triggered by a specific position or change in position. BPPV is triggered with sudden changes in position, such as a quick turn of the head on awakening or tipping the head back in the shower. Dizziness from orthostatic hypotension occurs with movement to the upright position. Clinicians may erroneously assume that dizziness that worsens with movement is associated with a benign condition in patients with persistent dizziness.

11 However, exacerbation of symptoms with movement is common to most causes of persistent dizziness and does not aid in determining whether the etiology is peripheral vs. central. 7 Medications were implicated in 23% of cases of dizziness in older adults in a primary care setting 12. The use of five or more medications is associated with an increased risk of dizziness. 15 Older patients are particularly susceptible to medication adverse effects because of age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes.
13. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Findings from the physical examination — including a cardiac and neurologic assessment, with attention to the head, eye, ear, nose, and throat examination — are usually normal in patients presenting with dizziness. Blood pressure should be measured while the patient is standing and in the supine position.

16 Orthostatic hypotension is present when the systolic blood pressure decreases 20 mm Hg, the diastolic blood pressure decreases 10 mm Hg, or the pulse increases 30 beats per minute after going from supine to standing for one minute. 17 A full neurologic examination should be performed in patients with orthostatic dizziness but no hypotension or BPPV. LABORATORY TESTING AND IMAGING Most patients presenting with dizziness do not require laboratory testing. Patients with chronic medical conditions may require blood glucose and electrolyte measurements. Patients with symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and possibly carotid Doppler testing. However, in a summary analysis of multiple studies that included 4, 538 patients, only 26 had a laboratory result that explained their dizziness.
