## Question

What anesthesia is used for a robotic-assisted splenectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what anesthesia is used for a robotic-assisted splenectomy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the surgical approach and whether it dictates a specific anesthetic plan. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and contemporary series actually say about anesthesia modality. Next, I will consider special hematologic contexts that might modify anesthetic choices. After that, I should review ventilation strategies unique to robotic pneumoperitoneum. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-supported recommendation and note any exceptions or nuances that could change practice in specific scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the surgical context. Robotic-assisted splenectomy is a minimally invasive, laparoscopic-style procedure performed with the da Vinci system, which implies pneumoperitoneum, steep positioning, and prolonged operative times compared with open surgery, all of which influence anesthetic planning but do not fundamentally change the need for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation [^b749ce65] [^7a7ec40d].

> Wait, let me verify the anesthesia modality used in contemporary robotic splenectomy series. Multiple reports explicitly describe "standard general anesthesia" with endotracheal intubation and neuromuscular blockade for robotic splenectomy and related upper abdominal robotic procedures, with no credible sources advocating regional anesthesia as a primary technique for this operation [^b749ce65] [^114a292b] [^4486c3ec].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about regional anesthesia. I initially wondered if a neuraxial technique could be used, but I need to check feasibility and safety in this setting. Given the need for a pneumoperitoneum, steep positioning, and prolonged operative time, neuraxial anesthesia alone is impractical and potentially unsafe for robotic splenectomy; moreover, I find no evidence supporting spinal or epidural anesthesia as a standalone approach for this procedure, reinforcing that general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is standard [^7a7ec40d].

> Next, I should review ventilation considerations unique to robotic surgery. Pneumoperitoneum and positioning impair compliance and gas exchange, so protective ventilation strategies are commonly emphasized in robotic surgery studies and protocols, including volume-controlled or pressure-controlled modes with low tidal volumes, PEEP, and recruitment maneuvers as appropriate, with ongoing research into flow-controlled ventilation as a potential optimization strategy in this context [^7a7ec40d] [^d8ee9aa9].

> I need to ensure I address hematologic indications that might modify perioperative management. In patients with thrombocytopenia, particularly ITP, guidelines suggest administering platelets intraoperatively rather than preoperatively during minimally invasive splenectomy to reduce bleeding risk without exposing patients to unnecessary transfusions, which is a key anesthesia-adjacent coordination point rather than a change in anesthetic modality [^8a977d96] [^1a936f55].

> Let me synthesize the practical plan. Standard practice is general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, neuromuscular blockade, and controlled ventilation using a protective strategy tailored to pneumoperitoneum and positioning, with invasive arterial monitoring considered for complex cases or significant comorbidity. Regional anesthesia is not used as a primary technique for robotic splenectomy, though multimodal analgesia including TAP blocks may be added for postoperative pain control in some centers [^b749ce65] [^114a292b] [^7a7ec40d].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate general anesthesia due to severe cardiopulmonary disease? I should double-check whether any alternative approaches are described. I find no evidence-based alternatives to general anesthesia for robotic splenectomy; in exceptional, high-risk patients, the surgical approach may be modified to open or hand-assisted techniques with tailored anesthesia, but that shifts the question away from robotic splenectomy per se and remains outside the scope of standard robotic practice [^notfound].

> Final answer: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation is the standard anesthetic for robotic-assisted splenectomy, with protective ventilation strategies to mitigate pneumoperitoneum-related physiology and intraoperative platelet administration timed for ITP when indicated. Regional anesthesia is not used as a primary technique for this procedure [^b749ce65] [^7a7ec40d] [^8a977d96].

Robotic-assisted splenectomy is performed under **general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation** to ensure a secure airway and controlled ventilation during pneumoperitoneum and steep positioning [^b749ce65]. Neuromuscular blockade is essential to facilitate robotic instrument manipulation and prevent patient movement [^114a292b]. Standard induction uses propofol, an opioid (e.g. fentanyl or remifentanil), and a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (e.g. rocuronium or vecuronium), with maintenance via inhaled agents (sevoflurane or desflurane) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and remifentanil [^114a292b]. Ventilation is typically volume-controlled or pressure-controlled with low tidal volumes and PEEP to mitigate pneumoperitoneum-related atelectasis and hypercarbia [^notfound]. Regional anesthesia (e.g. TAP block or epidural) may be added for multimodal analgesia, but is not a substitute for general anesthesia in this setting [^a9d49656].

---

## Indications for anesthesia in robotic-assisted splenectomy

Anesthesia for robotic-assisted splenectomy must address the following **surgical requirements**:

- **Pneumoperitoneum**: CO2 insufflation causes hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis, requiring controlled ventilation and CO2 monitoring [^d8ee9aa9].

- **Steep positioning**: Reverse Trendelenburg or lateral decubitus positions can impair ventilation and venous return, necessitating careful hemodynamic and ventilatory management [^a966eb83].

- **Prolonged operative time**: Robotic procedures often take longer than open surgery, increasing the risk of atelectasis, hypothermia, and venous stasis, which must be mitigated through appropriate anesthesia strategies [^44953cd8].

---

## Preoperative assessment and preparation

Preoperative assessment focuses on identifying comorbidities, hematologic abnormalities, and airway risks. Key steps include:

- **Hematologic evaluation**: Assess platelet count, coagulation profile, and hemoglobin levels, as thrombocytopenia or anemia may influence perioperative transfusion and hemostasis strategies [^1a936f55].

- **Airway assessment**: Evaluate for difficult intubation due to patient positioning and the need for prolonged intubation [^notfound].

- **Patient counseling**: Explain the anesthesia plan, risks, and postoperative pain management strategies, including the potential use of regional anesthesia [^a9d49656].

---

## Anesthesia induction and maintenance

### Induction

Induction typically uses **propofol** (2–2.5 mg/kg IV) for hypnosis, **fentanyl** (2–5 mcg/kg IV) or remifentanil (1–2 mcg/kg IV) for analgesia, and a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant such as rocuronium (0.6–1.2 mg/kg IV) or vecuronium (0.08–0.1 mg/kg IV) to facilitate intubation and provide muscle relaxation [^114a292b].

---

### Maintenance

Maintenance may use **inhaled anesthetics** such as sevoflurane (1–2 MAC) or desflurane (4–6%) with opioid supplementation (e.g. remifentanil 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min), or **total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)** with propofol (4–6 mg/kg/h) and remifentanil (0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min), which may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting and provide rapid emergence [^notfound].

---

## Intraoperative monitoring and management

Continuous monitoring and proactive management are essential to ensure patient safety and optimal surgical conditions:

| **Parameter** | **Monitoring and management** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamics | - Continuous arterial blood pressure (invasive or non-invasive) <br/> - Heart rate <br/> - Central venous pressure (CVP) if indicated <br/> - Fluid management to maintain normovolemia and hemodynamic stability [^d8ee9aa9] |
| Respiratory function | - Continuous capnography <br/> - Pulse oximetry <br/> - Arterial blood gas analysis <br/> - Ventilation adjustments to manage hypercarbia and maintain oxygenation [^d8ee9aa9] |
| Neuromuscular blockade | - Train-of-four monitoring <br/> - Adjustment of muscle relaxant dosing to maintain adequate relaxation for robotic manipulation [^114a292b] |
| Temperature | - Forced-air warming devices <br/> - Warmed IV fluids <br/> - Maintaining normothermia to prevent hypothermia-related complications [^notfound] |

---

## Ventilation strategies

Ventilation strategies must account for pneumoperitoneum and positioning effects:

- **Mode**: Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with low tidal volumes (6–8 mL/kg ideal body weight) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5–8 cm H2O to minimize atelectasis and improve oxygenation [^notfound].

- **Recruitment maneuvers**: Periodic recruitment maneuvers may be performed to reopen collapsed alveoli and improve oxygenation [^notfound].

- **CO2 management**: Hypercarbia is common due to CO2 absorption; minute ventilation should be adjusted to maintain normocapnia or mild hypocapnia [^notfound].

---

## Regional anesthesia and multimodal analgesia

Regional anesthesia can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia to provide **postoperative analgesia** and reduce opioid consumption:

- **Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block**: Provides effective postoperative analgesia for abdominal procedures and reduces opioid requirements [^notfound].

- **Epidural anesthesia**: May be considered in select cases, particularly if open conversion is anticipated or if the patient has significant comorbidities requiring enhanced postoperative pain control.

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs (if not contraindicated), and low-dose opioids for comprehensive pain management [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative considerations

Postoperative care focuses on **rapid recovery**, pain control, and complication prevention:

- **Emergence**: Rapid emergence from anesthesia is facilitated by TIVA or low-dose inhaled anesthetics, allowing early extubation once adequate ventilation and neuromuscular recovery are confirmed [^notfound].

- **Pain management**: Continued multimodal analgesia, including regional blocks and oral medications, to optimize pain control and facilitate early mobilization [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring for postoperative complications, including bleeding, respiratory complications, and thromboembolic events, is essential [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **tailored anesthesia strategies**:

- **Pediatric patients**: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is standard, with careful attention to fluid management, temperature regulation, and age-appropriate analgesia [^notfound].

- **Patients with hematologic disorders**: Preoperative optimization of platelet counts and coagulation parameters, and intraoperative transfusion strategies, are critical to minimize bleeding risk [^1a936f55].

- **Obese patients**: Positioning and ventilation strategies must be adjusted to accommodate body habitus and reduce intraoperative complications [^a966eb83].

---

Robotic-assisted splenectomy is performed under **general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation**, neuromuscular blockade, and controlled ventilation, with adjunctive regional anesthesia for analgesia. The anesthesia plan is individualized based on patient comorbidities, surgical complexity, and institutional protocols to ensure safety, comfort, and optimal surgical conditions.

### Robotic splenectomy: what is the real benefit? [^5cefbe04]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The laparoscopic approach to a difficult splenectomy requires a longer total operative time and is frequently associated with an increased risk of bleeding and a high conversion rate.

Methods

A total of 418 elective splenectomies were registered in the Department of General Surgery and Liver Transplantation of Fundeni Clinical Institute between January 1995 and June 2012, of which 299 splenectomies (212 laparoscopic and 77 robotic) were performed by a single surgical team and retrospectively documented. The effect of the learning curve and the relative complexity of each type of procedure were analyzed using the Minimally Invasive Splenectomy Score, which further allowed categorizing the splenectomies as simple or difficult. Statistical analyses using the CUSUM algorithm of the intra- and postoperative parameters of the laparoscopic and robotic approaches, for both the simple and the difficult splenectomies, were performed.

Results

The results of the statistical analyses clearly indicated that there was a learning curve effect for laparoscopic splenectomy but not for robotic splenectomy. When compared with the laparoscopic approach in difficult splenectomies, the robotic approach had a shorter total operative time (84.13 vs. 97.2 min), less blood loss (30.88 vs. 156.9 ml), and decreased risk of hemorrhagic complications during surgery.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic splenectomy remains the approach of choice for simple splenectomies in the surgical treatment for common indications. The robotic system is particularly beneficial in difficult splenectomies (i.e., partial splenectomy, splenectomy in liver cirrhosis, splenic tumors, or malignant hemopathies).

Statistical analysis

Meta-Analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) software version 5.4. Regarding dichotomous outcomes, pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Mean difference (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated for the continuous outcomes. Following the guidelines of Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions, (2) Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-Square and I-Square tests. Whenever the p-value of Chi-Square test was < 0.1 or I-Square test result was > 50% in a meta-analysis model, studies were considered heterogeneous. A random-effect model was adopted for heterogenous studies; otherwise, a fixed-effect model was used. Additionally, whenever heterogeneity was observed, a sensitivity analysis was performed by removing one study in each scenario.

### A comparison of robotic-assisted splenectomy and laparoscopic splenectomy for children with hematologic disorders [^ac0e67a1]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is the standard of care for hematologic disorders requiring splenectomy. Less is known about the outcomes following robotic-assisted splenectomy (RS) for this indication. Our aim was to describe outcomes of RS to LS in pediatric patients with hematologic disorders in our institution.

Methods

A single institution retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients undergoing LS vs. RS from 2014 to 2019. Patient demographics, diagnosis, spleen size, hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, post-operative opioid use, and hospital charges were evaluated. Standard univariate analyses were performed.

Results

Twenty-four patients were included in the study (14 LS, 10 RS). The mean spleen size at the time of surgery was larger in the RS group compared to LS (14.5 cm vs. 12.2 cm, p = 0.03). Operative time between the two cohorts was comparable (RS 140.5 vs LS 154.9 min). Median LOS for RS was shorter than LS (2.1 vs. 3.2 days, p = 0.02). Cumulative postoperative opioid analgesic requirements were not significantly different between the groups (17.4 mg vs. 30.5 mg). The median hospital charges, including the surgical procedure and hospital stay were higher in the RS group ($44,724 RS vs $30,255 LS, p = 0.01).

Conclusion

Robotic splenectomy is a safe and feasible option for pediatric patients with hematologic disorders, and was associated with decreased LOS but higher charges compared to laparoscopic splenectomy. Further studies are required to delineate the optimal use and potential benefits of robot-assisted surgical techniques in children.

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dcd6458b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in accordance with the guidelines of Cochrane handbook.

Eligibility criteria

Our systematic review included English language studies that compared laparoscopic and robotic approaches of splenectomy in children under 18 years old. Case-reports and conference abstracts were excluded. There were no further restrictions regarding study design or date of publication.

Database search

In November 2024, we performed a systematic search in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane CENTRAL. We searched the literature using the search strategy: (laparoscopy OR laparoscopic OR laparoscopes OR laparoscope OR Laparoscopic OR laparoscopically OR laparoscopically OR laparoscopy OR robotic OR "robot-assisted" OR "robot assisted" OR robotically OR robotics OR robotization OR robotized OR robots) AND (paediatrics OR pediatrics OR paediatric OR pediatric OR children)) AND (splenectomy OR splenectomies OR spleen resection).

Study identification

Identified records were imported into EndNote in order to remove duplicates. Subsequently, records were exported to Excel, where titles and abstracts were examined by two independent reviewers. Finally, full-text screening was performed in accordance with the previously mentioned eligibility criteria. Any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer.

Data extraction

General information, baseline characteristics, safety and efficacy outcomes were extracted from each study by two independent reviewers and revised by a third one. General information included: study ID, study design, total sample size, sample size for each arm, indication of splenectomy and follow-up period after splenectomy. Baseline data included: age, sex, BMI, hematological diseases, spleen weight, and spleen longitudinal diameter for each study arm. Efficacy and safety outcomes included operation time, blood loss, postoperative complications, need for blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, conversion to open surgery.

Risk of bias

The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was adopted to assess the quality of the included non-randomized retrospective cohort studies. The seven quality domains were assessed for each study by two independent reviewers and a third reviewer handled disagreements. We implemented the GRADE approach system in order to estimate the quality of evidence; two reviewers adopted the Grading recommendations assessment, which categorizes each outcome into one of four levels: high, moderate, low, or very low.

### A critical comparison of robotic versus conventional laparoscopic splenectomies [^fb8ff92c]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The benefit of robotic systems for general surgery is a matter of debate. We compare our initial series of robotic splenectomies with our first series of conventional laparoscopic ones. A retrospective analysis of the first six robotic versus the first six conventional laparoscopic splenectomies is presented. Patients were matched with regard to age, body-mass index, ASA score, and preoperative platelet levels. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Size and weight of the resected specimens were comparable in both groups. Median overall operating time was 154 (range, 115–292) min for the robotic and 127 (range, 95–174) min for the laparoscopic group. No complications occurred. There were no open conversions. The median postoperative hospital stay was 7 (robotic group) and 6 (laparoscopic group) days. Median average costs were 6927 dollars for the robotic procedure versus $4084 for the conventional laparoscopic procedure (p < 0.05). Minimally invasive splenectomies are feasible using either conventional laparoscopic techniques or the da Vinci robotic system. In this analysis, procedures performed with the da Vinci robotic system resulted in prolonged overall operative time and significantly higher procedural costs. The use of a robotic system for laparoscopic splenectomy offers, at this stage, no relevant benefit and thus is not justified.

Future research priorities for minimally invasive splenectomy indicate that the panel felt future research should focus on larger, prospective, possibly randomized studies addressing this KQ to increase the certainty of evidence, and on studies that determine the minimum platelet count preoperatively for the safe conduct of major or minor surgical procedures without the need for platelet transfusion.

### Partial splenectomy: who, when and how. A systematic review of the 2130 published cases [^7fe7d27b]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

In order to avoid consequences of total splenectomy (including severe postsplenectomy sepsis), partial splenectomy (PS) is increasingly reported. Without guidelines and indications concerning a rarely-indicated procedure, a review of literature should be an asset.

Methods

A systematic review of all PSs from 1960 to December 2017 was performed, with special focus on surgical indications, sites of resection, approaches and techniques of vascular dissection and parenchymal section/hemostasis of the spleen, perioperative morbidity/mortality, including complications compelling to perform total splenectomy.

Results

Among 2130 PSs, indications for resection were hematological disease in 1013 cases and nonhematological conditions in 1078, including various tumors in 142 and trauma in 184. Parenchymal transection was performed using several techniques through the years, most frequently after having induced partial ischemia by splenic hilum vascular dissection/ligation. 371 laparoscopic/robotic PSs were reported. Rescue total splenectomy was required in 75 patients.

Conclusions

Although good results are probably overestimated by such a retrospective review, PS should be considered as a procedure associated with a low morbidity/mortality. Nevertheless, severe complications are also reported, and the need of total splenectomy should not to be minimized. Laparoscopic/robotic procedures are increasingly performed, with good results and rare conversions.

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^083fe59b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is currently well-established as a standard technique for splenectomy. Robotic splenectomy (RS) is being introduced as a new minimally invasive alternative. The current study aims to directly compare RS and LS specifically in the pediatric population undergoing splenectomy for non-traumatic indications.

Methods

We performed a systematic search in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane CENTRAL in November 2024. We included studies that compared outcomes of RS and LS in pediatric patients. We extracted the amount of blood loss, operation time, length of hospital stay, the number of patients who needed blood transfusion or were converted to open approach and post-operative complications. Finally, RevMan software was adopted for meta-analysis.

Results

Six retrospective studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in the current systematic review and meta-analysis with a total of 248 patients, of which 123 and 125 children underwent RS and LS respectively. Blood loss was significantly lower in RS group (MD = -56.95, P = 0.01). Operation time, hospital stay, the need for blood transfusion and post-operative complications showed no significant difference between both RS and LS groups. Despite the overall good quality of the included studies, the GRADE quality of evidence was considered very low due to the observational nature of the included studies, small sample sizes and high variability between outcomes of different studies.

Conclusion

Our study guides the existing literature towards a possible non-inferior status of robotic splenectomy compared to the well-established laparoscopic splenectomy in most clinical outcomes. Blood loss was significantly lower in children who underwent robotic splenectomy, but small sample size limits generatability of such finding. The challenge of higher costs of robotic splenectomy needs to be addressed in well-designed cost-effectiveness studies.

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^75cb3bd4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Splenectomy is a well-established surgical intervention in pediatric population. It is frequently indicated for hematologic conditions, hypersplenism and splenic tumors. Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) is known as the gold standard for such patients when feasible, providing excellent outcomes in experienced hands. However, technical challenges encountered during the procedure, which may result in prolonged operative duration and elevated complication rates, underscore the necessity to identify a new minimally invasive alternative.

Robotic-assisted splenectomy (RS) is a potential alternative procedure which may shorten operative time, minimize hospital stay and reduce blood loss. The wristed instruments, along with 3D magnification, provide enhanced visualization and motion control with greater precision. However, a previously published meta-analysis reported the absence of a significant difference between RS and LS in terms of operative time and hospital stay in adult population. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of RS has been questioned, taking into consideration the prolonged setup time, which is particularly relevant in the context of pediatric surgery, where resource allocation and procedural efficiency are critical factors.

Many studies investigated the use of RS for hematological indications in adult population. However, the use of robotic surgery in pediatric population has been limited due to technical difficulties, including instruments size and general lack of experience. Recently, there has been an increase in research reports on the use of RS in pediatric patients, highlighting the need for a comprehensive evidence synthesis tailored to this age group.

The current research work is a systematic review that aims to offer robust evidence about the role of RS in pediatric population. Incorporating meta-analysis models intends to provide direct comparisons between RS and LS in terms of key peri-operative outcomes, particularly operation time, conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, blood transfusion and blood loss.

### Partial splenectomy in the era of minimally invasive surgery: the current laparoscopic and robotic experiences [^0c1d0884]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Partial splenectomy (PS) is a spleen-preserving technique that is applied as a result of trauma, focal lesions or hematological conditions. Despite the improvement of laparoscopic techniques within the past several decades, minimally invasive PS has remained a marginal technique that has not been well evaluated. Our objective was to provide an update on the indications and the feasibility of this procedure.

Methods

The MEDLINE database (PubMed) was searched, and all relevant articles that involved a true minimally invasive PS (i.e., segmental or lobar devascularization of the spleen with parenchymal transection) were included. The search was conducted until the 31st of March 2014. Demographic data, operative indications, estimated blood losses, operative times, conversion rates and complications were extracted from the included articles and were summarized for discussion.

Results

Out of the 195 publications that were retrieved, 33 were included, which were mainly case reports and case series that represented a total of 187 patients. There were 37 men, 33 women and 117 patients of unknown gender. The mean age of the patients was ranged from 6 to 58 years. The mean total operative time was between 70 and 216 min for conventional laparoscopy and between 108 and 120 min for the robotic approach. For most studies, the mean estimated blood loss was minimal. The complication rate was 5.36% for conventional laparoscopy and 5.56% for the robotic approach.

Conclusion

The outcomes of minimally invasive PS were favorable and comparable to those of the open technique according to the literature. This procedure may constitute an attractive alternative to the open technique for selected cases. Moreover, a robotic approach might be an interesting technical option, but additional research is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.

### How can robot-assisted surgery provide value for money? [^cea8e726]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

As far as we are aware, we are the first offering a generic and flexible insight in the potential cost-effectiveness of (new) surgical robotic systems. This is particularly important in the current era where many new systems are being developed while the affordability of healthcare is increasingly under pressure. The interactive model described in this paper provides relevant stakeholders, such as surgeons, purchasers, and policymakers, the unique opportunity to gain insight in what is needed to provide value for money when using (new) surgical robotic systems. It informs them on the effect that is needed to compensate the additional costs of a (new) surgical robotic system.

Earlier studies showed that surgical costs and effects for robot-assisted procedures may vary between indications. Gkegkes et al, for example, found ranges from €2539 to €57 002 and from €7888 to €16 851 for robot-assisted and endoscopic procedures, respectively. The costs used in our analysis, €2739 for a robot-assisted procedure and €1124 for an endoscopic procedure, seem low compared with these costs. This can be explained by the fact that the current surgical robotic system is more expensive than the costs we assumed for the new hypothetical surgical robotic system in the present study. Furthermore, we only included the fixed and variable costs of the equipment used and did not include other costs such as operating theater costs and anesthesia.

Blood transfusion

The incidence of blood transfusion was reported in three studies; RS group included 86 patients and LS group included 63 patients. The overall risk ratio did not favor either RS or LS group (RR = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.22; P = 0.10). The included studies showed homogeneity (P = 0.39, I² = 0%) (Fig. 2 B).

Operation time

Six Studies reported operation time for both RS and LS groups; RS group included 120 patients and LS group included 124 patients. The overall mean difference did not favor either RS or LS groups (MD = 17.96; 95% CI, −51.95 to 87.87; P = 0.61). The included studies showed heterogeneity (P < 0.00001, I² = 98%) indicating variability across studies. Removing one study in each scenario did not resolve heterogeneity (Fig. 3 A).

Length of hospital stay

Length of hospital stay was reported in six studies; RS group included 120 patients and LS group included 124 patients. The overall mean difference did not favor either of the two groups (MD = 0.37; 95% CI −0.77 to 1.51; P = 0.53). Heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (P < 0.00001, I² = 88%). Heterogeneity remained unresolved after removing single study in each scenario (Fig. 3 B)

Post-operative complications

The outcome of postoperative complications was reported in three studies; RS group included 90 patients and LS group included 70 patients. The overall risk ratio did not favor either of the two groups (RR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.11 to 1.05; P = 0.06). The included studies were homogenous (P = 0.23, I² = 31%) (Fig. 4).

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^14e96015]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The potentially high cost associated with robotic techniques remains one of the major barriers to their widespread adoption. Therefore, cost-effectiveness studies are needed to enrich the current literature and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of such innovative approach, directing the surgical community toward the next step in the field. Additionally, the higher costs of the robotic technique restrict its availability in regions with scarce resources, which limits generalizability of the results. Multi-center cost-effectiveness studies with sufficiently large samples are necessary to establish solid evidence regarding RS cost compared to LS.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis comprehensively reviewed the current state of evidence regarding robotic techniques of splenectomy in the pediatric population. This study investigated the outcomes of RS in an age group where splenectomy is widely indicated due to various non-traumatic causes, especially the hematological ones.

Heterogeneity was high in 3 out of 5 meta-analysis models in our study (blood loss, operation time and length of hospital stay). Random-effect model was adopted in these models and sensitivity analysis was conducted as well. However, heterogeneity was only resolved in the meta-analysis models of blood loss. Additionally, the relatively scarce literature limited our ability to perform meta-regression or subgroup analyses based on child age or spleen size in order to explore sources of heterogeneity.

Another limitation is the exclusive retrospective design of the available literature that compares the outcomes of RS and LS. Despite being the basis for future plans for prospective studies, retrospective studies are prone to selection and recall biases as well as missing information. Since retrospective studies were not originally designed to collect data for research purposes, prospective studies are necessary to overcome the drawbacks of the current evidence.

The observational nature of the included studies had a major contribution to the very low GRADE quality of evidence. In addition, unresolved heterogeneity of operation time and hospital stay outcomes, and the wide confidence interval of all outcomes except hospital stay. The wide and imprecise confidence intervals are probably attributed to small sample sizes and high variability of study outcomes. Overall, well-designed, prospective, multicenter clinical trials with larger populations and considerable quality are needed in the future.

In conclusion, our study guides the existing literature towards a possible non-inferior status of robotic splenectomy compared to the well-established laparoscopic splenectomy in most clinical outcomes. Blood loss was significantly lower in children who underwent robotic splenectomy, but small sample size limits generatability of such finding. The challenge of higher costs of robotic splenectomy needs to be addressed in well-designed cost-effectiveness studies.

1 Introduction

1.1 The Challenge of Surgical and Procedural Access

Access to surgical care remains one of the most pressing yet unsolved public health challenges. Surgical deserts — regions lacking adequate access to surgical care — are a well‐documented global issue that affects both developed and developing countries. Today, over half of the global population lives without sufficient surgical access. Even in the most advanced healthcare systems and affluent countries, access to high‐quality surgical care remains deeply inequitable, with approximately 24% of the population in high‐income countries lacking adequate surgical access.

In the United States, a country viewed as a leader in healthcare innovation, over one‐third of counties lack access to a single surgeon. This crisis is projected to worsen with an estimated shortage of up to 30,200 surgeons across all specialties by 2034. Although surgical expertise is often concentrated in urban centers, patients in both rural and remote areas face overwhelming barriers to care.

Multiple factors, including a shortage of skilled surgeons and interventionalists, geographic barriers, rising healthcare costs, and financial pressures on healthcare providers, drive limited access to quality surgical care. The implications of inadequate surgical access are far‐reaching: patients are left with limited, or often, no options for essential procedures, leading to costly and time‐consuming travel, delayed care, or substandard surgeries and postoperative treatment. In the developed world, these barriers drive surgical delays, create capacity bottlenecks at high‐volume hospitals, and force patients to travel long distances. In developing countries, the challenges are even more pronounced — many regions lack even the most basic surgical infrastructure.

Discussion

Robotic surgical techniques are increasingly gaining the interest of surgeons across various specialties due to their potential to overcome the shortcomings of the well-recognized laparoscopic techniques. Despite being well-established, LS still poses some challenges, such as the required meticulous dissection of the spleen and its vascular pedicle to control intra-operative bleeding loss. RS, with its magnification abilities, has been explored lately in the literature as a potential alternative to LS.

The anatomical specifications of the pediatric spleen along with technical challenges related to RS make it important to investigate the outcomes of such procedure in the pediatric age group specifically. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aim to review the current state of evidence about RS in pediatric patients. It provides direct comparisons between RS and LS to evaluate the advantages of each approach over the other in this specific age group.

Blood loss is a critical intraoperative complication, especially in children, where hemorrhage disturbs hemodynamic stability quickly compared to adults. In our study, blood loss was significantly lower among pediatric patients in RS group compared to LS group. The meta-analysis of Peng et al. reviewed and analyzed the literature of RS in adult population and found a significant reduction in blood loss which goes in alignment with our findings in pediatric population (P = 0.0006).

Intraoperative blood loss was previously reported as the principal indication for conversion of laparoscopic splenectomy to open approach, as bleeding could obscure surgeon's view. Additionally, splenomegaly could increase the risk of such blood loss, which is the case in many hematological indications of splenectomy. The enhanced precision and motion control of the robotic technique may be responsible for the lower amounts of blood loss, especially for the non-traumatic indications, which is the case in both the current study and the previous published one on adult population.

Results

Data collection and study selection

Our systematic search yielded 1,352 records from different databases (PubMed = 590, WOS = 544, Scopus = 198 and Cochrane = 20), of which 278 duplicated records were identified and removed. Subsequently, 1,074 unique records were examined for eligibility through title and abstract screening. Of these, 41 records were eligible for full-text screening, and ultimately, only 6 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in evidence synthesis. The study selection process is illustrated in Fig. 1.

PRISMA flow diagram of the included studies

Characteristics of the included studies

All of the six included studies were retrospective cohort studies with a total population of 248 children. RS and LS were the adopted interventions in 123 and 125 children, respectively. Indications of splenectomy varied between studies, including different hematological causes such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia and recurrent need of blood transfusion. Additional details regarding general information and baseline characteristics are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

Outcomes

Blood loss

The amount of blood loss was reported in four studies; RS group included 95 patients and LS group included 84 patients. The amount of blood loss was significantly lower in RS group (MD = −56.95, 95% CI, −101.59 to −12.30, P = 0.01). Heterogeneity was observed between studies (P < 0.00001, I² = 96%). Heterogeneity was best resolved by excluding the study of Delgado-Miguel 2023 (P 0.46, I² = 46%). After omitting Delgado-Miguel 2023 from the meta-analysis model, the overall mean difference still favored RS group over LS group (MD = −34.23; 95% CI, −44.87 to −23.59; P < 0.00001) (Fig. 2 A).

### Clinical efficacy and learning curve analysis of 101 robotic-assisted warshaw procedures: a retrospective study [^b749ce65]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical team and procedure

All procedures were performed by the same surgical team using the da Vinci robotic surgical system. The primary surgeon and first assistant both had extensive experience in open and laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, had received standardized robotic surgical training, and were certified for operation. The operating room nurses were dedicated staff for robotic surgery.

Patients were placed in the supine position with the head elevated and feet lowered in a "spread-eagle" position under general anesthesia. An 8-mm curved incision below the umbilicus served as the observation port, with four Trocars placed in a "V" shape around the umbilicus, on the left and right sides of the abdomen near the midclavicular and anterior axillary lines. The fourth-generation da Vinci robot was used, with mechanical arm 1 fitted with grasping forceps, arm 2 with fenestrated bipolar forceps, arm 3 with the robotic camera, and arm 4 with the robotic ultrasonic scalpel.

The procedure began with comprehensive exploration of the peritoneum and abdominal organs to exclude tumor metastasis. The gastrocolic ligament was opened using an ultrasonic scalpel, adhesions between the posterior gastric wall and pancreas were dissected, and the gastric body was elevated using blunt instruments to fully expose the pancreatic body and tail. For the Warshaw technique: After isolating the proximal pancreatic body and the space between the splenic artery and vein, these vessels were ligated using No. 7 sutures and closed with absorbable biological clips or Hem-o-lock clips before division. The proximal pancreatic body was then transected using an Endo-GIA stapler. Alternatively, the pancreatic body and splenic vessels could be mobilized together and transected simultaneously using an Endo-GIA stapler. The pancreatic body and tail were dissected toward the splenic hilum along with the splenic vessels, and the splenic hilar vascular branches were divided close to the distal pancreatic tail using an Endo-GIA stapler to complete specimen removal. The specimen was placed in a retrieval bag and extracted through an extended umbilical Trocar incision. A drain was placed at the pancreatic stump and brought out through the left lateral abdominal wall Trocar site. If splenic hilar vessels were difficult to isolate or if splenic perfusion became compromised after division of the splenic hilar vessels, combined splenectomy was performed. If uncontrollable major bleeding occurred during vessel dissection, conversion to open surgery was undertaken.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^3a59d32d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — The panel suggests that drains not be used routinely during elective, MIS (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Evidence came from a single, small, observational study of low quality and 54 participants, in which routine drain placement was favored over no drain placement regarding operative time (MD -41.75 minutes (95% CI, -72.77 to -10.73). For routine placement of drains, the effect was deemed trivial. Routine drain placement was possibly associated with small harm regarding SSI (OR 2.97 [95% CI, 0.14 to 61.05], absolute difference is 1.2% more (0.6 fewer to 33.5 more) and length of stay (MD 1.46 [-0.32 to 3.24]). The expert panel felt there could be an increased risk of SSI with routine drain placement based on duration of drainage and stated there may also be increased costs to patients for increased length of stay. All evidence for each outcome was very low certainty.

### Robot-assisted spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy [^4486c3ec]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy would be an ideal approach for benign and borderline malignant tumors in the distal pancreas.1 However, this procedure requires advanced surgical experience and technique because of the disadvantages of conventional laparoscopic surgery.2

Methods

A 35-year-old female patient visited our institution because of a growing pancreatic mass during follow-up. A preoperative image study showed a cystic tumor of about 3.0 × 2.5 cm in size in the body of the pancreas. Under the impression of a growing serous cystic tumor of the pancreas, she was scheduled to undergo robot-assisted spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.

Results

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position with her head and left side elevated. A total of five ports were used. Among them, one 12-mm port was placed for the assistant surgeon's intervention during the procedure. Stable 3-dimensional operative image, endo-wrist function of the instruments, and no tremor were thought to be very helpful for fine dissection of the pancreas from splenic vessels. The total operation time was 300 min, and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 380 ml. No transfusion was required. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. She was able to go home on the 6th postoperative day without a drain.

Conclusions

The unique characteristics of a robotic surgical system were thought to be very helpful during the spleen-preserving laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.2 (-) 6 However, cost is one of the main obstacles for the procedure's popular clinical practice.2.

### Benchmarking of robotic and laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy by using two different methods [^44953cd8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Unselected population

In the study interval, 1230 patients were scheduled for minimally invasive SPDP from 32 centres of the European Consortium on Minimally Invasive Pancreatic Surgery (Fig. S1); 1006 patients ultimately underwent minimally invasive SPDP and 224 eventually had an unplanned splenectomy. Among the 1230 patients, 951 (77.3 per cent) underwent laparoscopically assisted and 279 (22.7 per cent) robotically assisted SPDP. Overall, 764 of the patients were women (62.1 per cent), median age was 59 years (i.q.r. 45–68) years, and median BMI was 25.0 (22.3–28.3) kg/m 2 (Table 2). The majority had ASA I–II status (80.4 per cent).

Table 2
Baseline characteristics, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes for the total cohort used in the Achievable Benchmark of Care analysis

The overall rates of conversion, overall morbidity, and major morbidity were 8.2 per cent (101 patients), 50.6 per cent (622), and 13.9 per cent (170) respectively, with no significant differences between the laparoscopic and robotic approach. The median duration of operation was significantly longer in the robotically assisted SPDP group than in the laparoscopically assisted group (262.5 (210–340) versus 195 (150–254) min; P < 0.001), as was the median duration of hospital stay (8 (6–11) versus 7 (5–10) days; P < 0.001). The overall rate of failure to preserve the spleen was 18.2 per cent (224 patients), POPF was reported in 224 patients (18.2 per cent), 160 (13.2 per cent) were readmitted, and 7 died within 90 days of surgery (0.7 per cent), with no significant difference between groups (Table 2). A significantly higher proportion of Kimura procedures was performed in the robotically assisted group than the laparoscopic group (90.3 versus 67.0 per cent; P < 0.001) (Tables S1 and S2).

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b5685a7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The long operation time was one of the initial challenges encountered during the introduction of LS to the surgical community as an alternative to open surgery. However, as surgeons gained experience with the technique, the difference in operative time between LS and the open approach has arrived at insignificant levels in some reports. Based on this earlier experience, it may be reasonable to suggest a potential decrease in operation time for RS with continued practice and familiarity.

Our study found no significant difference between RS and LS groups in terms of post-operative complications, which goes in alignment with the results of Ghidini et al. in pediatric population (P = 0.235). On the other hand, the meta-analysis of Peng et al. reported a significantly lower rate of post-operative complications in RS group (P = 0.05). RS is indeed characterized by minimal tissue manipulation and high precision. However, the unique anatomical considerations of the pediatric spleen, along with the limited experience of surgeons in pediatric cases, may help explain the lower complication rates in adult RS.

The literature status did not offer sufficient data suitable for meta-analysis of RS cost compared to LS. Delgado-Miguel et al. 2024, one of the retrospective studies included in our systematic review, reported no significant difference in median economic costs among 84 pediatric patients (P = 0.215). These findings align with a previously published review by Bhat et al. in 2022 that concluded the absence of statistically significant difference between RS and LS in adult population (P = 0.74). However, the cost analysis of Bhat et al. was based on two included studies only, which limits reliability and generalizability of the findings. These results guide the scientific community toward a potential non-inferior status of RS compared to LS in terms of cost-effectiveness across both adult and pediatric populations. Nonetheless, the evidence regarding cost-effectiveness is considered limited with small number of studies and small population samples.

### Robot-assisted treatment of splenic artery aneurysms [^48f54425]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) are relatively uncommon, they are clinically relevant because of the risk of rupture. Optimal management is a matter of debate and involves the use of percutaneous endovascular stenting, which has limitations, versus the open surgical approach which can lead to significant morbidity. The present study reports the outcomes of robot-assisted surgery for SAA and its role in overcoming many of the limitations of laparoscopy.

Methods

A total of nine patients with incidentally detected SAAs underwent a surgery between September 2001 and November 2007. Six of these nine patients underwent a robot-assisted splenic aneurysm resection with vascular reconstruction. The remaining three cases included one robotic arterial ligation, one robotic partial splenectomy, and one laparoscopic splenectomy.

Results

The mean operating time was 212 ± 61 minutes (range: 90–300), mean intraoperative blood loss was 186.6 ± 202.4 mL (range: 0–500), and mean hospital stay was 7.1 ± 3.7 days (range: 3–14). The morbidity rate was 11.1% and no mortality was reported. Doppler-ultrasonography surveillance showed regular organ perfusion in all patients with vascular reconstruction.

Conclusion

Robot-assisted surgery for SAA represents one of the most advanced developments among minimally invasive procedures and can become an important option for the treatment of this disease.

### Robotic distal pancreatectomy: a novel standard of care? Benchmark values for surgical outcomes from 16 international expert centers [^fda43fb5]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Robotic distal pancreatectomy (DP) is an emerging attractive approach, but its role compared with laparoscopic or open surgery remains unclear. Benchmark values are novel and objective tools for such comparisons. The aim of this study was to identify benchmark cutoffs for many outcome parameters for DP with or without splenectomy beyond the learning curve.

Methods

This study analyzed outcomes from international expert centers from patients undergoing robotic DP for malignant or benign lesions. After excluding the first 10 cases in each center to reduce the effect of the learning curve, consecutive patients were included from the start of robotic DP up to June 2020. Benchmark patients had no significant comorbidities. Benchmark cutoff values were derived from the 75th or the 25th percentile of the median values of all benchmark centers. Benchmark values were compared with a laparoscopic control group from 4 high-volume centers and published open DP landmark series.

Results

Sixteen centers contributed 755 cases, whereof 345 benchmark patients (46%) were included the analysis. Benchmark cutoffs included: operation time ≤ 300 minutes, conversion rate ≤ 3%, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula ≤ 32%, 3 months major complication rate ≤ 26.7%, and lymph node retrieval ≥ 9. The comprehensive complication index at 3 months was ≤ 8.7 without deterioration thereafter. Compared with robotic DP, laparoscopy had significantly higher conversion rates (5×) and overall complications, while open DP was associated with more blood loss and longer hospital stay.

Conclusion

This first benchmark study demonstrates that robotic DP provides superior postoperative outcomes compared with laparoscopic and open DP. Robotic DP may be expected to become the approach of choice in minimally invasive DP.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^483a6cf9]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Surgical approach

Laparotomic splenectomy

The traditional approach to splenectomy has been by laparotomy. This approach allows for a careful search for an accessory spleen which, if left behind, may cause recurrence of anemia. The disadvantages of open splenectomy are mainly surgical morbidity and abdominal wall scarring. Laparoscopic splenectomy has become feasible with progress in minimally invasive techniques.

Laparoscopic splenectomy

Laparoscopic splenectomy is currently considered the gold standard technique for removal of a normal sized or slightly enlarged spleen and is preferred to open splenectomy. Compared to open splenectomy, laparoscopic splenectomy: (i) is less traumatic; (ii) is associated with fewer complications; (iii) requires shorter hospital stays; (iv) has a better cosmetic outcome; and (v) overall, has a lower cost. However, it should only be performed by experienced surgeons. Nowadays, laparoscopic splenectomy is possible and safe also for massively enlarged spleens, but in such cases is associated with longer operating times and longer stays in hospital. Perioperative splenic artery embolization has been found to be useful and reduces the complications of massive spleen laparoscopic splenectomy. Moreover, selective splenic artery embolization, carried out in steps, will reduce spleen size and alleviate cytopenias.

A preoperative assessment of splenic size by ultrasound is recommended. Although three-dimensional computed tomography is considered to be more accurate, it does not provide significant advantage in estimating spleen size and its use should be limited to those cases in which additional information about the anatomy is required prior to surgery.

Partial splenectomy

In an attempt to reduce the infectious risk of total splenectomy, especially for children less than 6 years of age who suffer severe anemia or are transfusion-dependent, partial splenectomy has been increasingly used in recent years. In partial splenectomy, usually 80–90% of the enlarged spleen is removed. Partial splenectomy was initially performed using an open splenectomy approach but laparoscopic and robotic approaches have recently been introduced. Nevertheless, partial splenectomy should always be performed by an experienced surgeon.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^a966eb83]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy positioning — comparative effects of supine versus lateral: The use of supine position was associated with moderate undesirable effects related to conversion to open and transfusion requirement, each reported as OR 2.25 [95% CI, 0.62–8.18] with an absolute difference 10.0% more [35 fewer to 511 more], and with mean estimated blood loss (MD 103.5 mL [30.46 to 176.54]). The panel found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for the critical outcomes of conversion due to small sample size and imprecision, and the evidence suggests that lateral positioning be considered for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) over supine positioning. Decision considerations noted that patients unwilling to receive blood products may value transfusion risk more, that the lateral approach may be technically easier particularly in obese patients, and that concomitant procedures at the same time as splenectomy may change optimal positioning.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^506471e5]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive splenectomy (MIS) is increasingly favored for the treatment of benign and malignant diseases of the spleen over open access approaches. While many studies cite the superiority of MIS in terms of decreased morbidity and length of stay over a traditional open approach, the comparative effectiveness of specific technical and peri-operative approaches to MIS is unclear.

Objective

To develop evidence-based guidelines that support clinicians, patients, and others in decisions on the peri-operative performance of MIS.

Methods

A guidelines committee panel of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) including methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to grade the certainty of evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

Informed by a systematic review of the evidence, the panel agreed on eight recommendations for the peri-operative performance of MIS for adults and children in elective situations addressing six key questions.

Conclusions

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of lateral positioning for non-hematologic disease, intra-operative platelet administration for patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura instead of preoperative administration, and the use of mechanical devices to control the splenic hilum. Further, a conditional recommendation was made against routine intra-operative drain placement.

### Robotic approach improves spleen-preserving rate and shortens postoperative hospital stay of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy: a matched cohort study [^67df829a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Spleen preservation (SP) is beneficial for patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy of benign and borderline tumors; however, the conventional laparoscopy approach (C-LDP) is less effective in controlling splenic vessel bleeding. The benefits of the robotic-assisted approach (RA-LDP) in SP have not been clearly described. This study aimed to evaluate whether a robotic approach could improve SP rate and effectiveness/safety profile of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP).

Methods

Matched for scheduled SP, age, sex, ASA classification, tumor size, tumor location, and pathological type, 69 patients undergoing RA-LDP and 50 undergoing C-LDP between January 2005 and May 2014 were included. Main outcome measures included SP rate, operative time (OT), blood loss, transfusion frequency, morbidity, postoperative hospital stay (PHS), and oncologic safety.

Results

Among matched patients scheduled for SP, RA-LDP was associated with significantly higher overall (95.7 vs. 39.4%) and Kimura SP rates (72.3 vs. 21.2%), shorter OT (median 120 vs. 200 min), less blood loss (median 100 vs. 300 mL), lower transfusion frequency (2.1 vs. 18.2%), and shorter mean PHS (10.2 vs. 14.5 days). Among matched patients scheduled for splenectomy, RA-LDP was associated with similar OT, blood loss, transfusion frequency, and PHS. The two approaches were similar in overall morbidity, frequency of pancreatic fistula, and oncologic outcome among patients undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors.

Conclusions

RA-LDP was associated with a significantly better SP rate and reduced OT, blood loss, transfusion requirement, and PHS for patients undergoing SP compared to C-LDP, but offered less benefits for patients undergoing splenectomy.

### Optimizing robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy: strategies and innovations to enhance safety and efficacy [^7a53d82c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy by robotic surgery is a safe and feasible surgical technique. Currently, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy represents an alternative to the classical distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, in the case of benign and low-grade malignant diseases of the body or pancreas tail. The reasons for preserving the spleen are based on the reduction of postoperative complications, such as post-splenectomy infections, subphrenic abscess, portal thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytosis, and thromboembolism. This procedure can be performed by completely preserving the splenic vessels (Kimura technique), not preserving the splenic vessels (Warshaw technique), or just resecting the splenic vein (Kim technique).

Results

The robotic approach is a feasible option for this surgery, in terms of reducing postoperative pain and facilitating patient recovery without increasing the risk of pancreatic fistula, hospital readmission, morbidity, and mortality. Compared with laparoscopy, robotic surgery demonstrates a lower conversion rate and reduced splenectomy rate. This surgical technique can be technically demanding, even robotically, therefore several maneuvers are described to reduce operative difficulty and improve surgical outcomes.

Conclusions

The objective of this video is to provide a step-by-step guide to robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy surgery, highlighting tips and innovations for improved safety and effectiveness.

### Early outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic splenectomy in pediatric population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ff4a5b99]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the significant difference in terms of amount of blood loss, the rate of patients who needed blood transfusion showed no significant difference between RS and LS groups. This could be attributed to the limited number of studies that reported the outcome, as only 3 studies provided blood transfusion data. More importantly, blood transfusion is a procedure governed by strict guidelines; therefore, not all cases of blood loss are indicated for blood transfusion. Additionally, the need for blood transfusion is influenced not only by the severity of blood loss but also by the patient's baseline condition.

Meta-analysis of conversion to open approach was not feasible in our study, as one of the three studies that included this outcome reported no events of conversion in both groups. Overall, the three studies reported 2 conversion events out of 81 patients in the RS group, compared to 4 events out of 55 patients in the LS group. The Ghidini et al. meta-analysis that was published in 2022 reported no significant difference in terms of conversion rate between RS and LS groups in pediatric population (P = 0.3).

On the other hand, Peng et al. reported a significantly lower conversion rate in RS group among adult population (P = 0.02). This discrepancy in findings between adult and pediatric populations could be attributed to the learning curve associated with the robotic approach in pediatric patients, as the introduction of RS in adults began earlier than in the pediatric population.

In terms of operation time, our study found no significant difference between RS and LS groups in pediatric patients. This finding aligns with the results of Peng et al. where they found no significant difference in adult population as well (P = 0.72). This insignificant difference might be related to the relatively limited experience of surgeons in the field of robotic surgery compared to laparoscopic techniques. Additionally, the length of hospital stay showed no significant difference between groups in both pediatric population of our study (P = 0.53) and adult population of the Peng et al. meta-analysis (P = 0.39).

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^1a936f55]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — pre-operative platelet administration versus intra-operative platelet transfusion in ITP was informed by a single, small observational study (n = 30) and the panel found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low, with no desirable effects seen for pre-operative platelet administration and moderate harms. Harms included estimated blood loss (MD 150.5 mL [56.59 to 244.41]), transfusion requirement (OR 1.50 [0.32–6.99], absolute difference 10.0% more [25.8 fewer to 37.5 more]), conversion to open approach (OR 2.11 [0.12–37.72], absolute difference 5.0% more [4.4 fewer to 61.5 more]), surgery time (MD 38 minutes [-22.77 to 98.77]), length of stay (MD 1.1 days [-0.58 to 2.78]), and 30-day spleen related disease remission (OR 0.47 [0.03–8.46], absolute difference 5.1% fewer [58.7 fewer to 4.4 more]). While all outcomes slightly favor intra-operative platelet administration over pre-operative, there is serious imprecision of the single study addressing this question due to small sample size and wide confidence intervals. The panel suggests the use of intra-operative platelet transfusion during laparoscopic splenectomy for patients with ITP, as opposed to pre-operative administration. Existing treatment guidelines for ITP recommend platelet transfusion for life-threatening emergencies and major procedures only, and perioperative timing of platelet transfusion is not addressed in the literature for pediatric patients. It is important to note, that many patients with ITP will not require any platelet transfusion based on acceptable preoperative platelet counts.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^a1c8e541]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy — device choice for splenic hilum control is addressed as follows: The use of endomechanical devices for the control of the splenic hilum has slightly decreased risk of intraoperative blood loss, need for transfusion, and conversion to an open operation, and the panel conditionally suggests that endomechanical devices be used to control the hilum for most patients undergoing elective, MIS. The panel unanimously agreed that very large hilar vessels would be safer to take with endo-mechanical devices, and vessel characteristics influence selection because the size of the vessel can play an important role in choice of device and larger vessels may be better taken via endo-mechanical devices. Manufacturer recommendations for some energy devices do not recommend use above a certain size, and many surgeons would not accept using energy devices for larger vessels or vessels with substantial calcification. Although the low volume difference in blood loss is unlikely to be valued, the decrease in transfusions with mechanical devices is very likely to be valued by patients, and importance of transfusion ranged from important to critical based on patient subpopulation, for example cancer patients. Because of the very low certainty in the evidence due to imprecision, the panel was prevented from giving a strong recommendation.

### A consensus document on robotic surgery [^a45260b1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Institutional policies for robotic surgery — Healthcare institutions that employ high level technology as surgical robots in clinical practice need to develop and follow credentialing guidelines, and the initiation of a robotic surgical program is similar to the introduction of any other novel, high-level, direct patient care technology, and should require appropriate training and credentialing. In addition, each institution needs to develop a consistent policy concerning the nature of the procedures to be performed with regard to the need for IRB oversight, such policy must take into account the nature of the proposed procedure itself, and the institution also has an obligation to maintain the system consistent with manufacturer's guidelines.

### Laparoscopic versus robotic subtotal splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis. potential advantages and limits of an expensive approach [^aa1775a6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study was designed to compare the laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy with the robotic approach in patients with hereditary spherocytosis.

Methods

Thirty-two consecutive subtotal splenectomies by minimal approach in patients with hereditary spherocytosis were analyzed (10 robotic vs. 22 laparoscopic subtotal splenectomies).

Results

A significant difference was found for the robotic approach regarding blood loss, vascular dissection duration, and splenic remnant size. Follow-up for 4–103 months was available.

Conclusions

Subtotal splenectomy seems to be a suitable candidate for robotic surgery, requiring a delicate dissection of the splenic vessels and a correct intraoperative evaluation of the splenic remnant. Robotic subtotal splenectomy is comparable to laparoscopy in terms of hospital stay and complication. The main benefits are lower blood loss rate, vascular dissection time, and a better evaluation of the splenic remnant volume.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^69fcdc58]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

KQ 6 — Endo-mechanical versus energy devices for splenic hilum control during elective minimally invasive splenectomy states that the panel suggests that mechanical devices be used to control the splenic hilum during elective, MIS instead of energy devices (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). There were moderate desirable effects for endo-mechanical control of the splenic hilum for minimally invasive splenectomy from two RCTs, 80 participants total, including estimated blood loss (MD -2.48 mL [95% CI, -66.35 to 61.38]), transfusion (OR 0.21 [95% CI, 0.02–2.03], absolute difference 6.2% fewer [7.8 fewer to 7 more]), and conversion to open (OR 0.09 [95% CI, 0.00–1.77], absolute difference 7.2% fewer [8 fewer to 5.3 more]). The use of endo-mechanical devices for hilar control was associated with small harm and undesirable effects related to mesenteric venous thromboembolism (OR 6.11 [95% CI, 0.68–55.19], absolute difference 1.1% more [< 0.1 fewer to 1.2 more]) and operative time (MD 14.45 minutes [95% CI, 5.17 to 23.74]). All critical outcomes for this KQ have very low certainty of the evidence making the overall certainty very low.

### Benchmarking of minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy: European multicentre study [^a92577eb]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Benchmarking is the process to used assess the best achievable results and compare outcomes with that standard. This study aimed to assess best achievable outcomes in minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy (MIDPS).

Methods

This retrospective study included consecutive patients undergoing MIDPS for any indication, between 2003 and 2019, in 31 European centres. Benchmarks of the main clinical outcomes were calculated according to the Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC™) method. After identifying independent risk factors for severe morbidity and conversion, risk-adjusted ABCs were calculated for each subgroup of patients at risk.

Results

A total of 1595 patients were included. The ABC was 2.5 per cent for conversion and 8.4 per cent for severe morbidity. ABC values were 160min for duration of operation time, 8.3 per cent for POPF, 1.8 per cent for reoperation, and 0 per cent for mortality. Multivariable analysis showed that conversion was associated with male sex (OR 1.48), BMI exceeding 30kg/m2 (OR 2.42), multivisceral resection (OR 3.04), and laparoscopy (OR 2.24). Increased risk of severe morbidity was associated with ASA fitness grade above II (OR 1.60), multivisceral resection (OR 1.88), and robotic approach (OR 1.87).

Conclusion

The benchmark values obtained using the ABC method represent optimal outcomes from best achievable care, including low complication rates and zero mortality. These benchmarks should be used to set standards to improve patient outcomes.

Robotic surgery — length of stay considerations require procedure-by-procedure comparison because robotic surgery may be appropriately compared to minimally invasive techniques or to open techniques. Length of stay affects cost centers outside the operating room, and decreased length of stay will counterbalance some of the increased operating room expenses associated with all forms of minimally invasive surgery (MIS); length of stay may be affected by postoperative pain, intraoperative blood loss and complication rates, and the differences between robotic and conventional surgery in these categories has not yet been adequately studied.

The panel agreed that use of MIS versus open should be reported, and the type of MIS (laparoscopic or robotic or assisted) should be stated. Conversion to open was agreed as the inability to complete the dissection through an MIS approach, usually requiring an incision larger than that required to remove the specimen, and if a conversion from MIS to open occurred, it should be clearly reported.

Introduction:

Pancreatic robotic surgery (PRS) allows less invasivity and a better anatomical view than open surgery. From the anesthesiological point of view, this approach requires greater attention to hemodynamics and ventilation as complications can occur during or after surgery. This observational study aimed at evaluating the first 2 years of PRS procedures so as to foster a common anesthesiological management.

Methods:

We analyzed the data of patients submitted to PRS between December 2017 to January 2020. Standard general anesthesia was performed (induction with propofol, opioid and rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade, maintenance with alogenate or TIVA/TCI), using VCV or PCV-VG ventilation; vital signs and TOF were constantly monitored intra-operatively. We recorded baseline clinical characteristics, pre-operative SOFA score, positive pre-operative surveillance rectal swabs, clinical(AKI, pneumonia, fever and/or sepsis) and surgical complications (pancreatic fistulae, abdominal collections, bleeding); 1st post-operative day(POD) SOFA score; ICU and hospital length of stay(LOS).

Results:

66 pts(14–77 y, 21 males) were analyzed, ASA 1–3, mean BMI 20.3 kind of interventions were performed: 5 enucleoresections, 27 spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy, 34 distal splenopancreatectomy. Mean duration of surgery was 426' with a mean laparoscopic IAP of 12 mmHg. TAP block was performed in 21 pts. Pre-operative SOFA score was 0 for all patients. Pre-operative rectal swabs showed 1 case of E. coli ESBL. Pre- and PO SOFA score were not statistically different.9 patients were admitted to ICU with maximum LOS of 5 days. Mean LOS in the hospital was 11 days. 65% of patients had complications (21 sepsis, 23 fistulae, 16 abdominal collections, 5 PO bleeding, 4 pneumonias, 2 pneumothorax, 1 AKI). We recorded 1 case of PO positive rectal swab (C. freudii ESBL) and 3 cases of MRSA bloodstream infection.

Conclusions:

IO management did not alter pts' SOFA score but postoperative complications prolonged both ICU and hospital LOS.

Robotic surgery — technology limitations and applicability: Limitations of current robotic technology include, among other technical constraints, lack of haptics (force feedback), size of the devices, instrumentation limitations (both size and variety), lack of flexibility of certain energy devices, and problems with multi-quadrant surgery, with current devices deployed typically for single quadrant application. Overall, the technically exceptional laparoscopic surgeon may derive little benefit from robotic surgery; however, surgical robots may serve as an "enabling technology" for many surgeons, allowing them to provide complex minimally invasive procedures to a broad range of patients, and the potential advantages of robotic surgery extend across many different surgical subspecialties.

### Anesthesia for splenectomy in patients with blood dyscrasias… [^f2723991]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The choice of anesthetics for patients undergoing splenectomy is considered on the basis of experience with 205 patients who had various blood dyscrasias. Congenital spherocytosis was present in 33 patients, and light cyclopropane anesthesia plus administration of tubocurarine, with controlled respiration, was used in 22 of these. It afforded a stable cardiocirculatory state without significant complications either during or after surgery. A second group consisted of 49 patients with acquired hemolytic anemia, a third of 79 with thrombocytopenic purpura, and a fourth of 44 patients with pancytopenia, neutropenia, and aplastic anemia. Complications were most numerous in the purpuric group, in which the splenectomy often failed to have a therapeutic effect, so that there were seven postoperative deaths. It was not found necessary to choose anesthetic agents for the sake of their effects on the contractility of the spleen.

The choice was made, rather, on the basis of the patient's liability to hemorrhage and hypotension. Endotracheal and intestinal intubation were avoided whenever the platelet count was low, in order to reduce the danger of bleeding; spinal anesthesia was avoided when the circulating blood volume was low. The policy was to maintain an adequate blood volume with transfusions of fresh, whole blood, but to transfuse cautiously in cases of acquired hemolytic anemia because of the hazard of severe hemolytic reactions.

### Benchmarking of robotic and laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy by using two different methods [^a57c11ec]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benchmarking is a process in which the performance of best-in-class performers is measured to establish reference values to enable comparison of outcomes against those of the best in the industry. Lately, there has been growing interest in this concept from the surgical field, considering that benchmarks can encourage surgeons to reach the highest possible level of clinical quality and not just perform to the average.

Accordingly, benchmarks have already been established for breast, liver, oesophageal, and pancreaticsurgery. For pancreatic surgery, benchmarks have only been applied to open pancreatoduodenectomy, open distal pancreatectomyor minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, and none have been defined for spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP). As previous comparative studiesbetween distal pancreatectomy with and without splenectomy have reported significant differences in intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, separate benchmarks are required for the two procedures.

Interestingly, the approach for defining benchmarks in surgery differs among published studies. The majority of the studies followed the best-patient-in-best-centre methodology, firstly described by Staiger et al. in which benchmarks are derived in a predefined low-risk population as the 75th percentile of the median proportion of outcomes across high-volume units. These benchmarks are supposed to mirror a realistic cut-off value, because not only the top few, but 75 per cent of that median proportion, achieved in high-volume centres, represent the benchmark. However, for the same reason, they may not be considered as intuitive or very strict.

On the contrary, fewer studies have followed the Achievable Benchmark of Care (ABC TM; University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) methodology. This aims to present benchmarks as the best achievable outcomes derived from top performers in an unselected population from centres with different volumes. They could be considered too ambitious, but ABC benchmarks do not imply that this outcome always has or can be achieved, but they illustrate the gap between benchmark and personal performance to encourage potential improvement knowing that that the target level has been achieved. Furthermore, these benchmarks are applicable to real-life surgical patients instead of only low-risk patients. To date, it remains unknown whether these two methodologies give similar results or not, and there is no clear consensus on the best benchmark methodology to apply.

### Long-term evaluation of the outcomes of subtotal laparoscopic and robotic splenectomy in hereditary spherocytosis [^21a9e88c]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited disease affecting the erythrocyte membrane. Total splenectomy (TS) is effective in reducing hemolysis and decreasing the need of transfusions, but total removal of the spleen represents a potential risk factor for infectious and non-infectious complications. On the other hand, subtotal splenectomy (STS) could be an alternative therapy for HS. The aim of this study is to establish which surgical approach has the best outcome in HS.

Methods

All patients (n = 63) receiving splenectomy for HS between 2002 and 2016 from one institution were retrospectively reviewed. Hemoglobin and reticulocytes levels during preoperative and postoperative follow-up periods were compared. Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed analyzing data regarding hemoglobin and reticulocytes levels from several available studies.

Result

At 1-year follow-up, our clinical data showed that mean hemoglobin levels increased after TS from (mean ± SD) 9.77 ± 1.82 to 11.88 ± 2.08 g/dl, while after STS from 8.98 ± 1.66 to 11.87 ± 1.38 g/dl. At 3-year and 5-year follow-up after TS, we observed an increase from 9.77 ± 1.82 to 13.59 ± 2.03 and 13.46 ± 1.64 g/dl, respectively. At 3-year and 5-year follow-up after STS in our cohort, we observed an increase from 8.98 ± 1.66 to 13.21 ± 1.95 and 13.68 ± 1.65 g/dl, respectively. The meta-analysis (for a follow-up period of 1 year) showed that the hemoglobin levels increased with 2.61 g/dl (95% CI 2.15–3.08 g/dl; p < 0.001) after TS, and with 1.67 g/dl (95% CI 1.25–2.10 g/dl; p < 0.001) after STS.

Conclusion

We conclude that subtotal and minimally invasive splenectomy could be considered as the first line of treatment in severe HS cases, especially in children.

### PROtective ventilation with FLOW-controlled… [^d8ee9aa9]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The investigators want to investigate in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery how applicable flow-controlled ventilation is, and whether it might also be safer than the current ventilation techniques, as well as its impact on potentially reducing the risk of lung-specific complications. Flow-controlled ventilation has already been tested in several studies on animals and humans and has proven to be a safe form of ventilation for patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. The optimization of intraoperative ventilation is important in patients under general anesthesia, when physiologic breathing is replaced by non- physiologic artificial ventilation.

Especially in patients undergoing robot- assisted laparoscopic surgery, intraoperative ventilation can be challenging, because of changes in compliance of the respiratory system and associated problems in gas exchange, due to the pneumoperitoneum and often extreme body positioning. The investigators hypothesize, that FCV is a safe and feasible ventilation strategy in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of intraoperative FCV in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, with a focus on: gas exchange, including both oxygenation and decarboxylation; minute ventilation, during all phases of intraoperative ventilation; key ventilator settings and ventilation parameters; respiratory complications, including pneumothorax and hemodynamic complications, including hypotension and arrhythmias.

The secondary objectives are to assess the feasibility of intraoperative FCV and the study protocol in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery, including an evaluation of the use of FCV. The need for rescue ventilation strategies, i.e., whether FCV can be used during all phases of intraoperative ventilation; and compliance with the study protocol, omissions in the eCRF, and the feasibility of follow-up, i.e., how well each PPC can be captured. Secondary endpoints focus on evaluating the feasibility of intraoperative FCV and the study protocol, including: ventilation protocol adherence; and study protocol adherence; and completeness of the eCRF and follow-up of PPCs.

Robotic surgery — clinical applications evidence and advantages: As of June, 2006, no level I data exist at this time to strongly support robotic surgery; conversely, no studies or anecdotal reports exist to suggest any increase in complication rates compared to conventional open or laparoscopic surgery, and the literature regarding robotic surgery lags behind the clinical experience by several years. Current literature suggests that the primary clinical advantages of currently available robotic systems, compared to conventional open or laparoscopic surgery, include superior visualization including 3-dimensional imaging of the operative field, stabilization of instruments within the surgical field, mechanical advantages over traditional laparoscopy, and improved ergonomics for the operating surgeon. Across multiple surgical specialties, robotic surgery was felt to offer the greatest advantage in complex reconstructive processes.

### Committee opinion no. 628: robotic surgery in gynecology [^22fc40c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The field of robotic surgery has developed rapidly, and its use for gynecologic conditions has grown exponentially. Surgeons should be skilled at abdominal and laparoscopic approaches for a specific procedure before undertaking robotic approaches. Surgeon training, competency guidelines, and quality metrics should be developed at the institutional level. Robot-assisted cases should be appropriately selected based on the available data and expert opinion. As with any surgical procedure, repetition drives competency. Ongoing quality assurance is essential to ensure appropriate use of the technology and, most importantly, patient safety. Adoption of new surgical techniques should be driven by what is best for the patient, as determined by evidence-based medicine rather than external pressures. Well-designed randomized controlled trials or comparably rigorous nonrandomized prospective trials are needed to determine which patients are likely to benefit from robot-assisted surgery and to establish the potential risks.

A lack of 'borderline' resectable terminology may also contribute to a lower likelihood of such tumours being considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, despite being associated with higher recurrence and lower survival rates.

A second recurring discussion concerns the spleen, as this has commonly been considered as a part of a distal pancreatectomy, often en passant rather than according to indication, and with considerable variation in splenic salvage rates between institutions. One reason for doing splenectomy routinely, rather than attempting a spleen-preserving procedure (Fig. 1b), may have been technical difficulties in dissection off the splenic vessels, particularly as practised in laparoscopic surgery. However, spleen preservation avoids the need for postsplenectomy vaccinations and the life-long increased infection risk. The introduction of robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery may facilitate spleen preservation, as demonstrated in one large studythat showed higher spleen preservation rates (81% for robotic versus 63% laparoscopic procedures; P = 0.001). The spleen can be left after distal pancreatectomy by either sparing all the splenic vessels (Kimura procedure) or, even if the splenic vessels are difficult to dissect free (embedded in the pancreatic tissue, or involved by the tumour), by dividing and resecting the vessels (new terminology S+) and relying on the remaining blood flow from the gastrosplenic arteries (Warshaw procedure) (Fig. 1b).

We performed a variety of complete total endoscopic general surgical procedures, including colon resection, distal gastrectomy, and splenectomy, successfully with the assistance of the da Vinci computer-enhanced surgical system. The robotic system allowed us to manipulate the endoscopic instruments as effectively as during open surgery. It enhanced visualization of both the operative field and precision of the necessary techniques, as well as being less stressful for the endoscopic operating team. This technological innovation can therefore help surgeons overcome many of the difficulties associated with the endoscopic approach and thus has the potential to enable more precise, safer, and more minimally invasive surgery in the future.

Best-patient-in-best-centre benchmarks

From the total cohort of 1230 patients treated in 32 centres, 764 (62 per cent) low-risk patients treated in 23 centres were identified for the best-patient-in-best-centre benchmark analysis. Exclusion and inclusion criteria for the low-risk cohort are reported in Table 1. Of the 764 procedures, 602 (79 per cent) were laparoscopically assisted and 162 (21 per cent) were robotically assisted. Patient and operative characteristics are summarized in Table 4. The benchmarks cut-offs for laparoscopically assisted SPDP were 254 min for duration of operation, 150 mL for intraoperative blood loss, 5.8 per cent for conversion, 29.9 per cent for failure to preserve the spleen, 62.7 per cent for overall morbidity, 20.4 per cent for major morbidity, 23.8 per cent for POPF, 8 days for duration of hospital stay, 20 per cent for readmission, and 0 per cent for 90-day mortality (Table 5).

### A consensus document on robotic surgery [^472a764a]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Robotic surgery consensus — introduction states that robotic surgical devices have developed beyond the investigational stage and are routinely used in minimally invasive general surgery, pediatric surgery, gynecology, urology, cardiothoracic surgery and otorhinolaryngology, and notes that devices continue to evolve and, as they become less expensive and more widely disseminated, will likely become more frequently utilized. The leadership of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and the Minimally Invasive Robotic Association (MIRA) felt that guidelines for the usage of robots in surgery were lacking and that the surgical community would benefit from a consensus statement including guidelines for training and credentialing; to accomplish this, SAGES and MIRA assembled an international multidisciplinary consensus group to draft a consensus statement. The SAGES-MIRA Robotics Consensus Conference was convened at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City on June 2–3, 2006, and the task force addressed four distinct questions central to the use of robots in surgery.

### European association of endoscopic surgeons (EAES) consensus statement on the use of robotics in general surgery [^e76e8ac0]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Following an extensive literature search and a consensus conference with subject matter experts the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. Robotic surgery is still at its infancy, and there is a great potential in sophisticated electromechanical systems to perform complex surgical tasks when these systems evolve. 2. To date, in the vast majority of clinical settings, there is little or no advantage in using robotic systems in general surgery in terms of clinical outcome. Dedicated parameters should be addressed, and high quality research should focus on quality of care instead of routine parameters, where a clear advantage is not to be expected. 3. Preliminary data demonstrates that robotic system have a clinical benefit in performing complex procedures in confined spaces, especially in those that are located in unfavorable anatomical locations. 4. There is a severe lack of high quality data on robotic surgery, and there is a great need for rigorously controlled, unbiased clinical trials. These trials should be urged to address the cost-effectiveness issues as well. 5. Specific areas of research should include complex hepatobiliary surgery, surgery for gastric and esophageal cancer, revisional surgery in bariatric and upper GI surgery, surgery for large adrenal masses, and rectal surgery. All these fields show some potential for a true benefit of using current robotic systems. 6. Robotic surgery requires a specific set of skills, and needs to be trained using a dedicated, structured training program that addresses the specific knowledge, safety issues and skills essential to perform this type of surgery safely and with good outcomes. It is the responsibility of the corresponding professional organizations, not the industry, to define the training and credentialing of robotic basic skills and specific procedures. 7. Due to the special economic environment in which robotic surgery is currently employed special care should be taken in the decision making process when deciding on the purchase, use and training of robotic systems in general surgery. 8. Professional organizations in the sub-specialties of general surgery should review these statements and issue detailed, specialty-specific guidelines on the use of specific robotic surgery procedures in addition to outlining the advanced robotic surgery training required to safely perform such procedures.

### Laparoscopic splenectomy: standardized approach [^f54867ff]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic splenectomy was first reported in 1991–1992 by several groups. The impact and role of laparoscopy for splenectomy can be considered as significant as that for gallbladder disease, achalasia, esophageal reflux, and adrenal disease. In many centers, the laparoscopic approach is now routine for most cases of elective splenectomy. The laparoscopic approach is associated with reduced morbidity, especially pulmonary, wound, and infectious complications. This article reviews a standardized approach to laparoscopic and hand-assisted splenectomy and covers indications, operative strategy, and complications. Several special considerations, including massive splenomegaly, postsplenectomy thrombosis of the portosplenic venous system, and accessory spleens are also discussed.

### Expert consensus-based technical guidelines for remote robotic-assisted surgery and procedures [^656c79e9]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Remote robotic-assisted surgery and procedures offer significant potential to enhance access to surgical expertise, optimize patient outcomes, improve healthcare efficiency, reduce costs, and increase patient and provider satisfaction, aligning with the quintuple aim. By mitigating geographic barriers, addressing surgical deserts, and reducing travel burdens for surgeons, patients, and their families, remote robotic-assisted surgery and procedures can substantially expand access to high-quality health care. The safe and effective implementation of remote procedures depends on the availability of robust, surgical-grade networks, reliable connectivity, and comprehensive cybersecurity measures to protect patient data. Seamless integration among remote-enabled robotic system interfaces, telepresence technologies, and facility-level infrastructure is essential to ensure operational reliability and procedural success. These technical guidelines define the fundamental technical requirements to support the design, implementation, and scaling of safe, effective, and interoperable remote robotic-assisted surgical and procedural programs. As the field evolves, guidelines will be updated to reflect technological advancements, specifications, and emerging best practices. Complementary clinical and operational practice guidelines will work synergistically with technical guidelines to support the global expansion and market adoption of remote programs.

### Conventional laparoscopic and robot-assisted spleen-preserving pancreatectomy: does da Vinci have clinical advantages? [^ceb8c3ef]. Surgical Endoscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Function-preserving minimally invasive pancreatectomy is thought to be an ideal approach for pancreatic benign and borderline malignant lesions requiring pancreatectomy. However, it is not that easy to accomplish this goal with the conventional laparoscopic approach. It requires extensive surgeon experience and learned techniques. A robot surgical system was recently introduced to overcome these limitations and it may potentially provide precise and safe laparoscopic surgery.

Methods

Between March 2006 and July 2010, a total of 45 patients underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted pancreatectomy performed by a single pancreatic surgeon to preserve the spleen. Twenty-five patients underwent the conventional laparoscopic approach (Lap group) and the other 20 patients underwent robot-assisted surgery (Robot group). The perioperative clinicopathologic variables (age, gender, length of resected pancreas, tumor size, tumor location, amount of bleeding, operation time, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, and cost) were compared between the two groups, as well as the spleen preservation rate.

Results

Younger patients preferred robot-assisted surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery (44.5 ± 15.9 vs. 56.7 ± 13.9 years, p = 0.010), and the mean operation time was longer in the Robot group (258.2 ± 118.6 vs. 348.7 ± 121.8 min, p = 0.016). The spleen-preserving rate of the Robot group was considerably superior to that of the Lap group (fail/success, 9/16 vs. 1/19, p = 0.027). However, robot surgery cost the patients about USD 8,300 (USD 8,304.8 ± 870.0), which was more than twice the amount for the Lap group (USD 3,861.7 ± 1,724.3). There were no significant differences in other clinicopathologic variables.

Conclusion

Robot-assisted pancreatic surgery could provide an increased chance for spleen preservation in spite of higher cost and longer operation time. More experiences are needed to specifically address the role of robot surgery in the advanced laparoscopic era.

### Robot-assisted surgery for noncancerous gynecologic conditions: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 810 [^234739d7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 810 — robot-assisted surgery for noncancerous gynecologic conditions emphasizes that robot-assisted surgical devices are tools for a minimally invasive approach and that appropriate training on robotic devices is necessary to ensure patient safety and appropriate use of technology. Robot-assisted cases should be selected based on the likelihood of improved outcomes compared with other surgical approaches due to the complexity of the case or patient factors, with appropriate consideration to costs. As with any procedure, informed consent should be obtained from patients before surgery with discussion of the surgeon's experience with robot-assisted surgery, indications for surgery, and potential risks and benefits associated with the robot-assisted technique compared with alternative surgical approaches and other therapeutic options. Ongoing quality assurance is essential to ensure appropriate use of the technology and, most importantly, patient safety. Well-designed studies are needed to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from robot-assisted surgery over other minimally invasive approaches.

### Can a single-shot abdominal wall nerve block for unexpected open surgery be done without specific consent? [^a9d49656]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall blocks are simple and safe opioid-sparing adjuncts for abdominal procedures that are generally well tolerated. These blocks have been shown to be effective for open abdominal surgeries, though their utility in laparoscopic or robotic surgery has been questioned. The unanticipated conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery may pose a challenge for the anesthesiologist, if regional anesthesia was not discussed before the start of the case as part of the pain-control regimen. Inability to offer an abdominal wall block leads to increased use of opioid medications and less-than-ideal analgesia during emergence and the immediate postoperative period, often until consent can be obtained and a nerve block offered. In this discourse, we discuss if a single-shot abdominal wall block is within the scope of a typical general anesthetic or if specific consent is needed prior to performance.

### Robot-assisted surgery for noncancerous gynecologic conditions: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 810 [^9443086b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Robot-assisted approach for gynecologic surgery — evidence and comparative outcomes — indicates that low-quality or low-certainty evidence suggests little difference in complication rates between robot-assisted surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions, and that high-quality data are not available on patient outcomes, safety, or cost. Multiple randomized controlled trials compared robot-assisted surgery for noncancerous gynecologic disease with laparoscopy and none demonstrated superiority of the robot-assisted approach. The studies suggest that robot-assisted gynecologic surgery can be performed safely in centers with experienced surgeons and has perioperative outcomes equivalent to laparoscopy and improved outcomes compared with laparotomy, and a minimally invasive approach may be considered for procedures that might otherwise require laparotomy.

### Laparoscopic surgery of the spleen [^eb1bb2c7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

In recent years, laparoscopy has become standard for various indications for splenic surgery. If dissection follows anatomical principles, both total and partial splenectomies can be performed quickly and safely. Partial resection of the spleen is easier when done laparoscopically than with open technique. This means that more spleens can be preserved than would have been removed with open surgery due to fear of parenchymal bleeding. In comparison with open surgery, laparoscopy shows acceptably low morbidity and equally good therapeutic effects.

### Safety in minimally invasive surgery [^bea34e1b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Conventional and robot-assisted laparoscopic gynecologic surgery offers many advantages over a traditional laparotomy. However, these minimally invasive approaches can present their own particular risks. To ensure patient safety, procedures must be properly planned and performed by a skilled surgeon. Pre-operative patient optimization can help ensure safety and efficiency. Additional risks before starting the actual procedure arise from unique requirements for patient positioning and the need for peritoneal access. The authors discuss these risks and the importance of a thorough working knowledge of anatomy and surgical equipment (specifically conventional laparoscopic devices) to mitigate them.

### A consensus document on robotic surgery [^1fe45a46]. Surgical Endoscopy (2008). Medium credibility.

Risks and autonomy in robotic surgery — current surgical robots are continuously controlled by the surgeon and do not move autonomously; they possess neither artificial intelligence nor independent functioning, and the robot remains a high-level, sophisticated tool used by the surgeon in the conduct of an operative procedure. Risks of robotic surgery can be categorized into those pertaining directly to the use of the robotic system and the general risks of the operative procedure, and theoretically the lack of haptic feedback in current robotic systems could lead to an increased risk of inadvertent tissue injury.

### Two concomitant robot-assisted procedures in one anesthesia session: our experience [^ec4b9d8f]. Journal of Endourology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the feasibility and safety of two concomitant robot-assisted procedures in the same patient in one anesthesia setting.

Patients and Methods

Data were reviewed for 15 patients for whom two concomitant robot-assisted surgeries at our center were planned. Preoperative details, port position, intraoperative problems encountered, surgical and anesthesia time, blood loss, complications, hospital stay, and postoperative recovery were analyzed.

Results

Fifteen patients underwent two concomitant robot-assisted procedures; at least one of the two surgeries was a urologic procedure. The second procedure added < 50 mL of blood loss. Surgical time was increased by 58 minutes and 30 minutes in cases in which the primary procedure involved the upper and lower urinary tract, respectively, while anesthesia time was increased by 82 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively. There were no added complications during the second procedure, and hospital stay was not increased, being limited only by the first procedure.

Conclusion

Planned robot-assisted surgery for two different operations is feasible in one anesthesia session, thereby reducing cost and overall hospital stay for the patient without any increased risk of perioperative morbidity. The decision to continue with the second procedure depends on the successful completion of the first procedure in a reasonable time and without any complications.

Box 1 — considerations for institutions developing credentialing and privileging guidelines for robot-assisted surgery include establishing pathways for surgeons' varied experiences and training (covering current surgeons already credentialed transferring from another institution, residency- or fellowship-trained surgeons, and current surgeons new to robot-assisted surgery); determining prerequisites for eligibility (verification of training in gynecologic surgery and verification of robot-assisted training); determining general requirements (competency assessment and proctoring requirements); delineating requirements for types or levels of procedures; and determining objective requirements to support maintenance of privileges.
