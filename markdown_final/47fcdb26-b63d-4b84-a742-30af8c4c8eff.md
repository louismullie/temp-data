## Question

What is the role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis and staging of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of liver biopsy in diagnosing and staging non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including when it is indicated, how it is performed and scored, and how it fits with non-invasive testing in contemporary practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the histologic spectrum of NAFLD and why biopsy is considered the reference standard. Then, I should verify the limitations of biopsy that constrain its routine use. Next, I will review guideline-based indications for when to perform a biopsy. After that, I need to check the technical and scoring requirements that optimize diagnostic yield. Then, I will integrate non-invasive testing into a stepwise algorithm and clarify when to escalate to biopsy. Finally, I will consider special populations, including pediatrics and lean NAFLD, and close with a concise clinical take-home message anchored in current guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the histologic framework. NAFLD spans simple steatosis (≥ 5% steatosis without injury), NASH (steatosis plus lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, with or without fibrosis), and progressive fibrosis that can culminate in cirrhosis. Fibrosis stage is the strongest predictor of liver-related outcomes, which is why staging matters for prognosis and management decisions [^117StPTZ] [^114dT1sK] [^112QiZdt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — why is biopsy the "gold standard"? I should confirm that histology is uniquely capable of distinguishing NASH from simple steatosis and of staging fibrosis, tasks that no single non-invasive test reliably accomplishes; this is why regulators and guidelines still require biopsy for trial entry and endpoint adjudication, and why biopsy remains the reference for definitive diagnosis in ambiguous cases [^111M1oC3] [^115ZzScM] [^112KadmR].

> Wait, let me verify the limitations before over-calling biopsy. Biopsy is invasive with rare but serious complications, has sampling variability (about 40% for fibrosis in some series), and suffers from inter-observer variability; these constraints, coupled with the sheer prevalence of NAFLD, make routine biopsy impractical and justify a risk-stratified, non-invasive-first approach in most patients [^112vrDxd] [^113QfJZG] [^114QeykZ].

> I need to check guideline indications for when to biopsy. Authoritative guidance converges on three scenarios: diagnostic uncertainty (competing etiologies such as alcohol, autoimmune, viral, drug-induced, or overlap disease), therapeutic decision-making (e.g., consideration of pharmacotherapy or trial enrollment where histology is required), and indeterminate or discordant non-invasive fibrosis staging that alters management. Some guidance also supports biopsy for persistent unexplained liver enzyme elevations beyond six months [^116GP2Mz] [^116vCw3T] [^111M1oC3] [^114V6RrY].

> Let me consider special populations. In pediatrics, biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis is unclear, multiple diagnoses are possible, or before initiating potentially hepatotoxic medications. Histology in children may show a periportal-predominant pattern and requires pediatric expertise in interpretation, reinforcing the need for judicious, context-specific biopsy use [^114VS9kB] [^116LK6e7]. In lean NAFLD, biopsy should be considered when other causes cannot be excluded despite routine testing, given atypical phenotypes and the risk of missing alternative diagnoses [^1125QNuW].

> Next, I should review technical adequacy and scoring systems. I need to ensure adequate tissue: a 16-gauge needle and a core length of at least 1.5–2.5 cm, ideally two cores, reduce sampling error. Standardized processing and stains, and reporting using validated systems such as NAS or SAF, improve reproducibility and clinical interpretability. Pathologists should participate in external quality assurance programs to mitigate variability [^112KadmR] [^113ChBKx] [^111M1oC3].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate non-invasive testing. Contemporary pathways start with simple fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score) to triage risk. Low-risk patients can be managed in primary care with lifestyle counseling, while intermediate/high-risk patients proceed to second-line tests such as ELF or transient elastography. Biopsy is reserved for indeterminate or discordant results, suspected advanced disease, or when histology will change management, aligning with a biopsy-sparing but safety-conscious strategy [^113DtiLm] [^112xzfAq] [^116f3ws7].

> I will now examine the role of biopsy in drug development and trials. Regulatory authorities still require biopsy confirmation of NASH and fibrosis staging for inclusion and endpoint assessment in phase 2/3 trials; emerging non-invasive biomarkers are promising but, to date, none has achieved regulatory qualification to replace biopsy for diagnosing "at-risk NASH" (NASH with NAS ≥ 4 and F ≥ 2), keeping biopsy central to trial design and regulatory decision-making [^111M1oC3] [^115ZzScM].

> But wait, what if non-invasive tests are discordant or the clinical picture conflicts with results? I should double-check that guidelines advise considering biopsy in precisely these scenarios, as well as when alternative liver diseases remain in the differential; this preserves diagnostic accuracy and avoids misclassification that could delay appropriate therapy or surveillance [^116f3ws7] [^111YzawE].

> Let me reconsider the prognostic anchor. Fibrosis stage on biopsy correlates with liver-related mortality, decompensation, transplant, and HCC; thus, confirming stage — particularly F3–F4 — directly informs surveillance for varices and HCC and timing of hepatology referral, even when cirrhosis is suspected non-invasively and biopsy is deferred for safety or feasibility [^114dT1sK] [^115uMjg5].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: liver biopsy remains the reference standard for distinguishing NASH from simple steatosis and for staging fibrosis, but it should be deployed selectively — when diagnostic uncertainty persists, when histology will alter management or enable therapy/trial participation, or when non-invasive tests are indeterminate or discordant — while leveraging validated non-invasive pathways to safely and efficiently risk-stratify the vast majority of patients with NAFLD [^111M1oC3] [^113DtiLm] [^112KadmR].

Liver biopsy is the **gold standard** [^112he2ue] for diagnosing and staging NAFLD because it is the only method that reliably distinguishes simple steatosis from NASH and stages fibrosis with histologic precision [^1125CqgP]. It is indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty, suspected advanced fibrosis, or before initiating pharmacotherapy or enrolling in clinical trials [^116GP2Mz] [^111M1oC3]. However, biopsy is invasive, carries procedural risks, and is limited by sampling error and interobserver variability [^113QfJZG]; therefore, it is reserved for selected patients, with non-invasive tests used first-line for risk stratification [^113DtiLm] [^112xzfAq].

---

## Histological features assessed by liver biopsy

Liver biopsy provides a **detailed histological assessment** of NAFLD, including:

- **Steatosis**: Degree of fat accumulation (graded as mild, moderate, or severe) [^112he2ue].
- **Inflammation**: Lobular and portal inflammation, indicating active disease [^1148EVQX].
- **Ballooning degeneration**: Hepatocyte injury characteristic of NASH [^11482x6E].
- **Fibrosis**: Staging of fibrosis from F0 (no fibrosis) to F4 (cirrhosis) [^113ChBKx].

These features are essential for **differentiating simple steatosis from NASH** and for staging fibrosis, which directly correlates with prognosis and guides management decisions [^114dT1sK].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy in NAFLD

Liver biopsy is **not routinely performed** in all patients with NAFLD. Current guidelines recommend selective use based on specific clinical indications:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for biopsy** |
|-|-|
| Diagnostic uncertainty | Competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis or co-existing chronic liver diseases cannot be excluded [^116GP2Mz] [^1148EVQX] |
| Suspected advanced fibrosis | Patients at increased risk of NASH and advanced fibrosis (e.g. metabolic syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, imaging suggestive of fibrosis) [^116GP2Mz] [^116vCw3T] |
| Before pharmacotherapy | Biopsy-proven NASH is recommended before initiating pharmacologic therapy [^117Pi5QN] [^115HtRtX] |
| Clinical trials | Required for enrollment and endpoint assessment in clinical trials [^111M1oC3] [^113rrUMw] |

## Limitations and risks of liver biopsy

Despite its diagnostic accuracy, liver biopsy has several **limitations and risks**:

- **Invasiveness**: Procedure-related morbidity, including pain, bleeding, and rare mortality [^113QfJZG] [^1128earA].
- **Sampling error**: Small tissue samples may not accurately represent the entire liver, leading to misclassification [^114QeykZ].
- **Interobserver variability**: Differences in pathologist interpretation can affect diagnostic consistency [^113QfJZG].
- **Patient acceptance**: Discomfort and anxiety associated with the procedure [^114QeykZ].

---

## Non-invasive alternatives to liver biopsy

Given the limitations of liver biopsy, **significant efforts have been made** to develop non-invasive tests (NITs) for diagnosing and staging NAFLD. These include:

- **Serum biomarkers**: FIB-4, NAFLD Fibrosis Score, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test [^113DtiLm] [^112xzfAq].
- **Imaging techniques**: Transient elastography (FibroScan), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and multi-echo MRI for fat quantification [^112Kz3uB] [^116oi1Np].

These non-invasive tests have shown promising results in **identifying patients at risk of advanced fibrosis** and in monitoring disease progression [^113DtiLm] [^112xzfAq]. However, they **cannot reliably distinguish NASH from simple steatosis**, and biopsy remains the gold standard in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or when histological confirmation is required [^11482x6E] [^111M1oC3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **selective approach** to liver biopsy in NAFLD:

- **AASLD guidelines**: Biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies cannot be excluded or in those at increased risk of NASH and advanced fibrosis [^116GP2Mz] [^116vCw3T].
- **AGA guidelines**: Non-invasive tests should be used first-line for risk stratification, with biopsy reserved for indeterminate or discordant results [^112xzfAq] [^116f3ws7].
- **BASL guidelines**: Biopsy is recommended for diagnostic uncertainty, evaluation of NASH severity, and when non-invasive tests are inconclusive [^111M1oC3].

---

## Conclusion

Liver biopsy remains the **gold standard** for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, particularly for differentiating NASH from simple steatosis and accurately staging fibrosis [^116ZvMnm]. However, its invasive nature, sampling error, and interobserver variability limit its routine use. Non-invasive tests are increasingly used for initial risk stratification and monitoring, but biopsy is still required in selected cases where histological confirmation is essential for clinical decision-making [^113DtiLm].

The role of liver biopsy in NASH has evolved along with the increased recognition of the significance of this disease, and the unmet medical need it presents. Drug development and clinical trials are rapidly growing, as are noninvasive tests for markers of steatosis, inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Liver biopsy evaluation remains necessary for both drug development and clinical trials as the most specific means of diagnosis and patient identification for appropriate intervention. This White Paper, sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease NASH Task Force, is a focused review of liver biopsy evaluation in fatty liver disease in subjects with presumed NAFLD for practicing clinical hepatologists and pathologists. The goal is to provide succinct and specific means for reporting the histopathologic elements of NASH, distinguishing NASH from nonalcoholic fatty liver without steatohepatitis, and from alcohol-associated steatohepatitis when possible. The discussion includes the special situations of NASH in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and in the pediatric population. Finally, there is discussion of semiquantitative methods of evaluation of lesions of "disease activity" and fibrosis. Tables are presented for scoring and a suggested model for final reporting. Figures are presented to highlight the histopathologic elements of NASH.

### Role of liver biopsy in the assessment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^116ZvMnm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Assessments of liver biopsies are important in the diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Histology remains the 'gold standard' for making the important distinction between simple steatosis, which is generally non-progressive and readily reversible, and steatohepatitis, which has the potential to progress to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Liver biopsy may also identify other causes of liver disease in patients thought to have fatty liver disease and vice versa. Histological grading and staging of fatty liver disease require further study but these are potentially important approaches for studying disease severity and progression, particularly in the context of clinical trials to assess novel therapeutic approaches.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112he2ue]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Still, the gold standard for diagnosing, grading and staging NAFLD is liver biopsy, either percutaneous (i.e. mostly in patients without advanced chronic liver disease) or via the transjugular route (i.e. in patients with advanced chronic liver disease, severe thrombocytopenia or severe coagulopathy). Both procedures are safe with very low risk of complications. A diagnosis of NASH is currently not possible without liver histology, however, liver biopsy is usually only performed in patients with a high pre‐test probability for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, as indicated by non‐invasive fibrosis tests (i.e. VCTE, non‐invasive fibrosis scores). Therefore in daily clinical practice, outside clinical trials, only rather indeterminate/unclear cases regarding fibrosis stage or etiology require liver biopsy while when cirrhosis/ACLD is evident clinicians should directly proceed to HCC screening and management of portal hypertension. However, even in cirrhotic/ACLD patients, other causes of liver disease should be carefully ruled out before the definitive diagnosis of NAFLD‐associated ACLD can be made.

Nevertheless, once biopsy specimens are obtained, pathologists should report the grades of hepatic steatosis [reported as a percentage of lipid‐containing hepatocytes mild (Grade 1: 5–33%), moderate (Grade 2: 34–66%), severe steatosis (Grade 3: > 66%)], hepatocyte ballooning [absent (0), rare (1), or prominent(2)] and necro‐inflammatory activity [absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3)]. Finally, the NAFLD activity score (NAS) should be reported as the sum of the three characteristics (steatosis, ballooning, inflammation) and ranges between 0 and 8 points; however, NAFLD per se is defined by the presence of steatosis so usually, a minimum of 1 point (for steatosis) should be reported to establish a NAFLD diagnosis. Most importantly, however, it needs to be emphasized that a diagnosis of NASH should not be made based on NAS alone and rather based on evaluation of patterns as well as individual lesions (overall "gestalt") on liver biopsies Typical histological features of NAFLD/NASH can be seen in Fig. 1.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113CUgzj]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disorder characterized by excess accumulation of fat in hepatocytes (nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)); in up to 40% of individuals, there are additional findings of portal and lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injury (which characterize nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)). A subset of patients will develop progressive fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiovascular complications are life-threatening co-morbidities of both NAFL and NASH. NAFLD is closely associated with insulin resistance; obesity and metabolic syndrome are common underlying factors. As a consequence, the prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be 10–40% in adults worldwide, and it is the most common liver disease in children and adolescents in developed countries. Mechanistic insights into fat accumulation, subsequent hepatocyte injury, the role of the immune system and fibrosis as well as the role of the gut microbiota are unfolding. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic factors might explain the considerable interindividual variation in disease phenotype, severity and progression. To date, no effective medical interventions exist that completely reverse the disease other than lifestyle changes, dietary alterations and, possibly, bariatric surgery. However, several strategies that target pathophysiological processes such as an oversupply of fatty acids to the liver, cell injury and inflammation are currently under investigation. Diagnosis of NAFLD can be established by imaging, but detection of the lesions of NASH still depend on the gold-standard but invasive liver biopsy. Several non-invasive strategies are being evaluated to replace or complement biopsies, especially for follow-up monitoring.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver disease in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114QeykZ]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to afflict approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. In a subset of NAFLD patients, who have the progressive form of NAFLD termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), it can progress to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related morbidity and mortality. NASH is typically characterized by a specific pattern on liver histology, including steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning with or without peri-sinusoidal fibrosis. Thus, key issues in NAFLD patients are the differentiation of NASH from simple steatosis and identification of advanced hepatic fibrosis. Until now, liver biopsy has been the gold standard for identifying these 2 critical end points, but has well-known limitations, including invasiveness; rare but potentially life-threatening complications; poor acceptability; sampling variability; and cost. Furthermore, due to the epidemic proportion of individuals with NAFLD worldwide, liver biopsy evaluation is impractical, and noninvasive assessment for the diagnosis of NASH and fibrosis is needed. Although much of the work remains to be done in establishing cost-effective strategies for screening for NASH, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis, in this review, we summarize the current state of the noninvasive assessment of liver disease in NAFLD, and we provide an expert synthesis of how these noninvasive tools could be utilized in clinical practice. Finally, we also list the key areas of research priorities in this area to move forward clinical practice.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^112JDg5T]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Obesity and metabolic syndrome are healthcare problems that continue to rise in frequency worldwide. Both phenotypes are a strong predictor for development of liver steatosis in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Ultrasound may detect steatosis, but its sensitivity is limited and liver biopsy is still considered to be the gold standard. Less invasive techniques that accurately quantify liver steatosis are warranted. Jiménez-Agüero and colleagues propose that multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging might be such a diagnostic tool. They validated multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging with measured hepatic triglyceride concentration. Their results show that this innovative technique measures the grade of steatosis in different clinical situations. Therefore, multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging might be considered for monitoring liver steatosis as an intermediate endpoint. Wide clinical applicability is limited though, as it does not allow differentiation between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Liver biopsy [^112QiZdt]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy — prognostic value of fibrosis staging across liver diseases is emphasized, including that in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation mortality was increased with advanced versus minimal fibrosis, that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progression and liver-related mortality relate to initial fibrosis stage, and in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) a long-term cohort study of 160 patients found that for every stage increase of fibrosis identified (on a 1–4 point fibrosis scale) there was a twofold increase in future complications or death (relative risk 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6–3.6). Additional prognostic points include that in genetic hemochromatosis survival without cirrhosis is similar to controls while advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis increases mortality and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) risk warranting screening, that patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV can have significant fibrosis despite persistently normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and that fibrosis regression may protect from clinical complications; overall, accurate histologic assessment of liver fibrosis provides important prognostic information.

### Medical liver biopsy: background, indications, procedure and histopathology [^112MsYXr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Indications for performing a liver biopsy

The advent of non-invasive tools such as serum biomarkers and elastography has given clinicians additional tools for estimating the severity of fibrosis. While this has resulted in reduced overall need for liver biopsy, histological analysis of the hepatic parenchyma remains an important investigation.

Broadly, the indications for medical liver biopsy fall into two groups. First, establishing a diagnosis, which includes ruling out other diagnoses or determining the predominant pathology if more than one cause of liver injury is present. Second, liver biopsy allows assessment of disease severity including staging and grading. Staging pertains to the severity of fibrosis: although non-invasive tests increasingly have a role to play, biopsy is generally considered the 'gold-standard' test provided a satisfactory sample is obtained. Grading involves determining the severity of the underlying disease process.

Biopsies are occasionally carried out in acute liver failure. Biopsy in this setting would be determined on a case-by-case basis; recent guidance suggests that it can be considered to rule out infiltrative malignancy, alcohol-related pathology and cirrhosis.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the population in many developed countries. The disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcohol-related steatohepatitis (NASH; fat with hepatocyte injury and hepatic inflammation) and can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Individuals with NAFLD have an increased risk of overall mortality compared with the general population, and common causes of death include cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver-related complications –. The majority of the estimated 14.1 million individuals with NAFLD in the UK remain undiagnosed and worryingly the prevalence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis is projected to double to 1 million individuals by 2030. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD in the population, recognition and management of the condition is variable across the UK. One multicentre study from England found a large variability in the primary and secondary care management of NAFLD, with clear deficiencies identified in primary care investigations, fibrosis staging, provision of lifestyle treatments, and assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors. There is therefore a clear need to improve the holistic management of patients with NAFLD in order to achieve better outcomes.

When to obtain a liver biopsy in NAFLD — Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for characterizing liver histology in NAFLD but is expensive and carries some morbidity and very rare mortality risk; it should be performed in those who would benefit the most from diagnostic, therapeutic guidance, and prognostic perspectives. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk to have steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis (Strength – 1, Evidence – B). The presence of metabolic syndrome and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score may be used for identifying patients who are at risk for steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis (Strength – 1, Evidence – B). Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis and co-existing chronic liver diseases cannot be excluded without a liver biopsy (Strength – 1, Evidence – B).

### Diagnostic value of biochemical markers (nashTest) for the prediction of non alcoholo steato hepatitis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1123ePKZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of conditions characterized histologically by an excessive accumulation of hepatic fat in the absence of alcohol consumption. Two main histological patterns of NAFLD have been described: bland steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is an increasingly recognized cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Although the majority of patients do not develop complications, 28% may develop serious liver sequelae, including end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Those at highest risk include patients with significant hepatic necro-inflammation and fibrosis. Liver biopsy, therefore, has been recommended for confirming its diagnosis and for providing prognostic information.

There are several drawbacks in using liver biopsy for this purpose. It is an invasive and costly procedure, and is prone to complications, some minor, such as pain, others more severe with a recorded risk of death of 0.01%. Notably, as in other chronic liver diseases, there is high sampling variability; and high intra- and inter-pathologist variability. Most importantly, the number of patients at risk for NAFLD is high enough that liver biopsy is not a practical and efficient tool for identifying those at risk of NASH and advanced fibrosis. Indeed an estimated 15 to 20% of the Western European population has steatosis, while more than half of Americans are overweight or obese.

### Noninvasive biomarkers in NAFLD and NASH-current progress and future promise [^1138bWzH]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the global adult population and is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the active form of NAFLD, with hepatic necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression. With an increasing number of patients developing NASH-related end-stage liver disease and pharmacological treatments on the horizon, there is a pressing need to develop NAFLD and NASH biomarkers for prognostication, selection of patients for treatment and monitoring. This requirement is particularly true as liver biopsy utility is limited by its invasive nature, poor patient acceptability and sampling variability. This article reviews current and potential biomarkers for different features of NAFLD, namely, steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. For each biomarker, we evaluate its accuracy, reproducibility, responsiveness, feasibility and limitations. We cover biochemical, imaging and genetic biomarkers and discuss biomarker discovery in the omics era.

The histology of NASH

Key points

Liver biopsy remains the reference standard for diagnosis of NASH (steatosis vs steatohepatitis).
Diagnosis and scoring are distinct and separate steps in the evaluation of NAFLD.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, from steatosis to cirrhosis, via NASH. The presence of 5% fat cells in the liver is a prerequisite for diagnosis, based on microscopic examination of liver tissue. Current European guidelinesstate that distinguishing NASH from simple steatosis requires biopsy (see figure 1), and the diagnosis cannot be made by clinical, biochemical or imaging measures.

Figure 1
Histology of NASH illustrating steatosis, lobular inflammation, portal fibrosis and centrolobular fibrosis. NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Liver biopsy can also be used to assess severity (grade) and stage (fibrosis) of disease. This enables enrolment in clinical trials, evaluation of treatment response and may point to comorbidity risk factors. Among the usual limits of liver biopsy, especially its invasiveness, sampling variability is a challenging issue as it represents a tiny fraction (1/50 000) of the whole liver. This strongly supports the use of criteria of biopsy adequacy including length and width of liver specimen. Nevertheless, given the zonation of the disease (starting in centrolobular areas), we may expect less impact of sampling compared with viral hepatitis, for instance.

Scoring systems to identify NASH

Pathologists use two main types of scoring system to assess liver biopsy for NASH:

The NAS (NAFLD Activity Score), which sums together scores for degree of steatosis, ballooning of liver cells and lobular inflammation, giving a score of 0–8. The NAS is not diagnostic, and was designed to measure histological changes during clinical trials. Fibrosis may also be added, with a score of 0–4.
The Steatosis, Activity and Fibrosis (SAF) score, which separately assesses steatosis from activity based on ballooning, and lobular inflammation, enabling an algorithm to sort results into NAFLD or NASH.

The two systems are not interchangeable. An evaluation of 1000 biopsies found excellent concordance between the two in identification of definite NASH, while 84% of the biopsies identified by NAS as 'borderline' (NAS 3–4) were identified as NASH by the SAF.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Lean NAFLD liver biopsy guidance states that liver biopsy is considered the reference standard for identifying NASH and staging hepatic fibrosis and "should be considered if there is uncertainty regarding contributing causes of liver injury and/or the stage of liver fibrosis"; liver biopsy should be considered in lean patients with NAFLD if other causes cannot be excluded through routine testing, and as a standard practice "a tissue sample of ≥ 2 cm in length is preferred to allow an accurate reading", with the Brunt criteria and Kleiner score that "can be used to assess those patients who have NASH to provide categorical assessment of disease activity and fibrosis".

Further risk stratification in the gastroenterology and hepatology practice settings — advanced tools and biopsy use are described: The primary goal in the specialty care setting is the identification of patients with "at-risk" NASH or advanced fibrosis who may benefit from targeted interventions; MR-based tools such as MRE or MRI corrected T1 (cT1) can be used to further risk stratify when other noninvasive tests are indeterminate or not reflective of clinical suspicion, and liver biopsy should be considered when there is diagnostic uncertainty or when there is persistent elevation (> 6 mo) in liver chemistries.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117StPTZ]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) definitions — NAFLD requires evidence of hepatic steatosis by imaging or histology and absence of secondary causes such as significant alcohol consumption, long-term use of a steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders; histologically, NAFLD is categorized as nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning. NASH is defined as the presence of ≥ 5% HS and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (e.g., ballooning), with or without any fibrosis. For "advanced" fibrosis, this guidance refers specifically to stages 3 or 4, that is, bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease, extending from simple steatosis to inflammation and fibrosis with a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis. It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through liver-specific morbidity and mortality but, perhaps more important, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is closely associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and both of these conditions drive progressive disease toward the more advanced stages. The mechanisms that govern hepatic lipid accumulation and the predisposition to inflammation and fibrosis are still not fully understood but reflect a complex interplay between metabolic target tissues including adipose and skeletal muscle, and immune and inflammatory cells. The ability to make an accurate assessment of disease stage (that relates to clinical outcome) can also be challenging. While liver biopsy is still regarded as the gold-standard investigative tool, there is an extensive literature on the search for novel noninvasive biomarkers and imaging modalities that aim to accurately reflect the stage of underlying disease. Finally, although no therapies are currently licensed for the treatment of NAFLD, there are interventions that appear to have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials as well as an extensive emerging therapeutic landscape of new agents that target many of the fundamental pathophysiological processes that drive NAFLD. It is highly likely that over the next few years, new treatments with a specific license for the treatment of NAFLD will become available.

### Diagnostic performance of circulating biomarkers for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^115ZzScM]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an active form of NAFLD, and liver fibrosis stage 2 or higher is linked to an increased incidence of liver-related adverse clinical outcomes and death and is also referred to as 'at-risk' NASH –. Identification of individuals with at-risk NASH for therapy is a cornerstone for clinical care and inclusion in therapeutic trials.

Histological evaluation of liver biopsy sections is the reference standard for diagnosis of NASH as well as quantification of disease activity and fibrosis stage, but it requires an invasive liver biopsy with its associated risks and limitations, hindering its widespread use –. This has spurred much work to establish non-invasive tests (NITs) to diagnose NASH and fibrosis, yet none has met the evidentiary requirements needed for regulatory qualification. The lack of regulatory approval limits availability of these tests for widespread clinical use. It also hinders patient recruitment into clinical trials and their further development for treatment response monitoring. From a public health point of view, the lack of approved biomarker panels for diagnostic purposes is, thus, a major barrier to access to care and drug development. Although progress has been made in retrospective comparative assessment of NITs, evidence gaps remain for full qualification. Development of such NITs to regulatory standards remains a major unmet need for the field.

Fatty liver disease

Fatty liver is defined by an abnormal deposition of fat (or steatosis) within more than 5% of hepatocytes — this is best appreciated in figure 2. The two most common causes of fatty liver are excessive alcohol consumption and in association with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD). Other causes include drugs, coeliac disease, parenteral nutrition, starvation and HIV. Steatosis alone does not necessarily have any significant sequelae; however, inflammation (steatohepatitis) may result which can lead to fibrosis.

Biopsies are undertaken in both alcohol-related and non–alcohol-related aetiologies of fatty liver disease, although importantly it is usually not possible to tell the two aetiologies apart histologically. In alcohol-related liver disease, biopsy may be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or to accurately stage the disease. Liver biopsy used to be recommended in the context of severe alcoholic hepatitis to both confirm the presence of steatohepatitis and rule out other causes of liver injury; however, recent international guidelines and general opinion may be shifting away from this approach.

Future directions for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) highlight that the number of trials in NASH has increased exponentially over the last 10 years, and several therapeutic agents for NASH are in late-stage development, with safety and histological efficacy profiles that may be soon approvable by the FDA. Further validation of biomarkers that predict liver-related outcomes, identify patients who may benefit from treatment, and predict response to therapeutic intervention is underway, and the anticipated acceptance of biomarkers as surrogates of future liver-related events and treatment response will greatly accelerate drug development for single or combination approaches. Adoption of AI-based technologies will allow more accurate quantification of fibrosis and highlight early signs of treatment response, and AI may help diminish variability in histological assessment currently plaguing early-stage trials. Finally, rapidly growing knowledge in genetic disease relationships (eg, PNPLA3 and others) and the identification of distinct disease phenotypes using descriptive techniques will enable more individualized approaches to the future management of patients with NAFLD, and these advances will likely lead to rapid changes in the current recommendations (Table 7) for diagnosis and management of patients with NAFLD.

### Role of imaging-based biomarkers in NAFLD: recent advances in clinical application and future research directions [^115Jt9Gs]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major public health problem afflicting approximately one billion individuals worldwide. Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for assessment of liver disease severity in patients with NAFLD. However, it is invasive, has high inter-observer variability, and is associated with adverse effects, including pain, infection and, albeit rarely, death. It is also impractical because of the large number of individuals who have NAFLD. Therefore, tools to non-invasively assess disease severity in NAFLD are urgently needed. Over the last two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the assessment of NAFLD by non-invasive imaging. In this review, we will discuss the different non-invasive imaging modalities available to quantify liver fat and liver fibrosis. We will also discuss the limitations of current modalities to detect the progressive form for NAFLD, termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Finally, we will discuss the comparative efficacy of various imaging-based elastographic modalities for detection of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, as well as their diagnostic characteristics.

### How would you manage this patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115HtRtX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common diagnosis in the United States and other developed countries, has been increasing in prevalence. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to 5% generally reduces NASH, but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis. Pharmacologic therapies (such as pioglitazone and vitamin E) should be considered only in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol, although insufficient data exist to provide advice about other levels of alcohol use. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in this area debate whether to screen for NAFLD in primary care, how to monitor patients with NAFLD, and what interventions should be used to manage this condition.

### Paediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an approach to pathological evaluation [^116LK6e7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an increasingly important healthcare issue along with the rising rates of obesity worldwide. It is the most common chronic liver disease in the paediatric population and the fastest growing indication for liver transplant in young adults. The pathogenesis is complex with contributions from multiple factors and genetic predisposition. While non-invasive laboratory tests and imaging modalities are being increasingly used, the liver biopsy continues to play a crucial role in the diagnosis and prognosis of NAFLD. Histologically, the assessment of paediatric fatty liver disease requires special considerations with respect to a periportal predominant pattern seen in prepubertal patients, as well as a different set of disease processes in the differential diagnosis. In this review, we provide a summary of current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical course of paediatric NAFLD as well as the clinical guidelines on diagnosis and management. We discuss the indications and limitations of liver biopsy, histological patterns seen in paediatric NAFLD, other entities to be considered in the differential diagnosis, and conclude with appropriate triaging of liver biopsies and essential elements of pathology reporting.

Liver biopsy for NAFLD

Although frequently not required for diagnosis, a liver biopsy is the definitive investigation for NAFLD and provides an assessment of hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. The presence of hepatocyte ballooning degeneration in association with steatosis is the key histological feature that distinguishes NASH from simple steatosis. The 'NAFLD activity score' (NAS) is the most widely used histological grading and staging system for NAFLD (table 3). The SAF score (encompassing an assessment of steatosis (S), activity (A) and fibrosis (F)) has been introduced more recently, which may be more accurate in identifying NASH. However, the majority of patients with NAFLD can be diagnosed and staged adequately using non-invasive strategies. Liver biopsy should be used for subjects where there is diagnostic uncertainly or if non-invasive staging is indeterminate.

Differentiating steatosis from steatohepatitis without liver biopsy

Knowledge of whether a patient has simple steatosis or NASH is very important prognostically. Subjects with simple steatosis have a good long-term prognosis with low rates of liver-related morbidity and mortality, and therefore do not require specific liver-related treatment. However, patients with NASH can progress to cirrhosis and therefore should be more actively managed to try and prevent disease progression. Unfortunately there is no widely available simple blood test or imaging modality that can differentiate simple steatosis from NASH. Clinically, the risk of steatohepatitis increases with the number of metabolic risk factors. Seventy per cent of centrally obese patients with hypertension and diabetes have steatohepatitis on liver biopsy. Therefore, until effective blood tests are available, metabolic risk factor profiling could be used to identify patients for further investigations. The search for an accurate biomarker of NASH is an active area of clinical research, and there have been some recent advances (see ref. 38 for a comprehensive review).

### The role of noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112MQWNc]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronically elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD remains clinically challenge as patients with NAFLD are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific presenting complaints and may have normal liver enzymes. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the clinically aggressive variant of NAFLD, is also difficult to differentiate noninvasively, and a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH. Thus, the definitive diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD is embedded in histological assessment of the liver. Several clinical aides been investigated in an attempt to risk stratify and identify patients noninvasively as doing a liver biopsy in all patients with NAFLD are not feasible. Since these biomarkers are unable to differentiate NASH from non‐NASH, they have leveraged biochemical changes within the liver as patients progress to varying degree of hepatic fibrosis to identify patients with moderate fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or greater) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or greater) to help guide the need for additional and more definitive workup. These clinical aides span from by‐products of apoptosis to statistical modelling of clinically available data to identify 'at‐risk' patients with NAFLD. The current review will focus the diagnostic performance of these noninvasive serum‐based biomarkers in NAFLD.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment

Patients with NAFLD should undergo sequential use of a simple non-invasive test (e.g. FIB-4) and specialist non-invasive tests (e.g. ELF, transient elastography, or ARFI) to assess the severity of fibrosis. (Recommendation 13, Table 1). Ideally, an initial fibrosis assessment should have been undertaken in primary care and patients with suspected advanced fibrosis referred into secondary care as they have the greatest risk of hepatic morbidity. In secondary care, fibrosis stage should be confirmed, or second line testing conducted with more specialist tests in individuals where simple non-invasive tests are indeterminate. The performance of biomarkers may be influenced by the prevalence of the target condition in the population being assessed so clinicians should consider the likely disease prevalence in their practice setting and adopt suitable test thresholds to achieve the desired performance. In general, use of simple non-invasive tests excludes the majority of cases with mild fibrosis. Addition of a second line test (e.g. ELF, transient elastography or ARFI), further reduces the number of cases with an indeterminate score, allowing liver biopsy to be reserved for use in a minority of patients where it adds additional useful information. Such two-stage care pathways are currently considered to provide the most robust means for the risk-stratification of patients with NAFLD. Ongoing regular non-invasive fibrosis reassessment should be considered every 1–3 years to monitor response to treatment or for fibrosis progression.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: non-invasive investigation and risk stratification [^114gvEPF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a histological spectrum of liver disease, from simple steatosis through to cirrhosis. As the worldwide rates of obesity have increased, NAFLD has become the commonest cause of liver disease in many developed countries, affecting up to a third of the population. The majority of patients have simple steatosis that carries a relatively benign prognosis. However, a significant minority have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and have increased liver related and cardiovascular mortality. Identifying those at risk of progressive disease is crucial. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation for assessing stage of disease but its invasive nature makes it impractical for widespread use as a prognostic tool. Non-invasive tools for diagnosis and disease staging are required, reserving liver biopsy for those patients where it offers clinically relevant additional information. This review discusses the non-invasive modalities available for assessing steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. We propose a pragmatic approach for the assessment of patients with NAFLD to identify those at high risk of progressive disease who require referral to specialist services.

### Association between fibrosis stage and outcomes of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114dT1sK]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Biopsy-confirmed liver fibrosis is a prognostic factor for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We performed a systematic review to quantify the prognostic value of fibrosis stage in patients with NAFLD and the subgroup of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to assess the evidence that change in fibrosis stage is a surrogate endpoint.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and trial registry databases through August 2018 for prospective or retrospective cohort studies of liver-related clinical events and outcomes in adults with NAFLD or NASH. We collected data on mortality (all cause and liver related) and morbidity (cirrhosis, liver cancer, and all liver-related events) by stage of fibrosis, determined by biopsy, for patients with NAFLD or NASH. Using fibrosis stage 0 as a reference population, we calculated fibrosis stage-specific relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values for mortality and morbidities. We performed fixed-effect and random-effect model meta-analyses. Metaregression was used to examine associations among study design (prospective vs retrospective cohort), overall risk of bias (medium or high), and mean duration of follow-up (in years).

Results

Our meta-analysis included 13 studies, comprising 4428 patients with NAFLD; 2875 of these were reported to have NASH. Compared with no fibrosis (stage 0), unadjusted risk increased with increasing stage of fibrosis (stage 0 vs 4): all-cause mortality RR, 3.42 (95% CI, 2.63–4.46); liver-related mortality RR, 11.13 (95% CI, 4.15–29.84); liver transplant RR, 5.42 (95% CI, 1.05–27.89); and liver-related events RR, 12.78 (95% CI, 6.85–23.85). The magnitude of RR did not differ significantly after adjustment for confounders, including age or sex in the subgroup of NAFLD patients with NASH. Three studies examined the effects of increasing fibrosis on quality of life had inconsistent findings.

Conclusions

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found biopsy-confirmed fibrosis to be associated with risk of mortality and liver-related morbidity in patients with NAFLD, with and without adjustment for confounding factors and in patients with reported NASH. Further studies are needed to assess the association between fibrosis stage and patient quality of life and establish that change in liver fibrosis stage is a valid endpoint for use in clinical trials.

### Noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: present and future [^111TukCw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of conditions ranging from simple fatty liver which in general follows a benign nonprogressive clinical course, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more serious form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. At present, a liver biopsy remains the only reliable way to diagnose NASH and establish the presence of fibrosis. Current noninvasive clinically available tests lack accuracy and reliability. In light of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in conjunction with the significant research effort in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, noninvasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable biomarkers are greatly needed. They will not only help in the diagnosis of NASH, but also be useful for assessment of treatment response and prognosis and remain a research priority in the NAFLD field.

### AGA clinical practice update on the role of noninvasive biomarkers in the evaluation and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^112xzfAq]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the use of noninvasive tests (NITs) in the evaluation and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD affects nearly 30% of the global population and is a growing cause of end-stage liver disease and liver-related health care resource utilization. However, only a minority of all patients with NAFLD experience a liver-related outcome. It is therefore critically important for clinicians to assess prognosis and identify those with increased risk of disease progression and negative clinical outcomes at the time of initial assessment. It is equally important to assess disease trajectory over time, particularly in response to currently available therapeutic approaches. The reference standard for assessment of prognosis and disease monitoring is histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens. There are, however, many limitations of liver biopsies and their reading that have limited their use in routine practice. The utilization of NITs facilitates risk stratification of patients and longitudinal assessment of disease progression for patients with NAFLD. This clinical update provides best practice advice based on a review of the literature on the utilization of NITs in the management of NAFLD for clinicians. Accordingly, a combination of available evidence and consensus-based expert opinion, without formal rating of the strength and quality of the evidence, was used to develop these best practice advice statements.

Methods

This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These best practice advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these best practice advice statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: NITs can be used for risk stratification in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: A Fibrosis 4 Index score < 1.3 is associated with strong negative predictive value for advanced hepatic fibrosis and may be useful for exclusion of advanced hepatic fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: A combination of 2 or more NITs combining serum biomarkers and/or imaging-based biomarkers is preferred for staging and risk stratification of patients with NAFLD whose Fibrosis 4 Index score is > 1.3. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Use of NITs in accordance with manufacturer's specifications (eg, not in patients with ascites or pacemakers) can minimize risk of discordant results and adverse events. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: NITs should be interpreted with context and consideration of pertinent clinical data (eg, physical examination, biochemical, radiographic, and endoscopic) to optimize positive predictive value in the identification of patients with advanced fibrosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Liver biopsy should be considered for patients with NIT results that are indeterminate or discordant; conflict with other clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings; or when alternative etiologies for liver disease are suspected. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Serial longitudinal monitoring using NITs for assessment of disease progression or regression may inform clinical management (ie, response to lifestyle modification or therapeutic intervention). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with NAFLD and NITs results suggestive of advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) should be considered for surveillance of liver complications (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma screening and variceal screening per Baveno criteria). Patients with NAFLD and NITs suggestive of advanced hepatic fibrosis (F3) or (F4), should be monitored with serial liver stiffness measurement; vibration controlled transient elastography; or magnetic resonance elastography, given its correlation with clinically significant portal hypertension and clinical decompensation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prevalent forms of chronic liver disease with a global prevalence of approximately 25% among adults. 1 NAFLD is the broad umbrella term that encompasses the spectrum of FLD. Histologically, NAFLD is categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 2, 3, 4 To meet diagnostic criteria for NAFL, individuals must have ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis without evidence of hepatocellular injury. Alternatively, NASH is defined by the presence ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis with lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injury (ballooning) with or without hepatic fibrosis. 2 It is estimated that approximately 20% of individuals with NAFLD have NASH. 1, 2, 5 Clinical practice guidelines from both the American and European liver societies currently recommend liver biopsy as the gold standard for diagnosing and staging NASH. 2, 6 Enrolment in NASH clinical trials and definition of therapeutic response to novel pharmacologic agents for NASH are also largely defined using histologic criteria. 7 Inclusion criteria for clinical trials generally include fibrosis stage of ≥ F2 on biopsy. Primary outcomes assessing response to novel treatment agents are typically defined using changes in the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) paired with stability or improvement in fibrosis. 7, 8 There are several notable limitations in liver biopsy including concerns over sampling error and interrater reliability. 9 In addition, both patients and clinicians are often hesitant to pursue biopsy due to its invasive nature with potential for clinical complications including severe bleeding and rarely death. 10 As a result, liver biopsy is infrequently obtained in clinical practice for diagnosis and staging of NASH. In real‐world clinical practice, providers often use a combination of noninvasive serum tests, imaging results and endoscopic findings to arrive at a personalized diagnosis and risk stratification for an individual patient.

### Biomarkers for staging fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (the LITMUS project): a comparative diagnostic accuracy study [^1139LvVV]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The reference standard for detecting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and staging fibrosis-liver biopsy-is invasive and resource intensive. Non-invasive biomarkers are urgently needed, but few studies have compared these biomarkers in a single cohort. As part of the Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis (LITMUS) project, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 17 biomarkers and multimarker scores in detecting NASH and clinically significant fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and identify their optimal cutoffs as screening tests in clinical trial recruitment.

Methods

This was a comparative diagnostic accuracy study in people with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD from 13 countries across Europe, recruited between Jan 6, 2010, and Dec 29, 2017, from the LITMUS metacohort of the prospective European NAFLD Registry. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with paired liver biopsy and serum samples were eligible; those with excessive alcohol consumption or evidence of other chronic liver diseases were excluded. The diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers was expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with liver histology as the reference standard and compared with the Fibrosis-4 index for liver fibrosis (FIB-4) in the same subgroup. Target conditions were the presence of NASH with clinically significant fibrosis (ie, at-risk NASH; NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 4 and F ≥ 2) or the presence of advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3), analysed in all participants with complete data. We identified thres holds for each biomarker for reducing the number of biopsy-based screen failures when recruiting people with both NASH and clinically significant fibrosis for future trials.

Findings

Of 1430 participants with NAFLD in the LITMUS metacohort with serum samples, 966 (403 women and 563 men) were included after all exclusion criteria had been applied. 335 (35%) of 966 participants had biopsy-confirmed NASH and clinically significant fibrosis and 271 (28%) had advanced fibrosis. For people with NASH and clinically significant fibrosis, no single biomarker or multimarker score significantly reached the predefined AUC 0.80 acceptability threshold (AUCs ranging from 0.61 [95% CI 0.54–0.67] for FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter to 0.81 [0.75–0.86] for SomaSignal), with accuracy mostly similar to FIB-4. Regarding detection of advanced fibrosis, SomaSignal (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.86–0.94]), ADAPT (0.85 [0.81–0.89]), and FibroScan liver stiffness measurement (0.83 [0.80–0.86]) reached acceptable accuracy. With 11 of 17 markers, histological screen failure rates could be reduced to 33% in trials if only people who were marker positive had a biopsy for evaluating eligibility. The best screening performance for NASH and clinically significant fibrosis was observed for SomaSignal (number needed to test [NNT] to find one true positive was four [95% CI 4–5]), then ADAPT (six [5–7]), MACK-3 (seven [6–8]), and PRO-C3 (nine [7–11]).

Interpretation

None of the single markers or multimarker scores achieved the predefined acceptable AUC for replacing biopsy in detecting people with both NASH and clinically significant fibrosis. However, several biomarkers could be applied in a prescreening strategy in clinical trial recruitment. The performance of promising markers will be further evaluated in the ongoing prospective LITMUS study cohort.

AASLD NAFLD practice guidance — the role and interpretation of liver biopsy notes that biopsies obtained with a 16-G needle should be at least 1.5 cm in length but preferably 2–2.5 cm in length, with good-quality sectioning and staining also important. It states that fibrosis stage is the best predictor of long-term outcome in multivariable analyses and that composite histological scores such as the NAFLD activity score (NAS) and the steatosis, activity, fibrosis score (SAF) combine features and are used in clinical studies. Biopsy remains the best method for providing information on architectural distortion and the complex anatomic interrelationships of cellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis.

Goals

We aimed to examine the correlation of pre-biopsy clinical diagnosis with hepatic histopathology.

Background

Liver biopsy provides histologic information and informs physicians about the underlying clinical disease. We hypothesized that expert physicians' pre-biopsy clinical diagnoses may obviate the need for histopathological diagnosis.

Study Methods

Patients undergoing liver biopsy to investigate a liver diagnosis were prospectively identified. In the 80 patients included, an anonymous validated questionnaire inquiring about the most likely clinical diagnosis and liver disease stage was completed prospectively by hepatologists before biopsy performance.

Results

The most common pre-biopsy diagnoses were alcoholic liver disease (19 diagnoses), followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis (18 each). Overall, the predicted histologic diagnosis was the same as the histologic diagnosis in 51/80 patients (64%), and thus a new liver disease diagnosis was made in 36% of patients. The diagnosis with the greatest pre-biopsy and post-biopsy diagnosis discrepancy was autoimmune hepatitis, with the correct diagnosis being predicted in 6/18 (33%) of patients (other diagnoses included the following: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (4), alcoholic liver disease (3), drug-induced liver injury (3), others (2)). For fibrosis staging, when grouped as no fibrosis (F0), fibrosis (F1-F3), or cirrhosis (F4), the fibrosis stage was correctly predicted in 68% of patients (54/80). Notably, 7 patients (9%) who were initially thought to have no or early-stage fibrosis had F4 fibrosis, and 6/80 (8%) patients who were considered to have a liver disease diagnosis before their biopsy had normal histology.

Conclusions

Although hepatology experts often predict the correct underlying liver disease diagnosis, histopathological diagnoses different from expected are common.

### Non-invasive markers associated with liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1161TR1P]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of fibrosis within liver disease is important for prognosis, stratification for treatment, and monitoring of treatment efficacy. The rising incidence and prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has driven the search for accurate non-invasive tools of liver fibrosis within this condition. With the aid of a systematic review, we explore how the field has evolved from the discovery of simple blood parameters to panel markers of liver fibrosis. We will discuss the biological plausibility, limitations, potential uses, and emerging diagnostic techniques of non-invasive markers in this rapidly expanding field.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver biopsy

Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the general population, fatty liver frequently co-exists with other liver diseases (especially viral hepatitis, autoimmune and haemochromatosis), thereby necessitating a biopsy to understand their relative contributions to the patient's condition. Furthermore, the diseases may be synergistic e.g. iron overload and NAFLD.

Liver biopsy remains the standard for diagnosing NASH and assessing disease activity (inflammation; ballooning) as there are no approved non-invasive radiological or serological markers specific for NASH. International drug authorities (FDA and EMA) therefore continue to recommend that phase 2/3 clinical trials utilise liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and assess the grade and stage of the disease, to determine trial entry, as well as act as a primary trial endpoint. There has been a recent debate about the role and reliability of histology in this setting.

In the event that there is discordance between non-invasive fibrosis markers, a biopsy may be required to stage fibrosis; and most importantly rule in or out cirrhosis.

Patients with NAFLD should therefore be considered for a liver biopsy: A. if there is diagnostic uncertainty (other aetiologies/overlap conditions); B. to evaluate the severity of NASH and be considered for potential drug therapies (including clinical trials); C. to determine the stage of liver fibrosis where non-invasive tests are inconclusive to aid with future management (e.g. F4 for HCC surveillance) (Recommendation 14, Table 1).

The Royal College of Pathologists has developed guidelines for the processing, staining and reporting of liver biopsiesand these should be followed. The pathologists who report these biopsies should be active participants in the EQA scheme run by the UK Liver Pathology Group. It is recommended that the biopsy reporting should include the individual components of either the NASH Clinical Research Network criteria (NAS) or steatosis, activity fibrosis (SAF) score with the choice of score being made by agreement with the clinicians. Accordingly, liver biopsies should be processed, stained and examined according to the RCPath guidelines and reported by pathologists who participate in the liver EQA scheme using a validated score such as the NASH CRN or SAF score. (Recommendation 15, Table 1)

### Diagnostic accuracy of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as a non-invasive test for steatosis in suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114riQVk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that although CAP could be considered as a promising non-invasive test for diagnosing and staging of hepatic steatosis because of its ease of operation and less sampling errors, and it may provide useful guidance to clinicians on whether liver biopsy would be necessary, the diagnostic power of CAP is more superior for ≥ S1 steatosis to ≥ S2 and ≥ S3 steatosis. When used in patients with ≥ S3 steatosis, high rates of missed or wrong diagnosis may occur. Moreover, CAP has a limited utility in obese patients, making its widespread application in patients with metabolic syndrome such as NAFLD a practical concern. Therefore, in clinical practice, the role of CAP as a potential non-invasive substitute for liver biopsy in the assessment of steatosis should be further validated. Searching for non-invasive, inexpensive, and more accurate methods for identifying and staging liver steatosis in suspected NAFLD patients should be a constant endeavour.

### Fatty liver disease: a practical approach [^113dfKgS]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

Fatty liver disease is now one of the most commonly encountered entities in the practice of liver pathology. Distinguishing simple steatosis from steatohepatitis is critical because the latter requires follow-up because of long-term risks that include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An organized approach for evaluating liver biopsies with steatosis is recommended to capture all of the relevant features: (1) degree of steatosis, (2) presence or absence of ballooning degeneration, (3) lobular inflammation, and (4) fibrosis. Herein, we provide a stepwise approach that readers can use to evaluate liver biopsies with steatosis, including examples, pitfalls, differential diagnostic considerations, and suggested diagnostic phrasing.

Objective —

To provide a stepwise approach for the evaluation of liver biopsies showing significant steatosis (involving ≥ 5% of liver parenchyma).

Data Sources —

Biopsies demonstrating fatty liver disease encountered in our daily practice were examined as well as recent literature.

Conclusions —

Effective evaluation of liver biopsies with steatosis requires careful histologic examination and correlation with clinical history, particularly regarding medications, nutrition status, and alcohol use. Examples of uniform reporting, including appropriate use of the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network Activity Score, are provided.

### Noninvasive evaluation for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^116XjFkB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide and has the potential risk for progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with a greater risk for complications of chronic liver disease. Noninvasive testing has been evaluated for diagnosis, risk stratification, disease progression, and assessing response to therapy. The purpose of this narrative review was to outline the current noninvasive testing modalities for the diagnostic evaluation of NAFLD and NASH, while discussing possible markers that could be used for monitoring response to therapies.

Methods

The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles that evaluated the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH with serum biomarkers and/or imaging.

Findings

Serum biomarkers, imaging modalities, and combinations/serial algorithms involved in the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH are outlined. In addition, noninvasive modalities that have been used for assessing response to therapies in clinical trials are discussed.

Implications

Liver biopsy currently remains the gold standard for diagnosis and is often used in clinical trials to assess treatment response. However, developing safe and accessible noninvasive modalities for diagnosis and monitoring will have greater impact and relevance, as biopsy may not always be feasible in all clinical settings.

### Recognition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease… [^1127xL1o]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Increased levels of liver transaminase in patients are commonly noted by family physicians. While many cases can be explained by previously undetected alcohol use, infectious hepatitis, or use of hepatotoxic medications, a large percentage have no obvious cause. Fatty liver is increasingly recognized as a common etiology of these otherwise unexplained cases of increased transaminase levels. Angulo reviewed recent progress in the understanding of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Its widespread prevalence and occasional progression to end-stage cirrhosis are the chief reasons that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is receiving increased clinical attention. More than two thirds of all obese persons have fatty liver, and 90 percent of persons weighing more than twice their ideal body weight are affected. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia increase the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Although the typical patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a middle-aged obese woman, the disease also affects nonobese persons, including children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Most patients are asymptomatic, and hepatomegaly is the only common finding on physical examination. In patients with advanced disease, the typical findings of cirrhosis become apparent. Ultrasonography of the liver has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting fatty infiltration of the liver, as does computed tomography. These modes are not helpful, however, in determining the severity of the disease. Liver biopsy is a more definitive way to grade the severity of fatty liver disease. Histologic examination of biopsy specimens allows for grading of fatty infiltration and resultant hepatitis and fibrosis. Most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease do not progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Risk factors for advanced disease have become clearer. Gradual weight loss and good control of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are recommended. Liver transplantation has been necessary in patients with end-stage cirrhosis, but fatty liver disease may recur in the transplanted organ in some patients.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: the mist gradually clears [^112F7t2j]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest liver disorder in the developed world affecting up to a third of individuals. It is closely associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, particularly obesity and diabetes. It can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure and is an increasing indication for transplantation. Dietary and genetic factors determine susceptibility to NAFLD and its progression. NAFLD may also be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Most patients present with incidentally found abnormal liver blood tests. Diagnosis is usually one of exclusion. Liver biopsy is required for disease staging, but new imaging modalities and biomarkers are emerging which may eventually fulfil this role. There is, as yet no firm evidence-based treatment for NAFLD. Therapy is currently directed at treating components of the metabolic syndrome which may also be beneficial for the liver. The recent elucidation of the mechanisms leading to progressive disease suggests a variety of novel targets worthy of testing in animal models of NAFLD and subsequently in pilot studies in humans.

### Biopsy and noninvasive methods to assess progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1125CqgP]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of histopathologic features, ranging from isolated hepatic steatosis, to steatohepatitis with evidence of hepatocellular injury and fibrosis, to cirrhosis. The diagnosis and determination of NAFLD prognosis requires clinical and histopathologic assessments. Liver biopsy still is regarded as the reference for differentiating steatosis (NAFL) from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, for staging hepatic fibrosis, and for identifying NAFLD in patients with other chronic liver disease. Standardized grading and staging histologic scoring systems, such as the NAFLD activity score and the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis score, can help guide clinical decisions and assess outcomes of clinical trials. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD and technologic advances have led to algorithms that can be used to assess serum biomarkers and imaging methods that are noninvasive alternatives to biopsy collection and analysis. We review the advantages and limitations of biopsy analysis and noninvasive tests as diagnostic and prognostic tools for patients with NAFLD. We also discuss techniques to improve dynamic histopathology assessment, and emerging blood and imaging biomarkers of fibrogenesis.

### Diagnostic modalities for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and associated fibrosis [^112Kz3uB]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum comprised of isolated steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The majority of NAFLD subjects do not have NASH and do not carry a significant risk for liver-related adverse outcomes (cirrhosis and mortality). Globally, the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%. In Asia, a gradient of high to low prevalence rates is noted from urban to rural areas. Given the prevalence of NAFLD, the clinical and economic burden of NAFLD and NASH can be substantial. With increasing recognition of NASH as an important liver disease, the diagnosis of NASH still requires a liver biopsy that is suboptimal. Although liver biopsy is the most accurate modality to diagnose and stage the severity of NASH, this method suffers from being invasive, costly, associated with potential complications, and plagued with interobserver variability of individual pathological features. A number of noninvasive modalities to diagnose NASH and stage liver fibrosis are being developed. These modalities include predictive models (NAFLD fibrosis score) and serum biomarkers such as enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF). Other tests are based on radiological techniques, such as transient elastography (TE) or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), which are used to estimate liver stiffness as a potential surrogate of hepatic fibrosis. Although a dynamic field of research, most of these diagnostic modalities have area under the curve ranging between 0.76 and 0.90%, with MRE having the best predictive performance. In summary, developing safe and easily accessible noninvasive modalities to accurately diagnose and monitor NASH and associated fibrosis is of utmost importance in clinical practice and clinical research. These tests are not only important to risk stratify subjects at the greatest risk for progressive liver disease, but also to serve as appropriate surrogate endpoints for therapeutic clinical trials of NASH.

### The diagnosis and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1148EVQX]. Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Practice guidance — liver biopsy indications and pathology reporting in NAFLD states that liver biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected NAFLD in whom competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis (HS) and the presence and/or severity of coexisting chronic liver diseases (CLDs) cannot be excluded without a liver biopsy; clinically useful pathology reporting should include a distinction between NAFL (steatosis), NAFL with inflammation, and NASH (steatosis with lobular and portal inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning); a comment on severity (mild, moderate, or severe) may be useful; specific scoring systems such as NAS and/or SAF may be used as deemed appropriate; and the presence or absence of fibrosis should be described, with a further statement related to location, amount, and parenchymal remodeling warranted if present.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): why you should care, when you should worry, what you should do [^116KxyJJ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

For the diabetologist, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is important at both ends of its spectrum. It is an early warning sign of future risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. It may also lead to late life-threatening sequela of diabetes mellitus in the event of progression to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. This review will highlight the recent progress in understanding the natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in developing a rational approach to its diagnosis, staging, and management. The pandemic prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Western countries necessitates both a high index of suspicion to identify cases and a non-invasive approach to staging, which is best achieved with clinical/biochemical panels and transient elastography. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of management. Recent clinical trials provide support for pharmacologic therapies directed at the metabolic syndrome and at protecting the liver but more data are needed. Bariatric surgery is appropriate for high-risk patients who fail conservative management. Patients with liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma may be candidates for liver transplantation.

### Expert panel consensus on clinical assertion statements describing noninvasive tools for diagnosing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^11646gTw]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals and Background

A panel of 9 experts in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis gathered to assess multiple components of the diagnostic process.

Materials and Methods

The Clinical Assertion Statements covered screening of patients with type 2 diabetes for high-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which-if any-noninvasive tests could determine whether to delay or defer biopsy, whether primary care providers and endocrinologists should routinely calculate Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or those at risk for it, optimal noninvasive tests to stage fibrosis, the need to consider fibrosis in patients with normal transaminase levels, periodic monitoring for progressive fibrosis, whether patients should undergo biopsy before pharmacotherapy, and the clinical utility of genetic testing.

Results and Conclusions

Evidence was presented to support or refute each Clinical Assertion Statement; the panel voted on the nature of the evidence, level of support, and level of agreement with each Statement. Panel level of agreement and rationale of each Clinical Assertion Statement are reported here.

### Treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current views and perspectives [^113MKrFU]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. Problems still exist concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in clinical practice, for example: (a) how to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its type; (b) how to select patients candidate to treatment; (c) how to treat selected patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but only non-alcoholic steatohepatitis evolves into cirrhosis and the absolute risk of mortality for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is low. As yet, no tools, other than liver biopsy, are available to differentiate the various types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many drugs are, currently, under study to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even if well-performed trials are until necessary to define the best treatment. At the moment, the entity of the problem and the characteristics of patients frequently put the physician, in clinical practice, to choose the therapeutic approach arbitrarily which is considered more effective for each individual patient. Probably the future will consider the possibility of treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with more than one drug, by considering the various aspects and degree of this syndrome. Actually each physician should select the individual treatment on the basis of his/her knowledge and experience, by never forgetting the old saying 'primum non nocere'. However, the epidemiological entity of the problem, the characteristics of the patients, generally young, the frequent lack of clinical evidence of involvement of the liver, are all the factors that require vast well-performed clinical trials in order to define the best therapeutic approach for each individual patient.

### Noninvasive imaging methods to determine severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^115m45rt]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common form of liver disease in developed countries, with an estimated prevalence of 20%-30% and increasing to as high as 90% in diabetics. As the rates of NAFLD continue to rise in parallel with those of the obesity pandemic, it is increasingly important to differentiate those patients with the highest risk of progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. In fact, those patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis are at the greatest risk of progression to advanced disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer and are more likely to develop liver-related mortality. Thus, it is critically important to distinguish between NASH and non-NASH NAFLD. Whereas liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging of disease, complications of this procedure and other well-recognized limitations make it impractical for widespread use given the overall NAFLD disease burden. Noninvasive imaging modalities are increasingly being utilized to evaluate and stage NAFLD in patients with such a wide spectrum of disease. In this article, the role of these new and promising noninvasive imaging modalities to assess disease severity in NAFLD are reviewed. (Hepatology 2016;64:2234–2243).

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^114vk2Zm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

### Association of histologic disease activity with progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^117BbDrS]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive form of NAFLD and is more likely to progress to cirrhosis compared with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). The growing contribution of NAFLD to the liver-related population burden of disease underscores the need for a granular understanding of the evolution of the disease and the factors associated with both disease progression and regression.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to NASH, and NASH can both progress and regress without specific pharmacologic intervention. However, there is uncertainty around the rates of change and the associated factors, especially when accounting for baseline phenotype (ie, NAFL vs steatohepatitis, disease activity, and stage). Prior studies are mostly single-center, retrospective experiences and limited by small sample sizes, which do not capture the full spectrum of disease, and variable or unreported case definitions. This lack of data has hindered development of generalizable models of disease evolution that are needed both to guide patient care and to conduct clinical trials designed to evaluate the effect of therapy on progression to cirrhosis, which is the generally accepted surrogate end point for drug approval. Lack of data further limits development of robust population burden of disease models needed to inform policies regarding resource allocation to treat this disease. There is therefore an unmet need for data derived from prospective, multicenter, protocol-driven assessment of the histologic evolution of NAFLD using validated scoring systems implemented in a standardized manner.

In this study, the histologic evolution of NAFLD and the factors associated with changes in disease severity over time were determined by analysis of prospectively collected clinical, laboratory, and histologic data from a cohort of participants with the full histologic spectrum of disease who underwent at least 2 liver biopsies more than 1 year apart.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^1128earA]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of obesity is increasing worldwide at an alarmingly fast pace, mainly because of a combination of cultural, social, and economic factors that affect lifestyle. Currently, one out of every three Americans is considered to be obese. Obesity is the main driver for the onset of metabolic syndrome, which is a group of metabolic abnormalities that share the cardiovascular risk factors hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Presence of metabolic syndrome including obesity is a strong predictor for hepatic steatosis, defined as lipid deposition in hepatocytes. Its phenotype ranges from non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH - fatty changes with inflammation and hepatocellular injury or fibrosis), to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Similar to obesity, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions with a prevalence of 20% to 30% in western populations. Because NAFLD constitutes a risk factor for NASH, it is to be expected that the prevalence of complicated liver disease in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome will rise. As such, prevention of metabolic syndrome is a therapeutic target and lifestyle changes for patients at risk should be encouraged.

The question then arises, how to detect liver steatosis? Ultrasound is by far the most frequently used modality to detect liver steatosis. Fatty filtration of the liver produces a diffuse increase in echogenicity (a bright liver) and blurring of vascular margins and the diaphragm. Ultrasound, however, has some inherent disadvantages, such as a limited sensitivity to detect steatosis when less than 30% of hepatocytes contains fat, and its accuracy is compromised in patients who are obese. In addition, ultrasound cannot identify relevant liver disease in the context of NASH, such as steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

The gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD and to differentiate it from NASH is liver biopsy. A liver biopsy should be considered in patients with liver steatosis on imaging who are at increased risk of steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, such as patients with competing etiologies for hepatic steatosis (for example, diabetes mellitus) and with co-existing liver disease. However, the invasive nature of liver biopsy with its risk for major complications, such as bleeding in approximately 1% of cases, precludes widespread use. Therefore, an accurate, easy to conduct, and less invasive technique is needed in diagnosing NAFLD. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive modalities for quantifying steatosis. However, none of these imaging techniques have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to stage the disease and cannot distinguish between NAFLD and NASH.

### The role of noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1122aq7b]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronically elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD remains clinically challenge as patients with NAFLD are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific presenting complaints and may have normal liver enzymes. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the clinically aggressive variant of NAFLD, is also difficult to differentiate noninvasively, and a liver biopsy is required to definitively diagnose NASH. Thus, the definitive diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD is embedded in histological assessment of the liver. Several clinical aides been investigated in an attempt to risk stratify and identify patients noninvasively as doing a liver biopsy in all patients with NAFLD are not feasible. Since these biomarkers are unable to differentiate NASH from non-NASH, they have leveraged biochemical changes within the liver as patients progress to varying degree of hepatic fibrosis to identify patients with moderate fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or greater) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or greater) to help guide the need for additional and more definitive workup. These clinical aides span from by-products of apoptosis to statistical modelling of clinically available data to identify 'at-risk' patients with NAFLD. The current review will focus the diagnostic performance of these noninvasive serum-based biomarkers in NAFLD.

### Role of noninvasive tests in clinical gastroenterology practices to identify patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis At high risk of adverse outcomes: expert panel recommendations [^112sDYks]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is generally considered a silent and potentially reversible condition. The subtype of NAFLD that can be classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the metabolic nature of the pathogenic mechanism underlying NAFLD and NASH, it is often accompanied by common comorbidities such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities has resulted in a parallel increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, globally, nationally, and even in children. In recent years, it has been identified that the stage of fibrosis is the most important predictor of liver outcomes; therefore, identifying patients with NAFLD and NASH with more advanced stages of fibrosis can be essential for optimal management. Several noninvasive tools for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and NASH are available, but simple and straightforward recommendations on the use of these tools are not. Recognizing these unmet needs, hepatologists who are members of the American College of Gastroenterology and the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation created a practical decision tree/algorithm to risk stratify NAFLD/NASH as a resource in gastroenterology/hepatology clinical practices. This review will provide insight into how this algorithm was developed, describe it in detail, and provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.

### Current and emerging biomarkers and imaging modalities for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: clinical and research applications [^115zFRcq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder that frequently coexists with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The NAFLD spectrum, ranging from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, can be associated with long-term hepatic (hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extrahepatic complications. Diagnosis of NAFLD requires detection of liver steatosis with exclusion of other causes of chronic liver disease. Screening for NAFLD and identification of individuals at risk of end-stage liver disease represent substantial challenges that have yet to be met. NAFLD affects up to 25% of adults, yet only a small proportion will progress beyond steatosis to develop advanced disease (steatohepatitis and fibrosis) associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Identification of this cohort has required the gold standard liver biopsy, which is both invasive and expensive. The use of serum biomarkers and noninvasive imaging techniques is an area of significant clinical relevance. This narrative review outlines current and emerging technologies for the diagnosis of NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis.

Methods

We reviewed the literature using PubMed and reviewed national and international guidelines and conference proceedings to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence.

Findings

Significant advances have been made during the past 2 decades that have enhanced noninvasive assessment of NAFLD without the need for liver biopsy. For the detection of steatosis, abdominal ultrasonography remains the first-line investigation, although a controlled attenuation parameter using transient elastography is more sensitive. For detecting fibrosis, noninvasive serum markers of fibrosis and algorithms based on routine biochemistry are available, in addition to transient elastography. These techniques are well validated and have been incorporated into national and international screening guidelines. These approaches have facilitated more judicious use of liver biopsy but are yet to entirely replace it. Although serum biomarkers present a pragmatic and widely available screening approach for NAFLD in large population-based studies, magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer the benefit of achieving high degrees of accuracy in disease grading, tumor staging, and assessing therapeutic response.

Implications

This diagnostic clinical and research field is rapidly evolving; increasingly combined applications of biomarkers and transient elastography or imaging of selective (intermediate or high risk) cases are being used for clinical and research purposes. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation, particularly in the context of clinical trials, but noninvasive options are emerging, using multimodality assessment, that are quicker, more tolerable, more widely available and have greater patient acceptability.

Patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (equivalent to Brunt fibrosis stage 3 or 4) are at increased risk of complications of chronic liver disease, decompensation, liver transplantation and death in the short- to medium-term.

Since liver blood tests and ultrasound poorly discriminate fibrosis stage, primary care pathways for patients with NAFLD should assess for the presence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis using validated non-invasive fibrosis tests. Accordingly, we suggest the finding of liver steatosis on ultrasound, or unexplained abnormal liver blood tests, should prompt risk assessment for liver fibrosis (Recommendation 4, Table 1). Use validated widely available non-invasive tests with high negative predictive value to risk assess for significant liver fibrosis in the community (Recommendation 5, Table 1). Refer patients stratified as high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis to a hepatologist. For patients stratified as indeterminate risk, offer further discriminatory tests (such as transient elastography or ELF test) or refer for further evaluation (Recommendation 6, Table 1).

Indirect biomarkers of liver fibrosis such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis score have been shown to have prognostic value for long term outcomes and are validated against liver biopsy with good negative predictive value to rule-out advanced liver fibrosis in NAFLD. They combine routinely applied laboratory tests with clinical parameters and are easily applicable. Patients with a FIB-4 index < 1.3 (or < 2.0 if over 65 years) or NFS < -1.455 (or < 0.12 if over 65 years) have a low probability of having advanced fibrosis and can be reassured –. Of note, neither the FIB-4 nor the NFS have been validated in patients under 35 years of age. Evidence for the performance of other biomarkers such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis test (ELF) or transient elastography (discussed below) in young patient cohorts is also lacking so non-invasive tests should be interpreted with caution in this age group.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^112dndww]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK with approximately a third of the population being affected. The exact prevalence is not known, but population studies from the USA and China using magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimate that approximately 30% of the general population have steatosis. It is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The majority have simple steatosis, but approximately 10–30% develop NASH and the development of NASH cirrhosis is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Patients with NASH have increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality. Many patients with NAFLD remain undiagnosed, and recognising those at risk is the first step. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, the majority of patients can be effectively diagnosed non-invasively with tests that are routinely available in the clinic today. This review discusses a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD so that patients at the highest risk of liver-related complications can be identified.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly prevalent and strongly associated with obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, not only in the Western societies, but also in most regions of the world in the 21st century. The spectrum of its histopathology ranges from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with risk for progressive fibrosis that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Benign and malignant liver tumors have also been more frequently reported with the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. This review addresses the pathology of NAFLD and NASH, and their diagnostic features, diagnostic pitfalls, grading and staging, and clinical correlation.

### Pathological features of fatty liver disease [^1157ZXTZ]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are significant causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Both are characterized by histological lesions that can include steatosis, and each can lead to cirrhosis. It might be possible for pathologists to identify lesions and patterns of ALD and NAFLD; we review these lesions and propose methods to distinguish between the disorders. Any form of ALD can lead to end-stage liver disease, according to long-term studies of biopsy specimens and patient outcomes. Although steatosis can be a significant cofactor in progression of established chronic liver disease, or even development of hepatocellular carcinoma, only steatohepatitis indicates the presence of progressive liver disease in patients with NAFLD. Pediatric and adolescent NAFLD differ from adult nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and should be recognized as distinct conditions. Benign and malignant liver tumors have been more frequently reported with the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Histological scoring systems for ALD and NAFLD have been proposed to monitor efficacy in clinical trials and serve as prognostic factors. We review what we have learned from pathological analyses about the development of these disorders and how this information might be used to detect and treat them.

### How to identify the patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis who will progress to cirrhosis [^111kYJn9]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) figures prominently into the clinical hepatology landscape. NAFLD represents a disease spectrum comprising simple steatosis, steatosis with elevated liver enzymes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the entity with clear potential for fibrosis progression. Risk factors associated with fibrosis progression in NASH include histologic findings of lobular inflammation and any fibrosis as well as clinical comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in evaluating NASH; however, noninvasive methods are accumulating evidence for a growing role in identifying patients at increased risk to develop NASH, fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis.

### Diagnosis of fatty liver disease: is biopsy necessary? [^115ccwNS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly being recognized as an important and common condition, affecting approximately 20% of the general population. Although liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for diagnosis, there is a need for less invasive methods. Imaging by ultrasound, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance are all able to demonstrate fat. In this paper, these three imaging techniques are critically assessed. Ultrasound, although probably not the most reliable imaging method, has many advantages and, when positive, gives a high degree of certainty of the diagnosis depending on the prevalence of fatty liver in the population being studied. Unlike liver biopsy, none of these techniques is able to differentiate simple steatosis from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Conclusions

NAFLD is a very common condition affecting approximately 30% of the population and can cause significant liver disease in a proportion of patients. Accurate diagnosis and staging is important in determining the appropriate long-term management for patients with NAFLD.

Key points

Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are a poor predictor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Ultrasound is the first-line imaging test for patients with suspected steatosis (good accuracy if > 30% of hepatocytes are steatotic).
Liver fat decreases as fibrosis increases.
Risk of NAFLD/NASH directly related to presence and severity of the metabolic syndrome.
Simple steatosis carries benign prognosis.
NASH carries poor prognosis with increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality.
Aims: to identify individuals at risk of NAFLD to risk stratify patients with NAFLD to focus care on patients with NASH.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: summary of an AASLD single topic conference [^113UsRFt]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Fatty liver disease that develops in the absence of alcohol abuse is recognized increasingly as a major health burden. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions at a Single Topic Conference held September 20–22, 2002, and sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The conference focused on fatty liver disorders. Estimates based on imaging and autopsy studies suggest that about 20% to 30% of adults in the United States and other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the liver. About 10% of these individuals, or fully 2% to 3% of adults, are estimated to meet current diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained liver injury leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in a fraction, possibly up to one third, of those with NASH, and NASH may be a cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. NASH is now a significant health issue for obese children as well, leading to cirrhosis in some. The diagnostic criteria for NASH continue to evolve and rely on the histologic findings of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning, Mallory bodies), and the pattern of fibrosis. Generally recognized indications for biopsy include establishing the diagnosis and staging of the injury, but strict guidelines do not exist. Liver enzymes are insensitive and cannot be used reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Older age, obesity, and diabetes are predictive of fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is multifactorial. Insulin resistance may be an important factor in the accumulation of hepatocellular fat, whereas excess intracellular fatty acids, oxidant stress, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver. Efforts are underway to refine the role of insulin resistance in NASH and determine whether improving insulin sensitivity pharmacologically is an effective treatment. An altered lifestyle may be a more effective means of improving insulin sensitivity. The research agenda for the future includes establishing the role of insulin resistance and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in NASH, determining the pathogenesis of cellular injury, defining predisposing genetic abnormalities, identifying better noninvasive predictors of disease, and defining effective therapy.

### Noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis in NAFLD [^114SvcKf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, afflicting approximately a billion individuals. NAFLD is a slowly progressive disease that may evolve in a subset of patients toward cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. Liver fibrosis severity is the strongest predictor of clinical outcomes. The emergence of effective therapeutics on the horizon highlights the need to identify among patients with NAFLD, those with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis, who are the most at risk of developing complications and target them for therapy. Liver biopsy has been the reference standard for this purpose. However, it is not suitable for large-scale population evaluation, given its well-known limitations (invasiveness, rare but severe complications, and sampling variability). Thus, there have been major efforts to develop simple noninvasive tools that can be used in routine clinical settings and in drug development. Noninvasive approaches are based on the quantification of biomarkers in serum samples or on the measurement of liver stiffness, using either ultrasound- or magnetic resonance-based elastography techniques. This review provides a roadmap for future development and integration of noninvasive tools in clinical practice and in drug development in NAFLD. We discuss herein the principles for their development and validation, their use in clinical practice, including for diagnosis of NAFLD, risk stratification in primary care and hepatology settings, prediction of long-term liver-related and non-liver-related outcomes, monitoring of fibrosis progression and regression, and response to future treatment.

### A new noninvasive technique for estimating hepatic triglyceride: will liver biopsy become redundant in diagnosing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease? [^116oi1Np]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Future perspectives

Multi-echo MRI is an attractive noninvasive technique to measure the grade of steatosis. However, as long as the grade of hepatic fat has no direct effect on liver disease, in contrast to NASH, multi-echo MRI at best measures an intermediate endpoint. Histopathological assessment of hepatitis and fibrosis, by means of a biopsy, remains the gold standard to differentiate between NAFLD and NASH. Therefore the use of multi-echo MRI is probably restricted to clinical research. On a different note, we encourage the development of new noninvasive techniques to grade steatosis because they can be of great value in patients with NASH. There, these techniques can play a role in monitoring the reduction of steatosis through lifestyle changes. In such cases, steatosis is a worthwhile intermediate endpoint that is associated with improved histological lesions that occur in NASH, such as hepatitis, hepatocellular ballooning and fibrosis.

### Non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^1174D9GG]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent form of chronic liver disease that poses challenges in diagnosis and risk stratification. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more progressive form of NAFLD, is particularly challenging to diagnose in the absence of histology. Liver biopsy is infrequently performed due to its invasive nature, potential for sampling error, and lack of inter-rater reliability. Non-invasive tests that can accurately identify patients with at-risk NASH (ie, individuals with biopsy-proven NASH with NAFLD activity score [NAS] ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2) are key tools to identify candidates for pharmacologic therapy in registrational trials for the treatment of NASH-related fibrosis. With emerging pharmacotherapy, non-invasive tests are required to track treatment response. Lastly, there is an unmet need for non-invasive tests to assess risk for clinical outcomes including progression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver-related mortality, and overall mortality. In this Review we examine advances in non-invasive tests to diagnose and monitor NAFLD and NASH.

A pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD in clinical practice

NAFLD is very common and the majority of patients have mild disease, but patients with advanced NASH need to be identified to offer treatment and surveillance for liver-related complications. With the current lack of a simple, widely available biomarker for NASH, a pragmatic diagnostic and staging approach is needed. One such approach for the investigation and assessment of disease severity in patients with NAFLD is shown in figure 1.

Figure 1
Example of algorithm for clinical assessment of patients at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. CK-18 levels are not routinely available in many centres, so patients at intermediate and high risk have to be managed according to the high-risk arm of the algorithm (red arrows). 'Screen'- blood tests to rule out common causes of liver disease; USS, ultrasound; MS, metabolic syndrome; IR, insulin resistance; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

In brief, the first stage involves the identification of patients with NAFLD either with metabolic risk factor profiling, LFTs or imaging. If steatosis is confirmed and other causes of liver disease are excluded, a clinical diagnosis of NAFLD can be made. The second stage involves risk stratification to determine a patient's stage of disease. This should be initially undertaken non-invasively with a locally available test (eg, FIB-4 score, NAFLD fibrosis score, TE, ARFI, CK-18). Patients who are identified as 'low' risk of NASH or advanced fibrosis can be managed in primary care with modification of their metabolic risk factors. Patients who are 'indeterminate' or 'high' risk should undergo further assessment (often requiring a liver biopsy) to determine the stage of disease. Risk stratification means patients can then be managed appropriately as will be discussed in 'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to management' by Dyson et al.

Machado et al have recently proposed a similar algorithm for patients with NAFLD to guide when liver biopsy is needed. They used the NAFLD Fibrosis Score and TE to evaluate fibrosis and CK-18 fragments to evaluate NASH. The management pathway for patients would be very similar as with the algorithm we propose, but CK-18, and even TE, are not available in many centres, which is reflected in our algorithm.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: controlling an emerging epidemic, challenges, and future directions [^1179mXpj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks and future directions

There are many challenges facing patients affected by NAFLD. There are also many challenges faced by clinicians and researchers involved in the management of NAFLD. However, there are opportunities to overcome these challenges. There is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of NAFLD is guided by an interaction of nutritional habits, genetics, and environmental factors. One area of future research is to explore specific pathways through which these factors interact, especially in the era of epigenetics. A deeper understanding of this complex interaction can lead to the development of guidelines for screening, early diagnosis, and the development of therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic studies will enable us to predict which subset of patients affected by NAFLD are likely to progress into more advanced stages of disease.

Furthermore, the use of noninvasive biomarkers to obviate the need for liver biopsy requires further investigation. Noninvasive staging methods will encourage more patients to enroll in clinical trials, which will further broaden our understanding of the disease. To this end, there is also a need for clinical trials of longer duration to determine clinical endpoints, as well as the long-term safety and durability of new treatment options.

Our review has also shown that there is a need to increase training among healthcare providers with respect to lifestyle behavioral changes and motivational interventions. A patient-centered approach is expected to yield better outcomes in terms of weight loss and its effect on liver fat accumulation. This should also be reflected in authoritative guidelines. The 2012 guidelines of the AASLD need to be updated to reflect current knowledge and trends in order to guide healthcare providers and patients.

NAFLD is emerging as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and presents an impending social and economic burden. If it is not addressed, a significant portion of healthcare expenditure and resources will be required to cater for NAFLD-related diseases, further increasing healthcare expenditure. There is a gap in our knowledge and therapeutic armamentarium that needs to be bridged before we can stem the tide.

### Pathology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111t3DDi]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are gaining increasing recognition as components of the emerging epidemic of obesity in North America and in other parts of the world. These entities are considered the hepatic manifestations of the insulin resistance syndrome and represent the spectra of fatty liver disease associated with it. All features of metabolic syndrome are associated with NAFLD/NASH, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in the form of elevated triglyceride levels. NAFLD/NASH can progress to liver cirrhosis and has been reported as a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, the histopathologic features of NAFLD/NASH and differential diagnostic considerations are discussed. In addition, grading and staging schema proposed and currently in use are reviewed. Finally, other aspects for consideration by practicing pathologists, such as sampling issues, histopathologic findings after therapeutic interventions, and recurrence after liver transplantation, are addressed.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of conditions characterized histologically by excessive accumulation of hepatic fat in the absence of alcohol consumption. Two main histological patterns of NAFLD are described: fatty liver alone and steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is an increasingly recognized cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Although the majority of patients do not develop complications, 28% may develop serious liver sequelae, including end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Those at highest risk include patients with significant hepatic necro-inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore liver biopsy had been recommended for confirming diagnosis and for providing prognostic information.

There are several drawbacks in using liver biopsy for this purpose. This procedure is invasive, costly, and prone to complications, some minor, such as pain, others more severe with a recorded risk of death of 0.01%. Notably, just as is the case in other chronic liver diseases, there is considerable sampling variability (40% for fibrosis staging), and a high intra and inter-pathologist variability. Most importantly, the number of patients at risk for NAFLD is high enough that liver biopsy is not a practical and efficient tool for identifying those at risk of advanced fibrosis. Indeed an estimated 15 to 20% of the Western European population has steatosis while more than half of Americans are overweight or obese.

Statement 4: NASH Should Be Confirmed by Liver Biopsy Before Initiating Pharmacological Therapy in NAFLD

In response to the difficulties in using liver biopsy to confirm NASH, new data have shifted the focus toward NASH patients with stage 2 and higher fibrosis. These are stages that correlate with disease morbidity and mortality and potential candidacy for targeted therapies. The 2018 AASLD Guidance recommended that pharmacological therapy should be predicated upon the finding of F2 fibrosis or greater on liver biopsy.

Recent research has focused on identifying patients with NASH+NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4+ ≥ F2, primarily to replace biopsy, which is currently required for clinical trials. One promising NIT is the FibroScan-AST (FAST) score, which combines the controlled attenuation parameter score and stiffness assessed by TE with AST. In the derivative/validation cohorts study, the test performed well, with AUROC of ~0.80 and 2 author-determined cutoffs: the first (≤ 0.35) to rule out NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2 and the other (≥ 0.67) to rule in NASH+NAS ≥ 4+ ≥ F2. Greater than 30% of patients fell into the indeterminate zone. Nevertheless, the test is a promising alternative to liver biopsy for determining which NASH patients should be started on therapy.

### Non-invasive diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A critical appraisal [^112vrDxd]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one in every three subjects in the occidental world. The vast majority will not progress, but a relevant minority will develop liver cirrhosis and its complications. The classical gold standard for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and assessing fibrosis is liver biopsy (LB). However, it has important sample error issues and subjectivity in the interpretation, apart from a small but real risk of complications. The decision to perform an LB is even harder in a condition so prevalent such as NAFLD, in which the probability of finding severe liver injury is low. In an attempt to overcome LB and to subcategorize patients with NAFLD in different prognoses allowing better management decisions, several non-invasive methods have been studied in the last decade. The literature is vast and confusing. This review will summarize which methods have been tested and how they perform, which tests are adequate for clinical practice and how they can change the management of these patients.

Imaging-detected unsuspected hepatic steatosis — when patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging have symptoms or signs attributable to liver disease or have abnormal liver biochemistries, they should be evaluated as though they have suspected NAFLD and worked-up accordingly (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who lack any liver-related symptoms or signs and have normal liver biochemistries, it is reasonable to assess for metabolic risk factors (e.g., obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia) and alternate causes for hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption or medications (Strength – 1, Evidence - A); in patients with unsuspected hepatic steatosis detected on imaging who are asymptomatic and have normal liver biochemistries, a liver biopsy cannot be recommended (Strength – 1, Evidence - B).
