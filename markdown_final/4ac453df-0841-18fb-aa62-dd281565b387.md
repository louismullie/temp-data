## Question

What is hemolytic microangiopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hemolytic microangiopathy is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct terminology and whether "hemolytic microangiopathy" is synonymous with thrombotic microangiopathy. Then, I should define the core clinical triad and pathophysiology. Next, I will classify the major etiologies, including primary and secondary forms, and clarify the key differentiators like ADAMTS13 and complement. After that, I should review organ involvement patterns and diagnostic steps, including when to suspect renal-limited disease. Finally, I will consider management principles and why timely, etiology-specific therapy matters, while double-checking areas of controversy and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because precision matters here. "Hemolytic microangiopathy" is not the standard term; the correct clinical entity is thrombotic microangiopathy, which encompasses the syndromes characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ injury due to microvascular thrombosis, with TTP and HUS as prototypical examples, so I should correct the phrasing to TMA while explaining that MAHA is a hallmark laboratory feature rather than the disease name itself [^115zwwrx] [^1151XYV8].

> I will now examine the core clinical triad to anchor the definition. TMA is defined by three elements: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on smear, consumptive thrombocytopenia from platelet activation and consumption, and ischemic end-organ injury driven by microthrombi in small vessels; this triad reflects endothelial injury and microvascular occlusion as the unifying pathophysiology across etiologies, so I need to ensure I emphasize both the hematologic and vascular components [^115zwwrx] [^1151XYV8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify the major categories. TMAs are broadly divided into primary forms, where the TMA is the principal disease process, and secondary forms, where TMA is a manifestation of another condition; primary forms include ADAMTS13-deficient TTP and complement-mediated TMA, while secondary forms include infection-associated, drug-induced, malignancy-associated, transplant-associated, pregnancy-related, autoimmune, and malignant hypertension–associated TMA, and I should confirm that secondary TMAs are far more common than primary forms in hospitalized cohorts [^115zwwrx] [^114qXkMx].

> Next, I should review the key pathophysiologic drivers and how they guide testing. TTP is linked to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, which allows ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers to drive platelet aggregation; complement-mediated TMA reflects dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway with membrane attack complex–mediated endothelial injury; Shiga toxin–associated HUS involves toxin-mediated endothelial damage with variable complement activation; and malignant hypertension–associated TMA reflects shear stress–induced endothelial injury with secondary thrombosis, so I need to ensure I align diagnostic assays with these mechanisms [^114wbLfT] [^114USgT9] [^112uiNCZ] [^113pYkXa].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic differentiators that change management. Severe ADAMTS13 activity less than 10% supports TTP and mandates urgent plasma exchange, whereas ADAMTS13 activity greater than 10% with the TMA phenotype should redirect evaluation toward complement-mediated TMA or other secondary causes; complement genetic testing and functional assays can identify pathogenic variants or autoantibodies in roughly 60–70% of complement-mediated TMA, though I should note that a negative genetic panel does not exclude disease and results may take time, which is why clinical exclusion of TTP and STEC-HUS is essential at the bedside [^116WjaiV] [^114USgT9] [^1164sRi6].

> I need to check organ involvement patterns because they provide clinical clues. TTP more often features neurologic and cardiac ischemia, whereas complement-mediated TMA and STEC-HUS more often show severe renal involvement; however, overlap is common, and renal-limited TMA can occur with biopsy-proven microthrombi despite minimal hematologic abnormalities, so I should emphasize that absence of overt MAHA or thrombocytopenia does not rule out TMA when renal failure and hypertension are present [^113HWUPZ] [^1149PwwW] [^117SURXs].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach and where delays commonly occur. Initial evaluation should include CBC with smear for schistocytes, LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, creatinine, and coagulation studies to distinguish TMA from DIC; ADAMTS13 activity should be sent urgently when TTP is suspected; stool testing for Shiga toxin and cultures should be pursued in children with diarrhea; and complement studies and genetic testing are indicated when complement-mediated TMA is suspected after TTP and STEC-HUS are excluded, ideally with multidisciplinary coordination to expedite results and treatment decisions [^116WjaiV] [^115zwwrx] [^1147LMvg].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the patient is critically ill. In the ICU or emergency setting, early plasma exchange is often initiated empirically for suspected TTP while awaiting ADAMTS13, and complement blockade is considered early when complement-mediated TMA is likely; I should double-check that this empiric strategy balances benefit and risk, and indeed, delays in TTP therapy increase mortality while delays in complement blockade increase irreversible renal failure, so a low threshold for empiric therapy is reasonable when the pretest probability is high [^116WjaiV] [^115YE6kK].

> I will now examine management principles by etiology, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. For TTP, daily therapeutic plasma exchange with corticosteroids is first-line, with rituximab for refractory or relapsed disease; for complement-mediated TMA, C5 inhibition with eculizumab or ravulizumab is standard and has transformed outcomes; for STEC-HUS, supportive care remains the cornerstone, with dialysis as needed, and antibiotics are avoided in E. coli–associated cases unless pneumococcus is suspected; for secondary TMAs, treatment of the underlying cause is essential, and plasma exchange is generally not beneficial unless there is concurrent TTP physiology, so I should confirm each patient's etiology before committing to prolonged apheresis [^1147LMvg] [^111PXd8n] [^114EX2hh] [^114qhRB8].

> Hold on, I should verify a couple of nuances that often cause confusion. First, some clinicians still use "TTP/HUS" as a catch-all, but contemporary practice favors distinguishing TTP by ADAMTS13 and complement-mediated TMA by mechanism because treatments diverge; second, while eculizumab is highly effective for complement-mediated TMA, its role in STEC-HUS remains controversial, with a randomized pediatric trial showing no acute benefit but a signal for reduced 1-year renal sequelae, so routine use in STEC-HUS is not yet standard; third, renal-limited TMA can be missed if hematologic criteria are strictly enforced, so biopsy and clinical context remain crucial in unexplained AKI with hypertension or hemolysis [^116XFCCU] [^115MxPp9] [^117SURXs].

> Let me reconsider the initial premise to ensure internal consistency. Hemolytic microangiopathy is best understood as the laboratory hallmark of thrombotic microangiopathy, namely microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, which together with thrombocytopenia and organ injury defines TMA; the priority is to rapidly identify the etiology and deliver disease-specific therapy because outcomes hinge on timely, mechanism-targeted treatment rather than supportive care alone [^115zwwrx] [^1151XYV8].

Hemolytic microangiopathy, more accurately termed **thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)** [^115zwwrx], is a clinicopathologic syndrome defined by **microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ injury** due to microvascular thrombosis [^1151XYV8]. The core mechanism is **endothelial injury** [^1149PwwW] with subsequent platelet activation and fibrin-rich microthrombi that cause ischemia and organ dysfunction [^114wbLfT]. TMA includes TTP, HUS, and secondary forms (malignancy, drugs, autoimmune disease, transplantation, pregnancy) [^114qXkMx]; prompt recognition and etiologic diagnosis are essential because treatments differ and delays increase morbidity and mortality [^116WjaiV] [^115zwwrx].

---

## Clinical definition and diagnostic criteria

TMA is identified by the following **triad**:

- **Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA)**: Non-immune hemolysis with schistocytes on peripheral smear, elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116F3Mgs].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Consumptive from platelet activation and aggregation in microthrombi [^114wbLfT].

- **Organ injury**: Commonly renal (AKI), neurologic (encephalopathy, seizures, focal deficits), cardiac (ischemia, heart failure), and gastrointestinal (ischemia, pancreatitis) [^114wbLfT].

---

## Pathophysiology

The unifying mechanism is **endothelial injury** [^1149PwwW] leading to:

- **Platelet activation and aggregation**: Forming microthrombi and causing ischemia [^114wbLfT].

- **Red cell fragmentation**: Mechanical hemolysis from shear stress in narrowed vessels [^116F3Mgs].

- **Complement activation**: Especially in complement-mediated TMA (aHUS), driving endothelial damage and thrombosis [^114USgT9].

---

## Classification of TMA

TMA is classified into **primary and secondary forms**:

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary TMA | - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) <br/> - Complement-mediated TMA (aHUS) | - Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency in TTP [^114wbLfT] <br/> - Complement dysregulation in aHUS [^114USgT9] |
| Secondary TMA | - Malignancy <br/> - Drugs (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors, gemcitabine) <br/> - Autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, APS) <br/> - Transplantation <br/> - Pregnancy (HELLP, preeclampsia) <br/> - Infections (e.g. HIV, pneumococcus) | - Underlying condition drives endothelial injury [^114qhRB8] <br/> - Management targets the cause [^114qhRB8] |

---

## Clinical presentation

TMA presents with **nonspecific symptoms** — fatigue, pallor, bleeding, and neurologic deficits — and organ-specific findings such as AKI, hypertension, encephalopathy, and ischemia [^115zwwrx]. Severity varies by etiology and organ involvement [^114qXkMx].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic approach** is critical:

- **Confirm MAHA and thrombocytopenia**: CBC, smear, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, Coombs test [^116F3Mgs].

- **Assess organ injury**: Renal function, neurologic exam, cardiac enzymes, ECG [^115zwwrx].

- **Differentiate etiologies**: ADAMTS13 activity (TTP), complement studies (aHUS), stool Shiga toxin (HUS), autoimmune serologies, drug history, pregnancy testing [^116WjaiV].

- **Biopsy**: Kidney or other affected organ when diagnosis is unclear or to confirm TMA lesions [^1149PwwW].

---

## Management

Treatment is **etiology-specific**:

- **TTP**: Urgent plasma exchange and immunosuppression; ADAMTS13-guided therapy [^1147LMvg].

- **Complement-mediated TMA**: Eculizumab or ravulizumab (C5 inhibitors) [^114USgT9].

- **Secondary TMA**: Treat the underlying cause (e.g. stop offending drug, chemotherapy, immunosuppression, control hypertension) [^114qhRB8].

- **Supportive care**: Dialysis, transfusion, antihypertensives, and infection prophylaxis (especially with complement blockade) [^117WD2qY].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by etiology and timeliness of therapy. TTP has high early mortality if untreated but improves with plasma exchange [^115YE6kK]; complement-mediated TMA carries a risk of progression to ESRD without complement blockade [^114C8Zbv]; secondary TMA outcomes depend on control of the underlying condition [^notfound].

---

Hemolytic microangiopathy (TMA) is a **life-threatening syndrome** defined by MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and organ injury from microvascular thrombosis; **rapid etiologic diagnosis and targeted therapy** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^115zwwrx].

### Clinical evaluation and management of thrombotic microangiopathy [^115zwwrx]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) refers to a diverse group of diseases that share clinical and histopathologic features. TMA is clinically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, consumptive thrombocytopenia, and organ injury that stems from endothelial damage and vascular occlusion. There are several disease states with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms that manifest as TMA. These conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and require urgent recognition and treatment. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome are traditionally considered to be primary forms of TMA, but TMA more commonly occurs in association with a coexisting condition such as infection, pregnancy, autoimmune disease, or malignant hypertension, among others. Determining the cause of TMA is a diagnostic challenge because of limited availability of disease-specific testing. However, identifying the underlying etiology is imperative as treatment strategies differ. Our understanding of the conditions that cause TMA is evolving. Recent advances have led to improved comprehension of the varying pathogenic mechanisms that drive TMA. Development of targeted therapeutics has resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes. In this article, we review the pathogenesis and clinical features of the different TMA-causing conditions. We outline a practical approach to diagnosis and management and discuss empiric and disease-specific treatment strategies.

### Is there a shared pathophysiology for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome? [^116KoikB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is characterized by microvascular thrombosis coupled with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and red blood cell fragmentation. Familiar to nephrologists and hematologists alike, classically associated with thrombotic microangiopathy are the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), the histories and presentations of which are closely intertwined. Not surprising, these two disorders are considered by many to be manifestations of the same disease process, whereas others consider HUS and TTP to be distinct clinical and pathologic entities. Herein are reviewed HUS and TTP along with recent progress shedding new light on possible shared pathophysiologic mechanisms for these two intriguing disorders.

Thrombotic microangiopathy can manifest in a diverse range of diseases and is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and organ injury, including AKI. It can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but a systematic approach to investigation and prompt initiation of supportive management and, in some cases, effective specific treatment can result in good outcomes. This review considers the classification, pathology, epidemiology, characteristics, and pathogenesis of the thrombotic microangiopathies, and outlines a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and management.

### Thrombotic microangiopathies and the kidney [^113YQHT6]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a pathological lesion that occurs due to endothelial injury. It can be seen in a heterogenous group of disorders, typically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and end-organ ischemia. TMA can also be renal limited with no systemic manifestations. There are multiple etiologies of a TMA with complement activation being a core underlying mechanism, although the nature and extent of complement involvement can vary. A further complicated factor is the cross talk between complement, neutrophils, and coagulation pathways in the pathophysiology of TMAs. Therefore, a thorough and systematic clinical history and laboratory evaluation are critical to establish the cause and pathophysiology of a TMA. Furthermore, TMAs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and timely diagnosis is key for appropriate management and to prevent end-stage kidney disease and other associated complications. In this review, we focus on the pathology, mechanisms, diagnostic work up and treatment of TMAs associated with various etiologies. We also define the complement evaluations that should be conducted in these patients and further highlight the currently approved complement therapies as well as others in the pipeline.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy: a multidisciplinary team Approach [^1167BRPp]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is characterized by the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia along with organ dysfunction, and pathologically, by the presence of microthrombi in multiple microvascular beds. Delays in diagnosis and initiation of therapy are common due to the low incidence, variable presentation, and poor awareness of these diseases, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary approaches to clinical care for TMA. We describe a new approach to improve clinical management via a TMA team that originally stemmed from an Affinity Research Collaborative team focused on thrombosis and hemostasis. The TMA team consists of clinical faculty from different disciplines who together are charged with the responsibility to quickly analyze clinical presentations, guide laboratory testing, and streamline prompt institution of treatment. The TMA team also includes faculty members from a broad range of disciplines collaborating to elucidate the pathogenesis of TMA. To this end, a clinical database and biorepository have been constructed. TMA leaders educate front-line providers from other departments through presentations in various forums across multiple specialties. Facilitated by an Affinity Research Collaborative mechanism, we describe an interdisciplinary team dedicated to improving both clinical care and translational research in TMA.

### Hemolytic uremic syndrome: a brief overview… [^114EX2hh]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies are a group of disorders that cause end organ damage and include hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. HUS, classified into primary and secondary types, mostly affects the kidneys. HUS is the main cause of acute kidney injury in children, producing significant morbidity and mortality. The key takeaways from the article are as follows: HUS was historically classified based on etiology as "diarrhea positive" — or typical — and "diarrhea negative" — or atypical. This classification is now changed to primary and secondary, based on pathophysiology. Primary HUS is due to a disorder of complement regulation likely from a genetic predisposition in contrast to secondary HUS, which is most likely from an infection. The most likely cause of secondary HUS in the US is infection from Shiga toxin-producing bacteria.

The authors describe the initial clinical presentation to be nonspecific, with significant variability in systemic progression. HUS is characterized by the classical triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI. The diagnostic approach requires testing for hemolysis and assessing renal, cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, and gastrointestinal function. TTP should be ruled out as this condition requires immediate initiation of plasmapheresis. Patients in both primary and secondary HUS may have low complement levels. If no infectious cause is found, primary HUS should be suspected and genetic workup should be initiated. Other serious diagnoses such as TTP and DIC should be ruled out. The management of HUS is fluid management. Packed red blood cells may be needed, and platelet transfusions are only indicated if there is bleeding. Antibiotics are not indicated in HUS caused by. Escherichia coli; the only notable exception is pneumococcal infection.

For primary HUS, terminal complement blocking agent needs to be given, especially if kidney function tests are deteriorating despite fluid resuscitation. Management should be done in conjunction with a pediatric hematologist and nephrologist.

### Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: what is it, how is it diagnosed, and how is it treated? [^1164sRi6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare syndrome of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. Genetic mutations in the alternate pathway of complement are well recognized as the cause in more than 60% of patients affected by this thrombotic microangiopathy. The identification of aHUS as a disease of the alternate pathway of complement enables directed therapeutic intervention both in the acute and chronic setting and may include one or all of the following: plasma therapy, complement blockade, and liver transplantation. Because aHUS shares many of the presenting characteristics of the other thrombotic microangiopathies, and confirmatory genetic results are not available at the time of presentation, the diagnosis relies heavily on the recognition of a clinical syndrome consistent with the diagnosis in the absence of signs of an alternate cause of thrombotic microangiopathy. Limited understanding of the epidemiology, genetics, and clinical features of aHUS has the potential to delay diagnosis and treatment. To advance our understanding, a more complete characterization of the unique phenotypical features of aHUS is needed. Further studies to identify additional genetic loci for aHUS and more robust biomarkers of both active and quiescent disease are required. Advances in these areas will undoubtedly improve the care of patients with aHUS.

### Consensus on the standardization of terminology in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related thrombotic microangiopathies [^116XFCCU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials An international collaboration provides a consensus for clinical definitions. This concerns thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The consensus defines diagnosis, disease monitoring and response to treatment. Requirements for ADAMTS-13 are given.

Summary

Background Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are two important acute conditions to diagnose. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a broad pathophysiologic process that leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and involves capillary and small-vessel platelet aggregates. The most common cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be differentiated by abnormal coagulation. Clinically, a number of conditions present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, including cancer, infection, transplantation, drug use, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in pregnancy. Despite overlapping clinical presentations, TTP and HUS have distinct pathophysiologies and treatment pathways. Objectives To present a consensus document from an International Working Group on TTP and associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Methods The International Working Group has proposed definitions and terminology based on published information and consensus-based recommendations. Conclusion The consensus aims to aid clinical decisions, but also future studies and trials, utilizing standardized definitions. It presents a classification of the causes of TMA, and criteria for clinical response, remission and relapse of congenital and immune-mediated TTP.

### Microangiopathic disorders in pregnancy [^113wf8wk]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Microangiopathic disorders present with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan damage. In pregnancy, these disorders present a challenge both diagnostically and therapeutically, with widely overlapping clinical scenarios and disparate treatments. Although rare, a clear understanding of these diseases is important because devastating maternal and fetal outcomes may ensue if there is misdiagnosis and improper treatment. Microangiopathic disorders presenting in pregnancy are thus best assessed and treated by both obstetric and hematology teams. As a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying each of the disease processes is gained, new diagnostic testing and therapies will be available, which will lead to improved outcomes.

### Renal thrombotic microangiopathy: a review [^1149PwwW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), a pathological lesion observed in a wide spectrum of diseases, is triggered by endothelial injury and/or dysfunction. Although TMA lesions are often accompanied by clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ischemic end-organ injury, renal-limited forms of TMA are not infrequently encountered in clinical practice. The presence of renal-limited manifestations can be diagnostically challenging, often delaying the initiation of targeted therapy. Prompt investigation and empirical treatment of TMA is warranted to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. Major advances have been made with respect to the pathophysiology of primary TMA entities, with the subsequent development of novel diagnostic tools and lifesaving therapies for diseases like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and complement-mediated TMA. This article will review the clinical presentation and pathologic hallmarks of TMA involving the kidney, and the disease-specific mechanisms that contribute to the endothelial injury that characterizes TMA lesions. Diagnostic approach and both empirical and disease-specific treatment strategies will be discussed, along with the potential role for emerging targeted disease-specific therapies.

### Molecular basis of thrombotic microangiopathy [^116hsVyf]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are two index conditions of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). While conditions classified as TMA share common clinical characteristics, their underlying causes differ significantly. TMA is challenging to diagnose but life threating without proper and timely diagnosis and treatments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding of the molecular basis, clinical epidemiology, and treatments of TTP and HUS.

### Does hemolytic uremic syndrome differ from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? [^117B5rWb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Both hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), affecting mainly the kidney and brain, respectively. Diagnosis of HUS or TTP has been complicated by the fact that these disorders share several clinical characteristics, and by the dearth of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of TMA. Advances in the identification of pathogenic features — deficiency of the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 in TTP and association of mutated complement proteins with atypical HUS — have gone some way towards improving clinicians' ability to distinguish between the two diseases. Here, we pose the following question: is it important to patient management that HUS be distinguished from TTP? By discussing what is known about the pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of these two conditions we address this question, and propose a new nomenclature for TMA.

### Advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome [^114qC9oH]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

The thrombotic microangiopathies are microvascular occlusive disorders characterized by hemolytic anemia caused by fragmentation of erythrocytes and thrombocytopenia due to increased platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, eventually leading to disturbed microcirculation with reduced organ perfusion. Depending on whether brain or renal lesions prevail, two different entities have been described: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, not rarely the clinical distinctions between these two conditions remain questionable. Recent studies have contributed greatly to our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to TTP and HUS. In this review, we briefly focus on the most important advances in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of these two thrombotic microangiopathies.

### Management of thrombotic microangiopathic hemolytic anemias with therapeutic plasma exchange: when It works and when It does not [^117X44zq]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies are a heterogeneous group of inherited and acquired disorders sharing a common clinical presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage. These disorders have been treated with plasma exchange (TPE) based on randomized controlled trials, which found this therapy to be effective in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). For the remaining disorders, low- to very low-quality evidence exists for the use of TPE. When TPE is applied, the treatment regimen used for TTP is usually applied. There is a need for further evaluation of the role of TPE in the treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies other than TTP.

### Thrombotic microangiopathies [^115YE6kK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are rare diseases characterized by endothelial injury and microvascular clots. TMAs often lead to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and end organ damage. Common TMA types include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), infection-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and complement-mediated TMAs. Diagnosing TMAs in the emergency setting is challenging. Laboratory tests, such as complete blood count and peripheral smear are useful in the diagnosis. TTP, marked by severe thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and normal coagulation factors, has high mortality without treatment. Early recognition and thorough evaluation are crucial for appropriate management and improved patient outcomes.

### Ten tips for managing complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies (formerly atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome): narrative review [^117WD2qY]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies (CM-TMA) are rare and life-threatening disorders characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage. These conditions result from dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway, often due to genetic variants or autoantibodies. The clinical spectrum is broad, comprising varied presentations and triggers, including infections, malignancies, and pregnancy-related complications. Advances in understanding the genetic and immunological basis of CM-TMA have improved diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis requires exclusion of other thrombotic microangiopathies like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and secondary causes, with genetic testing recommended to identify underlying susceptibilities. The introduction of C5 inhibitors has transformed the management of CM-TMA, significantly improving outcomes compared to the pre-2011 era when therapeutic plasma exchange was the primary therapy. Despite these advances, challenges remain in determining the optimal duration of therapy. Prophylactic measures against infections, particularly meningococcal disease, are mandatory for patients receiving C5 inhibitors. This article underscores the need for a personalized, multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis and management of CM-TMA. Advances in genetics and complement biology have led to improved therapeutic strategies, however ongoing research is essential to address unanswered questions regarding relapse risk, treatment duration, and long-term outcomes.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy and indications for therapeutic plasma exchange [^111a9Cz7]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a clinicopathological condition associated with a wide variety of medical conditions. TMA is classically characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular thrombi that cause end-organ damage. The most prominent diagnoses associated with TMA are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although TTP and HUS can have similar clinical and laboratory features and are often lumped together as a combined entity referred to as "TTP/HUS", the pathologic processes causing TMA and optimal therapies for these conditions are different. Empiric use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in the setting of TMA is common. The high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with some causes of TMA justify rapid institution of this relatively low-risk procedure. However, many causes of TMA do not respond to TPE and prolonged courses of exchange in the absence of an underlying diagnosis may cause a detrimental delay in appropriate medical therapy. The American Society of Apheresis has published guidelines for the use of TPE for several distinct conditions associated with TMA. This list is not comprehensive and the use of TPE for other causes of TMA may be considered if the mechanism of the underlying disease process provides a clear rationale for this intervention.

### Hemolytic uremic syndrome revisited: Shiga toxin, factor H, and fibrin generation [^116e6Fs8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. These features reflect the underlying histopathologic lesion: fibrin-rich thrombi that predominate in the renal microvasculature. HUS most commonly affects children younger than 5 years and is associated with Shiga toxin-producing enteric bacteria, the most important of which is Escherichia coli O157:H7. In this setting, HUS is epidemic and also might affect adults, particularly elderly people. Sporadic cases of HUS more commonly occur in adults and are associated with a wide variety of inciting agents and conditions. Although the disease manifestations might be similar and endothelial activation or injury likely represents a common etiologic event, differing responses to therapy suggest different pathogenic mechanisms. As more is understood about the underlying pathogenesis of the diseases that we now lump together as HUS, more efficacious and rational treatment and prevention strategies are likely to follow.

### Expert statements on the standard of care in critically ill adult patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^113CBWet]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

A typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) presents similarly to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and other causes or conditions with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or sepsis. Similarity in clinical presentation may hinder diagnosis and optimal treatment selection in the urgent setting in the ICU. However, there is currently no consensus on the diagnosis or treatment of aHUS for ICU specialists. This review aims to summarize available data on the diagnosis and treatment strategies of aHUS in the ICU to enhance the understanding of aHUS diagnosis and outcomes in patients managed in the ICU. To this end, a review of the recent literature (January 2009-March 2016) was performed to select the most relevant articles for ICU physicians. Based on the paucity of adult aHUS cases overall and within the ICU, no specific recommendations could be formally graded for the critical care setting. However, we recognize a core set of skills required by intensivists for diagnosing and managing patients with aHUS: recognizing thrombotic microangiopathies, differentiating aHUS from related conditions, recognizing involvement of other organ systems, understanding the pathophysiology of aHUS, knowing the diagnostic workup and relevant outcomes in critically ill patients with aHUS, and knowing the standard of care for patients with aHUS based on available data and guidelines. In conclusion, managing critically ill patients with aHUS requires basic skills that, in the absence of sufficient data from patients treated within the ICU, can be gleaned from an increasingly relevant literature outside the ICU. More data on critically ill patients with aHUS are needed to validate these conclusions within the ICU setting.

### Haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^111PXd8n]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that result in a common pathology, thrombotic microangiopathy, which is classically characterised by the triad of non-immune microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. In this Seminar, different causes of HUS are discussed, the most common being Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli HUS. Identifying the underlying thrombotic microangiopathy trigger can be challenging but is imperative if patients are to receive personalised disease-specific treatment. The quintessential example is complement-mediated HUS, which once carried an extremely high mortality but is now treated with anti-complement therapies with excellent long-term outcomes. Unfortunately, the high cost of anti-complement therapies all but precludes their use in low-income countries. For many other forms of HUS, targeted therapies are yet to be identified.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy: focus on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^116ESTBV]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) have evolved from rare, fulminant childhood afflictions to uncommon diseases with acute and chronic phases involving both children and adults. Breakthroughs in complement and coagulation regulation have allowed redefinition of specific entities despite substantial phenotypic mimicry. Reconciliation of phenotypes and delivery of life saving therapies require a multidisciplinary team of experts. The purpose of this review is to describe advances in the molecular pathophysiology of aHUS and to share the 2014 experience of the multidisciplinary Johns Hopkins TMA Registry in applying diagnostic assays, reporting disease associations, and genetic testing.

### HUS and the case for complement [^112uiNCZ]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy that is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Excess complement activation underlies atypical HUS and is evident in Shiga toxin-induced HUS (STEC-HUS). This Spotlight focuses on new knowledge of the role of Escherichia coli-derived toxins and polyphosphate in modulating complement and coagulation, and how they affect disease progression and response to treatment. Such new insights may impact on current and future choices of therapies for STEC-HUS.

### Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^117JS7Ef]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The Haemolytic Uremic Syndromes (HUS) are a heterogeneous group of conditions with differing underlying pathophysiology. These all result in the pathological features of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) which causes endothelial damage and organ injury. TMAs manifest with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and commonly acute kidney injury. The past two decades have revealed many of the immunological, metabolic, ribosomal, cell signalling and clotting pathways responsible for disease. The understanding of the role of membrane attack complex in some TMAs led to the introduction of pharmacological inhibition of Complement C5, which greatly improved prognosis. This review summaries our current understanding of the pathogenesis of complement dependent and non-complement dependent TMAs.

### How to evaluate and treat the spectrum of TMA syndromes in pregnancy [^112yLrdK]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is the broad definition for thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and end-organ damage. Two important categories are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and complement-mediated hemolytic-uremic syndrome (CM-HUS). Pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period are associated with TMAs specific to pregnancy in rare situations. These include pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. TTP and CM-HUS may present in pregnancy. However, the diagnosis may not be immediately obvious as they share characteristics of pregnancy-related TMAs. Within this review, we discuss investigations, differential diagnosis of TMAs in pregnancy, and management. The importance is a risk of maternal mortality but also poor fetal outcomes in relation to TTP and CM-HUS. Treatment of these disorders at presentation in pregnancy is discussed to achieve remission and prolong fetal viability if possible. In subsequent pregnancies, a treatment pathway is presented that has been associated with successful maternal and fetal outcomes. Critical to this is a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, the fetal medicine unit, and neonatologists.

### Transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy: twenty-two years later [^113VW6At]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

A syndrome of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal dysfunction and neurological abnormalities was first noted in bone marrow transplant recipients 22 years ago. Now known as transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) to distinguish it from other thrombotic microangiopathies, this disorder responds poorly to conventional treatments for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this review, we discuss the incidence and risk factors for TA-TMA and describe a pathophysiologic model of the disorder based on results obtained from laboratory models of the thrombotic microangiopathies. We conclude by suggesting possible approaches to the early diagnosis and treatment of TA-TMA based on this model that may warrant testing in future clinical trials.

### Etiology and outcomes of thrombotic microangiopathies [^114qXkMx]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Thrombotic microangiopathies constitute a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Secondary thrombotic microangiopathies are less characterized than primary thrombotic microangiopathies (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome). The relative frequencies and outcomes of secondary and primary thrombotic microangiopathies are unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a retrospective study in a four-hospital institution in 564 consecutive patients with adjudicated thrombotic microangiopathies during the 2009–2016 period. We estimated the incidence of primary and secondary thrombotic microangiopathies, thrombotic microangiopathy causes, and major outcomes during hospitalization (death, dialysis, major cardiovascular events [acute coronary syndrome and/or acute heart failure], and neurologic complications [stroke, cognitive impairment, or epilepsy]).

Results

We identified primary thrombotic microangiopathies in 33 of 564 patients (6%; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: 18 of 564 [3%]; atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome: 18 of 564 [3%]). Secondary thrombotic microangiopathies were found in 531 of 564 patients (94%). A cause was identified in 500 of 564 (94%): pregnancy (35%; 11 of 1000 pregnancies), malignancies (19%), infections (33%), drugs (26%), transplantations (17%), autoimmune diseases (9%), shiga toxin due to Escherichia coli (6%), and malignant hypertension (4%). In the 31 of 531 patients (6%) with other secondary thrombotic microangiopathies, 23% of patients had sickle cell disease, 10% had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and 44% had folate deficiency. Multiple causes of thrombotic microangiopathies were more frequent in secondary than primary thrombotic microangiopathies (57% versus 19%; P < 0.001), and they were mostly infections, drugs, transplantation, and malignancies. Significant differences in clinical and biologic differences were observed among thrombotic microangiopathy causes. During the hospitalization, 84 of 564 patients (15%) were treated with dialysis, 64 of 564 patients (11%) experienced major cardiovascular events, and 25 of 564 patients (4%) had neurologic complications; 58 of 564 patients (10%) died, but the rates of complications and death varied widely by the cause of thrombotic microangiopathies.

Conclusions

Secondary thrombotic microangiopathies represent the majority of thrombotic microangiopathies. Multiple thrombotic microangiopathies causes are present in one half of secondary thrombotic microangiopathies. The risks of dialysis, neurologic and cardiac complications, and death vary by the cause of thrombotic microangiopathies.

### Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: beyond hemolysis and uremia [^114g7HgW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome commonly presents with the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal function impairment without an antecedent hemorrhagic diarrhea. Less known are extrarenal complications due to abnormal vascular permeability, although these are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for the patients. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that the disease may present with hypertension or renal function impairment with no or mild thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Awareness of the full spectrum of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome may facilitate its diagnosis and treatment before serious complications or death occurs.

### Ten tips for managing complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathies (formerly atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome): narrative review [^112gtGd6]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are a group of clinical disorders characterized by the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and multisystem organ damage. These conditions encompass various entities, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) secondary to infections (often associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli [STEC] infection), and atypical HUS, now referred to as complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (CM-TMA).

In recent years, advances in understanding the complement system, along with improvements in genetic diagnostic techniques and the development of novel therapeutic agents for TMA, have significantly enhanced the knowledge and management of these complex diseases.

### The role of complement in autoimmune disease-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and the potential for therapeutics [^112jWtPc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The complement system is a tightly regulated, cascading protein network representing a key component linking the innate and humoral immune systems. However, if misdirected or dysregulated, it can be similarly damaging to host-tissue. The role of complement dysregulation on vascular endothelial cells has been well established in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and target organ injury. Yet, a great deal of complexity exists around the role of complement in TMA associated with other diseases. A further complicating factor is the cross-talk between complement, neutrophils, and coagulation pathways in the pathophysiology of TMA. Advancements in the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of aHUS paved the way for the successful development of anticomplement therapies (complement C5 inhibitors), which have revolutionized the treatment of aHUS. Therefore, a clearer understanding of the role of the complement system in TMA associated with other conditions will help to identify patients who would benefit from these therapies. This review aims to provide an assessment of the nature and extent of complement involvement in TMA associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and scleroderma renal crisis. Defining the role of complement in TMA in these conditions will help to guide timely diagnosis and management.

### Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^114C8Zbv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare life-threatening disease of unregulated complement activation. Untreated, the prognosis is generally poor; more than one-half of patients die or develop end-stage renal disease within 1 year. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy with evidence of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. This systemic disease affects the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and skin. Acquired and genetic abnormalities of complement regulation may be identified in approximately 70% of patients. Plasma therapy is generally ineffective. Eculizumab blocks terminal complement activation, prevents complement-mediated organ damage, and is currently recommended as front-line therapy.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy: current knowledge and outcomes with plasma exchange [^114vZNrX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

The classification of thrombotic microangiopathy has evolved and expanded due to treatment and mechanistic advances. The two basic clinical forms of thrombotic microangiopathy (excluding disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) encompass a wide range of primary and secondary forms. The advent of plasma therapy and the identification of an inhibitor to ADAMTS13 in the idiopathic or acute forms of TTP and its absence in diarrheal HUS have had a major impact on our current classification of thrombotic microangiopathy. In adults, the difficulty of differentiating TTP, which is much more common than HUS and the need for a speedy diagnosis to provide life-saving plasma therapy has resulted in the term TTP/HUS for adult forms of thrombotic microangiopathy that present with unexplained thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without a DIC. In this adult population a primary idiopathic and hereditary form as well as eight known secondary categories or clinical forms of TTP/HUS have been identified. HUS also embraces a primary (atypical HUS) and secondary forms (majority, diarrheal HUS secondary to Escherichia coli 0157:H7). In children, who present with HUS with no preceding history of diarrhea, plasma therapy is also offered on an urgent basis and studies are carried out to determine if they are suffering an abnormality in complement activation that may require eculizumab therapy. The advent of plasma therapy in the treatment of thrombotic microangiopathy has led to a clearer understanding of the role of ADAMTS13, both short- and long-term outcomes and the need for future surveillance and intervention.

### Pathology consultation on the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) [^115LjJm6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pathologists specializing in transfusion medicine, apheresis medicine, and/or coagulation are often consulted by clinicians to reach a diagnosis for patients with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), so that disease-specific, often life-saving therapy can be initiated as promptly as possible.

Methods

This article describes how to proceed when treating a patient with TMA. The differential diagnosis is broad and potentially very challenging. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are three such TMAs that require timely diagnosis and treatment.

Results

TTP is treated with daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and commonly with adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy, while aHUS may initially be managed with TPE but is best controlled with eculizumab once a presumptive diagnosis is made. TPE has no proven role in typical HUS, which is most commonly treated with supportive measures only.

Conclusions

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of TMA subtypes optimizes treatment and improves patient outcomes.

### Pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome [^114wbLfT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies are rare disorders characterized by the concomitant occurrence of severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and a variable degree of ischemic end-organ damage. The latter particularly affects the brain, the heart, and the kidneys. The primary forms, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), although their clinical presentations often overlap, have distinctive pathophysiologies. TTP is the consequence of a severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency, either immune-mediated as a result of circulating autoantibodies, or caused by mutations in ADAMTS-13. HUS develops following an infection with Shiga-toxin producing bacteria, or as the result of excessive activation of the alternative pathway of the complement system because of mutations in genes encoding complement system proteins.

### Attending rounds: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with renal insufficiency [^116zYJ7n]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The classification of thrombotic microangiopathy has evolved and expanded due to treatment and advances in understanding of the diseases associated with this clinical presentation. The three clinical forms of thrombotic microangiopathy-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation-encompass a wide range of disorders that can be classified as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to another identifiable disease or clinical context. Identification of an inhibitor to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) in the idiopathic and acute forms of TTP, recognition of the absence of ADAMTS13 inhibition in diarrheal HUS, identification of complement abnormalities in atypical HUS, and a better understanding of the role of plasma therapy, rituximab, and eculizumab therapy have all had a major effect on current understanding of the thrombotic microangiopathies. In this Attending Rounds, a patient with a thrombotic microangiopathy is presented, along with discussion highlighting the difficulty of differentiating TTP from HUS and disseminated intravascular coagulation, the need for a prompt diagnosis, and the role for plasma therapy in appropriately selected patients. The discussion attempts to provide a simple clinical approach to the diagnosis, treatment options, and future course of adults and children suffering from a thrombotic microangiopathy.

### The conundrum of postpartum thrombotic microangiopathy: case report and considerations for management [^116FbXGC]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias and thrombocytopenias in pregnant or postpartum women constitute an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the evaluation of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), where urgent care must be considered.

Case presentation

We here report the case of a 21-year-old Somali woman, who was delivered by emergency caesarean section at 35 weeks of gestational age with acute dyspnea, placental abruption and gross edema due to severe preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome. After delivery, she developed acute kidney failure and thrombotic microangiopathy as revealed by kidney biopsy. The lack of early response to plasma exchange prompted extensive laboratory workup. Ultimately, the patient completely recovered with negative fluid balance and control of severe hypertension.

Conclusions

This case report emphasizes the importance to differentiate between primary TMA syndromes and microangiopathic hemolytic anemias due to systemic disorders. Delayed recovery from preeclampsia/HELLP syndrome and malignant hypertension can clinically mimic primary TMA syndromes in the postpartum period.

### Early differentiation of Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome in critically ill adults with thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes [^115vA8Ud]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes are a heterogeneous group of severe diseases that often require ICU admission. Prompt initiation of targeted therapies is required for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, whereas there is no specific consensus therapy for Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome. We sought to compare the characteristics of Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients at admission in the ICU to allow early differentiation of Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome from other thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes and help to tailor initial treatment.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Two ICUs part of the French reference center for thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes.

Patients

Adult patients presenting with features of thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes. Other causes than Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were excluded.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

From September 2003 to January 2017, 236 thrombotic microangiopathy syndrome patients were admitted, including 12 Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, 21 atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and 91 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome patients were older than other thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes patients (64 yr [interquartile range, 50–72 yr] vs 42 yr [31–54 yr]; p = 0.007) and presented with more frequent digestive symptoms (92% vs 42%; p < 0.001), especially nonbloody diarrhea and vomiting. Biologically, Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome patients displayed higher fibrinogen (490mg/dL [460-540mg/dL] vs 320mg/dL [240-410mg/dL]; p = 0.003) and creatinine levels (2.59mg/dL [2.12–3.42mg/dL] vs 1.26mg/dL [0.61–1.90mg/dL]; p < 0.001), and less marked anemia (hemoglobin level, 9.7g/dL [8.7–11.9g/dL] vs 7.7g/dL [6.3–9.1g/dL]; p < 0.001). Forty-two percent (n = 5) required renal replacement therapy, and 83% (n = 10) were treated with plasma exchange before the distinction from other thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes could be made.

Conclusions

Adult Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome patients are older, present more frequently with digestive symptoms and display higher hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels than other thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes. However, overlap across the three thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes remains substantial, putting forward the need to implement early plasma therapy until thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome can be ruled out.

### TTP and ADAMTS13: when is testing appropriate? [^114KctnU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The last 10 years witnessed the publication of many studies on the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure. The most important finding was the identification of a novel metalloprotease, named ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motives), that is involved in the regulation of the size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a major modulator of platelet adhesion and aggregation in the microcirculation. Inherited or acquired deficiencies of ADAMTS13 impair VWF cleavage, leading in turn to the disseminated formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the micro-circulation and to symptoms of end-organ ischemia. By measuring ADAMTS13 in plasma, it has been clearly shown that patients with inherited TTP have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, patients with acquired TTP present with clinical and laboratory heterogeneity, and there are unequivocal cases of acquired TTP with measurable plasma levels of ADAMTS13. This heterogeneity poses a challenge for understanding the pathogenesis of TTP and selecting appropriate therapies.

### Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients: approach to the patient with thrombotic microangiopathy [^113HWUPZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), specifically, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (CM-HUS) are acute life-threatening disorders that require prompt consideration, diagnosis, and treatment to improve the high inherent mortality and morbidity. Presentation is with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia (MAHAT) and variable organ symptoms resulting from microvascular thrombi. Neurological and cardiac involvement is most common in TTP and associated with poorer prognosis and primarily renal involvement in CM-HUS. TTP is confirmed by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (which can be undertaken in real time) and CM-HUS by an abnormality in complement regulators, confirmed by mutational analysis (in 60% to 70% of cases) or the presence of Factor H antibodies (which may not be available for weeks or months). Plasma exchange (PEX) should be started as soon as possible following consideration of these TMAs. Differentiation of the diagnosis requires specific treatment pathways thereafter (immunosuppression primarily for TTP and complement inhibitor therapy for CM-HUS). As the diagnosis is based on MAHAT, there are a number of other medical situations that need to be excluded and these are discussed within the article. Other differentials presenting as TMAs may also be associated with micro- or macrovascular thrombosis, yet are more likely to be due to direct endothelial damage, many of which do not have a clear therapeutic benefit with PEX.

The role of the terminal complement pathway as the cause of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is widely recognized, but the relative contribution of the effectors C5a/C5aR1 and C5b-9 to disease pathogenesis has not been defined. Using FH R/R mice carrying a factor H mutation that causes cell surface complement alternative pathway dysregulation, Ueda documented that in FH R/R mice, C5b-9 causes renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) whereas C5a/C5aR drives macrovascular thrombosis. This commentary addresses the implications and limitations of this study.

### Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^115eaSeZ]. Seminars in Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome:

- **Definition**: aHUS is a complement-mediated disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.
- **Pathophysiology**: aHUS is most commonly caused by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway.
- **Disease course**: The failure of complement regulation results in aHUS, which presents with clinical manifestations of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. Extra-renal manifestations include altered consciousness, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, prodromic diarrhea, hypertension, and malaise. Disease progression may lead to ESRD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: aHUS is associated with an overall mortality rate of 25%.

1. Evolution of nomenclature

The current nomenclature has evolved significantly as the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of thrombotic microangiopathies has deepened. The term HUS was traditionally classified into two entities:

"Typical" HUS or STEC-HUS

This term refers to the condition that predominantly affects children under five years, typically presenting bloody diarrhea after the first days of exposure to STEC. Shiga toxin induces endothelial damage, leading to the manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy. Approximately 5% of cases are associated with invasive pneumococcal disease. Management is primarily supportive, ensuring adequate hydration, blood pressure control, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and transfusion of hemocomponents. Renal replacement therapy is required in up to 45% of cases and is associated with a 3–4% mortality rate during the acute phase. Long-term follow-up reveals evidence of chronic kidney damage in up to one-third of patients.

Typical HUS can also affect adults, particularly in the context of outbreaks of foodborne poisoning, such as the one that occurred in Germany in 2011 due to an unusual Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain.

CM-TMA (formerly atypical HUS)

This term initially referred to TMA manifestations not preceded by diarrhea, typically occurring in older patients (adolescents or young adults). In some cases, there was history of prior TMA episodes or a family history of TMA. It was later identified as a condition mediated by uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to the formation of membrane attack complexes (C5b-9) that damage vascular endothelium. Unlike typical HUS, this form has a severe clinical course, with a high rate of progression to kidney failure and mortality if not treated promptly.

With the growing understanding of the mechanisms underlying alternative complement pathway dysfunction, the need for more precise terminology emerged. New expert consensus has highlighted the importance of renaming atypical HUS to CM-TMA to specifically describe forms of TMA in which complement dysfunction is the primary pathogenic factor. This updated nomenclature is expected to optimize clinical research and therapeutic management, allowing for a more targeted approach, particularly with C5 inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION: THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY (TMA) IN ATYPICAL HAEMOLYTIC URAEMIC SYNDROME (aHUS) AND BEYOND

TMA describes a pattern of endothelial injury characterized by pathological alterations within the walls of arterioles and capillaries leading to microvascular thrombosis. In clinical practice, TMA is often associated with the triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and ischaemic organ injury involving the kidneys or virtually any other organ. TMA may also present as a progressive and isolated increase in serum creatinine in the absence of haematological manifestations, and a kidney biopsy may be required for the diagnosis. The presence of TMA lesions on the kidney biopsy without haematological manifestations is referred to as 'kidney-limited TMA'.

Conditions causing TMA encompass a wide spectrum of diseases and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms has led to a pathophysiology-based classification of TMA. The current classification includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, due to either immune or inherited deficiency in a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13); Shiga toxin–producing E. coli –associated HUS; secondary TMA; and primary aHUS/complement-mediated TMA (hereafter referred to as aHUS), which remains a clinical diagnosis by exclusion of other aetiologies. Despite the significant advances associated with such classification, the current terminology of atypical, primary and secondary HUS is confusing and efforts are being made to propose an updated nomenclature of TMA.

aHUS has become a hallmark of complement-mediated diseases and a model for precision medicine, where uncovering the pivotal role of the complement system has driven the development of targeted therapies, significantly enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life. The complement system is a crucial component of the innate immune response, facilitating pathogen elimination through opsonization, inflammation and direct cell lysis. It can be activated via three distinct pathways (classical, lectin and alternative), all of which converge at the formation of C3 convertase. This enzyme cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b, initiating key effector functions: C3a acts as an anaphylatoxin, enhancing inflammation by recruiting and activating immune cells, while C3b promotes opsonization and activates the terminal complement pathway, culminating in assembly of the membrane attack complex and subsequent lysis of the target pathogen. Tight regulation of complement activity is essential to prevent unintended injury to host tissues. This regulation is maintained by both soluble and membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins, including factor H, factor I and membrane cofactor protein.

### None of the above: thrombotic microangiopathy beyond TTP and HUS [^114qhRB8]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are appropriately at the top of a clinician's differential when a patient presents with a clinical picture consistent with an acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, there are several additional diagnoses that should be considered in patients presenting with an acute TMA, especially in patients with nondeficient ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity (> 10%). An increased awareness of drug-induced TMA is also essential because the key to their diagnosis more often is an appropriately detailed medical history to inquire about potential exposures. Widespread inflammation and endothelial damage are central in the pathogenesis of the TMA, with the treatment directed at the underlying disease if possible. TMA presentations in the critically ill, drug-induced TMA, cancer-associated TMA, and hematopoietic transplant-associated TMA (TA-TMA) and their specific treatment, where applicable, will be discussed in this manuscript. A complete assessment of all the potential etiologies for the TMA findings including acquired TTP will allow for a more accurate diagnosis and prevent prolonged or inappropriate treatment with plasma exchange therapy when it is less likely to be successful.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy multidisciplinary assessment team: demographics, final diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^11544u2h]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of etiologically disparate diseases that appear similar clinically. However, they may involve various degrees of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and acute kidney injury (AKI) of varying severity. These may occur in the context of a genetic predisposition, a mix of genetic and environmental factors, or due to purely environmental triggers. Triggers are extremely varied and underlying them often are disorders in coagulation proteins, genetic mutations in complement proteins, auto antibodies affecting various coagulation/complement cascades, overwhelming adaptive immunity activation, inborn errors of metabolism amongst other complex pathologies.

A complex group of diseases such as these require multiple disciplines and a team effort from equally diverse specialists. The needed expertise may include hematologists, transplant nephrologists, transplant hematologists, nephrologists, pharmacists, administrators, health care executives, rheumatologists, maternal-fetal medicine (obstetrical) specialists, and infectious disease experts. Within our institution at the University of California Irvine (UCI), the TMA team consisted of nephrology, benign hematology, transplant hematology, transfusion medicine, internal medicine, rheumatology, and a pharmacy liaison. Due to the high cost of the therapy, processes were in place to assist with the approval, authorization, and acquisition of the medication. This team was built from an already active publishing faculty from UCI with an ongoing interest in TMA diagnosis and treatment. A group of interested medical students, residents, interested fellows were also utilized to collate research results for dissemination and publication, led by the lead author and overseen by the senior author.

Rationale & objective

Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMAs) include an etiological diverse group of phenotypically similar disorders. While individually rare, they are seen as an aggregate with regularity. Prior reports suggested the importance of approaching TMAs in a multidisciplinary fashion. We present the development and data over a 4-year period after establishing the University of California Irvine (UCI) TMA team.

Design, settings, participants, and measurements

This is a single-center retrospective case observational study of 101 diverse patients demonstrating demographics, diagnoses, triggers, treatments applied, and outcomes representing a wide range of hematologic pathologies.

Findings

Of the 101 patients, 47 were females with an age range between 18 and 83 years old. 46 of our 101 patients were diagnosed with TMA. 24 patients were diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Eight patients were diagnosed with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant TMA (HSCT-TMA). Of the 24 aHUS patients, 16 were treated and 8 were evaluated for complement blockade. Of those treated, 100% demonstrated a hematologic response, 81.3% had initial renal remission and 68.8% of those who were on dialysis (11 of 16) remain off dialysis. Of the 8 HSCT-TMA patients, 5 were treated and 3 were evaluated for complement blockade. Of those treated, 80% demonstrated a hematologic response, 100% had initial renal remission; however, of all treated patients eventually returned to needing dialysis.

Limitations and conclusions

This observational study highlights the importance of the TMA multidisciplinary team to improve diagnosis and optimize outcomes of this rare condition. Future research is needed to subdivide response to various TMA to current and emerging therapies in the context of multidisciplinary care.

Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) overview — Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a common and potentially severe complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which can occur in both pediatric and adult hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. TA-TMA is characterized by the development of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and end-organ damage. The primary driver of the disease is thought to be multiple hits to the endothelium, which result in inappropriate immune and complement activation, inducing a negative feedback loop that leads to more endothelial damage and activation.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) comprise a spectrum of clinical conditions sharing common pathological features of microvascular thrombosis leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and end-organ damage. Although rare, they constitute an important cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The two classic forms - thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) - have become increasingly recognized as part of a broader syndrome with diverse etiologies.

While primary TMA syndromes, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and complement-mediated TMA (formerly referred to as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, aHUS), have been extensively studied in Western populations, secondary forms associated with malignant hypertension, pregnancy, medications, or autoimmune diseases remain less characterized, particularly in North African populations.

Recent advances in complement genetics and targeted therapies (e.g. eculizumab) have revolutionized TMA management, yet access to these treatments remains limited in resource-constrained settings.

This study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, biological, and histological characteristics of TMA in a Tunisian cohort, with particular focus on etiological distribution and long-term renal outcomes.

Thrombocytopenia, strictly defined as a platelet count less than 150,000, is common in the emergency department. Recognition, diagnostic investigation, and proper disposition of a thrombocytopenic patient are imperative. One group of disorders leading to thrombocytopenia is the thrombotic microangiopathies, hallmarked by platelet destruction. These thrombotic microangiopathies include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, low platelet count (HELLP), which should be distinguished from similar disease processes such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In this article, clinical presentations, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, management plans, complications, and dispositions are addressed for this complex group of platelet disorders.

Since the last review in 2007 of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the Clinics, further understanding of the nature of TTP and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has led to increasing use of rituximab in the treatment of TTP and the approval in 2011 of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS. With this new armamentarium, distinction of aHUS from TTP has become more critical than ever. This article updates the new knowledge, highlights the difference between aHUS and TTP, and presents a scheme for their diagnosis and management.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare but important finding in the context of organ transplantation. Acute renal insufficiency in the setting of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, a triad that constitutes 'hemolytic uremic syndrome', can be associated with, or triggered by, conditions such as verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli, viral infections, malignant hypertension, scleroderma, allograft rejection, lupus erythematosus, pregnancy, and medications including mitomycin C, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral contraceptives. After renal transplantation, it can occur, as either a de novo episode, or recurrent disease. Calcineurin inhibitors have long been associated with post-transplantation thrombotic microangiopathy. Sirolimus has been used as a primary immunosuppressant in patients transplanted with a history of earlier hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and also as rescue therapy in patients with calcineurin-inhibitor-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. We describe four cases where there was significant thrombotic microangiopathy in the context of contemporaneous or contiguous calcineurin inhibitor and sirolimus usage. As the intrarenal cyclosporin concentration is thought to be significantly elevated when cyclosporin and sirolimus are used together, this may explain these findings, and mandates caution in their co-administration.

### Advances in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^112gNMRE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are both characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolysis, and organ dysfunction. Other disorders occasionally present with similar manifestations. Recent studies have demonstrated that deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13, due to genetic mutations or autoimmune inhibitors, causes TTP. Molecular cloning of ADAMTS13 elucidates the structure of the protease, raising the prospect for advances in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Assay of ADAMTS13 activity distinguishes TTP from HUS and other types of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA); therefore, the term TTP/HUS should be avoided because it obscures the known or potential differences among the various types of TMA.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy: new insights [^112fRmcD]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the following study new aspects and insights into the epidemiology, pathogenesis and typical morphology of kidney involvement in thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) are discussed. TMA comprises a spectrum of microvascular thrombosis syndromes associated with multiple pathogenetic factors, that is, typical and atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), malignant hypertension, drugs or systemic autoimmune diseases or antibody-mediated rejection.

Recent Findings

The present article will put particular emphasis on new pathophysiological insights into the development of TMA in the various settings. In addition, new options in the therapeutic management of TMA in atypical HUS are discussed. The pathogenesis of TMA in atypical HUS primarily involves hereditary or acquired deficiencies and disturbances of the complement system. Eculizumab is a promising new therapeutic option that has been discovered recently.

Summary

In HUS/TTP the kidney shows characteristic vascular changes due to endothelial damage, that is, TMA, which should be clinically and morphologically differentiated from other diseases. Recent genetic and molecular studies have shed more light on the pathogenesis of TMA in atypical HUS, that is, disturbances of various aspects of the complement system, and in TTP, that is, von Willebrand factor regulation by ADAMTS13, which are also helpful in the differential diagnosis.

### The role of ADAMTS13 testing in the diagnosis and management of thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombosis [^111tQekn]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 13) is a metalloprotease responsible for cleavage of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers. Severely deficient activity of the protease can trigger an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Our understanding of the pathophysiology of TTP has allowed us to grasp the important role of ADAMTS13 in other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) and thrombotic disorders, such as ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease. Through its action on VWF, ADAMTS13 can have prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties, not only when its activity is severely deficient, but also when it is only moderately low. Here, we will discuss the biology of ADAMTS13 and the different assays developed to evaluate its function in the context of TTP, in the acute setting and during follow-up. We will also discuss the latest evidence regarding the role of ADAMTS13 in other TMAs, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. This information will be useful for clinicians not only when evaluating patients who present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, but also when making clinical decisions regarding the follow-up of patients with TTP.

### Medical consult: aHUS, TTP? How to distinguish and what to do [^116WjaiV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) caused by an autoantibody-mediated deficiency of ADAMTS13 and atypical hemolytic syndrome (aHUS) caused by alternative complement dysregulation are the most common primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). The evaluation of a patient with TMA is a medical emergency since it is critical to quickly distinguish iTTP and aHUS from other causes of TMA. Untreated iTTP is rapidly fatal, and delays in initiating complement inhibition in aHUS increase the risk of irreversible renal failure. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% is diagnostic of iTTP in the appropriate clinical setting. In settings where rapid-turnaround ADAMTS13 testing is not available, clinical features and clinical prediction tools are useful to identify patients who should receive emergent plasma exchange. We present an evidence-based approach to the initial (first 24 hours) diagnosis and management of iTTP and review the clinical and laboratory features that can be used to identify patients with aHUS who will benefit from early C5 blockade. We also discuss the potential use of complement blockade to improve outcomes in selected patients with secondary TMA.

### Cancer and thrombotic microangiopathy | JCO oncology practice… [^111rZg3Y]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Thrombotic Microangiopathy Thrombotic microangiopathy is a general term that describes the clinical features of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, in conjunction with a raised lactate dehydrogenase level, reticulocytosis, and often hyperbilirubinemia. Clinical features can be variable and will in part depend on the underlying final diagnosis. These are also often associated with severely reduced ADAMTS13 levels and require treatment of the underlying TTP as well as the precipitating cause. More recently, diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome has become relevant, 3with the availability of and success in response to complement inhibition. 4Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is also a clinical diagnosis, requiring exclusion of other causes of TMA, such as autoimmune disease or malignant hypertension, and ADAMTS13 levels that are not severely reduced, typically between 30% and the normal range.

One of the largest reviews of cancer-associated microangiopathy confirms a majority of cases are solid cancers, but hematologic cancers such as lymphoma make up approximately 8% of all cases. Within solid cancers, gastric, lung, breast, and prostate cancers, primarily adenocarcinoma, were the most likely diagnoses. Respiratory symptoms were again more commonly highlighted, but an increase in disseminated intravascular coagulation was noted. Treatment with antitumor therapy was associated with improved survival and confirmed there was no role for plasma therapy. 5 Morton and George 1present a comprehensive review of cases, their experience from the Oklahoma registry, and a review of the literature on cancer-associated TMA. Presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur in one of three scenarios: de novo as TMA; in patients with known cancer, typically metastatic disease; or as a result of therapies to treat cancer.

In conclusion, cancer-associated TMA is not a common presentation of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Early diagnosis and differentiation from TTP or atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome help avoid unwarranted plasma exchange or immune-modulating therapies.

### Clinical features of anti-factor H autoantibody-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome [^112a4Wh8]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare form of thrombotic microangiopathy that associates, in 70% of cases, with genetic or acquired disorders leading to dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement. Autoantibody directed against Factor H causes at least 6% to 10% of aHUS cases, but only a few clinical reports are available. Here, we describe the clinical, biologic, genetic features, treatment, and outcome of 45 patients who presented with aHUS associated with anti-FH autoantibody. We found that this form of aHUS primarily affects children between 9 and 13 years old but it also affects adults. It presents with a high frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and with extrarenal complications and has a relapsing course. Activation of the alternative pathway of complement at the onset of disease portends a poor prognosis. Early specific treatment may lead to favorable outcomes. These data should improve the recognition and diagnosis of this form of aHUS and help identify patients at high risk of a poor outcome.

### Treatment and management of children with haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^112JWAgW]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), comprising microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute kidney injury, remains the leading cause of paediatric intrinsic acute kidney injury, with peak incidence in children aged under 5 years. HUS most commonly occurs following infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS). Additionally, HUS can occur as a result of inherited or acquired dysregulation of the alternative complement cascade (atypical HUS or aHUS) and in the setting of invasive pneumococcal infection. The field of HUS has been transformed by the discovery of the central role of complement in aHUS and the dawn of therapeutic complement inhibition. Herein, we address these three major forms of HUS in children, review the latest evidence for their treatment and discuss the management of STEC infection from presentation with bloody diarrhoea, through to development of fulminant HUS.

### Complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathies [^117TXuN4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy caused by dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. There is evidence showing complement activation in other thrombotic microangiopathies. The aim of this study was to evaluate complement activation in different thrombotic microangiopathies and to monitor treatment response.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Complement activation was assessed by exposing endothelial cells to sera or activated-patient plasma-citrated plasma mixed with a control sera pool (1:1)-to analyze C5b-9 deposits by immunofluorescence. Patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (n = 34) at different stages of the disease, HELLP syndrome (a pregnancy complication characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) or severe preeclampsia (n = 10), and malignant hypertension (n = 5) were included.

Results

Acute phase atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-activated plasma induced an increased C5b-9 deposition on endothelial cells. Standard and lower doses of eculizumab inhibited C5b-9 deposition in all patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, except in two who showed partial remission and clinical relapse. Significant fibrin formation was observed together with C5b-9 deposition. Results obtained using activated-plasma samples were more marked and reproducible than those obtained with sera. C5b-9 deposition was also increased with samples from patients with HELLP (all cases) and preeclampsia (90%) at disease onset. This increase was sustained in those with HELLP after 40 days, and levels normalized in patients with both HELLP and preeclampsia after 6–9 months. Complement activation in those with malignant hypertension was at control levels.

Conclusions

The proposed methodology identifies complement overactivation in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome at acute phase and in other diseases such as HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia. Moreover, it is sensitive enough to individually assess the efficiency of the C5 inhibition treatment.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^116F3Mgs]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Schistocytes are fragmented cells that result from intravascular destruction, which occurs in MAHA syndromes. Bite and blister cells result from partial phagocytosis, and occur in oxidative causes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 2 The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes of hemolytic anemia from nonimmune causes. 6, 7. The progression of the condition is typically gradual, and treatment involves removal of the offending agent. Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia MAHA is a descriptive term for hemolytic anemia that occurs when RBCs fragment, and results in schistocytes visible on the peripheral blood smear. This can be caused by trauma from an endovascular device or microthrombi. Thrombotic microangiopathies are a diverse group of clinical entities that share MAHA as a central feature.

16 A low lactate dehydrogenase–to–aspartate transaminase ratio can aid in distinguishing HELLP syndrome, because the rate of hemolysis is higher in the other TMAs and hepatic involvement is higher in HELLP syndrome. 17 Disseminated intravascular coagulation also can result in MAHA due to fibrin-rich microthrombi. Disseminated intravascular coagulation causes prolonged coagulation studies, positive d-dimer test results, and decreased fibrinogen levels.
18. DRUG-INDUCED THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY Drug-induced TMA occurs when a compound causes the formation of platelet microthrombi, resulting in MAHA through induced antibodies or direct toxicity. These antibodies interact strongly only in the presence of the drug. The clinical features are similar to those of other MAHA syndromes. In a 2015 review, the overall incidence of drug-induced TMA was 5% of all MAHA cases.

Oxidative Hemolytic Anemia Oxidative hemolysis occurs when normal processes are unable to reduce ferric iron, also known as methemoglobin, to ferrous iron, which carries oxygen. This results in methemoglobinemia, leading to premature RBC destruction by phagocytosis.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy in cancer [^111Bh5Fc]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is clinical syndrome based on the presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 K or a reduction of the platelet count by > 30% from baseline) accompanied by fragmentation hemolysis (MAHA) and evidence of organ damage. It can be seen in a variety of disorders including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), shigatoxin related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). Cancer itself has long been associated with both macro and microvascular thrombosis. In addition, treatment with chemotherapy as well as hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HCST) has been associated with atypical hemolytic uremic (aHUS) like syndrome. In this review, I will discuss the pathophysiology of TMA in cancer, chemotherapy associated HUS, and HSCT, well as new therapeutic interventions.

### HUS and atypical HUS [^112fkHrH]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by intravascular hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney failure. HUS is usually categorized as typical, caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection, as atypical HUS (aHUS), usually caused by uncontrolled complement activation, or as secondary HUS with a coexisting disease. In recent years, a general understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms driving HUS has increased. Typical HUS (ie, STEC-HUS) follows a gastrointestinal infection with STEC, whereas aHUS is associated primarily with mutations or autoantibodies leading to dysregulated complement activation. Among the 30% to 50% of patients with HUS who have no detectable complement defect, some have either impaired diacylglycerol kinase ε (DGKε) activity, cobalamin C deficiency, or plasminogen deficiency. Some have secondary HUS with a coexisting disease or trigger such as autoimmunity, transplantation, cancer, infection, certain cytotoxic drugs, or pregnancy. The common pathogenetic features in STEC-HUS, aHUS, and secondary HUS are simultaneous damage to endothelial cells, intravascular hemolysis, and activation of platelets leading to a procoagulative state, formation of microthrombi, and tissue damage. In this review, the differences and similarities in the pathogenesis of STEC-HUS, aHUS, and secondary HUS are discussed. Common for the pathogenesis seems to be the vicious cycle of complement activation, endothelial cell damage, platelet activation, and thrombosis. This process can be stopped by therapeutic complement inhibition in most patients with aHUS, but usually not those with a DGKε mutation, and some patients with STEC-HUS or secondary HUS. Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of the different forms of HUS may prove helpful in clinical practice.

5.14 Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) Including Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), have been reported in patients treated with ENVARSUS XR. TMA may have a multifactorial etiology. Risk factors for TMA that can occur in transplant patients include, for example, severe infections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) mismatch, the use of calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. These risk factors may, either alone or combined, contribute to the risk of TMA.

In patients with signs and symptoms of TMA, consider ENVARSUS XR as a risk factor. Concurrent use of ENVARSUS XR and mTOR inhibitors may contribute to the risk of TMA.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy and associated renal disorders [^115nDWbb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a pathological process involving thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and microvascular occlusion. TMA is common to haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) associated with shiga toxin or invasive pneumococcal infection, atypical HUS (aHUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and other disorders including malignant hypertension. HUS complicating infection with shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is a significant cause of acute renal failure in children worldwide, occurring sporadically or in epidemics. Studies in aHUS have revealed genetic and acquired factors leading to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway. TTP has been linked to reduced activity of the ADAMTS13 cleaving protease (typically with an autoantibody to ADAMTS13) with consequent disruption of von Willebrand factor multimer processing. However, the convergence of pathogenic pathways and clinical overlap create diagnostic uncertainty, especially at initial presentation. Furthermore, recent developments are challenging established management protocols. This review addresses the current understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying TMA, relating these to clinical presentation with an emphasis on renal manifestations. A diagnostic and therapeutic approach is presented, based on international guidelines, disease registries and published trials. Early treatment remains largely empirical, consisting of plasma replacement/exchange with the exception of childhood STEC-HUS or pneumococcal sepsis. Emerging therapies such as the complement C5 inhibitor eculizumab for aHUS and rituximab for TTP are discussed, as is renal transplantation for those patients who become dialysis-dependent as a result of aHUS.

### The role of ADAMTS-13 activity and complement mutational analysis in differentiating acute thrombotic microangiopathies [^113tVkiL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) that manifest with organ dysfunction or life threatening features requiring urgent recognition and treatment. Both present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, although the clinical course of the two diseases can be markedly different. Historically, ~60% of aHUS patients progressed to end‐stage renal failure (ESRF) 1, 2, whereas in TTP, neurological and cardiac features are often more prominent and severe renal dysfunction is rare.

Although it is known that aHUS and TTP are histologically distinct entities 3, diagnosis is often reliant on clinical features, such as the pattern of organ dysfunction and degree of thrombocytopenia. It has been suggested that a serum creatinine level of > 150 to 200 μmol L⁻¹ or a platelet count of > 30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ 'almost eliminates' a diagnosis of TTP 4. Because the two diseases have overlapping clinical features, however, there is inherent opportunity for misdiagnosis, and studies on TTP and aHUS have been open to diagnostic bias. The term 'TTP‐HUS' has been used historically to reflect the degree of diagnostic uncertainty.

The past decade has seen major advances in our knowledge of the molecular pathophysiology underlying both aHUS and TTP, accompanied by shifts in diagnostic testing and divergence of treatment algorithms for the two diseases. In aHUS, dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway leads to excessive activation of the terminal complement pathway, complement‐mediated endothelial cell damage, and subsequent glomerular microthrombi 2. Detectable complement abnormalities have been described in ~50% of patients, including loss of function mutations within membrane co‐factor protein (CD46), complement factor H (CFH) and factor I (CFI), and autoantibodies to the factor H (FH) and factor I (FI) proteins. Gain‐of‐function mutations have also been identified within complement factor B (CFB) and C3 5, 6, 7.

### Extracellular vesicles and renal endothelial cells: a fatal attraction in hemolytic uremic syndrome [^116Uup4B]. The American Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review focuses on typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening sequela of human infections caused, particularly in children, by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains. Thrombotic microangiopathy of the brain and the kidney is the end point of toxin action, resulting in the hallmarks of HUS (ie, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure). A growing body of evidence points to the role of extracellular vesicles released in the blood of patients by toxin-challenged circulating cells (monocytes, neutrophils, and erythrocytes) and platelets, as a key factor in the pathogenesis of HUS. This review provides i) an updated description of the pathogenesis of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infections; ii) an analysis of blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and of their parent cells, as triggering factors in HUS; and iii) a model explaining why Shiga toxin-containing vesicles dock preferentially to the endothelia of target organs.

### How I treat refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^113s7qG2]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) without an obvious cause, and may include fever, mild renal failure, and neurologic deficits. It is characterized by a deficiency of the von Willebrand factor (VWF) cleaving enzyme, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase, with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), resulting in formation of microthrombi in the high sheer environment of the microvasculature. This causes microvascular occlusion, MAHA, and organ ischemia. Diagnosis is based on the presence of clinical symptoms, laboratory aberrations consistent with MAHA, decreased ADAMTS13 activity, and possibly presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. Upfront treatment of acute TTP includes plasma exchange and corticosteroids. A significant number of patients are refractory to this treatment and will require further interventions. There are limited data and consensus on the management of the refractory TTP patient. Management involves simultaneously ruling out other causes of thrombocytopenia and MAHA, while also considering other treatments. In this article, we describe our management of the patient with refractory TTP, and discuss use of rituximab, increased plasma exchange, splenectomy, and immunosuppressive options, including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and cyclosporine. We also review recent evidence for the potential roles of bortezomib and N-acetylcysteine, and explore new therapeutic approaches, including recombinant ADAMTS13 and anti-VWF therapy.

### Hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children [^114dUkZv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by a triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney failure. Most cases are caused by Shiga-toxin-producing bacteria, especially Escherichia coli. Transmission occurs through ground beef and unpasteurized milk. STEC-HUS is the main cause of acute renal failure in children. Management remains supportive. Immediate outcome is most often. Atypical HUS represents about 5% of cases, has a relapsing course with more than half of the patients progressing to end-stage kidney failure. Most cases are due to variants in complement regulators of the alternative pathway. Complement inhibitors, such as eculizumab, have considerably improved the prognosis.

### Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients with cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^114auvxM]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

The unexpected occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, in a patient with cancer requires urgent diagnosis and appropriate management. TMA is a term used to describe multiple syndromes caused by microvascular thrombosis, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Shiga toxin–mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and complement-mediated TMA. In patients with cancer, systemic microvascular metastases and bone marrow involvement can cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. This occurs most often in patients with known metastatic cancer, but microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur unexpectedly in patients without known metastatic disease or be the presenting features of undiagnosed cancer. TMA may also be caused by commonly used chemotherapy agents, either through dose-dependent toxicity or an acute immune-mediated reaction.

These causes of TMA must be distinguished from TTP, which results from a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 and is the most common cause of TMA among adults without cancer. The importance of this distinction is to avoid inappropriate use of plasma exchange, which is associated with major complications. Plasma exchange is the essential treatment for TTP, but it has no known benefit for patients with cancer-induced or drug-induced TMA. We will describe cancer-induced and drug-induced TMA using the experience of the Oklahoma TTP–Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Registry and data from a systematic review of all published reports of drug-induced TMA. We will illustrate the principles of evaluation and management of these disorders with patients' stories.

### Spectrum and outcomes of thrombotic microangiopathies in nephrology: a 17-year cohort from a north African center [^112m4zXq]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are rare but life-threatening conditions characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and organ injury. They are encountered in nephrology due to their renal manifestations. Data from North African populations remain scarce.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational study over 17 years (2006–2023) in a nephrology department in Tunisia. We included 36 patients with confirmed TMA based on clinical and/or histological criteria. We analyzed demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, renal histology, etiologies, treatments, and outcomes.

Results

The mean age was 35.6 ± 11.3 years, and 55.6% were female. Hypertension was present in 83.3% of cases, and neurological symptoms in 66.7%. Acute kidney injury occurred in 80.6%, with stage 3 KDIGO in most cases. Etiologies were dominated by malignant hypertension (33.3%), pregnancy-related TMA (30.6%), drug-induced TMA (13.9%), and less commonly autoimmune, infectious, or atypical/typical hemolytic uremic syndromes. Renal biopsy, performed in 12 cases, revealed acute and chronic TMA lesions. Treatments included antihypertensive therapy (86.1%), plasma exchange (16.7%), corticosteroids (22.2%), and rituximab (2.7%). No patient received eculizumab. Renal recovery varied widely by etiology, with complete recovery in 90.9% of pregnancy-related cases and none in malignant hypertension. The overall rate of adverse outcomes (death or end stage renal disease (ESRD)) was 58.3%.

Conclusion

TMA is a heterogeneous condition with diverse etiologies and outcomes. Early etiological identification and tailored management are crucial to improving renal prognosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to targeted therapies is restricted.

### Isolated thrombotic microangiopathy of the small intestine in a patient with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-a case report [^115GiEym]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) syndromes are defined by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and systemic organ injury. TMA may be caused by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which usually can be referred to dysregulated activity of the alternate complement pathway. In at least 50% of the patients an inherited or acquired complement abnormality can be found. aHUS is also known to affect the kidney, often resulting in renal insufficiency. The optimal management of aHUS-patients, when undergoing kidney transplantation to prevent recurrence in the allograft, is eculizumab. Eculizumab is an approved recombinant antibody against human complement component C5 with a high potency of inhibiting complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy.

We report the case of a 39 year-old woman who had an unusual recurrence of her known aHUS predominantly affecting the small intestine.

### Emicizumab (Hemlibra) [^117MacfL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Thrombotic Microangiopathy Associated with HEMLIBRA and aPCC

Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were reported from clinical trials when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) was administered for 24 hours or more to patients receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis. In clinical trials, thrombotic microangiopathy was reported in 0.8% of patients (3/391) and in 8.1% of patients (3/37) who received at least one dose of aPCC. Patients presented with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury, without severe deficiencies in ADAMTS13 activity.

Evidence of improvement was seen within one week following discontinuation of aPCC. One patient resumed HEMLIBRA following resolution of TMA.

Consider the benefits and risks if aPCC must be used in a patient receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis. Due to the long half-life of HEMLIBRA, the potential for an interaction with aPCC may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose. Monitor for the development of TMA when administering aPCC. Immediately discontinue aPCC and interrupt HEMLIBRA prophylaxis if clinical symptoms and/or laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur, and manage as clinically indicated. Consider the benefits and risks of resuming HEMLIBRA prophylaxis following complete resolution of TMA on a case-by-case basis.

### Atypical and secondary hemolytic uremic syndromes have a distinct presentation and no common genetic risk factors [^116U3NMV]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a heterogeneous group of thrombotic microangiopathies associated with various underlying conditions. Whether it belongs to the spectrum of complement-mediated HUS remains controversial. We analysed the presentation, outcome, and frequency of complement gene rare variants in a cohort of 110 patients with secondary HUS attributed to drugs (29%), autoimmune diseases (24%), infections (17%), malignancies (10%), glomerulopathies (9%), extra-renal organ transplantation (8%), and pancreatitis (3%). The frequency of complement gene rare variants was similar in patients with secondary HUS (5%) and in healthy individuals (6% and 8% in French and European controls, respectively). At diagnosis, 40% of patients required dialysis and 18% had neurological manifestations. Fifty percent of patients received plasmatherapy and 35% were treated with eculizumab. Haematological and complete renal remission was achieved in 80% and 24% of patients, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of patients progressed to chronic kidney disease (stages 3–4) and an additional 37% reached end-stage renal disease. Eleven percent of patients died, most often from complications of the underlying cause of HUS. Only one patient experienced an HUS relapse. Patients treated with eculizumab presented with more severe HUS and were more likely to require dialysis at the time of diagnosis as compared to patients not treated with eculizumab. Rates of hematological remission, chronic kidney disease (stages 3–4), and end-stage renal disease were similar in the two groups. Secondary HUS is an acute nonrelapsing form of HUS, not related to complement dysregulation. The efficacy of eculizumab in this setting is not yet established.

### What's new in the diagnosis and pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^111jJUed]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Severe ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) deficiency causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the absence of oliguric or anuric renal failure. However, some patients with this constellation of findings do not have ADAMTS13 deficiency, and some patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency have renal failure or relatively normal blood counts. Consequently, many investigators and clinicians have incorporated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency into the case definition of TTP. This change has facilitated the timely initiation of treatment for patients with atypical clinical features who otherwise would not be recognized as having TTP. Conversely, excluding severe ADAMTS13 deficiency focuses attention on the diagnosis and treatment of other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy that require different treatment. The rapid return of ADAMTS13 data is important to make the best use of this information.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy in aHUS and beyond: clinical clues from complement genetics [^114USgT9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Studies of complement genetics have changed the landscape of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), particularly atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS). Knowledge of complement genetics paved the way for the design of the first specific treatment for aHUS, eculizumab, and is increasingly being used to aid decisions regarding discontinuation of anti-complement treatment in this setting. Complement genetic studies have also been used to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie other forms of HUS and provided evidence that contributed to the reclassification of pregnancy- and postpartum-associated HUS within the spectrum of complement-mediated aHUS. By contrast, complement genetics has not provided definite evidence of a link between constitutional complement dysregulation and secondary forms of HUS. Therefore, the available data do not support systematic testing of complement genes in patients with typical HUS or secondary HUS. The potential relevance of complement genetics for distinguishing the underlying mechanisms of malignant hypertension-associated TMA should be assessed with caution owing to the overlap between aHUS and other causes of malignant hypertension. In all cases, the interpretation of complement genetics results remains complex, as even complement-mediated aHUS is not a classical monogenic disease. Such interpretation requires the input of trained geneticists and experts who have a comprehensive view of complement biology.

### A case of pediatric thrombotic microangiopathy in a jehovah's witness… [^111wQHym]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic microangiopathy is a disease affecting vessel walls leading to aggregation of platelets and wall thickening. Laboratory findings include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated LDH. TMA is a rare finding in the pediatric population. The main causes are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and atypical HUS. We present a 15 year-old previously healthy Jehovah's witness on no medications who presented in hypertensive emergency, found to have azotemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, and anion gap metabolic acidosis. Blood pressures and chemistries improved after hemodialysis, aggressive fluid removal, and antihypertensive medications. TMA workup was extensive and currently ongoing. Shiga toxin mediated HUS was excluded based on stool studies.

ADAMTS13 did not meet criteria for TTP. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria testing was negative. In addition, at presentation the underlying etiology of his TMA was unclear but throughout his admission we have narrowed down the possible cause. There was evidence suggesting chronic kidney disease as his primary diagnosis causing MHTN including small echogenic kidneys on ultrasound, elevated PTH levels, and asymptomatic anemia as patient was without tachycardia with a Hgb of 6 mg/dL. With aggressive blood pressure control there has been a decrease in serum LDH and CBC has remained stable. He did not receive plasmapheresis, plasma infusion, or C5 blocking monoclonal antibody. MHTN is characterized by severe hypertension and end-organ damage. The pathology of organ damage is typically from endothelial cell injury causing activation of proinflammatory cytokines and clotting factors.

This results in thrombi formation in arteriolar lumens and resultant narrowing of blood vessels and destruction of RBCs and platelets. The patient is clinically improving, although kidney function is not and remains on dialysis. The kidney biopsy can not be safely performed at this time due to blood product refusal and we hope to do so in the future once his hematologic parameters improve.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy in malignant hypertension and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) / thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): can we differentiate one from the other? [^113pYkXa]. Hypertension Research (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with malignant hypertension sometimes exhibit microangiopathic hemolytic anemia/thrombocytopenia known as thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). On the other hand, severe hypertension is sometimes associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Because the clinical features of the two entities overlap significantly, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other. However, such differentiation is indispensable, since early performance of plasmapheresis is critical in HUS/TTP. It has been suggested that severe thrombocytopenia is one of the most useful differential points in diagnosing HUS/TTP from malignant hypertension caused by other etiologies. Early performance of plasmapheresis can be justified in the presence of both TMA and thrombocytopenia. However, thrombocytopenia can be seen in the cases with malignant hypertension from etiologies other than HUS/TTP, and in these particular cases, plasmapheresis is useless and can be harmful. Recently, the plasma level of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain, with thrombospondin type 1 motif 13), which is a von Willebrand Factor cleaving protease, has been shown to be very low in familial or some of the sporadic cases of TTP, and a low level of ADAMTS13 is very specific to TTP. Some reports have shown that patients with a very low plasma level of ADAMTS13 respond very well to plasmapheresis. We recently experienced two cases with TMA. Although both of our patients had severe hypertension with TMA, different therapeutic strategies ameliorated their illness: symptomatic treatment was effective in case 1, which showed normal ADAMTS13 activity, whereas plasma infusion was necessary to save case 2, which showed low ADAMTS13 activity. Thus, patients with a low level of ADAMTS13 activity might respond well to plasmapheresis or plasma infusion. When presented with patients with severe hypertension and thrombotic microangiopathy, ADAMTS13 activity may prove to be a promising adjunctive tool in differentiating TTP from TMA due to other etiologies, but in the meantime, we should make the choice of whether or not to perform plasmapheresis based on the degree of thrombocytopenia.

### Adrenocortical carcinoma complicated by renal thrombotic microangiopathy, a case-series [^115B4B6q]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare entity due to a wide variety of diseases, all characterized by mechanical hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and microvascular occlusions. Causes of TMA are separated between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, typical Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), primary atypical HUS in patients with an abnormality of the alternative complement pathway, and HUS secondary to a heterogeneous group of causes: infections, drugs, genetic disorders, systemic diseases and cancers. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumour, with an unfavourable prognosis. Hormonal complications often occur, but paraneoplastic syndromes are uncommon in the literature. Here, we describe a case-series of ACC-associated TMA.

### Differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy in nephrology [^117YR5u7]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of TMA is complex but important to inform treatment decisions. Consensus guidelines for the differential diagnosis of TMA were updated in 2015, however real-world evidence on the current diagnosis and treatment practices has not been reported. We hypothesised that there are areas of uncertainty in the work-up of patients with TMA, leading to potential delays in establishing the final diagnosis, putting patient's lives at a higher risk.

We devised a survey with the objective of understanding current practices in the diagnosis of TMA and aHUS across Europe and the Middle East and challenges when diagnosing the cause of TMA.

Assessment timing and escalation — Given the current limited data, the panel could not come to consensus on appropriate time point (s) based on available literature. Mortality rates in patients refractory to first-line treatment of TA-TMA exceed 80% regardless of the drug or therapeutic approach utilized. There is emerging evidence that 4–6 weeks may be a time point to consider assessment in children who receive complement C5 inhibitors, though additional data are needed, and we agreed that a goal of future work is to identify an early time point at which, if patients do not achieve clinically meaningful response to that approach, they are unlikely to respond and merit additional or alternative interventions; these gaps and future directions informed the panels proposed response definitions focusing on clinically meaningful PR.

### Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome in adults, France, 2009–2017 [^116cMXBj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study on hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in 96 adults enrolled in the cohort of the National Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies network in France during 2009–2017. Most infections were caused by STEC strains not belonging to the O157 or O104 serogroups. Thirty (31.3%) patients had multiple risk factors for thrombotic microangiopathy. In total, 61 (63.5%) patients required dialysis, 50 (52.1%) had a serious neurologic complication, 34 (35.4%) required mechanical ventilation, and 19 (19.8%) died during hospitalization. We used multivariate analysis to determine that the greatest risk factors for death were underlying immunodeficiency (hazard ratio 3.54) and severe neurologic events (hazard ratio 3.40). According to multivariate analysis and propensity score-matching, eculizumab treatment was not associated with survival. We found that underlying conditions, especially immunodeficiency, are strongly associated with decreased survival in adults who have hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by STEC.

### Athrombocytopenic thrombotic microangiopathy, a condition that could be overlooked based on current diagnostic criteria [^117SURXs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) was identified initially as the lesion causing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which presents with non-immune haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and tissue dysfunction, and was identified later on also as the lesion causing haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which resembles TTP except for affecting the kidney predominantly. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of TTP appear to differ from those of HUS, it is still common usage to consider both disorders as the same entity, and 'non-immune haemolytic anaemia' and 'thrombocytopenia' as main diagnostic criteria.

On several occasions, colleagues in our Division have reported identifying TMA lesions in athrombocytopenic patients only after a kidney biopsy had been obtained for renal failure of unknown aetiology. They have also reported that even if the TMA lesions occurred in the absence of underlying condition and were apparently plasmapheresis responsive, haematologists frequently argued that this treatment was of unproven benefit when one of the diagnostic criteria for TTP/HUS was missing.

Based on our colleagues' experience, and considering that plasmapheresis is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for TTP/HUS, we became concerned that the criteria used to diagnose these disorders might lead, in being too exclusive, to undertreat many individuals with actual TMA lesions. This worry was justified further by studies in which HUS was found to be associated with a worse renal outcome than TTP.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy associated with mantle cell lymphoma: a case report [^115wvV7m]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a syndrome characterized by vascular endothelial cell damage, with the three main features of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombus-related organ damage, including kidney injury. TMA is classified into four major categories according to the causative disease: Shiga toxin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and secondary TMA. A differential diagnosis is essential because treatment strategies differ depending on the causative disease. Secondary TMA is caused by various factors, including autoimmune diseases, drugs, and malignancy. Therefore, treating the underlying cause is crucial for improving patient's condition. Secondary TMA caused by hematological malignancies is generally less common than that caused by solid tumors; lymphoma is the most common cause of TMA among hematological malignancies. Although Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) accounts for 3% of all malignant lymphomas, case reports on TMA with MCL are extremely rare. Thus, its pathogenic relationship remains unknown.

Herein, we report a very rare case of secondary TMA wherein MCL was diagnosed based on the same kidney biopsy specimen and treated with chemotherapy, resulting in improvement in TMA.

### An ASTCT, CIBMTR, EBMT, and APBMT consensus statement defining response criteria for hematopoietic cell transplantation associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) directed therapy [^113iHjk9]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

TA-TMA response assessment — proposed criteria and rationale outlines that, when evaluating response, we propose assessing hematologic/biochemical and organ manifestations separately, because hematologic manifestations appear to improve before organ manifestations and severe organ damage can take a prolonged period to recover; we envision that this will facilitate treatment decisions in real time, particularly early after initiating a TA-TMA directed therapy, and at the completion of therapy we also propose combining hematologic/biochemical manifestations and organ manifestations in an overall assessment of response. The proposed criteria utilize recently published harmonized diagnostic criteria as the framework, and note that common concurrent comorbidities can impact features of TA-TMA assessed for response such that, even with effective TA-TMA-directed therapy, the complete resolution of these features is expected to take time. To enable early efficacy assessments, clinically meaningful partial responses (PR) are required because many prior studies defined PR as achieving neither a complete response (CR) nor no response (NR), a definition with limited clinical utility in real time; in the absence of specific partial response definitions that support clinically meaningful improvement, providers cannot assess early efficacy of TA-TMA directed therapy.

### Norovirus: a novel etiologic agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant [^113BCiut]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with a mean annual incidence of 6.1 cases/million children less than 5 years of age and an overall case fatality rate of 4%. The primary damage to the vascular endothelium is responsible for the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI). Pediatric HUS is classified either as: 1) typical and caused by Shiga toxin producing E.coli (STEC) and accounts for 90% of cases or 2) atypical, subdivided into familial HUS or non-familial HUS which are usually secondary to inherited or acquired abnormalities in the alternate complement pathway. Patients with STEC HUS develop acute kidney injury typically 2–12 days after the onset of bloody diarrhea. Treatment is supportive, blood transfusion if deemed necessary and temporary dialysis in case of severe acute kidney injury. Fortunately the mortality rate for STEC-HUS has decreased to less than 5% with a 70% complete recovery after an episode acute kidney injury.

We report an unusual case of HUS with severe anuric AKI in association with Norovirus (previously Norwalk virus) induced gastroenteritis in a nine-month-old baby which, to our knowledge, is the first infant where such a causal association is documented. We also present a brief review of other viruses reported to cause HUS and TTP.

### Efficacy and safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients affected by Shiga toxin-related hemolytic and uremic syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115MxPp9]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Shiga toxin-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) is a serious condition, characterized by multiorgan thrombotic microangiopathy, mainly affecting children. Renal involvement is severe, with approximately half of patients requiring dialysis. So far, no specific treatment has been proven efficient in STEC-HUS. The use of eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting terminal complement complex, has demonstrated remarkable success in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, but its use in uncontrolled studies to treat STEC-HUS has yielded inconsistent results. In this Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 100 pediatric patients with STEC-HUS, the findings did not show efficacy of eculizumab during the acute phase of the disease. However, the results indicated a reduction of renal sequelae in eculizumab-treated patients at 1-year follow-up. Larger prospective studies would be needed to further explore eculizumab as a potential treatment.

Background

Shiga toxin-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) in children is a severe condition, resulting in approximately 50% of patients requiring RRT. Furthermore, at least 30% of survivors experience kidney sequelae. Recently, activation of the complement alternative pathway has been postulated as a factor in STEC-HUS pathophysiology, leading to compassionate use of eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the terminal complement complex, in affected patients. Given the lack of therapy for STEC-HUS, a controlled study of eculizumab efficacy in treating this condition is a priority.

Methods

We conducted a Phase 3 randomized trial of eculizumab in children with STEC-HUS. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either eculizumab or placebo during 4 weeks. Follow-up lasted for 1 year. The primary end point was RRT duration < 48 hours after randomization. Secondary endpoints included hematologic and extrarenal involvement.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar among the 100 patients who underwent randomization. The rate of RRT < 48 hours did not differ significantly between the two groups (48% in the placebo versus 38% in the eculizumab group; P = 0.31) or in the course of ARF. The two groups also exhibited similar hematologic evolution and extrarenal manifestations of STEC-HUS. The proportion of patients experiencing renal sequelae at 1 year was lower in the eculizumab group than in the placebo group (43.48% and 64.44%, respectively, P = 0.04). No safety concern was reported.

Conclusions

In pediatric patients with STEC-HUS, eculizumab treatment does not appear to be associated with improved renal outcome during acute phase of the disease but may reduce long-term kidney sequelae.

### Complement C5 inhibition in early onset HELLP syndrome [^115R1uwC]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to features that define preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is marked by thrombotic microangiopathy, drawing parallels to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) or complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy, which is commonly diagnosed post partum and often preceded by a pregnancy complication, including preeclampsia, preterm birth, or fetal death. Pregnancy is a well-established trigger of complement activation. Complement is part of the innate immune system, functioning in defense against foreign pathogens, clearance of damaged cells, and removal of immune complexes, and is closely linked to coagulation and inflammatory pathways. The complement system plays critical dual roles in maintaining healthy pregnancy, combating infection and allowing tolerance of the semiallogeneic fetus; however, its careful regulation is equally critical. We previously identified rare germ line variants in genes regulating complement in ∼50% of women with HELLP syndrome, a frequency similar to that of aHUS. We further corroborated the central role of complement in HELLP syndrome pathogenesis using a functional, cell-based assay of complement and found increased complement activity in serum from 62% of pregnancies at HELLP syndrome diagnosis vs 16% of control pregnancies in the late third trimester. A single case report describes the successful use of the terminal complement inhibitor, eculizumab, to prolong pregnancy 17 days in a woman with preterm HELLP syndrome. Importantly, experience in aHUS and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria demonstrate that eculizumab is safe in pregnancy. Although eculizumab can be detected in low levels in cord blood, levels are not high enough to affect complement in the neonate, nor there is significant eculizumab in newborn plasma.

### The role of ADAMTS-13 activity and complement mutational analysis in differentiating acute thrombotic microangiopathies [^114bY2qV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials

Molecular diagnostics has improved the differentiation of acute thrombotic microangiopathys (TMAs).
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome may have features mimicking thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
We identified novel complement mutations and a high incidence of CD46, with favorable long term outcomes.
Complement mutation analysis in TMA where the diagnosis is unclear and ADAMTS‐13 activity is > 10%.

Summary

Background

Differentiation of acute thrombotic microangiopathy at presentation has historically been dependent on clinical parameters. Confirmation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is increasingly reliant on demonstrating deficient‐13 activity. The identification of alternative complement pathway abnormalities in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), along with the proven efficacy of terminal complement inhibitors in treatment, has increased the need for rapid differentiation offrom aHUS.

Objectives

We describe the clinical phenotype and nature of complement mutations in a cohort ofpatients referred as acutes.

Patients/methods

Fourteen consecutivepatients were screened for mutations in C3, 46, and, as well as factor H (FH) antibodies. Allpatients had‐13 activity > 10%.

Results

Of 14patients, 11 (79%) had platelet counts < 30 × 10⁹/L during the acute phase. Median presenting creatinine level was 295 μmol L⁻¹, while five (36%) of 14 presented with a serum creatinine level < 200 μmol L⁻¹. Alternative complement pathway mutations were detected in 9 (64%) of 14 patients, including 46 mutations in five (36%) of 14 patients. Patients were identified with novel mutations inand C3 that have not been previously reported.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that diagnostic differentiation based on platelet count and renal function is insufficient to predict an underlying complement mutation in somecases. Specifically, we demonstrate a high frequency of functionally significant 46 mutations which may mimic.‐13 activity > 10% in a patient with ashould necessitate genetic screening for complement abnormalities.

### An ASTCT, CIBMTR, EBMT, and APBMT consensus statement defining response criteria for hematopoietic cell transplantation associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) directed therapy [^111dc9ue]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

ASTCT, CIBMTR, EBMT, and APBMT consensus — response criteria for transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) directed therapy are proposed to standardize assessment; the objective was to propose clinically meaningful response criteria for TA-TMA directed therapy to enhance consistent evaluation of therapeutic agents in clinical practice, interventional trials, and registry studies, and after a relevant literature review, the Delphi method was used to achieve consensus on proposed response criteria. The panel focused on the 3 key concepts, including that the complete resolution of TA-TMA manifestations may be difficult to achieve immediately after initiating treatment, making the definition of clinically meaningful partial responses essential to assess early efficacy of TA-TMA directed therapies. Because hematologic manifestations may resolve faster than organ damage, we suggest assessing hematologic/biochemical and organ manifestations independently, in addition to having an overall response assessment, and using the previously established diagnostic criteria as a framework, we propose objective response definitions for each TA-TMA criterion and organ manifestation. Clinical and methodological elements essential to response assessment include anemia and thrombocytopenia, with criteria established for transfusion dependence or independence at the time of treatment, schistocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and soluble C5b-9. Patients with other established etiologies of cytopenias (i.e. poor graft function or relapsed hematologic malignancy) should be considered unevaluable for hematologic response. In an overall assessment, the best overall response is limited by the lowest hematologic/biochemical or organ response, and NR of either hematologic/biochemical or organ is considered an overall NR; while consensus was achieved on response definitions, due to the lack of evidence, there was no agreement on response assessment timepoints, and since achieving an early overall CR may be challenging/protracted in patients with organ injury; establishment of criteria for clinically meaningful PR is important and may be a more useful early endpoint in studies.

### Rifampin [^115PGwYF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing cases of paradoxical drug reaction (recurrence or appearance of new symptoms, physical and radiological signs in a patient who had previously shown improvement with appropriate antimycobacterial treatment, in the absence of disease relapse, poor treatment compliance, drug resistance, side effects of treatment, or secondary infection/diagnosis) have been reported with Rifampin capsules (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Paradoxical drug reactions are often transient and should not be misinterpreted as failure to respond to treatment. If worsening of symptoms or signs occurs during antimycobacterial treatment, consider paradoxical drug reaction in the differential diagnosis, monitor, or treat accordingly.

Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremia syndrome, some fatal, have been reported with rifampin. Discontinue Rifampin if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur. The findings of unexplained thrombocytopenia and anemia should prompt further evaluation and consideration of the diagnosis of TMA.

### Gnotobiotic piglets develop thrombotic microangiopathy after oral infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli [^117YUCrd]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) may cause severe enteritis, followed in up to 10% of cases by an extraintestinal complication, the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by a triad of symptoms: anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renalfailure due to thrombotic microangiopathy. EHEC produces several virulence factors, among which a family of phage-encoded cytotoxins, called Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, seems to be most important. However, since an appropriate animal model is not available, pathogenicity of these emerging enteric pathogens is still poorly understood. Germ-free gnotobiotic piglets infected orally with an O1577:H7 or an O26:H11 EHEC wild-type isolate, both producing Shiga toxin 2, developed intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations of EHEC disease, including thrombotic microangiopathy in the kidneys, the morphologic hallmark of HUS in humans. Thus, gnotobiotic piglets are suitable to further study the pathophysiology of EHEC-induced HUS. It can be expected that data obtainedfrom this animal model will improve our current standard of knowledge about this emerging infectious disease.
