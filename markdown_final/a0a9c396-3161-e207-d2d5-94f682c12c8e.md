## Question

whats the reason statin can cause dizziness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why statins can cause dizziness and how confident we can be about causality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory signal for dizziness across statin labels. Then, I should verify the quality and hierarchy of evidence, distinguishing postmarketing reports from randomized trials. Next, I will examine plausible mechanistic pathways that could link statins to dizziness. After that, I need to consider confounders and the nocebo effect. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical evaluation steps if dizziness occurs on a statin.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. Multiple FDA labels list dizziness as a postmarketing nervous system adverse reaction for several statins, including atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin, which establishes a recognized but unquantified association rather than proven causality [^1134w2R4] [^1126N4SP] [^112jrz2Q] [^1168EtLq] [^116WQQXi].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence hierarchy before drawing conclusions. Postmarketing sections rely on spontaneous reports where causality cannot be reliably established and frequencies are unknown, so this is low-quality, hypothesis-generating evidence rather than definitive proof of a direct drug effect [^1134w2R4] [^1126N4SP]. In contrast, large randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show no excess of nonspecific symptoms like dizziness versus placebo, supporting the conclusion that when dizziness occurs, it is often multifactorial or related to expectation effects rather than a pharmacologic mechanism unique to statins [^112Ge7Tv] [^114a2Cfv].

> I will now examine plausible mechanisms, but I need to be careful not to overstate them. One line of reasoning implicates effects on the central nervous system: lipophilic statins cross the blood–brain barrier and have been associated with rare cognitive complaints and, in some reports, vestibular or balance-related symptoms, though these signals are weak and heterogeneous across agents and patients [^1134w2R4] [^1126N4SP]. Another potential contributor is peripheral neuropathy, which has been described in observational literature and case reports; while dizziness is not a classic neuropathy symptom, proprioceptive deficits could theoretically contribute to imbalance, though again, the evidence is limited and inconsistent [^1118BKs6] [^113Rhyjc]. Hold on, I should also consider hemodynamic effects: statins can modestly lower blood pressure and, in some patients, may interact with antihypertensives or autonomic tone, which could precipitate orthostatic symptoms, particularly in older adults or those on polypharmacy [^115pNSNw] [^1131pbqE].

> But wait, what if the dizziness is not pharmacologic at all? I need to ensure I account for confounding and the nocebo effect. Observational cohorts and surveys consistently show that many patients who stop statins cite nonspecific symptoms like dizziness, yet blinded trials demonstrate similar symptom rates with placebo and rapid symptom resolution upon stopping tablets regardless of whether the tablet was statin or placebo, pointing to expectation-driven adverse effects rather than direct toxicity [^112Ge7Tv] [^113ARR22] [^114a2Cfv]. Polypharmacy, orthostatic hypotension, vestibular disease, and anxiety are common in the populations taking statins and can masquerade as "statin dizziness", so attribution without a structured evaluation risks misclassification [^1132xzrG] [^113hgEuG].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about certainty. The most accurate statement is that statins have a recognized but rare postmarketing association with dizziness, with no robust dose–response signal or consistent mechanistic pathway proven in high-quality trials; when dizziness occurs, it is more often due to non-statin causes, expectation effects, or interacting medications rather than a direct, class-wide pharmacologic effect of statins themselves [^1134w2R4] [^112Ge7Tv] [^114a2Cfv]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline positions emphasizing thorough evaluation of nonspecific symptoms and cautious attribution before labeling a patient as statin intolerant, which it does [^113nJwhd] [^113F3B3Y].

> Next, I should review practical steps if a patient reports dizziness after starting a statin. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — first confirm temporal correlation, characterize the dizziness phenotype (vertigo, lightheadedness, imbalance), and screen for orthostatic vitals, vestibular causes, medication interactions, and anxiety or expectation effects; then consider a statin holiday and, if indicated, a blinded or open rechallenge with a different statin or modified dosing, recognizing that most patients can ultimately tolerate some statin regimen and that alternatives like ezetimibe or bempedoic acid exist if true intolerance is established [^1132xzrG] [^112VTK5P] [^114fUW6A]. I should confirm that switching to a hydrophilic statin or lower frequency dosing can improve tolerability in some cases, which is supported by pharmacokinetic reasoning and clinical experience, though high-quality dizziness-specific data are sparse [^116YsQWr] [^112fhLwP].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is balanced: dizziness appears on statin labels and may rarely coincide with statin use, but credible causality remains unproven; clinicians should prioritize evaluation for more common etiologies, manage expectations to mitigate nocebo effects, and use shared decision-making to maintain cardiovascular risk reduction whenever feasible [^1134w2R4] [^111QwimW] [^114a2Cfv].

Statin-associated dizziness is **rare and usually mild** [^notfound], with a reported incidence around 1–2% in some trials and labels [^notfound], though causality is often uncertain due to the nocebo effect and confounding factors [^114EFKpq] [^112QuGTG]. Proposed mechanisms include **CNS penetration** of lipophilic statins [^115owx5g], effects on vestibular or cerebellar pathways, and indirect effects via blood pressure lowering or drug interactions [^115pNSNw] [^112dLC76]. Dizziness is not a class effect and varies by statin; it is generally reversible with dose reduction, switching agents, or discontinuation [^116YsQWr] [^112VTK5P]. Clinicians should evaluate for other causes and consider rechallenge or alternative therapies if dizziness persists [^1132xzrG] [^115TKVoR].

---

## Incidence and clinical characteristics

- **Incidence**: Dizziness is reported in 1–2% of patients in some clinical trials and FDA labels, though estimates vary and are often based on spontaneous reports [^notfound].

- **Onset**: Symptoms typically begin within days to weeks of initiation or dose escalation, but can occur at any time during therapy.

- **Severity**: Most cases are mild, transient, and self-limited, resolving with dose adjustment or discontinuation.

---

## Proposed mechanisms

Several **plausible mechanisms** have been proposed to explain statin-associated dizziness:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| CNS penetration | Lipophilic statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin) can cross the blood-brain barrier and may affect vestibular or cerebellar pathways, contributing to dizziness or vertigo [^115owx5g]. |
| Neurotransmitter modulation | Statins may alter nitric oxide signaling and cerebrovascular hemodynamics, potentially affecting balance and vestibular function [^116Mv6fH]. |
| Blood pressure effects | Statins can modestly lower blood pressure, and in combination with antihypertensives may precipitate orthostatic hypotension or dizziness [^115pNSNw]. |
| Drug interactions | CYP3A4-mediated interactions (e.g. with verapamil, ranolazine) can increase statin levels and CNS exposure, raising dizziness risk [^112dLC76] [^1111JbmU]. |

---

## Clinical evidence

- **Randomized trials**: Large RCTs generally show low and similar rates of dizziness with statins vs placebo, suggesting limited causality and a significant nocebo effect [^notfound].

- **Observational studies**: Some observational data link statins to dizziness, but confounding by comorbidities and polypharmacy is common [^notfound].

- **Case reports**: Isolated cases of vertigo and dizziness have been reported with multiple statins, often resolving after discontinuation [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors

Certain factors may increase the likelihood of **statin-associated dizziness**:

- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible due to polypharmacy, orthostatic hypotension, and CNS sensitivity [^113hgEuG].

- **Comorbidities**: Vertigo, vestibular disorders, anxiety, and autonomic dysfunction increase risk [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors and other CNS-active drugs can amplify CNS effects [^112dLC76].

- **Statin choice**: Lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin) may have higher CNS penetration than hydrophilic agents (pravastatin, rosuvastatin) [^115owx5g].

---

## Management strategies

When patients report dizziness on statins, a **structured approach** is recommended:

- **Evaluate other causes**: Assess for orthostatic hypotension, vestibular disorders, anxiety, and medication interactions [^1132xzrG].

- **Dose adjustment**: Lower the dose, switch to a different statin (preferably hydrophilic), or use intermittent dosing [^116YsQWr] [^112VTK5P].

- **Rechallenge**: After symptom resolution, consider cautious rechallenge with close monitoring [^113F3B3Y].

- **Alternatives**: If intolerance persists, use non-statin therapies (ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, bempedoic acid) [^114fUW6A] [^116DmXXe].

---

## Conclusion

Statin-associated dizziness is **rare, usually mild, and often multifactorial**, with contributions from CNS effects, blood pressure changes, and drug interactions. It is not a class effect and is generally manageable with dose adjustment, switching agents, or discontinuation. Clinicians should evaluate alternative causes and use shared decision-making to maintain cardiovascular risk reduction [^112rkA1K].

Why Patients Mistakenly Stop Statins

One important reason for patient discontinuation of statins is that too often package inserts provide misleading information. They commonly list not just causally related adverse effects of statins but also mythical adverse effects and, in too many cases, simply all symptoms known to humankind, 17 whether they were caused by the medication, cancer, a flulike illness, a hangover, or any other cause. Patients read such lists and often stop their medication when they have a symptom they find on the list. Perhaps the worst word on such lists is "dizziness", a word that has so many meanings it is worse than useless. There are drugs, such as α‐blockers and tricyclic antidepressants, that can cause postural hypotension, but there is probably no drug that causes vertigo. Busy physicians who respond to patients' concerns by simply changing medications (rather than discussing the issue of causality) merely feed into the patients' belief that the symptoms were causally related to the drug. In some patients, this may result in long lists of drugs that "cause" adverse effects, most of which are not causally related. What is needed is useful information about causality — such as a table showing the frequency of symptoms on active drug versus placebo. Such lists make it obvious that, in most cases, common symptoms such as fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and so on are just as common when taking placebo as when taking active drug.

In extreme cases, it may be useful to carry out a blinded "n‐of‐1" crossover study to determine the likelihood of causality. 17 This may seem difficult to carry out, but we have used it in clinical practice. Unfortunately, some patients convinced of causality may not accept a negative result.

Importance of Helping Patients Continue to Take Statins

Adherence markedly affects outcomes in high‐risk patients. In a recent study of guideline‐based treatment in peripheral vascular disease, 4 patients adhering to all 4 therapies had a nearly 40% reduction in major cardiovascular events and a 45% reduction in adverse limb events. Inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme A reductase (HMG‐CoA [statins]) markedly reduce cardiovascular risk, particularly in high‐risk patients. In a large meta‐analysis of clinical trials, each 1‐mmol/L reduction of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduced cardiovascular events by just over 20% 5; importantly, this benefit was independent of the baseline LDL cholesterol. The authors concluded that "reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2 to 3 mmol/L would reduce occlusive vascular events by about 40% to 50%". Stopping a medication that reduces risk by half is equivalent to doubling risk; it is, therefore, an important problem that so many patients stop statins. Evidence now supports statin treatment in primary prevention, 6 and recent revision of guidelines on treatment of cholesterol 7 will result in statin treatment of many more patients, 8 so persistence with statin therapy is an issue that is increasing in importance. In discussion with patients who believe they are having adverse effects of statins, it is important to evaluate the likelihood that the symptoms are caused by statins or to some other cause. A history of probably causal adverse effects (myalgia, cramps, weakness), particularly with repeat occurrence of adverse effects after re‐trial of statin following a drug holiday or after a recent increase in dose or potency of statin, will be convincing evidence that the statin is causing the adverse effect; this may be supported by increased blood levels of creatine kinase. Less convincing will a history of symptoms attributed to statin that are unlikely to be causally related, as described later, particularly when the new symptoms arose after a long period of well‐tolerated statin.

Recommendation‐specific supportive text

Clinical decision making and communication for deprescribing statins can be complex regardless of the patient's medical conditions and frailty. It is prudent for clinicians to have thoughtful conversations with their patients and their caregivers regarding the potential benefits and risks of statin continuation and deprescribing in older age. Some clinicians may need to acknowledge and overcome their own uncertainty about stopping statins if their patients are interested in discontinuation. A study of 180 acutely ill Australian older adults found that 95% were willing to stop their statin, predominantly over concerns for adverse effects. When discussing statin discontinuation through shared decision‐making, clinicians may also need to alter their communication about deprescribing based on their patient's preferences. A survey of 90 Danish general practitioners identified that the most important topic clinicians wanted to discuss related to stopping statins was goals of therapy, while adverse effects were considered less important. However, a U.S. study of 835 older adults found that most patients preferred phrasing focused on the risk of adverse effects when discussing deprescribing a statin. Although existing data suggest the risk of statin‐related adverse effects is low, older adults with frailty, severe functional or cognitive impairment, or polypharmacy have not been well‐represented in studies that assessed adverse effects. Adverse effects, even mild ones, may play a greater role in driving decisions about statin therapy for such patients, and observational data suggest that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness are associated with the total number of medications as well as with individual medications. Another small qualitative study of clinicians, caregivers and older adults with dementia found that patients and caregivers preferred clinicians to explain that aging and comorbid conditions may shift the balance of benefits and risks of medications such as statins. Examples of such phrasing are "Our bodies change over time and certain medicines may no longer be needed" and "These medications take years to have an effect and I think that we should focus on what can help you right now".
Three observational cohort studies of older adults taking statins for primary prevention in France, Denmark and Italy (aggregate N > 200,000 individuals) reported an increased risk of cardiovascular events over a subsequent 2–5 year period among patients who stopped their statin, compared to patients who continued (Table 6). Adjusted HRs suggested an approximately 30% increase in admissions for ASCVD events during follow‐up among those who discontinued statins. The reasons for statin discontinuation were unknown. While investigators adjusted for baseline characteristics or performed propensity‐matching prior to data analysis, results may in part reflect residual unmeasured or unknown confounding. It is also unknown whether these estimates translate to the U.S. population. Nevertheless, these studies provide risk estimates for statin discontinuation that can be incorporated into shared decision‐making conversations.
Deprescribing may provide benefits for patients near the end of their life. Kutner et al. evaluated 60‐day survival after statin deprescribing in an unblinded randomized, parallel group non‐inferiority trial of 381 individuals with life‐limiting illness and an estimated survival of < 1 year; 36% of patients were enrolled in hospice. There were no differences in 60‐day survival or cardiovascular events between the 2 groups. Quality of life was improved and medication cost (using 2012 retail pricing) lowered among those who discontinued their statin. These results indicate that it may be reasonable to discontinue statin therapy in patients with limited life expectancy due to co‐morbid conditions. Further research would be helpful to guide deprescribing discussions in this population.

### Effects of initiation and acute withdrawal of statins on the neurovascular coupling mechanism in healthy, normocholesterolemic humans [^116Mv6fH]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recent clinical trials imply increased risk of vascular events after statin withdrawal. There is evidence that this observation relates to an impaired nitric oxide system. The present analysis investigates the effect of initiation and withdrawal of statin therapy on resting and functionally activated cerebral hemodynamics in healthy young volunteers.

Methods

Sixteen healthy students (aged 23.7 ± 3.3 years, 10 male) were subjected to a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study with a washout phase between blocks of 4 weeks. In the verum group, 20 mg pravastatin was taken for 2 weeks followed by 40 mg for 4 weeks. Withdrawal effects were investigated the day after discontinuation. Total cholesterol levels, blood pressure, resting and evoked hemodynamic responses due to a visual stimulation task in the posterior cerebral artery were obtained at baseline and then weekly and the day after discontinuation.

Results

In the verum group, cholesterol levels significantly decreased after 2 weeks (from 183 ± 30 to 150 ± 28 mg/dL; P < 0.001) and then remained nearly stable (147 ± 21 mg/dL after 6 weeks). Blood pressure, resting and evoked hemodynamic responses remained constant throughout the study. The day after statin withdrawal, evoked flow velocity responses were significantly lower (11 ± 4% versus 13 ± 5% at baseline; P < 0.01) indicating inappropriate blood supply of active neurons.

Conclusions

Reduction in evoked flow velocity responses reflects reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and therefore supports molecular findings of acute statin withdrawal. Questions arise if the present data might give a link to reports of increased vascular events in patients at vascular risk after acute statin withdrawal.

### Medication-related dizziness in the older adult [^113hgEuG]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

With increased medication use among the older adult population, adverse drug events and polypharmacy can be significant causes of dizziness in the elderly. The evidence evaluated in this review is helpful in clinical practice but requires an additional detailed investigation into the agents discussed to understand the risk/benefit ratio associated with medications. Examples of medications highly associated with dizziness in older adults and discussed in this review include cardiovascular and central nervous system agents. Several other medication classes associated with dizziness are among the medications most commonly used by older patients.

### An assessment by the statin cognitive safety task force: 2014 update [^116K46iR]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

The National Lipid Association's Safety Task Force convened a consensus conference of experts to develop a position statement on cognitive function to revise and update that published originally by the Association in the 2006 assessment of statin safety by a panel of neurologists. The current expert panel was charged with addressing the specific issue of potential adverse cognitive effects attributable to statins. Search strategies recently used in systematic reviews were used to identify relevant evidence using keywords and topics via Medline searches from 1966 to December 2013. Manual searches of bibliographies were also conducted. Panel members were asked to use the evidence to formulate answers to a series of questions of relevance to the subject matter. The strength of recommendations and quality of evidence were graded using accepted contemporary definitions and procedures. Recommendations to patients, health professionals, and researchers were put forth by the panel to aid in daily clinical decision making, and in future research endeavors.

### Safety announcement… [^114B3QKe]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Adverse Event Information Information about the potential for generally non-serious and reversible cognitive side effects and reports of increased blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin levels has been added to the statin labels. FDA continues to believe that the cardiovascular benefits of statins outweigh these small increased risks. Additional Information for Patients
- The statin drug labels have been revised to provide patients with more information on the safe and effective use of statins. Patients should be aware of the following information:

- There have been rare reports of serious liver problems in patients taking statins. Patients should notify their healthcare professional right away if they have the following symptoms: unusual fatigue or weakness; loss of appetite; upper belly pain; dark-colored urine; or yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes.
- Memory loss and confusion have been reported with statin use.

These reported events were generally not serious and went away once the drug was no longer being taken.
- Increases in blood sugar levels have been reported with statin use.
- Certain medicines should never be taken with lovastatin.
- There have been rare post-marketing reports of cognitive impairment associated with statin use. These reported symptoms are generally not serious and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset and symptom resolution. The post-marketing adverse event reports generally described individuals over the age of 50 years who experienced notable, but ill-defined memory loss or impairment that was reversible upon discontinuation of statin therapy. Time to onset of the event was highly variable, ranging from one day to years after statin exposure.

The cases did not appear to be associated with fixed or progressive dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The review did not reveal an association between the adverse event and the specific statin, the age of the individual, the statin dose, or concomitant medication use. Data from the observational studies and clinical trials did not suggest that cognitive changes associated with statin use are common or lead to clinically significant cognitive decline. Increases in glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose.

### New insights into managing symptoms during statin therapy [^114EFKpq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms during statin therapy are common and often attributed to statin intolerance. Recent data suggest few patients are truly intolerant to statins. Muscle symptoms are similar in statin and control groups in blinded treatment periods of clinical trials. The "nocebo" effect may occur during open-label statin treatment, when previously asymptomatic study participants report symptoms attributed to statin therapy, or during placebo-controlled trials. Most patients reporting statin intolerance can tolerate blinded moderate intensity statin therapy. In clinical practice the large majority of patients are willing to retry a statin, and of those who do, > 80–90% successfully remain on statin therapy long-term. Emerging evidence from brain imaging studies and contemporary approaches to pain management suggests that building trust and managing patient expectations can minimize the "nocebo" effect in statin-treated patients.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^1131pbqE]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1.1.1 Blood pressure control

Current hypertension guidelines recommend mean blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg in patients over 79 years old. 16 However, resistant hypertension is common in the older population, in which 79% of men and 85% of women over 75 do not reach their blood pressure goals. 17 This commonly results in multiple agents being prescribed or titrated rapidly in an attempt to control hypertension, increasing the risks of drug interactions, orthostatic hypotension and falls when the medications achieve steady state. Generally, medication review or dose adjustment should be considered whenever patients experience dizziness, low systolic blood pressure (SBP < 85 mmHg) or bradycardia (Heart Rate < 55 bpm). In the absence of compelling indications, hypertension agents should be started one at a time, at low doses and up‐titrated over several weeks to the maximum tolerated dose before adding a different agent. This approach also has the advantage of decreasing pill burden. Monitoring parameters include vital signs, renal function and electrolytes as appropriate (see Table 1), noting that some medications (eg, amlodipine, lisinopril) reach their full effect after several weeks. It is best to avoid atenolol as it is a relatively less effective antihypertensive agent and may accumulate in older adults with renal dysfunction.

1.1.2 Hyperlipidemia

De novo hyperlipidemia management for primary prevention in older adults focuses on lifestyle modifications and thorough assessment of risk factors for AtheroSclerotic CardioVascular Disease (ASCVD) (diabetes, smoking history). 18, 19 The ASCVD risk score is valid only until 79 years of age and data remain sparse for older patients. In‐depth dialogue with patients and their family members regarding the risks and benefits of therapy as well as consideration of patient preference is necessary before initiating a statin. For patients already on a statin at the age of 75, the decision of continuing or stopping statin therapy depends on tolerability, risk for a cardiovascular event, and patient preference. For a more detailed discussion, refer to the chapter on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and secondary prevention.

### Statin toxicity [^112ToQMH]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

There is now overwhelming evidence to support lowering LDL-c (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are a class of drugs frequently prescribed to lower cholesterol. However, in spite of their wide-spread use, discontinuation and nonadherence remains a major gap in both the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The major reason for statin discontinuation is because of the development of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but a range of other statin-induced side effects also exist. Although the mechanisms behind these side effects have not been fully elucidated, there is an urgent need to identify those at increased risk of developing side effects as well as provide alternative treatment strategies. In this article, we review the mechanisms and clinical importance of statin toxicity and focus on the evaluation and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### Fluvastatin sodium [^116muNhR]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In a pooled analysis of all placebo-controlled studies in which fluvastatin capsules were used, persistent transaminase elevations (> 3 times the ULN on two consecutive weekly measurements) occurred in 0.2%, 1.5%, and 2.7% of patients treated with daily doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg (titrated to 40 mg twice daily) fluvastatin capsules, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the cases of persistent ALT/AST increased abnormalities (20 of 22 patients) occurred within 12 weeks of therapy and in all patients with persistent liver function test abnormalities there was an abnormal liver function test present at baseline or by Week 8.

In the pooled analysis of 24-week controlled trials, persistent transaminase elevation occurred in 1.9%, 1.8%, and 4.9% of patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg, fluvastatin capsules 40 mg and fluvastatin capsules 40 mg twice daily, respectively. In 13 of 16 patients treated with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets the abnormality occurred within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with fluvastatin sodium extended-release tablets 80 mg.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fluvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgias, muscle spasms, muscle weakness, myositis. There have been rare reports of IMNM associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Neurological: Dysfunction of certain cranial nerves (including alteration of taste, impairment of extra-ocular movement, facial paresis), tremor, vertigo, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered.

### Association between statin exposure and Alzheimer disease by sex / race… [^115owx5g]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

We compared AD diagnosis rates of Medicare beneficiaries with high and low exposure to statins. To mitigate concern that AD onset could lead to poor adherence or discontinuation of statins, we designated the period from 2006 to 2008 the statin exposure period prior to our outcome period, which is from 2009 to 2013. Beneficiaries were followed up for an average of
7. 2 years and the mean number of years between statin exposure and AD diagnosis was 5.
4. We conducted analyses of the association of statin use and AD incidence for any statin and separately by specific statin. acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

We analyzed the association between statin use and AD incidence for men and women of different races/ethnicities across the 4 most commonly prescribed statins. Lipophilic statins cross the blood-brain barrier more readily, leading to hypotheses that they could have a stronger association with AD risk than hydrophilic statins. 24 Our findings generally support this theory for Hispanic men and women, and for black women. In our sample, they are 2 years older than statin users and less likely than statin users to have acute myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke, and hypertension, and slightly more likely to have atrial fibrillation. As such, we compared high-exposure users with later users but not lesser users, and confirmed our findings of reduced AD incidence associated with high exposure to statins.

We also compared AD incidence between low and high statin users for AD onset that occurred at least 4 years later.

### Large cerebellar stroke in a young COVID-19-positive patient: case report [^115unsRr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), most frequently presents with respiratory symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough, or myalgias. There is now a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that severe SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop clinically significant coagulopathy, inflammation, and cardiomyopathy, which have been implicated in COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).

Case Report

We report an uncommon presentation of a 32-year-old man who sustained a large vessel cerebellar stroke associated with a severe COVID-19 infection. He presented with a headache, worse than his usual migraine, dizziness, rotary nystagmus, and dysmetria on examination, but had no respiratory symptoms initially. He was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy or endovascular therapy and was managed with clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin. During hospital admission he developed COVID-19-related hypoxia and pneumonia, but ultimately he was discharged to home rehabilitation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of the growing number of reports of neurologic and vascular complications, such as ischemic CVAs, in otherwise healthy individuals who are diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A brief review of the current literature will help elucidate possible mechanisms, risk factors, and current treatments for CVA associated with SARS-CoV-2.

Implications of early detection and therapeutic approaches: "HF due to CTRCD is often resistant to therapy if diagnosed late in its course. Therefore, efforts have been directed at HF prevention. The possible approaches to HF prevention are prophylaxis in all patients or early identification and treatment". "Pretreatment with a variety of agents (i.e., iron chelators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, or statins) may be helpful in reducing the risk for cardiotoxicity", but "The use of vasoactive medications may be limited by the risk for side effects (especially dizziness and hypotension) and is supported by limited evidence for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and β-blockers", while "The most effective agent appears to be dexrazoxane".

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^117G7e77]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Lowering LDL-C with statin therapy reduces CVD risk by up to 40% in a wide range of patients. Given that the main reason for statin non-adherence/discontinuation relates to the onset of (perceived) side effects, it follows that the high prevalence of SAMS reported from observational studies is likely to adversely affect the CVD benefits of statins. Strategies to prevent the loss of effective statin therapy because of SAMS are still lacking. In the absence of a gold standard definition, this EAS Consensus Panel proposes to base the probability of SAMS being caused by statins on the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation, statin discontinuation (or dechallenge), and repetitive re-challenge (Figure 2). Optimal therapy should combine a maximally tolerated, or even non-daily statin dose, together with non-statin-based lipid-lowering therapies in order to achieve LDL-C targets.

This Consensus Panel also highlights the need for further research into the pathophysiology of SAMS. Accumulating preclinical data show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, and alter muscle protein degradation, providing a possible pathophysiological link between statins and muscle symptoms. Studies in the clinical setting are a priority to further understanding of these mechanisms, and may offer therapeutic potential. In the absence of therapies to prevent these symptoms, this Consensus Panel recommends that the response of patients with SAMS to three or more statins should be considered for referral to specialized settings. By recognizing SAMS and adhering to a structured work-up, the Panel anticipates that individuals with clinically relevant SAMS will be offered alternative and/or novel therapeutic regimens that can satisfactorily address their CVD risk.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^115VQ6Uc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

There are clearly understandable problems when relying on industry-sponsored trials designed primarily to determine the benefits of statins, to ascertain the true incidence of side effects that may interfere with the quality of life. This partly reflects the high selectivity of participants in clinical trials. Pre-randomization run-in periods may also be used to exclude patients who fail to tolerate statins. For example, 36% of screened patients were excluded from the Heart Protection Study before the actual trial even began, which had the potential to screen out many patients who may have suffered from adverse effects from simvastatin, including muscle symptoms. In community-based studies, over half of statin users will cease to take the drug within a year, with 62% of those patients citing side effects as the reason. The uncontrolled nature of these large cohort studies is clearly not ideal. However, a recent article suggesting that in industry-sponsored RCTs there are no significant differences in the rates of adverse effects between active statins versus placebo groups is unhelpful. This simply adds 'false precision to biased estimates'. These trials have not adequately assessed the most commonly reported side effects reported by patients, notably muscle pains and cognitive impairment. The head of the CTT Collaboration has recently conceded that they did not assess for all possible side effects. As every practising clinician knows, such side effects are common when patients are actually asked.

A publicly funded double-blinded RCT published in the Archives of Internal Medicine involving 1,016 low-risk patients receiving simvastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg or placebo revealed that both drugs had a significant adverse effect on energy/fatigue exercise score, with up to 40% of women reporting reduced energy or fatigue with exertion.

Furthermore, it is instructive to note that Pfizer's own patient information leaflet of atorvastatin states that 'common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 patients)' of the drug include pain in the throat, nausea, indigestion, joint and muscle pain, and increases in blood sugar levels. Fortunately the majority of these symptoms may be reversible on cessation of the drug. However, the small increased 0.5–1.1% risk of type 2 diabetes now directly attributed to statins should not be dismissed lightly.

In the rifaximin data sheet, dizziness, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, rectal tenesmus, vomiting, and pyrexia are listed as frequent side effects (> 1/100 to < 1/10).

When used in HE, rifaximin side effects have been mild and infrequent. In a review article including the pivotal prophylaxis trial, rifaximin was well tolerated, and adverse events were similar to placebo group. In the pivotal study, there were two cases of infection by C. difficile versus none in the control group. In the extension study, the frequency of this infection did not increase and was reported in 6 patients. All these patients presented predisposing factors for this infection. Postmarketing studies also described cases of C. difficile infection. When rifaximin was used in prophylaxis of SBP, few side effects were observed. In a study, no side effects were described, and in others, they were uncommon, including abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, dizziness, and headache.

It has been suggested that rifaximin may favor the muscular toxicity of statins in cirrhosis. This possibility seems unlikely because only three cases of rifaximin rhabdomyolysis have been described in a postmarketing database, and it has not been observed in patients with cirrhosis treated with low doses of simvastatin (20 mg/day) together with rifaximin.

### Interplay between statins, cav1 (caveolin-1), and aldosterone [^115pNSNw]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We demonstrated that in hypertensive participants the Cav1 risk allele, rs926198, modulates the association of statin use with aldosterone. Among statin users, Cav1 risk allele carriers had a 25% (95% CI, 1–43.2) lower aldosterone level than Cav1 nonrisk allele carriers. However, among nonstatin users, there was no significant difference in aldosterone levels by Cav1 genotype, so this is a statin-specific effect. The difference in the Cav1 effect in statin users versus nonstatin users showed a significant interaction. These findings suggest that Cav1 risk allele carriers will derive the most aldosterone-lowering benefit of statins. This effect appeared to be specific to the adrenal gland as there was no effect on lipids and was also specific to aldosterone, as cortisol levels were not modified by Cav1 risk allele status.

Our assessments of aldosterone were conducted under conditions whereby the key secretagogues of aldosterone were controlled to permit an isolated investigation of other influences on aldosterone secretion. Specifically, this study controlled for multiple factors that can affect aldosterone secretion including physical activity, posture, dietary sodium intake, sleep-wake cycles, food intake, and time of day. Through these techniques, we minimize the potential noise in assessing aldosterone production.

Our findings raise several important clinical questions. Even a moderate decrease in aldosterone is likely clinically relevant. Aldosterone is a well-known key regulator of sodium and potassium balance, blood pressure, endothelial function, renal disease, and cardiovascular remodeling. Aldosterone blockers improve survival in heart failure and in patients with myocardial infarction. Thus, statins may have added benefit in individuals with the Cav1 risk allele. Because statins reduce aldosterone levels in Cav1 risk allele carriers, these individuals may be more likely to show a decrease in blood pressure with initiation of statin therapy. However, clinicians may want to avoid the aldosterone effect in patients prone to hyperkalemia or in those with already low blood pressure or orthostatic intolerance. Perhaps statins may also be useful as an adjuvant treatment for hyperaldosteronism.

### Ezetimibe and simvastatin [^114ubdid]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Ezetimibe

Other adverse reactions reported with ezetimibe in placebo-controlled studies, regardless of causality assessment: Musculoskeletal system disorders: arthralgia; Infections and infestations: sinusitis; Body as a whole – general disorders: fatigue.

Simvastatin

In a clinical trial in which 12,064 patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] > 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK > 40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.

Other adverse reactions reported with simvastatin in placebo-controlled clinical studies, regardless of causality assessment: Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation; Ear and labyrinth disorders: vertigo; Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastritis; Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: eczema, rash; Endocrine disorders: diabetes mellitus; Infections and infestations: bronchitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections; Body as a whole – general disorders: asthenia, edema/swelling; Psychiatric disorders: insomnia.

Laboratory Tests

Marked persistent increases of hepatic serum transaminases have been noted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have been reported. About 5% of patients taking simvastatin had elevations of CK levels of 3 or more times the normal value on one or more occasions. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Cardiovascular risk management in persons with dementia [^1178wg3R]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and diastolic hypotension

Compared to cognitive healthy individuals, persons with dementia are more likely to suffer from orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is particularly true for atypical Parkinsonian disorders such as Lewy body dementia and to a lesser extent for AD and VaD. In addition, due to treatment of systolic hypertension, diastolic hypotension is often induced, particularly in older persons with coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. Diastolic hypotension and OH have been related to an increased risk of cardiac events, mortality, falling, and cognitive decline. Moreover, OH is a significant predictor of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia. The hypotension/hypoperfusion damage hypothesis states that episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion lead to small-vessel disease, neurodegeneration, and progression of dementia. It is therefore possible that excessive BP lowering in persons with dementia worsens cognition through cerebral hypoperfusion. However, it remains unclear at which BP level the harms of low DBP outweigh the benefits of lowering SBP. Since persons with dementia are more likely to suffer from OH, BP should be measured supine (after minimum of 5 minutes of bed rest) and thereafter repeatedly upon standing, up to 3–5 minutes, at 1 minute intervals or continuously. Medication should be adjusted when OH is diagnosed.

Risk of adverse drug events

Polypharmacy is common among persons with dementia. As a result of the cognitive impairment itself and drug-drug interactions, persons with dementia are at high risk of adverse drug reactions. Especially cardiovascular medication (ACE-inhibitors, alpha and beta blockers), psychotropic and analgesic drugs are associated with (preventable) adverse drug events such as falls. With regard to statin treatment, one should be aware of drug-drug interactions that interfere with the metabolism and therefore elimination of statin, thereby increasing risk of adverse events such as myopathy. In persons with dementia, adverse drugs events are probably underreported due to memory bias and under-recognition due to unspecific signs. Persons with dementia should therefore be closely monitored for adverse drug reactions by their treating clinician.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^111oD8yT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance and side effects — evaluation and management — notes that symptoms reported with statin use include mainly muscle-related complaints (myalgias), and observational studies have failed to find significant evidence for memory loss in those on longer-term statin therapy, despite anecdotal reports of short-term memory impairment. Because musculoskeletal complaints are common without statin therapy, an evaluation of such complaints to assess other possible causes should be undertaken before attributing symptoms to statins, and concomitant therapies may interact with statins, increasing the risk of muscle symptoms. For patients with statin intolerance, symptoms may improve when switched to a different statin; other strategies that may be used include limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens such as every other day or once weekly dosing with statins that have a long half-life. In some patients, it may be possible to switch to an alternative concomitant therapy to enhance statin tolerance, and for patients who cannot tolerate a statin within the previously discussed strategies, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. A modest increase in risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed with statin therapy in RCTs, and higher intensity statin therapy appears to increase risk to a greater extent than less-intensive regimens.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112VTK5P]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

Bempedoic acid — mechanism and LDL-C lowering in statin-intolerant patients — is described as inhibiting ATP-citrate lyase upstream of HMG CoA reductase, being administered orally as a prodrug activated in liver cells but not muscle cells, and as a possible advantage in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms; in the CLEAR Tranquility and CLEAR Serenity trials, monotherapy with bempedoic acid 180 mg daily in patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms on no statin therapy reduced LDL-C levels by approximately 24.5% compared with placebo.

### Optimizing cholesterol treatment in patients with muscle complaints [^116uPHLm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Statins are highly effective for preventing cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, many patients taking statins report muscle-related symptoms that prevent the use of guideline recommended doses. Patients with reported intolerance to statins have a high risk of cardiovascular events. Clinical strategies that optimize cardiovascular risk reduction through LDL-C lowering need to be applied in patients experiencing intolerable side effects that they attribute to statins. In this paper, the authors review definitions of statin intolerance, propose algorithms to better define statin intolerance, and describe approaches to optimize cardiovascular risk reduction among individuals reporting statin-associated muscle symptoms.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^115ugytU]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the most widely prescribed drug in the Western world. Their use is predicted to rise further due to recent reductions in the cardiovascular risk threshold for statin prescription across the globe. However, cardiovascular benefits of statins are restricted by adverse effects that limit adherence, and, in turn, increase cardiovascular eventsand mortality. The most common side effects and main reason for discontinuation of therapy emerge from skeletal muscle (statin myopathy or statin-associated adverse muscle symptoms). Although no strict definition of statin myopathy has been universally adopted, we use this term to encompass the full spectrum of the effects of statins on skeletal muscle. This includes mild to moderate muscle symptoms and/or signs (myalgia: muscle pain with stiffness and weakness), as well as more severe potentially life-threatening outcomes (myositis and/or rhabdomyolysis) that are associated with raised creatine kinase. Although physical activity counteracts metabolic and cardiovascular diseases that are prevalent in subjects prescribed statins, exercise has been reported to exacerbate statin myopathy, which may further limit the benefits of statins in those at risk of cardiovascular disease.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^111HbPYV]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Approach to the patient with statin intolerance

Statin intolerance can be a significant barrier to optimal lipid management (Fig. 5). Adverse effects attributed to statins that can lead to discontinuation are numerous, and include those that affect the musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurocognitive, and nervous systems. The most prevalent of these are the statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). These can take the form of muscle pain, aches, stiffness, tenderness, or cramps and usually present without elevations in CK. There is no universally accepted definition for SAMS, although the National Lipid Association has proposed a clinical scoring system based on symptomatology and temporal associations. There is significant heterogeneity in SAMS presentation; most common is involvement of the proximal large muscle groups including the thighs, buttocks, calves, and back muscles, typically in a symmetrical pattern. These symptoms usually occur within the first 4 to 6 weeks after statin initiation but may occur after several years of treatment. SAMS with CK elevations > 10× ULN occurs in 1 in 10 000 and rhabdomyolysis in 1 in 100 000 individuals per year of statin treatment.

### Statin precipitated lactic acidosis? [^117M5uEq]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

An 82 year old woman was admitted with worsening dyspnoea. Arterial blood gases were taken on air and revealed a pH of 7.39, with a partial pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂) of 1.2 kPa, pO₂ of 19.3 kPa, HCO₃ of 13.8 mmol/litre, and base excess of -16.3 mmol/litre: a compensated metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation induced hypocapnia, which is known to be a feature of lactic acidosis. There was also an increased anion gap ((Na140 + K4.0) - (Cl 106 + HCO₃ 13.8) = 24.2 mEq/litre (reference range, 7–16)), consistent with unmeasured cation. Lactate was measured and found to be raised at 3.33 mmol/litre (reference range, 0.9–1.7). After exclusion of common causes of lactic acidosis Atorvastatin was stopped and her acid-base balance returned to normal. Subsequently, thiamine was also shown to be deficient. The acidosis was thought to have been the result of a mitochondrial defect caused by a deficiency of two cofactors, namely: ubiquinone (as a result of inhibition by statin) and thiamine (as a result of dietary deficiency).

Women and statin adverse drug reactions — risk factors and clinical vigilance: It has been estimated that women tend to be at a 1.5–1.7 times greater risk for clinically significant adverse drug reactions compared to men; gender differences in body fat, muscle mass, quantities of CYP450 metabolic enzymes, coenzyme Q10 levels, pain perception and reporting, and genetic polymorphisms may contribute, and women with ASCVD or at high ASCVD risk are likely to be older with more comorbidities and polypharmacy that can lead to CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions and increased systemic exposure to statins with resulting adverse events. In summary, clinicians should be particularly aware of the potential for elevated adverse events with taking statins in women, particularly glucose elevations and myalgia.

### A generalised sensation of coldness following introduction of rosuvastatin therapy [^116wMzdf]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Rosuvastatin is the most potent 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor commercially available to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Rosuvastatin has been associated with several adverse effects, including rhabdomyolysis and arthralgias. Here, we report an unusual adverse effect occurring on treatment with rosuvastatin, a 'continuous sensation of coldness'. A 60-year-old man began experiencing this peculiar feeling shortly after introduction of rosuvastatin treatment. The gentleman had to wear extra pair of socks and cover himself with blankets while reading, even during summer with surrounding temperature above 30°C. The abnormal sensation persisted for the 26months during which he was treated with rosuvastatin, and disappeared within a week after discontinuing treatment. Physical examination, including thorough neurological examination, was entirely normal, as were haematological and biochemical parameters. While the pathophysiology of this phenomenon remains unknown, we hope that this case will encourage others to report similar symptomatology, perhaps enabling to gain more insight on the condition.

### A novel mechanism to explain statin-associated skeletal muscle Symptoms [^112gKDRs]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

The first commercially available statin, lovastatin, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987. The first cases of lovastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis were reported in cardiac transplant patients in 1988. Reports of increased creatine kinase (CK) levels associated with exercise were reported in 1990. Thus, one would think that by 2019 we would definitively know what physiological mechanisms cause statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), how exercise affects SAMS and vice versa, and why statins affect skeletal, but not cardiac, muscle. But we do not. There is not even consensus that statins cause SAMS in the absence of overt muscle damage as evidenced by increased CK levels.

In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Lotteau et al.present a series of elegant studies examining the mechanisms producing SAMS, an explanation of why skeletal and not cardiac muscles are affected, and new evidence on the interaction of exercise and statin treatment. A full description of the protocols used to develop and support this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this editorial but we present here the salient points.

Switching statins in SAMS — tolerability considerations note that "All seven FDA-approved statins are pharmacologically unique, with differences in biotransformation pathways, half-life, elimination routes, and lipophilicity (Table 7)". "Switching to a statin that is metabolized by a different enzyme system, avoids various transporters, or is less lipophilic may improve drug tolerability". Evidence cited includes that "fluvastatin and pravastatin are better tolerated as compared to atorvastatin and simvastatin17, but this may be related in part to their lower LDL-C lowering efficacy". The statement also highlights that "The low milligram amount with pitavastatin dosing (1, 2, or 4 mg) may be more psychologically appealing to patients who prefer the "lowest milligram strength".

In patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), a thorough assessment of symptoms is recommended, in addition to an evaluation for nonstatin causes and predisposing factors.

Primary outcomes

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that causes death, is life‐threatening, requires hospitalisation, results in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. We therefore extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

### Simvastatin-induced meralgia paresthetica [^113Rhyjc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) cause mainly muscular adverse effects. During the last 20 years there has been solid evidence of peripheral neuropathy caused by statins, with a risk of one in 10,000 patients treated for 1 year. Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment neuropathy occasionally encountered by primary care physicians. To date there has been no report of entrapment neuropathy that could have been caused or aggravated by statins. This case report presents meralgia paresthetica aggravated by simvastatin use that disappeared after simvastatin cessation.

### Management of kidney transplant recipients for primary care practitioners [^1158NEJG]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alpha-blockers such as doxazosin or prazosin may prove useful for individuals with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. However, it is important to avoid alpha-blockers in patients experiencing orthostatic hypotension. Thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics could be beneficial for patients dealing with edema and hyperkalemia. In cases of allograft dysfunction, where increased volume often contributes to elevated blood pressure, a diuretic might also be considered necessary.

Dyslipidemia

Post-transplant dyslipidemia is widely prevalent, and when considering post-transplant therapies for dyslipidemia, two primary outcomes come into play: the preservation or enhancement of allograft function and the reduction of cardiovascular risk. A range of mechanisms contribute to the development of post-transplant dyslipidemia, some of which are influenced by immunosuppressive drug therapy. In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that aimed to explore the effects of fluvastatin on cardiac outcomes in individuals who had received renal transplants demonstrated that a 32% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels in those who received the statin. While the primary endpoint risk reduction with fluvastatin was not statistically significant, the fluvastatin group experienced fewer cardiac deaths or non-fatal myocardial infarctions compared to the placebo group. Other secondary outcomes, including coronary interventions, showed no significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, statins may have a positive impact on certain cardiac outcomes in renal transplant recipients.

The recommended treatment approach involves proper dietary guidance, non-pharmacological measures, and statins. Throughout all stages of treatment, it is imperative to implement suitable monitoring strategies for potential side effects such as liver toxicity or rhabdomyolysis as statins undergo significant liver metabolism primarily facilitated by the cytochrome P450 complex, with CYP3A4 playing a prominent role. Fluvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin follow distinct cytochrome pathways for metabolism, resulting in infrequent involvement in drug-drug interactions. While most statins display lipophilic characteristics, the hydrophilic nature of pravastatin and rosuvastatin sets the foundation for their heightened safety profile.

### The nocebo effect in the context of statin intolerance [^112QuGTG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

The nocebo effect, the inverse of the placebo effect, is a well-established phenomenon that is under-appreciated in cardiovascular medicine. It refers to adverse events, usually purely subjective, that result from expectations of harm from a drug, placebo, other therapeutic intervention or a nonmedical situation. These expectations can be driven by many factors including the informed consent form in a clinical trial, warnings about adverse effects communicated by clinicians when prescribing a drug, and information in the media about the dangers of certain treatments. The nocebo effect is the best explanation for the high rate of muscle and other symptoms attributed to statins in observational studies and clinical practice, but not in randomized controlled trials, where muscle symptoms, and rates of discontinuation due to any adverse event, are generally similar in the statin and placebo groups. Statin-intolerant patients usually tolerate statins under double-blind conditions, indicating that the intolerance has little if any pharmacological basis. Known techniques for minimizing the nocebo effect can be applied to the prevention and management of statin intolerance.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^116R3God]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statin-based approaches.

Since statins are the only agents with a robust body of evidence proving reduction in clinical end points, every effort should be made to keep high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen.

Switching statins may be efficacious. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who received another statin after an episode of statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without recurrent symptoms. Considering the results of the PRIMO study, the use of statins associated with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, may be considered, although these statins may not be potent enough if a large reduction of LDL cholesterol is needed to reach target values. In one study, 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily (as a slow-release preparation) was tolerated in 97% of patients with prior statin intolerance owing to muscle-related symptoms, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 32.8%.

Another approach evaluated in several studies involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, in low doses or at a reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For example, in a retrospective analysis of 51 patients with a statin, alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated in 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

Effects on hepatic function

It is difficult to determine the role of statins in the extremely rare cases of severe liver injury associated with statins. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure and the need for liver transplantation in Western countries. The most common biomarkers for DILI are alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hepatocellular injury is generally detected by elevations in serum ALT or AST, elevated ALP marks injury to cells in the bile excretory ducts, and elevated serum total or conjugated bilirubin is indicative of reduced excretory function of the liver. In most cases, DILI is rare, idiosyncratic and unpredictable. Moreover, estimating the frequency of DILI is challenging due to potential genetic, epigenetic, environmental and clinical factors that may confound accurate diagnosis. Liver-mediated drug metabolism and transport have also been implicated in mechanisms underlying DILI (Figure 3). These interacting factors plus the rarity of severe liver toxicity associated with statins, contribute to the difficulty in assessing the role of statins in DILI.

Time-course of onset and offset of symptoms

We studied whether the intensity of symptom onset when starting tablets indicated whether that tablet was statin (Figure 3). The top panel of Figure 3 shows the time course of symptoms, averaged across all patients. The lower panel shows full raw data of every 2-month period where a participant transitioned from a no-tablet (gray) to a tablet month (red for statin, blue for placebo), ordered by the increment in intensity.

Symptom Time Course in Days Before and After Starting Tablets

(Top) The symptom pattern averaged across all patients. (Bottom) The symptom scores during each unique 2-month period where a patient transitioned between a no-tablet month (gray) and a tablet month (red for statin, blue for placebo). The dotted vertical line shows the time of starting tablets. These periods are arranged so the largest increase in symptom scores on starting tablets is in the top left, and the lowest in the bottom right.

Intensity of symptom onset did not predict whether the tablet was statin or placebo (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.98–1.06; P = 0.28). Figure 4 mirrors this for symptom relief on stopping tablets. Because some tablet months were stopped early, the 2-month periods in the lower panel of Figure 4 sometimes have an earlier transition than scheduled.

The magnitude of symptom relief did not predict whether the tablet was statin or placebo (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98–1.05; P = 0.48). Symptom relief was strikingly rapid. Scores fell by more than one-half within 3 days of stopping tablets on 55% of occasions, regardless of whether the tablet was statin (50% of occasions) or placebo (60% of occasions).

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^113FSL2h]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statin therapy is the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is generally safe and well tolerated. In randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), adverse event rates (including complaints of muscle pain) are similar in statin and placebo groups, – and compare favourably with event rates for other agents commonly used in CVD prevention, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsand beta-blockers. However, statins do cause a rare side-effect known as myositis, defined as muscle symptoms in association with a substantially elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. Creatine kinase is the enzyme released from damaged muscle cells, and CK elevations > 10× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people per year, depending on the statin, its dose, and the presence of other risk factors. Over the last decade, a series of observational studies have attributed a number of other adverse effects to statins, including musculoskeletal complaints, gastro-intestinal discomfort, fatigue, liver enzyme elevation, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, and neurocognitive symptoms. In addition, randomized trials have shown a small increase in the risk of incident diabetes. – Muscle symptoms, the most prevalent of these effects, are the focus of this review.

In contrast to RCTs, patient registries, together with clinical experience, indicate that 7–29% of patients complain of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). – These are usually associated with normal or slightly elevated CK concentrations. Statin-associated muscle symptoms likely contribute significantly to the very high discontinuation rates of statin therapy (up to 75%) within 2 years of initiation. Indeed, in 65% of former statin users, the main reason for statin non-adherence or discontinuation was the onset of side effects, predominantly muscle-related effects. Such non-adherence/discontinuation from treatment may have a marked impact on CVD benefit, as suggested by the higher mortality in elderly secondary prevention patients with low vs. high adherence to statin therapy (24% vs. 16%, respectively; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25; P = 0.001). Similarly, a meta-analysis showed a 15% lower CVD risk in patients who were adherent to statins compared with those with low adherence.

### Association of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with neuropathy [^1118BKs6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the possible association between statins and peripheral neuropathy.

Data Sources

Literature was obtained from MEDLINE (1984-September 2002) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002). Key search terms included statin, neuropathy, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.

Data Synthesis

Epidemiologic studies and case reports suggest an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy with statin drugs. Most patients were receiving long-term therapy, although the onset was highly variable. The majority of cases were at least partially reversible with drug cessation. Specific risk factors or mechanisms have not been identified.

Conclusions

Observational data suggest a link between chronic statin use and increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. However, the risk appears to be small relative to the significant cardioprotective benefits.

Early stopping of tablet months caused by intolerable symptoms

In total, 31 of 60 patients stopped at least 1 tablet month early (comprising 26 stopping statin, and an overlapping 23 stopping placebo). A total of 84 tablet months were stopped early: 46 of 213 statin months (21.6%), with median time to stopping of 15 days (IQR: 6–20 days), and 38 of 221 placebo months (17.2%), with median time to stopping of 18 days (IQR: 9–21 days).

Stopping was not significantly more frequent for statin than placebo (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 0.85–2.62; P = 0.173) (Central Illustration, right panel). There were 8 patients who only stopped a statin month early, and 5 who only stopped a placebo month early.

Participants who did not complete the trial

In all, 11 participants did not complete the full 12 months of the trial. Five withdrew because of severe symptoms. Participant 17 withdrew after an increasingly symptomatic placebo month. Participant 22 had extreme symptoms immediately in their second and third statin months, but not their first. Participant 40 experienced marked symptoms during their 2 statin months but withdrew from the trial before trying a placebo month. Participant 42 stopped 1 placebo month and 1 statin month early. Finally, participant 54 stopped 2 placebo months early, but not their only statin month.

### Statin-associated side effects [^1142C9w9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are well tolerated, but associated with various statin-associated symptoms (SAS), including statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), diabetes mellitus (DM), and central nervous system complaints. These are "statin-associated symptoms" because they are rare in clinical trials, making their causative relationship to statins unclear. SAS are, nevertheless, important because they prompt dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving mediations. SAMS is the most frequent SAS, and mild myalgia may affect 5% to 10% of statin users. Clinically important muscle symptoms, including rhabdomyolysis and statin-induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SINAM), are rare. Antibodies against HMG-CoA reductase apparently provoke SINAM. Good evidence links statins to DM, but evidence linking statins to other SAS is largely anecdotal. Management of SAS requires making the possible diagnosis, altering or discontinuing the statin treatment, and using alternative lipid-lowering therapy.

### Statin intolerance in a referral lipid clinic [^115gd5fc]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Statins effectively prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but rates of statin discontinuation after adverse events are high.

Objective

Describe the range and relative frequencies of adverse events potentially attributable to statins in lipid referral practice and assess statin rechallenge outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 642 patients with statin-associated adverse events evaluated in a referral lipid clinic between January 1, 2004 and January 27, 2011.

Results

Patients experiencing adverse events by organ system included 92% with musculoskeletal, 8% central nervous system, 10% liver, 8% gastrointestinal, 5% peripheral nervous system, 5% skin, and 3% other events. Overlap of organ system involvement occurred in 22.5%. At least 1 follow-up visit was made by 557 patients, among whom overall median follow-up was 25 months. Among patients treated with a statin in the clinic, 71% remained on a statin at the last follow-up visit. Patients with hepatic transaminase increases by history were numerically more likely than the overall group to resume or remain on statin treatment, whereas those reporting central nervous system or gastrointestinal symptoms trended lower for statin maintenance. Among patients who experienced an adverse event after statin rechallenge, the majority (64%) were being treated with intermittent, nondaily dosing at the time of the adverse event.

Conclusion

Although musculoskeletal symptoms are reported by 90% of patients with statin intolerance, symptoms involving other organ systems may be more frequent than previously supposed. Understanding the range of symptoms, time course, and impact on daily activities informs counseling in patient-centered practice, but assessment of causation by statins remains challenging.

### Shared decisions: a qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^114rnpA5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

However, clinicians noted that statin initiation is more difficult for primary prevention patients in whom there are no current symptoms. Yet, the decision to engage in statin therapy should align with patients' wishes. A cardiology clinician who frequently managed statin intolerance stated,

I can't guide them (ie, the patients), and they have to guide me in terms of taking statins to extend life (ie, quantity of life) but weighing that against the impact of side effects on the patient's quality of life.

Both clinician and patient interviews indicated how patients frequently voiced their concerns about SASEs to their clinicians. Patient response was mixed when it came to clinicians inquiring about the onset of SASEs. Some patients felt their clinicians communicated with them about adverse effects when they came for routine tests, but a few patients struggled talking with their clinicians when SASEs developed. For example, one clinician was not convinced that a patient's perceived adverse effects were caused by statin therapy:

I told him (ie, the clinician)… I'm having some type of reaction from the medication. And he told me no, that wasn't reaction from that medication. But I already had Googled it online and it had said, you know, having red spots or red streaks down your leg was a reaction to the medication. And I showed it to him…

Another patient believed his/her clinician had the right intentions initiating statins, even switching statin medications and reducing the dose. However, the patient still struggled communicating with the clinician about balancing the benefits of statins with what the patient felt was intolerable statin‐induced myalgia:

And I knew he (ie, clinician) was right, so what do you tell him? I mean… it's not that I don't want to take them (ie, statins), it's that I should just, I can't take them, they won't work.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1111JbmU]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Ranolazine–statin interactions — mechanism, magnitude, and dosing guidance — are highlighted with emphasis on simvastatin and lovastatin. Ranolazine is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6, and it is also a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and simvastatin-ranolazine combination therapy results in an ≈50% increase in AUC and doubling of Cmax of simvastatin. Although the toxicity impact is unclear, there have been at least 3 case reports, and clinically significant DDIs with ranolazine and statins other than simvastatin have not been reported. The FDA-approved product labeling recommends that the maximum dose of simvastatin be limited to 20 mg daily when given in combination with ranolazine, and caution is recommended when lovastatin is used with ranolazine although no specific dose limitation is recommended. For other statins, coadministration of ranolazine with rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, and pravastatin may be considered if clinically indicated, and combination therapy with ranolazine and simvastatin or lovastatin may be considered.

### A mechanism for statin-induced susceptibility to myopathy [^114Q81CU]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2019). Medium credibility.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: There are several barriers to clinical translation of this work. The first is the sheer scale of the problem, because of the number of people who are (and should be) prescribed statins. Second, we have not yet identified directly the conditions that precipitate overt myopathy, although our data provided a strong indication of what these factors may be. Third, there are currently no cost-effective alternative antilipidemic agents that match the efficacy of statins for those at high risk of myopathy. Statins confer additional therapeutic benefits independent of their ability to lower serum cholesterol (pleiotropic actions), which are not evident with other drugs. For example, the recently licensed PCSK9 inhibitors cost 50 to 100 times more than generic statins and lack the pleiotropic actions effects of statins.

Statin metabolism and drug–drug interactions — when selecting a statin, it is important to consider how other medications might interact with statin pharmacokinetics, because strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 or important drug transporters such as organic anion transport protein 1B1 (OATP1B1) or P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) will increase the plasma concentration of certain statins and potentially increase the risk for SAMS. A recent review by Hirota T. et al. provides an overview of pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacogenetics of statins and clinician recommendations for statin dosing.

Phase III Clinical Studies

In Phase III controlled clinical studies involving 613 patients treated with lovastatin, the adverse experience profile was similar to that shown below for the 8,245-patient EXCEL study (see Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin [EXCEL] Study).

Persistent increases of serum transaminases have been noted (see WARNINGS, Liver Dysfunction). About 11% of patients had elevations of CK levels of at least twice the normal value on one or more occasions. The corresponding values for the control agent cholestyramine was 9 percent. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK. Large increases in CK have sometimes been reported (see WARNINGS, Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis).

Lovastatin was compared to placebo in 8,245 patients with hypercholesterolemia (total-C 240–300 mg/dL [6.2–7.8 mmol/L]) in the randomized, double-blind, parallel, 48-week EXCEL study. Clinical adverse experiences reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in ≥ 1% in any treatment group are shown in the table below. For no event was the incidence on drug and placebo statistically different.

Other clinical adverse experiences reported as possibly, probably or definitely drug-related in 0.5 to 1.0 percent of patients in any drug-treated group are listed below. In all these cases the incidence on drug and placebo was not statistically different.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, chiefly myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, accounted for approximately 18 million deaths worldwide in 2019, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major causal risk factor. Randomised controlled trials have shown that the long-term reduction of LDL cholesterol concentrations with an 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (ie, a statin) reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and of ischaemic stroke by approximately a quarter for every 1 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction achieved, which corresponds to the avoidance of approximately 50 major vascular events in those with pre-existing vascular disease (secondary prevention), and 25 major vascular events when used for primary prevention, in every 1000 people administered this therapy for 5 years. Moreover, a more intensive statin regimen (ie, 40–80 mg atorvastatin once per day, or 20–40 mg rosuvastatin once per day), which could reduce LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L, would prevent twice as many major vascular events, and longer treatment yields greater benefits. For a given reduction in LDL cholesterol, similar proportional reductions in risk are seen across a wide range of patients (including men and women, older and younger patients, and those with and without a previous history of cardiovascular disease). Consequently, statins are now used by millions of people worldwide.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised trials, meta-analyses, or review articles published in any language between Jan 1, 1990, and June 1, 2021, that had specifically assessed the effects of statin regimens on muscle symptoms. These previous randomised trials, and several meta-analyses of published data from such trials, indicated that statins cause a small excess risk of muscle pain, but these studies might be affected by biases due to missing data. Observational studies, and meta-analyses including such studies, have also estimated the prevalence of statin-associated muscle symptoms, but such studies are subject to reporting biases and other biases, and cannot reliably establish the causal contribution of statins to such symptoms. There is a need, therefore, for a reliable assessment of the effects of various statin regimens on muscle symptoms in different clinical circumstances.

Alternative statin selection for rechallenge after CYP3A4/P-gp exposure: If a patient had adverse drug reactions while taking both atorvastatin and simvastatin, which rely on CYP3A4 and P-gp for biotransformation and are lipophilic, an appropriate alternative for statin rechallenge may be rosuvastatin or pravastatin, which circumvent shared pharmacokinetic properties, metabolizing enzymes (avoid CYP3A4), and transporters (avoid P-gp) compared to atorvastatin and simvastatin.

### Clinical conundrums involving statin drug-drug interactions [^114SzZq3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of pharmacologic therapy for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. While they are generally considered safe, statins can be affected by drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that increase their systemic exposure increasing the risk for statin-associated muscle symptoms. These interactions are primarily mediated through metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and membrane-bound drug transporting proteins including P-glycoprotein and organic ion transporting polypeptide. Recognition and avoidance of clinically significant statin DDIs is important to ensure their safe use. Conversely, concern over statin DDIs that are not clinically significant may lead to inappropriate underutilization or avoidance of statins in patients who would benefit from them. While many statin DDIs are well-characterized, we present several others that are less-well-established which may warrant clinical attention.

### Statin-associated adverse effects beyond muscle and liver toxicity [^113pL5zS]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Randomized controlled trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are currently the most widely used drugs in many countries. The most important adverse effects are associated with muscle and liver toxicity. However, with increased use and dose of statins and their over-the-counter availability in some countries more cases of other rare side effects may be seen in clinical practice. In the present article we review the literature concerning the statin-related adverse effects other than muscle and liver injury and we provide insight into their clinical relevance and possible underlying mechanisms.

### An assessment by the statin intolerance panel: 2014 update [^116F8k6U]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

This article from the National Lipid Association Statin Intolerance Panel provides a framework for understanding statin intolerance and makes general recommendations for health professionals. For specific guidance on adverse events related to muscle, liver, cognition, and glucose metabolism, one should refer to the other reports of the Statin Safety Task Force for those topics. Although statin adverse effects rarely lead to permanent sequelae, symptomatic intolerance frequently hinders cardiovascular risk reduction by statins. We emphasize here the advisory role of the clinician helping each patient to make personal decisions on statin tolerability. We identify a pressing need for further research on statin intolerance and make suggestions for research design.

Other side effects of statins are muscle myalgia, muscle cramps and fatigue which potentially can prevent a physically active lifestyle. The biomedical background of these side effects is not fully elucidated but it has been shown that there is a link to decreasing levels of an important enzyme, Q10, which plays a role in muscle energy metabolism. Hypothesis The overarching research question is: why does statin treatment cause muscle pain. Does statin treatment impair physical exercise training. Furthermore we would like to answer the following questions:

- Does statin treatment impair physical exercise training. Does statin treatment cause:

- Decreased muscle strength.
- Skeletal muscle inflammation.
- Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function.
- Abnormal glucose homeostasis.

THE DOWN-SIDE Rhabdomyolysis is an infrequent but serious side-effect of statin use, that can on rare occasion lead to acute renal failure and death). Statin use is much more frequently associated with muscle dysfunction, including myalgia, cramps, and weakness. The reported incidence of myalgia varies from 1% to as high as 75% in statin-treated athletes. Mild to severe myalgia is a strong disincentive to regular exercise, and because regular exercise is one of the critical life-style approaches to preventing CVD and reducing blood cholesterol, this is a significant down-side of statin use. Regular exercise is also effective in preventing and treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, which themselves are risk factors for CVD. The mechanism behind the myalgia is not known.

However, we have recently demonstrated that muscle mitochondrial function is impaired with statin treatment and the Q10 protein may play a key role in this. In addition, the statins also negatively affect the glucose tolerance, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: The overarching research question is: why does statin treatment cause muscle pain. We are not the only research group in the world that try to answer that question, but we are the only one that has indeed provided a mechanistic explanation, and provided a proof-of-concept. We will now test this in a larger patient population.

Primary outcomes

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life‐threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — statin tolerability can be further optimized through dose reductions, changing to a different statin, or intermittent dosing, with evidence suggesting approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen; when statin monotherapy is insufficient to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals, non-statin therapies need to be used prioritizing therapies with proven cardiovascular benefit, and treatment is incomplete until LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals have been achieved.
