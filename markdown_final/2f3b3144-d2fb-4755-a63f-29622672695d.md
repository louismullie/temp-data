## Question

Can an atropine infusion be used to reverse hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an atropine infusion can be used to reverse hypertension (i.e., lower elevated blood pressure). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about atropine's pharmacologic mechanism and its expected hemodynamic effects. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indications and whether hypertension appears anywhere as an approved use. Next, I will review clinical scenarios where atropine affects blood pressure (anesthesia, toxicology) to ensure I'm not missing an antihypertensive role. After that, I should check contemporary hypertension guidelines to see if atropine is mentioned. Finally, I will synthesize the mechanism, indications, evidence, and safety considerations to answer the question conclusively [^114VCUjo] [^116pQoiU] [^115YF4pY] [^1145Uf7o].

> Let me consider the mechanism first. Atropine is a competitive muscarinic antagonist that blocks parasympathetic (vagal) input, increasing heart rate and shortening AV conduction time; it does not provide direct vasodilation or reduction in systemic vascular resistance, which are primary mechanisms needed to lower blood pressure in hypertension. In bradycardic hypotension, atropine can increase cardiac output and thus raise blood pressure, but that is the opposite of an antihypertensive effect. I should confirm: the Atropen labeling explicitly states atropine increases heart rate and reduces AV nodal conduction, consistent with a chronotropic, not vasodilatory, profile [^115T8ZH6].

> I need to check the labeled indications next. FDA sources list atropine for symptomatic bradycardia, bradyasystolic cardiac arrest, organophosphate/carbamate and muscarinic mushroom poisoning, and ophthalmic uses (mydriasis/cycloplegia). Continuous infusion appears in certain toxicologic contexts (e.g., maintenance dosing for muscarinic mushroom poisoning), but hypertension is not an indication anywhere on these labels. Hold on, I should verify multiple SPL entries to be certain — none list hypertension as a use, nor do they suggest antihypertensive effects as a therapeutic target [^114VCUjo] [^1161bL6J] [^1127WjiN] [^111toYVS].

> Next, I should review evidence where atropine has blood pressure effects to ensure I'm not overlooking an antihypertensive signal. In anesthesia studies, prophylactic atropine attenuates bradycardia and reduces the incidence or magnitude of hypotension during induction with propofol/remifentanil and during spinal anesthesia. Wait, let me verify the directionality: atropine prevented low blood pressure by preventing bradycardia, thereby supporting its pressor tendency in vagally mediated settings, not a role in lowering high blood pressure [^115YF4pY] [^11627SDP].

> I will now examine toxicology scenarios where hemodynamics are often deranged. In calcium channel blocker poisoning, expert recommendations reserve atropine for symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances; hypertension is managed with other agents, not atropine. I should double-check overdose labels too: diltiazem overdose guidance uses atropine for bradycardia and vasopressors/calcium for hypotension; there is no role for atropine as an antihypertensive. This pattern reinforces that atropine's therapeutic niche is chronotropy/conduction, not systemic vasodilation or afterload reduction [^116UApcQ] [^115qi93o] [^1158zTHq] [^116tya22].

> Let me review organophosphate poisoning, where atropine is often given as high-dose boluses and infusions. The clinical objective is atropinization (drying secretions, reversing bronchorrhea/bronchospasm, treating bradycardia), frequently alongside oximes such as pralidoxime, which can reduce atropine requirements. Hold on, I should verify the endpoints reported: trials and guidance emphasize reductions in atropine dose and ventilatory needs, not blood pressure lowering, and indeed atropine's tachycardic effect can increase rate-pressure product rather than reduce it. No antihypertensive role emerges from these data either [^1145Uf7o] [^11252PSh] [^1139GmJL].

> Next, I should review guidelines for hypertension. Contemporary European guidelines for hypertension and hypertensive emergencies outline vasodilators and other antihypertensives by scenario; atropine does not appear as a therapy to reduce blood pressure. In pregnancy-associated severe hypertension with pulmonary edema, for instance, an IV nitroglycerin infusion is recommended, which further underscores that guideline-directed therapies are vasodilators or agents affecting vascular tone/volume — again, not atropine. Thus, guideline silence plus alternative recommended agents argue strongly against any antihypertensive role for atropine [^116pQoiU].

> But wait, what about safety and pathophysiology in a hypertensive patient? Atropine reliably causes tachycardia and can increase rate-pressure product, potentially raising myocardial oxygen demand — particularly undesirable in coronary disease and in systolic hypertension. I need to ensure the source supports the chronotropic effect: the label documents atropine-induced increases in heart rate and conduction changes, and there is no compensatory vasodilatory mechanism that would lower systemic vascular resistance. Using atropine to treat high blood pressure risks physiologic counterproductivity and potential harm in susceptible patients [^115T8ZH6].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should be explicit: there is a mechanism mismatch (no vasodilation/afterload reduction), an absence of labeled or guideline indications, clinical evidence that atropine prevents hypotension in bradycardic states rather than lowering high blood pressure, and plausible safety concerns from tachycardia in hypertensive or ischemic patients. Therefore, no — an atropine infusion cannot and should not be used to reverse hypertension; guideline-directed antihypertensives and vasodilators should be used instead [^115T8ZH6] [^114VCUjo] [^116pQoiU].

Atropine infusion is **not used to reverse hypertension** [^114VCUjo]; it is a muscarinic antagonist that increases heart rate and can cause hypertension as a side effect. Atropine is indicated for bradycardia [^1158zTHq], organophosphate or carbamate poisoning [^115fu3Zy], and as an antisialagogue, **not for hypertension management** [^114VCUjo]. If hypertension occurs during atropine infusion, stop the infusion and treat with standard antihypertensive agents and supportive measures.

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of atropine

Atropine competitively blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors [^115T8ZH6], reducing parasympathetic tone, increasing heart rate, and decreasing secretions. It **does not lower blood pressure** and may increase it via tachycardia and reduced vagal tone.

---

## Clinical indications for atropine infusion

Atropine is indicated for:

- **Bradycardia**: Symptomatic bradycardia or AV block [^1158zTHq].
- **Organophosphate or carbamate poisoning**: Antidote for cholinergic crisis [^115fu3Zy].
- **Antisialagogue**: Reduce secretions preoperatively.

It is **not indicated for hypertension management**.

---

## Atropine and hypertension

Atropine can **cause hypertension** as an adverse effect, especially in high doses or sensitive patients, due to increased heart rate and reduced vagal tone. It is not used to reverse hypertension and may worsen it.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

No guidelines recommend **atropine for hypertension**; it is indicated for bradycardia, organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, and as an antisialagogue [^114VCUjo]. If hypertension occurs during atropine infusion, stop the infusion and treat with standard antihypertensives and supportive care.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of atropine infusion

Atropine infusion can cause:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Tachycardia, hypertension, arrhythmias.
- **Central nervous system effects**: Confusion, delirium, seizures.
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting.
- **Ocular effects**: Mydriasis, blurred vision.

These risks make it **unsuitable for hypertension management**.

---

## Alternative pharmacological interventions for hypertension

Standard **antihypertensive agents** include:

- **Beta-blockers**: Metoprolol, propranolol.
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Diltiazem, verapamil.
- **Vasodilators**: Nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside.
- **ACE inhibitors**: Lisinopril, enalapril.
- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Losartan, valsartan.

These are effective and safe for hypertension management.

---

## Clinical scenarios where atropine infusion may be considered

Atropine infusion is appropriate for symptomatic bradycardia or AV block, for organophosphate or carbamate poisoning as an antidote for cholinergic crisis [^115fu3Zy], and as an antisialagogue to reduce secretions preoperatively [^114VCUjo]. It is **not appropriate for hypertension management** [^116pQoiU].

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

When using atropine infusion, monitor cardiovascular status (heart rate, blood pressure, ECG), central nervous system status (mental status and seizure activity), respiratory status (airway patency and respiratory rate), and laboratory parameters (electrolytes and renal function). Discontinue infusion if **significant hypertension** or adverse effects occur.

### Atropen auto-injector [^115T8ZH6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions.

	- Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents.

	- Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block, which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular block and nodal rhythm.

	- Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis.

### Local and systemic effects of cat allergen nasal provocation [^111zgbTa]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), change from baseline, was measured as a response to active and diluent nasal challenges, with results expressed as mean ± standard error. There were two response types noted: the dose-response and the time-course response. Statistical significance was observed with P-values < 0.01, < 0.001, and < 0.0001, respectively, for allergen vs. diluent, using a paired t-test with correction for multiple comparisons.

Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) did not change significantly during dose-up of allergen challenge or over the following 8 hours. There were no correlations between participant cat-allergen-specific IgE levels or skin prick test size and any of the following: area under the curve for TNSS or PNIF, maximum TNSS, minimum PNIF, or threshold dose for a TNSS score of ≥ 7.

- **Local nasal biomarker responses**: Nasal fluid tryptase levels peaked at 5 minutes after the final allergen challenge, significantly increasing in comparison to the diluent challenge and baseline (post-lavage) with P-values < 0.05. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels continued to rise up to 8 hours post-challenge, showing a significant increase from baseline (P < 0.0001) and a trend towards increase after allergen compared to diluent (P = 0.07).

Tryptase and ECP levels in nasal fluid were assessed after cat allergen and diluent challenges, displayed as mean and standard error. Statistical notations indicate ✱ p < 0.05 for active vs. diluent at 5 minutes and †P = 0.07 for allergen vs. diluent at 8 hours, both using the Mann–Whitney U-test.

### Rapid atropine synthesis for the treatment of massive nerve agent exposure [^11518ZSD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

We developed and tested a protocol for compounding a large volume of injectable atropine from powder. The resulting protocol could be utilized by hospitals to rapidly use large amounts of stockpiled atropine.

- **Methods**: The protocol required 2 g of solid (powdered) atropine and 1 L of normal saline solution. The solution was filtered and mixed, followed by filling one hundred syringes using a standard syringe-batching system. Modifications, including hand filling, were explored to reduce the time required to synthesize one hundred 3-mL syringes.

- **Results**: A single pharmacist successfully reconstituted one hundred 6-mg atropine syringes in 29 minutes using the batching system. The quickest method for hand-filled syringes by a single pharmacist was 34 minutes. The cost to the hospital for 5 g of powdered atropine was 11 dollars, compared to 5,000 dollars for prefilled syringes.

- **Conclusion**: Large quantities of atropine syringes can be compounded from a powdered form in a timely manner. Additionally, there is a significant cost advantage to using powdered atropine as a hospital stockpile.

### Mannitol as a challenge test to identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite athletes [^1143p6ZZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Bronchial provocation tests provide objective criteria for asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and were recommended to justify the use of inhaled beta2-agonists by athletes at the Winter Olympics 2002. Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) was one test recommended to identify EIB. Provocation with EVH requires a special dry gas mixture, limiting its availability. However, provocation tests with osmotic aerosols require less expensive equipment that is easily portable.

We assessed the sensitivity of a challenge with mannitol to identify responsiveness to EVH in 50 elite summer sport athletes who were unselected if they had respiratory symptoms. Asthma was previously diagnosed by a doctor in 27 subjects, and 21 subjects were currently under treatment for EIB or asthma. The mean predicted FEV1 was 103.6 ± 10.8%, FVC was 99 ± 13.3%, and mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC was 104 ± 22.7%.

A total of 25 subjects were positive to the EVH challenge (mean percentage of fall in FEV1 was 25.4 ± 15% SD), and 26 subjects had a positive mannitol challenge. The geometric mean [95% confidence interval] provoking dose causing a 10% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second [PD10] was 202 mg [134, 300], with 24 of the subjects positive to both challenges.

Mannitol had a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92% to identify a positive response to EVH and, as such, could be used as an alternative to EVH to identify EIB.

### Multiple centrally acting antidotes protect against severe organophosphate toxicity [^111RzHFZ]. Academic emergency medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Accumulation of acetylcholine in the central nervous system is believed to account for the rapid lethality of organophosphate pesticides and chemical nerve agents. Diazepam is known to supplement atropine therapy, but its specific mechanism of action is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To test four centrally acting agents for early antidotal efficacy in severe dichlorvos poisoning in the murine model.

- **Methods**: The up-and-down method was used to dose four candidate antidotes: diazepam, xylazine, morphine, and ketamine. Antidotes were administered subcutaneously to unsedated adult Sprague-Dawley rats who were pretreated with 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal glycopyrrolate. All animals received 20 mg/kg of dichlorvos subcutaneously 5 minutes later. A blinded observer adjudicated the outcomes of 10-minute mortality and survival time.

- **Results**: All animals pretreated with either no antidote (8/8 deaths) or glycopyrrolate alone (8/8) died within 10 minutes of dichlorvos injection. Pretreatment with diazepam (3/9 deaths) or xylazine (3/9) decreased lethality substantially (Fisher p = 0.007; median effective doses 0.12 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg, respectively). Intermediate doses of morphine (3.1 to 5.5 mg/kg) resulted in survival, but higher doses did not, presumably because of excessive respiratory depression (7/11 deaths; p = 0.09). Ketamine (7/8 deaths) was ineffective as an antidote. Survival times also were prolonged in the diazepam and xylazine groups (log-rank p < 0.001) and, to a lesser degree, the morphine group (p = 0.07).

- **Conclusions**: Doses of diazepam, xylazine, and morphine b

### Tegsedi [^115Thijr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions/antibody formation**: Tegsedi can cause hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical studies, 6 out of 161 (4%) Tegsedi-treated patients stopped treatment because of a hypersensitivity reaction. Antibodies to Tegsedi were present when the reactions occurred. These reactions generally happened within 2 hours of administration of Tegsedi and included symptoms like headache, chest pain, hypertension, chills, flushing, dysphagia, palmar erythema, eosinophilia, involuntary choreaform movements, arthralgia, myalgia, and flu-like symptoms.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of Tegsedi, and initiate appropriate therapy. Do not use in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Tegsedi.

- **Uninterpretable platelet counts: Reaction between antiplatelet antibodies and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)**: In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], 23% of Tegsedi-treated patients had at least 1 uninterpretable platelet count caused by platelet clumping, compared to 13% of patients on placebo. In 2 cases of severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 25 x 10^9/L, one of which resulted in death, clumped platelet samples caused a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Both subjects tested positive for treatment-emergent antiplatelet IgG antibodies detected shortly before or at the time of the severe reduction in platelet count.

Although platelet clumping can have various causes, such as incompletely mixed or inadequately anticoagulated samples, it can also be caused by a reaction between antiplatelet antibodies.

### Inderalla [^111iUqEk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In cases of overdosage, propranolol is not significantly dialyzable. If overdosage or exaggerated response occurs, the following measures should be employed:

- **General**: If ingestion is or may have been recent, evacuate gastric contents with care to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

- **Supportive therapy**: Hypotension and bradycardia have been reported following a propranolol overdose and should be treated accordingly. Glucagon can exert potent inotropic and chronotropic effects and may be particularly useful for treating hypotension or depressed myocardial function. It should be administered at 50 to 150 mcg/kg intravenously, followed by a continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for a positive chronotropic effect. Isoproterenol, dopamine, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also be useful. However, epinephrine may provoke uncontrolled hypertension. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol, and serious bradycardia may require temporary cardiac pacing.

- **Monitoring**: The electrocardiogram, pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status, and intake and output balance must be monitored. Isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used for bronchospasm.

### The association between neostigmine and postoperative atelectasis in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy: a retrospective single-center propensity score matched study [^112JgWok]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Exposure variable

The exposure variable in this study was the administration of neostigmine for reversal (NEO group), regardless of dosage, while the control variable was the absence of neostigmine administration for reversal (Control group). Intraoperative anesthetic management was conducted by attending anesthesiologists with more than five years of work experience. PNRB was evaluated based on clinical subjective criteria, including the eyes opened and head up maintenance for 5 seconds, leg lift, and tongue protrusion test. Decisions on neostigmine administration and dosage were made by the same attending anesthesiologist in the PACU. According to our institutional guidelines, the dosage of neostigmine is 1–2 mg, accompanied by the use of atropine as appropriate depending on the heart rate level. The intermittent bolus dose of cis-atracurium is 0.03–0.05 mg/kg. Patients were allowed to regain spontaneous breathing without neostigmine reversal and then be extubated if the last dose of cis-atracurium was administered 30 minutes or more before the end of the surgery.

Confounding variables

We considered a range of variables that could potentially influence the development of postoperative atelectasis. Baseline characteristics included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ASA classification, and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Preoperative laboratory variables included hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and oxygen index (OI). The most recent preoperative laboratory values were used as baseline data. Anesthesia-related variables were considered to comp…

### p-STAT6, PU.1, and NF-κB are involved in allergen-induced late-phase airway inflammation in asthma patients [^115GQCNf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study individuals were seen at the screening visit where their eligibility for the study was checked based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. This visit included physical examination, spirometry, measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine, and skin prick testing. At 24 hours before a bronchial allergen challenge, spirometry was performed and peripheral blood was collected from all eligible study subjects. An allergen (D. pteronyssinus, birch, or five-grass mixture) for the bronchial challenge test in patients with allergic asthma (AA) was chosen according to the results of skin prick testing and clinical data in patients' medical records. In the case of multiple positive results from the skin prick test, an allergen that most probably caused bronchoconstriction previously was selected for specific bronchial challenge. All healthy volunteers were challenged with a D. pteronyssinus allergen. Bronchial allergen challenge was performed at 8:00 in the morning, and spirometry was reassessed every 10 minutes within the first hour and then every hour for the subsequent 6 hours. Physical examination, spirometry, and peripheral blood collection were performed again 24 hours after the bronchial allergen challenge.

- **Measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine**: Methacholine was nebulized into a 10-L reservoir with a pressure nebulizer (Pari Provocation I; Pari, Stanberg, Germany). Aerolized methacholine was inhaled through a one-way valve at 5-minute intervals starting with a 15-μg methacholine dose and doubling it.

### Continuous pralidoxime infusion versus repeated bolus injection to treat organophosphorus pesticide poisoning: a randomised controlled trial [^11252PSh]. Lancet (2006). High credibility.

The role of oximes for the treatment of organophosphorus pesticide poisoning has not been conclusively established. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a constant pralidoxime infusion compared with repeated bolus doses to treat patients with moderately severe poisoning from organophosphorus pesticides.

- **Methods**: 200 patients were recruited to our single-centre, open randomised controlled trial after moderately severe poisoning by anticholinesterase pesticide. All were given a 2 g loading dose of pralidoxime over 30 min. Patients were then randomly assigned to control and study groups. Controls were given a bolus dose of 1 g pralidoxime over 1 h every 4 h for 48 h. The study group had a constant infusion of 1 g over an hour every hour for 48 h. Thereafter, all patients were given 1 g every 4 h until they could be weaned from ventilators. Analysis was by intention to treat. Primary outcome measures were median atropine dose needed within 24 h, proportion of patients who needed intubation, and number of days on ventilation. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT00333944.

- **Findings**: 100 patients were assigned the high-dose regimen, and 100 the control regimen. There were no drop-outs. Patients receiving the high-dose pralidoxime regimen required less atropine during the first 24 h than controls (median 6 mg vs 30 mg; difference 24 mg [95% CI 24–26, p < 0.0001]). 88 (88%) and 64 (64%) of controls and high-dose patients, respectively, needed intubation during admission to hospital (relative risk = 0.72, 0.62–0.86, p = 0.0001).

### Humira [^1138cyJA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Humira, including the development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with Humira.

Discontinue Humira if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with Humira, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

- **Invasive fungal infections**: If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.

### The bronchial response to mannitol is attenuated by a previous methacholine test: but not vice versa [^114RFzgz]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

To examine the airway response to inhaled mannitol performed before or following a methacholine challenge test in a group of asthmatics with different levels of disease, the following methods were employed:

A total of 48 asthmatics, aged 18–73, were included in the study. Two pairs of challenges were conducted randomly on two separate days, with a minimum interval of 24 hours. On one day, mannitol was administered first, followed by methacholine after at least one hour. On the other day, the order was reversed. Participants underwent a questionnaire-based interview, and measurements of lung function, exhaled nitric oxide, skin prick test, and blood eosinophil count were taken.

The results indicated that 44% of the asthmatics used inhaled corticosteroids and 48% were atopic. The airway response to mannitol was attenuated when it was given after methacholine, compared to when mannitol was administered first [log response dose ratio (RDR): 1.42 vs. 1.60 (P = 0.004)], whereas the response to methacholine remained unchanged regardless of the test order [log RDR: 0.81 vs. 0.96 (P = 0.102)].

In conclusion, bronchial challenges with inhaled mannitol and methacholine can be performed on the same day; however, provocation with mannitol should precede methacholine.

### Oximes for acute organophosphate pesticide poisoning [^113aQDcr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning causes tens of thousands of deaths each year across the developing world. Standard treatment involves administration of intravenous atropine and oxime to reactivate inhibited acetylcholinesterase. The clinical usefulness of oximes, such as pralidoxime and obidoxime, has been challenged over the past 20 years by physicians in many parts of the world.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the effectiveness and safety of the administration of oximes in acute organophosphorus pesticide-poisoned patients.

- **Search strategy**: We searched both English and Chinese databases: Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) and the Chinese language databases CNKI and WANGFANG. All searches were run in September 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Articles that could possibly be RCTs were retrieved to determine if they were randomised.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The published methodology of three RCTs was not clear. We contacted the principal authors of these, but did not obtain further information.

- **Main results**: Seven pralidoxime RCTs were found. Three RCTs including 366 patients studied pralidoxime vs placebo, and four RCTs including 479 patients compared two or more different doses. These trials found quite disparate results with treatment effects ranging from benefit to harm. However, many studies did not achieve definitive conclusions.

### Atropen auto-injector [^117EeD7v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Geriatric patients may be more susceptible to the effects of atropine.

- **Pregnancy**: Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters fetal circulation. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of atropine in pregnant women. Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with atropine. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**: Atropine has been reported to be excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effects of atropine on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Atropen and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Atropen or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Pediatric use**: A review of published literature supports the safety and effectiveness of atropine in the setting of organophosphate insecticide poisoning in all pediatric age groups. Adverse events seen in pediatric patients treated with atropine are similar to those that occur in adult patients, although central nervous system effects are often seen earlier and at lower doses [see adverse reactions (6)]. Overheating (atropine fever) caused by suppression of sweat gland activity may be more pronounced in infants and small children. Extreme hyperthermia in a newborn may occur.

### Protopam chloride [^1154UqSD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Organophosphate poisoning treatment should include general supportive care, atropinization, and decontamination, in addition to the use of Protopam Chloride. Treatment is most effective if initiated immediately after poisoning. Administration of Protopam Chloride should be performed slowly and, preferably, by infusion. If intravenous administration is not feasible, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection should be used. Generally, little is accomplished if Protopam Chloride is given more than 36 hours after the termination of exposure to the poison.

When the poison has been ingested, it is particularly important to consider the likelihood of continuing absorption from the lower bowel, as this constitutes new exposure, and fatal relapses have been reported after initial improvement. In such cases, additional doses of Protopam Chloride may be needed every three to eight hours. The patient should be "titrated" with Protopam Chloride as long as signs of poisoning recur. As in all cases of organophosphate poisoning, care should be taken to keep the patient under observation for at least 48 to 72 hours.

If dermal exposure has occurred, clothing should be removed, and the hair and skin washed thoroughly with sodium bicarbonate or alcohol as soon as possible.

Supportive care, including airway management, respiratory and cardiovascular support, correction of metabolic abnormalities, and seizure control, may be necessary in cases of severe organophosphate poisoning. Atropine should be given as soon as possible after hypoxemia is improved.

### Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate are effective against acute cyanide poisoning when administered by intramuscular injection [^111VL59q]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The study aimed to assess the efficacy of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate as antidotes for acute cyanide poisoning when administered by intramuscular injection, rather than the standard intravenous method, which is less practical in out-of-hospital settings, especially during mass casualties.

- **Methods**: A randomized, nonblinded, parallel-group study design was employed using three mammalian models. These included:
	- Mice subjected to cyanide gas inhalation with treatments administered postexposure.
	- Rabbits received an intravenous sodium cyanide infusion, with severe hypotension as a treatment trigger.
	- Pigs were given an intravenous potassium cyanide infusion, with apnea triggering treatment.

	- The antidotes were administered intramuscularly, and without therapy, all models proved lethal.

- **Results**: Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate each rescued 100% of the mice. The drug combination rescued 73% of the rabbits and 80% of the pigs. Treated animals across all species had significantly better survival rates compared to controls (log-rank test, p < 0.05). In pigs, a 5-minute post-antidote injection revealed that the drugs reduced plasma lactate levels (difference between saline solution-treated versus nitrite- or thiosulfate-treated: 1.76 [95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.27]).

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate, when administered by intramuscular injection, are effective treatments for cyanide poisoning.

### Odor identification impairment and cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in Alzheimer's disease [^117Xko8J]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

This study evaluated acute changes in odor identification following an atropine nasal spray challenge and an 8-week change in odor identification ability as predictors of long-term improvement in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) who received open-label cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

- **Methods**: In patients with clinical AD, the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was administered before and after an anticholinergic atropine nasal spray challenge. Patients were then treated with donepezil for 52 weeks.

- **Results**: In 21 study participants, an acute atropine-induced decrease in UPSIT was not associated with changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) or the Selective Reminding Test (SRT). A decline in odor identification performance from baseline to week 8 was indicative of a future decline in cognitive performance over 52 weeks.

- **Discussion**: Change in odor identification with an atropine challenge is not a useful predictor of treatment response to cholinesterase inhibitors. Short-term changes in odor identification performance need further investigation as a potential predictor of cognitive improvement with cholinesterase inhibitor treatment.

### Atropen auto-injector [^1148ABYz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

It is recommended that three ATROPEN autoinjectors be available for use in each patient at risk for organophosphorus or carbamate poisoning: one for mild symptoms and two more for severe symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Different dose strengths of ATROPEN are available depending on the patient's weight. Atropen should be used by individuals adequately trained in recognizing and treating nerve agent or insecticide intoxication, though it may be administered by a caregiver or through self-administration if a trained provider is unavailable.

Only administer ATROPEN to patients experiencing symptoms of organophosphorus or carbamate poisoning, in situations where exposure is known or suspected. ATROPEN is a single-dose autoinjector intended as an initial treatment for the muscarinic symptoms of insecticide or nerve agent poisonings, typically characterized by breathing difficulties due to increased secretions. Definitive medical care should be sought immediately.

ATROPEN should be administered as soon as symptoms of organophosphorus or carbamate poisoning appear. In severe poisonings, it may be advisable to concurrently administer an anticonvulsant, preferably a benzodiazepine, if seizure is suspected in the unconscious individual, as the classic tonic-clonic jerking may not be apparent due to the effects of the poison. A cholinesterase reactivator, such as pralidoxime, may serve as an important adjunct to atropine therapy. Close supervision of all treated patients is indicated for at least 48 to 72 hours.

### Repeated pulse intramuscular injection of pralidoxime chloride in severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning [^115syDBp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of two therapies for patients with severe acute organophosphorus pesticide poisoning, focusing on atropine adverse effects, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, complications, and mortality.

A retrospective cohort study of 152 cases was collected from May 2008 to November 2012 at two urban university hospitals. Patients admitted for organophosphate poisoning were divided into two groups with different therapeutic regimens: Group A was administered a repeated pulse intramuscular injection of pralidoxime chloride, while Group B received the same initial dosage of atropine and pralidoxime chloride, but pralidoxime chloride intravenous therapy was limited to only three days, regardless of the length of atropine therapy. Subsequently, atropine adverse effects, length of ICU stay, complications, and mortality were statistically analyzed and compared between the two groups.

The total dose of atropine was 57.40 ± 15.14 mg in Group A and 308.26 ± 139.16 mg in Group B; Group A received less atropine than did Group B (P = .001). The length of ICU stay in Group A was reduced (P = .025), and Group A had fewer atropine adverse effects (P = .002). However, there was no significant difference in mortality or complication rate between the two groups (P > .05).

In conclusion, in patients with severe poisoning, Group A used less atropine, had fewer atropine adverse effects, and had a shorter ICU stay. We suggest that therapy should be started as early as possible using a sufficient amount of pralidoxime chloride.

### Open-label randomized clinical trial of atropine bolus injection versus incremental boluses plus infusion for organophosphate poisoning in Bangladesh [^1145Uf7o]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). High credibility.

Severe organophosphate compound (OPC) poisoning is an important clinical problem in many countries around the world. Unfortunately, little clinical research has been performed, and little evidence exists to determine the best therapy. A study was undertaken to determine the optimal dosing regimen for atropine in the treatment of OPC poisoning. An open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Chittagong, Bangladesh, on 156 hospitalized individuals with OPC poisoning from June to September 2006. The aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of conventional bolus doses with individualized incremental doses of atropine for atropinization, followed by continuous atropine infusion for the management of OPC poisoning.

Inclusion criteria included patients with a clear history of OPC poisoning and clear clinical signs of toxicity, i.e. features of a cholinergic crisis. The patients were observed for at least 96 hours. Immediate outcomes and complications were recorded. Out of 156 patients, 81 patients received the conventional bolus dose of atropine (Group A), and 75 patients received rapidly incremental doses of atropine followed by infusion (Group B). The mortality in Group A was 22.5% (18/80) and in Group B was 8% (6/75) (p < 0.05). The mean duration of atropinization in Group A was 151.74 minutes compared to 23.90 minutes for Group B (p < 0.001). More patients in Group A experienced atropine toxicity than in Group B (28.4% versus 12.0%, p < 0.05); the intermediate syndrome was more common in Group A than in Group B (13.6% versus 4%, p < 0.05).

### Clinical and bioavailability studies of sublingually administered atropine sulfate [^1137nrk2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The increased use of organophosphorus (OP) pesticides and the ever-increasing possibility of terror groups using nerve agents underscore the need to develop effective and safe antidotes against OP poisoning. The objectives of the present study were to develop a novel atropine sulfate (AS) sublingual injection formulation, to create its bioavailability data in humans, and to evaluate its suitability for field use with a view to obtaining early therapeutic drug concentration in comparison to the conventional intramuscular (IM) route that provides a therapeutic peak of 6 to 8 ng/mL in blood at 30 minutes.

- **Methods**: Two milligrams per 0.1 mL of AS was sublingually injected in 6 volunteers, and bioavailability and atropinization signs (blood pressure, pupil diameter, and heart rate) were noted.

- **Results**: Human bioavailability curve was created, which was equivalent to a 2 mg IM injection in amplitude within 10 minutes and described a better curve thereafter. Peak plasma concentration of AS occurred at 15 minutes and was 21 ng/mL. Increase in heart rate became extremely significant at 5 minutes (P < .0001), with a maximum increase of 62% ± 6% at 10 minutes after administration. Pupil diameter showed a maximal increase of 58% ± 21% at 15 minutes (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: Sublingual AS appears to have several advantages over the conventional IM route, including better bioavailability, rapid onset of action, and early atropinization. It is a safe and efficacious procedure with the potential to become an alternative to conventional IM injection, particularly in cases of chemical terrorism scenarios.

### Prophylactic atropine administration attenuates the negative haemodynamic effects of induction of anaesthesia with propofol and high-dose remifentanil: A randomised controlled trial [^115YF4pY]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). High credibility.

Induction of anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil often induces unwanted bradycardia and hypotension, raising concerns regarding tissue oxygenation. The electrophysiological cardiac effects of remifentanil can be reversed by atropine.

- **Objective**: To investigate if prophylactic administration of atropine can attenuate the negative haemodynamic effects of propofol and a high dose of remifentanil during induction of anaesthesia.

- **Design**: A double-blind, randomised controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Single-centre, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands.

- **Patients**: Sixty euvolaemic patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia.

- **Interventions**: Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion of propofol with a target effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.5 μg/mL, remifentanil (target-controlled infusion), (Ce 8 ng/mL) and cisatracurium. Methylatropine (500 μg) or 0.9% saline was administered immediately before induction of anaesthesia.

- **Main outcome measures**: The changes (Δ) in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), rate pressure product, cerebral tissue oxygenation and peripheral tissue oxygenation between induction of anaesthesia (T0) and 10 minutes later (T10).

- **Results**: Atropine significantly attenuated the changes in the outcome measures between T0 and T10. Median (interquartile range) changes were MAP, Δ = -24 (-40 to -21) vs. Δ = -37mmHg (-41 to -31) (P = 0.02); HR, Δ = 0 ± 13 vs. -19 ± 11 bpm (P < 0.01); CI, Δ = -0.4 ± 0.7 vs. -0.9 ± 0.6 L/min/m (P < 0.01) and rate pressure product, Δ = -3241 (-5015 to -613) vs. Δ = -571.

### Unituxin [^1161wJxC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients and caregivers about the following risks and necessary actions:

- **Serious infusion reactions**: There is a risk of serious infusion reactions and anaphylaxis. Patients should be advised to immediately report any signs or symptoms, such as facial or lip swelling, urticaria, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, or dizziness that occur during or within 24 hours following the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Pain, peripheral neuropathy, prolonged urinary retention, and transverse myelitis**: Patients should be informed about the risk of severe pain, sensory and motor neuropathy, prolonged urinary retention, and transverse myelitis. They should promptly report severe or worsening pain and symptoms such as numbness, tingling, burning, weakness, or inability to urinate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Neurological disorders of the eye**: Inform patients of the risk of neurological disorders of the eye. They should promptly report signs or symptoms like blurred vision, photophobia, ptosis, diplopia, or unequal pupil size [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)**: Discuss the risk of RPLS with patients and caregivers, advising them to immediately report signs or symptoms such as severe headache, hypertension, visual changes, lethargy, or seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Capillary leak syndrome**: Patients should be made aware of this risk, although the specific warning details are not included in the provided excerpt.

Ensure all the necessary information is communicated effectively to patients and caregivers to aid in the prompt identification and management of these conditions.

### Atropen auto-injector [^112dwkdF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Atropen has interactions with certain substances which must be considered during treatment.

- **Pralidoxime**: When atropine and pralidoxime are used together, the signs of atropinization, such as flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, and dryness of the mouth and nose, may occur earlier than expected compared to when atropine is used alone. This is because pralidoxime may potentiate the effect of atropine. Excitement and manic behavior immediately following recovery of consciousness have been reported in several cases. However, similar behavior has also occurred in cases of organophosphate poisoning that were not treated with pralidoxime.

- **Barbiturates**: Barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases; therefore, they should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions resulting from exposure to atropine.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^116UApcQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

- **Therapy in asymptomatic patients**: For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT): "Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison up to one hour previously. The potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded".

- **Rationale**: Based on case series, it is preferable to observe and monitor in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose, to consider gastrointestinal decontamination and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for and types of decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

- **First-line therapy for symptomatic patients**: For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends the use of IV calcium, high-dose insulin therapy with other first-line treatment(s) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present, and norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the presence of shock (even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed).

### Diltiazem HCI [^1158zTHq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Overdosage experience is limited. In the event of an overdosage or an exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed. The following measures may be considered:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.6 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

- **Hypotension**: Administer vasopressors (e.g. dopamine or norepinephrine).

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of a diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdoses with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that were initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases, intravenous calcium has been administered (1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate) over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.

### Guidelines for reporting case studies on extracorporeal treatments in poisonings: Methodology [^113z4K8V]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our methodology; the group of panelists that were chosen ultimately dictated which final criteria were selected, which can be biased if certain specialties are overrepresented. However, the individuals were chosen for their content expertise and came from diverse backgrounds. All panelists had extensive prior experience in reviewing and criticizing case reports for the EXTRIP clinical guideline development; many were also experienced in other peer review activities. Furthermore, several conference calls and in-house meetings permitted group discussions on the ideal constituents of a robust case report. Adherence to these reporting guidelines will need to be prospectively evaluated over time and modified accordingly, if necessary.

The sequential steps undertaken by our group differed from those proposed by the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines due to the previous work performed by the EXTRIP workgroup. For example, significant discussion had already taken place prior to the Delphi rounds; there may therefore have been a priori consensus, which could theoretically have impeded critical thought, and this may be suggested by the relatively few Delphi rounds needed to obtain consensus. The addition of two external validation rounds permitted the reporting guideline development to remain dynamic and ascertain that all items remained clear and understandable without extensive explanations for an end user.

Because case reports are likely to remain a significant proportion of the available literature in many acute care specialties, adherence to standardized reporting can enhance the quality and usability of such reports.

### Jimson weed extract as a protective agent in severe organophosphate toxicity [^112M2nGR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients following an organophosphate (OP) exposure can deplete a hospital's entire supply of atropine. Given the possibility of multiple severe exposures following a terrorist attack using OP nerve agents, there exists a need for either greater atropine stores or the development of alternative antidotes. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium) contains atropine and other anticholinergic compounds and is common and readily available. It is used recreationally for its central anticholinergic effects and is made easily into an extract by boiling the crushed seeds. The extract has a rapid onset of effects and may be useful for treating OP poisoning.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether pretreatment with an easily stored and prepared Datura seed extract (DSE) will increase survival following a severe OP poisoning.

- **Methods**: Datura stramonium seeds were collected, crushed, and then heated in water to make a 2-mg/mL atropine solution (100 seeds contain approximately 6 mg of atropine or 0.007 mg/seed). Male rats were randomized to pretreatment with either saline (n = 10) or 7.5 mg/kg DSE (n = 10) given as a single intraperitoneal injection 5 minutes prior to a subcutaneous injection of 25 mg/kg of dichlorvos. The endpoint was time to death recorded by a blinded observer.

- **Results**: The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 24-hour survival rate was 90% (95% CI = 56% to 100%) for the DSE-pretreated group and 10% (95% CI = 0% to 45%) for the control group. The log-rank test revealed a statistically significant longer survival for the Datura-treated animals (p = 0.0002).

### Protopam chloride [^117GGjgS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

When atropine and pralidoxime chloride are used together, the signs of atropinization, such as flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, and dryness of the mouth and nose, may occur earlier than when atropine is used alone. This is particularly evident if the total dose of atropine is large and the administration of pralidoxime chloride is delayed.

- **Precautions**: In the treatment of anticholinesterase poisoning, it is important to consider certain precautions, though they do not directly relate to the use of pralidoxime chloride. Barbiturates, potentiated by anticholinesterases, should be used cautiously for convulsion treatments. It is advisable to avoid morphine, theophylline, aminophylline, reserpine, and phenothiazine-type tranquilizers in patients with organophosphate poisoning. Prolonged paralysis has been reported when succinylcholine is administered with drugs possessing anticholinesterase activity; hence, caution is advised.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Pralidoxime chloride is intended primarily for short-term emergency use. Consequently, no investigations regarding its potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility have been conducted by the manufacturer or reported in the literature.

- **Pregnancy**:
	- **Teratogenic effects**: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pralidoxime chloride. It is also unknown whether pralidoxime chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. Pralidoxime chloride should be administered to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

### Degenerative cervical radiculopathy: Diagnosis and conservative treatment. A review [^114vxtmt]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To provide a state-of-the-art assessment of the diagnosis and non-surgical treatment of degenerative cervical radiculopathy, a literature search for studies on epidemiology, diagnosis (including electrophysiological examination and imaging studies), and different types of conservative treatment was undertaken. The most common causes of cervical root compression are spondylarthrosis and disc herniation. Diagnosis is made mainly on clinical grounds, although there are no well-defined criteria. Provocative tests like the foraminal compression test are widely used but not properly evaluated. The clinical diagnosis of degenerative cervical radiculopathy can be confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The role of electromyography is mainly to rule out other conditions. Cervical radiculopathy is initially treated conservatively, although no treatment modality has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

### Innohep [^112LfFeP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2008). Low credibility.

Innohep® should not be mixed with other injections or infusions. It should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, and hemorrhage.

Consistent with expected age-related changes in renal function, elderly patients and patients with renal insufficiency may show reduced elimination of tinzaparin sodium. Innohep® should be used with care in these patients. Patients aged 90 years or older with creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL/min should not be treated with Innohep®.

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic complete blood counts, including platelet count and hematocrit or hemoglobin, and stool tests for occult blood, are recommended during treatment with Innohep®. When administered at the recommended doses, routine anticoagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of Innohep® activity and, therefore, are unsuitable for monitoring.

- **Drug interactions**: Because of the increased risk of bleeding, Innohep® should be used with caution in patients receiving oral anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors (e.g. salicylates, dipyridamole, sulfinpyrazone, dextran, NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel), and thrombolytics. If coadministration is essential, close clinical and laboratory monitoring of these patients is advised.

### A mixture of organophosphate and pyrethroid intoxication requiring intensive care unit admission: A diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic approach [^114uL2WS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

The illegal mixing of organophosphates and pyrethroids in marketed agricultural insecticides is becoming prevalent in developing countries. Over a 12-month period, eight patients were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital in Dharan, Nepal, after ingestion of such a mixture with suicidal intent. All patients presented with a combination of miosis, bradycardia, tachypnea, and unconsciousness.

The occurrence of both pupillary dilation following a small-dose infusion of atropine (0.08 to 0.2 mg/kg in 1–3 hours) and seizures raised the possibility of pyrethroid poisoning. In each case, examination of the insecticide container confirmed that it contained a mixture of organophosphate and pyrethroid. After seizure control, gastric lavage, respiratory support, hemodynamic stabilization, and diuresis, seven of the patients recovered without neurological deficit. One patient suffered aspiration pneumonia and died.

The early clinical picture after this mixed poisoning is based on the toxicity of organophosphates rather than pyrethroids. Because the patients responded to a small dose of atropine with mydriasis and tachycardia, it suggested a mixed poisoning. Early suspicion of mixed poisoning may have a significant prognostic impact.

### Protopam chloride [^116zHTte]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Protopam Chloride has been well tolerated in most cases; however, it must be remembered that the desperate condition of the organophosphate-poisoned patient will generally mask such minor signs and symptoms as have been noted in normal subjects. Intravenous administration of Protopam Chloride should be carried out slowly and, preferably, by continuous or intermittent infusion, since temporary worsening of cholinergic manifestations (i.e. tachycardia, cardiac arrest, laryngospasm, and muscle rigidity or paralysis) may occur if Protopam Chloride is infused too rapidly. The intermittent infusion rate should not exceed 200 mg/minute. If intravenous administration is not feasible, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection should be used.

Protopam Chloride should be used with great caution in treating organophosphate overdosage in cases of myasthenia gravis, since it may precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Because pralidoxime is excreted in the urine, a decrease in renal function will result in increased blood levels of the drug. Thus, the dosage of Protopam Chloride should be reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency.

- **Laboratory tests**: Treatment of organophosphate poisoning should be instituted without waiting for the results of laboratory tests. Red blood cell, plasma cholinesterase, and urinary paranitrophenol measurements (in the case of parathion exposure) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and following the course of the illness, although such tests may be normal in the face of clinically significant organophosphate poisoning.

### Adrenergic mediation of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure [^112rxoLU]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

We used the original model of HAAF and the nonselective α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol, as well as the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine, in doses previously shown to be both safe and effective. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that adrenergic activation, cholinergic activation, or both mediate the effect of recent antecedent hypoglycemia to reduce the sympathoadrenal response to subsequent hypoglycemia — the key feature of HAAF in diabetes — in humans.

### Cardizem [^116tya22]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of intravenous calcium administration to reverse the pharmacological effects of diltiazem overdose has been inconsistent. In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers associated with hypotension and bradycardia that was initially refractory to atropine became more responsive to atropine after the patients received intravenous calcium. In some cases, intravenous calcium has been administered as 1 g calcium chloride or 3 g calcium gluconate over 5 minutes and repeated every 10 to 20 minutes as necessary. Calcium gluconate has also been administered as a continuous infusion at a rate of 2 g per hour for 10 hours. Infusions of calcium for 24 hours or more may be required. Patients should be monitored for signs of hypercalcemia.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Limited data suggest that plasmapheresis or charcoal hemoperfusion may hasten diltiazem elimination following overdose. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

- **Bradycardia**: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1.0 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

- **High-degree AV block**: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

- **Cardiac failure**: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

### Recovery from ultra-high dose organophosphate poisoning after "in-the-field" antidote treatment: Potential lessons for civil defense [^117VUmwk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Organophosphate poisoning is associated with a high mortality rate due to respiratory failure, dysrhythmias, and multi-organ failure. We report two cases of survival after "in-the-field" antidote treatment of very severe organophosphate poisonings. Two patients orally ingested large amounts of the organophosphorous agent oxydemeton-methyl in suicide attempts, resulting in the hypercholinergic syndrome in both. Resuscitation included the early administration of antidote by emergency medical personnel as well as high-dose atropine. Plasma levels of pseudocholinesterase were initially very low in both patients. Long-term mechanical ventilation was necessary, and both patients developed aspiration pneumonia. At discharge, no major neurological deficits were present. Prompt antidote treatment and aggressive supportive emergency and intensive care unit therapy contribute to improved survival after acute organophosphate poisoning.

We believe that in cases of mass poisonings — such as terrorist activity — therapy must be available on the scene as soon as possible. This also may require decentralized antidote storage.

### Sodium nitrite [^115VbBVJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with sodium nitrite injection has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with sodium nitrite injection, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous (IV) line [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

- **Recommended dosing**: Sodium nitrite injection and sodium thiosulfate injection are administered by slow intravenous injection. They should be given as early as possible following a diagnosis of acute life-threatening cyanide poisoning has been established. Sodium nitrite should be administered first, followed immediately by sodium thiosulfate. Blood pressure must be monitored during infusion in both adults and children. The rate of infusion should be decreased if significant hypotension is noted.

	- NOTE: If signs of poisoning reappear, repeat treatment using one-half the original dose of both sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.

In adult and pediatric patients with known anemia, it is recommended that the dosage of sodium nitrite should be reduced proportionately to the hemoglobin concentration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

All parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Osmitrol [^116cx32h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, hypotension, and dyspnea resulting in cardiac arrest and death, have been reported with Osmitrol. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop and initiate appropriate therapeutic countermeasures as clinically indicated.

- **Renal complications including renal failure**: Renal complications, including irreversible renal failure, have been reported in patients receiving mannitol. Reversible, oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) has occurred in patients with normal pretreatment renal function who received large intravenous doses of mannitol. Although the osmotic nephrosis associated with mannitol administration is, in principle, reversible, osmotic nephrosis in general is known to potentially proceed to chronic or even end-stage renal failure. Monitor renal function closely, including signs of urine output reduction, during Osmitrol infusion. Patients with pre-existing renal disease, those with conditions that put them at high risk for renal failure, or those receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs or other diuretics, are at increased risk of renal failure following administration of Osmitrol. Avoid concomitant administration of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides) or other diuretics with Osmitrol, if possible.

Patients with oliguric AKI who subsequently develop anuria while receiving mannitol are at risk of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypertensive crisis.

### Effect of coronary revascularization on the prognostic value of stress myocardial contrast wall motion and perfusion imaging [^115MPFM9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

**Stress protocol**: Dipyridamole was infused at the total dose of 0.84 mg/kg in all patients. A total of 461 patients underwent a 10-minute 0.84 mg/kg dipyridamole infusion with atropine administration (up to 1 mg), while the majority of patients (n = 868) underwent a 6-minute protocol consisting of the 0.84 mg/kg dipyridamole infusion, which does not require additional atropine administration. Two-dimensional echocardiography, 12-lead ECGs, and blood pressure monitoring were performed in accordance with established standard protocols. Aminophylline was routinely used to reverse the effect of dipyridamole. When an obvious new wall motion abnormality (≥ 1 akinetic segment) was observed by the physician performing the test, the dipyridamole infusion was stopped, and aminophylline was administered.

### The use of intravenous atropine following a saline infusion in the prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in elderly patients [^11627SDP]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2000). Low credibility.

We investigated the efficacy of IV atropine for preventing spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in elderly patients. Seventy-five patients undergoing transurethral prostate or bladder surgery were randomized to receive either placebo (n = 25), atropine 5 microg/kg (small-dose atropine, n = 25), or atropine 10 microg/kg (large-dose atropine, n = 25) after the induction of spinal anesthesia. All patients received an IV infusion of 10 mL/kg 0.9% normal saline over 10 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. The systolic blood pressure decreased in all three groups after spinal anesthesia.

There was a significant increase in the mean heart rate in both atropine groups compared to the placebo group: placebo group: 78 bpm, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 76.6–78.5; small-dose atropine group: 86 bpm, 95% CI: 83.9–88.8; large-dose atropine group: 97 bpm, 95% CI: 94.5–100.3; P = 0.001. There was a significant decrease in the incidence of hypotension in patients who received atropine: placebo group: 76%; small-dose atropine group: 52%; large-dose atropine group: 40%; P = 0.03.

The mean dose of ephedrine required was significantly decreased in the atropine groups: placebo group: 12.2 mg [SD = 10.5]; small-dose atropine group: 7.4 mg [SD = 10.0]; large-dose atropine group: 5.4 mg [SD = 8.7 mg]; P = 0.048. The total amount of IV fluid and number of patients requiring metaraminol in addition to 30 mg of ephedrine were not significantly different among the three groups. Significant side effects, such as confusion, ST segment changes, or angina, were not detected in any group.

### Lopressor [^11772N9J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Overdosage: Signs and symptoms of Lopressor overdose may include severe bradycardia, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness or coma, nausea, and vomiting.

- **Treatment**: Intensive care should be considered. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may experience significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose can cause significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. Based on the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, the following measures should be considered:
	- **Hemodialysis**: It is unlikely to make a useful contribution to the elimination of metoprolol.
	- **Bradycardia**: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs, or a pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders.
	- **Hypotension**: Address the underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.
	- **Heart failure and shock**: Treat with appropriate volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), and intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α1-receptor agonistic drugs added if vasodilation is present.
	- **Bronchospasm**: Can usually be reversed by bronchodilators.

### SPL drug information for atropine sulfate [^113oQJa1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for atropine, also known as AtroPen or Isopto Atropine, include:

- **Treatment of organophosphate poisoning in adults (mild)**: Administer as per recommended dosage to alleviate symptoms.
- **Treatment of carbamate poisoning in adults (mild)**: Follow specific guidelines for dosage adjustment based on severity.
- **Treatment of organophosphate poisoning in adults (severe)**: Initiate immediate intervention with appropriate dosage escalation.
- **Treatment of carbamate poisoning in adults (severe)**: Urgent management required, following established protocols.

Ensure adherence to all recommended usage guidelines for optimal efficacy in treatment scenarios.

### Malathion [^115PF4BS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consideration should be given, as part of the treatment program, to the high concentration of isopropyl alcohol in the vehicle. Malathion, although a weaker cholinesterase inhibitor than some other organophosphates, may be expected to exhibit the same symptoms of cholinesterase depletion after accidental oral ingestion. If accidentally swallowed, vomiting should be induced promptly, or the stomach should be lavaged with a 5% sodium bicarbonate solution.

Severe respiratory distress is the major and most serious symptom of organophosphate poisoning, requiring artificial respiration, and atropine may be needed to counteract the symptoms of cholinesterase depletion. Repeat analyses of serum and RBC cholinesterase may assist in establishing the diagnosis and formulating a long-range prognosis.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^114ygow5]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The target population for these recommendations includes adults poisoned by calcium channel blockers (CCBs). However, due to the scarcity of literature on the treatment of CCB-poisoned children and the lack of evidence suggesting that children respond differently than adults to CCB poisoning, the workgroup considers it reasonable to apply the recommendations to the pediatric population.

Even when articles were located to answer some key questions (KQs 1–5), the overall evidence available for developing these recommendations was of very low quality. Many interventions had been studied only for surrogate outcomes. Except for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for cardiotoxicant poisonings, neither the use of nor the costs associated with these resources have been described (KQ 5). Therefore, many questions within our proposed analytic framework remain unanswered. These represent potential areas for future research.

- **Comparative studies**: Comparative studies should be conducted to identify which interventions improve intermediate and health outcomes (KQ 1, 3, and 4) for each specific class of CCB (KQ 2) with acceptable adverse effects and costs (KQ 5).

- **Observational studies**: Observational studies should identify prognostic factors, which are particularly crucial in severe cases that may potentially require VA-ECMO (KQ 2).

- **Clinical trials**: Scientists should conduct clinical trials to identify factors associated with favorable responses to high-dose insulin therapies (KQ 2). Prospective, controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate currently recommended antidotes or to assess new ones (KQ 1, 3, 4, and 5).

### Addition of neostigmine and atropine to conventional management of postdural puncture headache: A randomized controlled trial [^1159co9y]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). High credibility.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) lacks a standard evidence-based treatment. A patient treated with neostigmine for severe PDPH prompted this study.

- **Methods**: This randomized, controlled, double-blind study compared neostigmine and atropine (n = 41) versus a saline placebo (n = 44) for treating PDPH, in addition to conservative management of 85 patients with hydration and analgesics. The primary outcome was a visual analog scale score of ≤ 3 at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes included the need for an epidural blood patch, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Patients received either neostigmine 20 μg/kg and atropine 10 μg/kg or an equal volume of saline.

- **Results**: Visual analog scale scores were significantly better (P < .001) after two doses of neostigmine/atropine. There were no between-group differences in neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting. Complications, including abdominal cramps, muscle twitches, and urinary bladder hyperactivity, occurred only in the neostigmine/atropine group (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Neostigmine/atropine was effective in treating PDPH after only two doses. Neostigmine can pass the choroid plexus but not the blood-brain barrier. The central effects of both drugs influence cerebrospinal fluid secretion and cerebral vascular tone, which are the primary pathophysiological factors in PDPH.

### Systemic bioavailability of sublingual atropine ophthalmic solution: a phase I study in healthy volunteers with implications for use as a contingency medical countermeasure [^113rbbLt]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). High credibility.

Atropine sulfate is an FDA-approved medical countermeasure (MCM) for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent and organophosphate pesticide toxicity. Sufficient MCM supplies must be available in an incident involving a mass human exposure, either from an accidental chemical release or a terrorist attack.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, 3-sequence, 3-period phase I crossover study to assess the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) of 1% ophthalmic atropine sulfate solution administered sublingually to 15 healthy adult volunteers. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the bioavailability of each of the two sublingual doses against a 1.0 mg reference intravenous (IV) atropine dose. Secondary endpoints included the safety and tolerability (xerostomia scale) of atropine sulfate administered sublingually.

- **Results**: Sublingual atropine was safe, with no severe adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported with either dose, and was well tolerated, with a single subject reaching maximum xerostomia on a single dosing day. The geometric mean AUC ∞ was 286.40, 493.81, and 816.47 min*ng/mL for the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg sublingual doses, and the 1.0 mg IV dose, respectively. Compared to IV administration, the 1.0 mg sublingual dose produced 0.60 (90% CI: 0.55–0.66) of the overall concentration of atropine over time (AUC ∞).

- **Conclusion**: Sublingual atropine sulfate 1% ophthalmic solution may be an alternative formulation and route of administration combination, which expands the capacity and dosing options of atropine as a nerve agent MCM.

### Protopam chloride [^114YyWYx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: The principal action of pralidoxime chloride is to reactivate cholinesterase, mainly outside the central nervous system, which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to organophosphate pesticides or related compounds. This allows for the destruction of accumulated acetylcholine, enabling neuromuscular junctions to function normally again. Pralidoxime chloride also slows the "aging" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a nonreactivatable form and detoxifies certain organophosphates through direct chemical reactions. Its most critical effect is relieving paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Because pralidoxime chloride is less effective in alleviating respiratory center depression, atropine is always required concomitantly to block the effect of accumulated acetylcholine at this site. Although pralidoxime chloride relieves muscarinic signs and symptoms such as salivation and bronchospasm, this action is relatively unimportant since atropine adequately addresses these issues.

- **Protopam chloride in animal studies**: Protopam chloride has been studied as an antidote in animals against various organophosphate pesticides, chemicals, and drugs. Regardless of whether animal studies suggest that the specific organophosphate poison a patient has been exposed to is amenable to treatment with pralidoxime chloride, its use should still be considered in life-threatening situations caused by these compounds. This is recommended due to the limited and arbitrary conditions of pharmacologic screening.

### Acute abdomen associated with organophosphate poisoning [^116Hca85]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Pesticides are extensively used in developed and developing countries.

- **Objectives**: The present study was designed to evaluate the clinical course of patients with carbamate or organophosphate poisoning presenting to a university-based emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: All consecutive patients admitted to our ED due to intoxication with carbamate or organophosphate compounds over a 2-year period were enrolled prospectively.

- **Results**: A total of 49 consecutive patients (26 females) were diagnosed with carbamate or organophosphate poisoning in the 24-month study period. The mean age of the patients was 32 ± 13.1 years (range 16–70 years). Signs and symptoms most frequently noted in patients with organophosphate or carbamate poisoning were perspiration, vomiting, and bronchorrhea. Abdominal pain was reported by 65.3% of the patients. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed in 22 patients who complained of abdominal pain as a leading symptom. Among these, 63.6% were found to have abdominal free fluid. Pancreatitis and peritonitis developed in one case. Atropine treatment was administered for approximately 24–36 hours, with a mean total dose of 13.75 ± 6.75 mg. Pralidoxime was administered to 70.9% of patients with organophosphate poisoning, but was not used in patients intoxicated with carbamates. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilatory support were required in 14.2% of the patients. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 3.7 ± 2.2 days. The overall mortality rate was 10.2%.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with a diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning should be screened promptly for related complications.

### Effects of black race on forearm resistance vessel function [^112H7FiS]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Presentation, response to therapy, and clinical outcome in hypertension differ according to race, and these observations could relate to differences in microvascular function. We examined forearm microvascular function in age-matched black (n = 56) and white subjects (n = 62) using intra-arterial agonist infusion and venous occlusion plethysmography.

In normotensive subjects (n = 70; 34 black and 36 white normotensives), methacholine-, sodium nitroprusside-, and verapamil-induced vasodilation was equivalent in black and white subjects. In hypertensive subjects (n = 48; 22 black and 26 white hypertensives), the vasodilator response to methacholine was markedly lower in black subjects compared with white subjects (P < 0.001). The vasodilator responses to sodium nitroprusside and verapamil, however, were equivalent in black and white hypertensive subjects.

Acute ascorbic acid infusion improved the methacholine response equally in black and white hypertensive patients, suggesting that a difference in a rapidly reversible form of oxidative stress does not explain these findings. Thus, the present study demonstrates important racial differences in vascular function and a marked impairment in endothelial vasomotor function in black patients with hypertension. Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanisms and determine whether these insights will lead to more appropriately tailored management of hypertension and its complications.
