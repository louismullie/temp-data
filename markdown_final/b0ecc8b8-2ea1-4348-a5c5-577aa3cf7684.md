## Question

explain alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, including its genetics, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic basis and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the molecular mechanisms in the lung versus the liver. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical phenotypes, followed by diagnostic strategies and thresholds. After that, I need to examine evidence for augmentation therapy and guideline positions. Finally, I will consider special populations, emerging therapies, and practical implementation issues, making sure I double-check any claims that might be overgeneralized or under-supported by the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the genetic foundation and nomenclature. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by SERPINA1 on chromosome 14, and the common alleles are M (normal), S (mild reduction), and Z (severe reduction), with codominant expression determining serum levels; Pi*ZZ typically has about 10–15% of normal circulating AAT, Pi*SZ around 25–60%, and Pi*MZ roughly 60% of normal, which frames risk stratification for lung and liver disease, so I should be careful to anchor statements to these ranges and not overstate risk in heterozygotes without context [^114ah8cT] [^1167J7km] [^114ovTYH] [^111DikPh].

> Wait, let me verify the lung pathophysiology before I jump ahead. The classic model is loss-of-function: reduced circulating and epithelial lining fluid AAT fails to neutralize neutrophil elastase, tipping the protease–antiprotease balance toward matrix destruction and panacinar emphysema, classically basal in distribution; however, I need to emphasize that Z-AAT polymers can also deposit in the lung interstitium and may amplify inflammation, so the phenotype is not purely a passive deficiency but also includes proinflammatory gain-of-function features in some contexts [^1123jnjB] [^1167J7km] [^113o8Lc3].

> Hold on, I should verify the liver pathophysiology separately because the mechanism is distinct. In Pi*ZZ, misfolded Z-AAT accumulates within hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum, causing proteotoxic injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk; importantly, this is a toxic gain-of-function process rather than simple loss of circulating AAT, which explains why liver disease can occur even as lung disease reflects inadequate antiprotease activity [^115uGWh1] [^114V8Vmk] [^115RAiJs].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and clinical manifestations, but I need to be cautious with prevalence estimates. Severe AATD (Pi*ZZ) is often cited around 1 in 3000 to 5000 in populations of European ancestry, yet underdiagnosis remains substantial, with fewer than 10% identified in many settings; lung disease typically presents as early-onset COPD/emphysema, frequently in the fourth to sixth decades, with a predilection for the lung bases and small airways involvement, while liver disease spans neonatal cholestasis to adult cirrhosis and HCC, with risk modified by age, sex, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol exposure [^111toLXT] [^112auVHA] [^115RAiJs] [^113o8Lc3].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach and thresholds because misclassification is common. A practical two-step algorithm is to measure serum AAT first, recognizing that a level less than about 11 micromol/L (0.57 g/L) indicates severe deficiency warranting genetic confirmation, while a level above about 23 micromol/L (1.2 g/L) makes severe deficiency unlikely; however, because dysfunctional variants can have near-normal levels, DNA sequencing of SERPINA1 exons 2–5 is the gold standard when suspicion is high or when targeted panels are unrevealing, and first-degree relatives of identified cases should be offered counseling and testing [^111S3nAS] [^114i7n9Z] [^114DDFQV] [^113rjkvR].

> Let me consider who to test, and I should confirm guideline alignment. The Canadian Thoracic Society and GOLD recommend targeted testing in all patients with COPD at diagnosis, in adults with persistent airflow obstruction labeled as asthma or unexplained bronchiectasis, and in first-degree relatives of affected individuals; importantly, the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous, and delayed diagnosis is associated with worse outcomes, so a low threshold for testing in at-risk presentations is justified despite low-quality evidence for some recommendations [^116qK1um] [^113xWYV8] [^1129Gs2o].

> Now, I will examine augmentation therapy evidence, and I need to separate biochemical efficacy from clinical outcomes. Intravenous AAT at 60 mg/kg weekly restores serum and epithelial lining fluid levels above a putative protective threshold and slows loss of lung density on CT in randomized trials, with the RAPID program demonstrating a consistent effect on densitometry; however, effects on FEV1 decline are small and difficult to detect in adequately powered RCTs, and real-world registry analyses suggest a survival advantage in appropriately selected cohorts, so the clinical signal is strongest for emphysema progression rather than spirometric change [^117BeqrC] [^113JNkBr] [^115Hrh2e] [^117J7rcJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal eligibility; I should verify guideline criteria. Contemporary guidelines conditionally recommend augmentation for adults with documented AATD genotypes, severely reduced AAT levels, impaired FEV1 less than 80% predicted, and CT evidence of emphysema, on top of optimal COPD care; they also note uncertainty about benefit in those without airflow limitation or without emphysema, and emphasize that most trial participants were Pi*ZZ, limiting extrapolation to Pi*SZ or other phenotypes [^115aYohy] [^111bUsHT] [^113n8MTz] [^112LDhCs].

> I need to check special populations and edge cases. Pi*MZ individuals generally have modestly reduced AAT and may have increased COPD risk with smoking or other exposures, but there is no definitive evidence for augmentation benefit in this group, so routine augmentation is not recommended; conversely, Pi*Null genotypes with absent AAT production appear to have particularly severe emphysema, underscoring the correlation between circulating AAT and lung phenotype severity, though data are limited and largely observational [^115DpaQe] [^111DikPh] [^114ovTYH].

> Next, I should review non-augmentation management and make sure I do not omit essentials. Smoking cessation is the most impactful intervention to slow lung function decline, standard COPD therapies including bronchodilators, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccinations, and exacerbation prevention apply, and for advanced disease, lung transplantation is a key option; for liver disease, surveillance for fibrosis with noninvasive tools and referral for transplant evaluation in decompensated cirrhosis are standard, with transplant restoring normal AAT phenotype and levels [^113xWYV8] [^115wetdd] [^115LNLxH].

> Let me consider emerging and investigational therapies, and I should confirm the most promising signals. Hepatocyte-targeted RNA interference with fazirsiran has shown phase 2 signals of reducing hepatic Z-AAT synthesis and improving fibrosis markers, representing a potential disease-modifying approach for liver disease; inhaled AAT is under study to deliver higher local concentrations, and gene therapy approaches using AAV vectors have achieved sustained albeit low-level expression with partial correction of neutrophil defects in early trials, though clinical efficacy remains to be proven [^112RbumJ] [^113JNkBr] [^114rBZRg].

> I should double-check implementation gaps because underdiagnosis materially alters outcomes. Diagnostic delays of roughly 5–8 years are common and correlate with worse symptoms and survival, and even simple EMR prompts increase testing rates but remain underutilized; standardizing CT densitometry reporting and ensuring access to sequencing can improve case finding and appropriate therapy initiation, and family cascade testing is a high-yield strategy to identify at-risk relatives early [^1129Gs2o] [^113pUGyj] [^1164SsA8] [^113rjkvR].

> But wait, what if I overstated that all COPD patients must be screened universally; I should verify the nuance. While GOLD endorses screening all patients with COPD once, especially in higher-prevalence regions, the Canadian Thoracic Society frames this as a conditional recommendation for targeted testing in defined respiratory phenotypes and relatives, reflecting low-quality evidence and practical constraints; thus, I should present both positions and emphasize shared decision-making and local epidemiology when advising testing strategies [^113xWYV8] [^116qK1um].

> In summary, AATD is a codominant SERPINA1 disorder with dual pathobiology: loss-of-function antiprotease deficiency drives emphysema, while proteotoxic polymer accumulation drives liver disease; diagnosis hinges on serum level screening followed by DNA sequencing, with targeted testing in COPD, persistent airflow obstruction, and family members; augmentation therapy preserves lung density and may improve survival in appropriately selected patients with emphysema and airflow limitation, whereas management otherwise mirrors COPD best practices plus liver-directed surveillance and transplant pathways, and emerging RNAi and gene therapies may reshape care if safety and efficacy are confirmed [^117BeqrC] [^115aYohy] [^112RbumJ].

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a **genetic disorder** caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to low levels of functional alpha-1 antitrypsin and increased risk of early-onset emphysema [^114ah8cT] and liver disease [^114V8Vmk]. It is most often due to the Z allele (Glu342Lys) [^116qxunB], with PiZZ individuals having about 15% of normal AAT levels [^1167J7km]. Diagnosis relies on **serum AAT level, phenotype, and genotyping** [^111S3nAS], with DNA sequencing as the gold standard [^111S3nAS]. Management includes smoking cessation, standard COPD care, and intravenous AAT augmentation for severe deficiency with emphysema [^115aYohy] [^117BeqrC]; liver transplantation is considered for advanced liver disease [^115wetdd]. Early detection and family screening are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113rjkvR] [^116ui878].

---

## Genetic basis and pathophysiology

- **Genetic mutations**: AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene on chromosome 14 [^116qxunB], with the Z allele (Glu342Lys) most common and the S allele (Glu264Val) also frequent [^116qxunB].

- **Protein synthesis and function**: AAT is a serine protease inhibitor produced mainly by hepatocytes [^1123jnjB]; it inactivates neutrophil elastase and other proteases, protecting lung tissue from proteolytic damage [^1123jnjB].

- **Pathophysiology**: Z-variant AAT misfolds and polymerizes within hepatocytes, causing retention and reduced circulating AAT [^111o1Z2h]; this protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lungs leads to emphysema, while polymer accumulation causes liver injury [^1123jnjB].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### Pulmonary disease

Panlobular emphysema is the **hallmark**, typically presenting in the **third to fourth decade** [^113xWYV8], especially in smokers [^113o8Lc3]. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develops earlier and progresses faster than in smokers without AATD [^112f6ZsB]. Small airways disease with **bronchiectasis** and chronic bronchitis are common [^113o8Lc3].

---

### Hepatic disease

Neonatal cholestasis may be the **initial manifestation** [^113pit4H]. Chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are **increased risks**, particularly in PiZZ individuals [^115RAiJs].

---

### Other manifestations

Panniculitis is a rare skin condition associated with AATD [^115qdgiU]. Vasculitis, including ANCA-associated vasculitis, has also been reported [^113BDXmU].

---

## Diagnosis

### Laboratory tests

Serum AAT level is the **initial screening test** [^1126ud5i]; levels below 11 μmol/L (0.57 g/L) indicate severe deficiency [^115aYohy]. Phenotyping by isoelectric focusing distinguishes normal (MM), heterozygous (MZ, SZ), and homozygous (ZZ) variants [^notfound]. Genotyping identifies common variants (S, Z), while DNA sequencing of SERPINA1 is the **gold standard** for rare or novel mutations [^111S3nAS].

---

### Clinical guidelines for testing

Test individuals with COPD, adult-onset asthma with persistent airflow obstruction, and unexplained bronchiectasis [^111o5D5f] [^113xWYV8]. Also test **first-degree relatives** of individuals with AATD [^113rjkvR].

---

## Management

### Pulmonary management

- **Smoking cessation**: Essential to slow lung function decline and reduce exacerbations [^notfound].

- **Standard COPD care**: Bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, and vaccination [^notfound].

- **Augmentation therapy**: Intravenous AAT replacement for severe deficiency (PiZZ) with emphysema and FEV1 < 80% predicted [^115aYohy]; evidence supports slowing emphysema progression on CT [^117BeqrC].

- **Lung transplantation**: Consider for advanced emphysema and severe airflow obstruction [^111NzFhC].

---

### Hepatic management

Regular monitoring of liver function and imaging is recommended [^notfound]. Liver transplantation is indicated for **advanced cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma** [^115wetdd].

---

## Prognosis

Pulmonary prognosis is poor without smoking cessation and augmentation therapy, with **early-onset emphysema and respiratory failure** [^115F2uAd]. Hepatic prognosis varies: some develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, while others have minimal liver disease [^115RAiJs].

---

## Epidemiology

Prevalence of severe deficiency (PiZZ) is about 1 in 3,000–5,000 in populations of European ancestry, whereas it is **less common in Asian and African populations** [^113pit4H]. Carrier frequency is roughly 1 in 25–50 for the Z allele in European populations [^notfound].

---

## Current research and future directions

Gene therapy is under investigation to correct **SERPINA1 mutations** and restore AAT production [^1145barp]. RNA-based therapies are being explored to reduce **Z-AAT synthesis** and polymer accumulation [^112RbumJ]. Inhaled AAT is being studied to deliver **AAT directly to the lungs** and improve convenience and efficacy [^113JNkBr].

---

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a **genetic disorder** causing low functional AAT, leading to emphysema and liver disease. Early diagnosis, smoking cessation, standard COPD care, and augmentation therapy for severe deficiency are key to management, with liver transplantation for advanced liver disease [^115aYohy] [^115wetdd].

## References

### The role of computed tomography for the evaluation of lung disease in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^114ffPNE]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by low serum levels of or dysfunctional alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor. In the lung parenchyma, this results in a loss of protection against the activity of serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase. The resultant imbalance in protease and antiprotease activity leads to an increased risk for the development of early-onset emphysema and COPD. As in traditional smoke-related COPD, the assessment of the severity and disease progression of lung disease in AATD is conventionally based on lung function; however, pulmonary function tests are unable to discriminate between emphysema and airways disease, the two hallmark pathologic features of COPD. CT imaging has been used as a tool to further characterize lung structure and evaluate therapeutic interventions in AATD-related COPD. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative CT have significantly improved our assessment of the lung architecture, which has provided investigators and clinicians with a more detailed evaluation of the extent and severity of emphysema and airways disease in AATD. In addition, serial CT imaging measures are becoming increasingly important, as they provide a tool to monitor emphysema progression. This review describes the principles of CT technology and the role of CT imaging in assessing pulmonary disease progression in AATD, including the effect of therapeutic interventions.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: does augmentation therapy work? [^113YRjTa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare inherited cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that affects an estimated 250,000 individuals in Europe and North America. Although alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy for individuals with AATD has been available since the late 1980s, about 35 years, this therapy has not been uniformly adopted by many countries. Despite the overwhelming logic that replacement of a missing protein would prevent further loss of lung tissue in individuals with AATD, many regulators remain unconvinced of the clinical utility of AAT augmentation therapy in individuals with AATD because clinical trials to date have not met regulatory designated clinical endpoints. The reason clinical trials have not met mandated clinical endpoints is complex and illustrates the challenges of proving that therapies are effective in rare diseases in general.

First is the fact that outcome variables such as FEV₁ are imprecise and only partially reflect the clinical features of AATD lung disease, particularly progressive emphysema, in individuals with AATD over their lifetimes. Second, sample size estimates using FEV₁ rate of decline as an outcome variable may approach 400 subjects in each arm and require 3-plus years to reach significance. Other challenges to designing studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of augmentation therapy include the lack of effective AATD screening programs to identify individuals with AATD and their identification only after they have substantial lung function impairment. Adding to these challenges is the placebo requirement for subjects in long-term intravenous (IV) studies.

An NHLBI registry that followed more than a 1,000 individuals with AATD with and without augmentation for up to 7 years only demonstrated a treatment effect in a subset of individuals with an FEV₁ between 35% and 49% predicted. The validity of this treatment effect has been questioned on the basis of the fact that subjects were not randomized and entered the study having been either placed on augmentation therapy or not by their individual physicians, thus creating a potential bias based on unclear health care decisions.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115F2uAd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disease affecting the lung and liver. The typical pulmonary manifestation is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema. Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in young adulthood, and terminal respiratory insufficiency causes premature death in many patients. In the liver, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may manifest as benign neonatal hepatitis syndrome; a small percentage of adults develop liver fibrosis, with progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The alpha-1 antitrypsin molecule is a serine protease inhibitor that is predominantly produced in the liver. Its most important physiologic functions are the protection of pulmonary tissue from aggressive proteolytic enzymes and regulation of pulmonary immune processes. Diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be established by measurement of the serum alpha-1 antitrypsin concentration or by genetic analysis. Treatment is similar to the usual treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A further option is substitution therapy with human alpha-1 antitrypsin. The targets of treatment are the prevention of the accelerated decline of pulmonary function, reduction of lung infections, and improvements in exercise capacity.

### Suspecting and testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-an allergist's and / or immunologist's perspective [^113Ch58d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary, monogenic disorder with no unique clinical features. AATD can be difficult to diagnose as patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms often mistaken for other respiratory syndromes such as asthma or smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, symptoms related to AATD may also affect other organs, including the liver, vasculature, and skin. The severity of AATD varies between individuals, and in severe cases, the irreversible lung damage can develop into emphysema. Early diagnosis is critical to enable the implementation of lifestyle changes and therapeutic options that can slow further deterioration of pulmonary tissue. Once AATD is suspected, a range of tests are available (serum alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor [A1-PI] level measurement, phenotyping, genotyping, gene sequencing) for confirming AATD. Currently, intravenous infusion of A1-PI is the only therapy that directly addresses the underlying cause of AATD, and has demonstrated efficacy in a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial. This review discusses the etiology, testing, and management of AATD from the allergist's and/or immunologist's perspective. It aims to raise awareness of the condition among physicians who care for people with obstructive lung disorders and are therefore likely to see patients with obstructive lung disease that may, in fact, prove to be AATD.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy: current status [^115ajV6G]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that predisposes to the development of early-onset emphysema and, in some instances, liver disease. The use of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement therapy in the treatment of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency related emphysema is much debated and the purpose of this review is to examine the results of recent studies. We will comment briefly on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease together with new therapeutic approaches currently under intense research.

Recent Findings

Several nonrandomized observational studies and one meta-analysis on the clinical effectiveness of alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement treatment showed a favourable result towards reducing forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) deterioration in alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficient individuals with moderate lung disease or accelerated FEV₁ decline. Improved ways of monitoring disease progression, including computed tomography scanning and exacerbations, are being proposed as primary endpoints. Apart from one small randomized, placebo-controlled trial using computed tomography scanning, which showed a trend toward preservation of lung density on scanning with treatment, the literature lacks proof of effectiveness from large randomized trials.

Summary

There might be a possible, but so far unproven, role of alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation therapy in reducing the progression of emphysema in subsets of patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are required to draw firm conclusions. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology provide opportunities for development of new therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.

### Liver disease in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: a review [^114V8Vmk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited metabolic disorder that predisposes the affected individual to chronic pulmonary disease, in addition to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Just over one-third of genetically susceptible adult patients with the most severe phenotype, PiZZ, develop clinically significant liver injury. The clinical presentation of liver disease is variable, and the genetic and environmental factors that predispose some individuals to liver disease while sparing others are unknown. The mechanisms of liver and lung disease are distinct and unique. This article reviews the liver disease associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, emphasizing the genetic defect, molecular pathogenesis, natural history, and promising therapies.

### A review of augmentation therapy for α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^116G9duN]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a relatively common, but under-recognized condition which manifests commonly with liver cirrhosis and emphysema. Specific therapy for lung-affected individuals with AATD is augmentation therapy, which consists of intravenous infusion of purified human plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Augmentation therapy was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987 for emphysema associated with severe AATD and today, six augmentation therapy preparations, all of which derive from pooled human plasma, have received FDA approval.

Areas Covered

This paper reviews augmentation therapy for AATD, including the various available commercial preparations, their processing and biochemical differences, evidence regarding biochemical and clinical efficacy, patterns of clinical use, adverse effect profiles, cost-effectiveness and potential uses in conditions other than emphysema associated with AATD. Novel and emerging strategies for treating AATD are briefly discussed next, including alternative dosing and administration strategies, recombinant preparations, small molecule inhibitors of neutrophil elastase and of AAT polymerization, autophagy-enhancing drugs and gene therapy approaches.

Expert Opinion

We conclude with a discussion of our approach to managing patients with AATD and use of augmentation therapy.

### Augmentation therapy in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^11415Cg2]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that leads to early-onset emphysema. Recently, exogenous supplementation of the enzyme has become a therapeutic alternative.

Objective

To review the role of so-called augmentation therapy with pooled human plasma alpha-1 antitrypsin as a specific treatment for emphysema caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Methods

The authors performed a Medline (1966–2007) search with the keywords 'alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency' and 'therapy'. The authors focused on articles regarding biochemical and clinical efficacy.

Results/Conclusion

Augmentation therapy has been shown to raise antiprotease serum and epithelial lining fluid levels above the 'protective threshold' value. Evidence suggests that this approach slows the decline in lung function, could reduce infection rates, might enhance survival, and is well tolerated. Questions about the cost-effectiveness of this therapy remain.

### Issues in the diagnosis of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency [^115g3Jgn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic disease that is underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Early diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient helps modify lifestyle choices to reduce the risk of emphysema. In 2003, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society issued guidelines to improve standards in diagnosing alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. This review highlights key recommendations for diagnosis of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, including the different types of diagnostic tests recommended in the guidelines. Options for patient treatment will be discussed.

### Key current clinical issues in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^1126bLXc]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a common but under-recognized condition on which respiratory therapists can have a large impact. A key recent development is the issuance of an international evidence-based standards document regarding diagnosis and management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This report summarizes that standards document, which recommends more widespread testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, in order to extend the benefits of diagnosis to individuals found to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. An important aspect of the standards document is that evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy is reviewed. Though no definitive support from a randomized clinical trial is available, the weight of evidence favors the clinical efficacy of alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy, at least in individuals with moderate degrees of established airflow obstruction. On that basis the standards document recommends intravenous augmentation therapy in specified clinical circumstances.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^114ah8cT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The association between severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin and early-onset pulmonary emphysema has been known for several decades. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, and the most common genetic variants causing deficiency are termed S and Z. The molecular basis of the deficiency is the abnormal folding, polymerization, and retention of the variant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The Z variant causes a change in the amino acid sequence (Glu366Lys) and is associated with plasma levels that are 10–15% of the normal M allele, whereas the S variant (Glu288Val) causes a milder deficiency with plasma levels that are 50–60% of normal.

Although the risk for lung disease in ZZ homozygotes is clearly established, the role of additional rare variants of SERPINA1 has not been adequately explored. This is an important issue, as there are more than 100 other rare variants in the SERPINA1 gene that have known or predicted deleterious effects. In addition, whether there is an increased risk for lung disease because of a single copy of the Z allele has been a source of debate in the literature for many years.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^1129Gs2o]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — clinical rationale for early identification and targeted testing. Considering the irreversible nature of lung damage, the importance of starting augmentation therapy as soon as the criteria are met must be emphasized, and late diagnosis has been associated with reduced functional status and quality of life, with suboptimal management leading to accelerated health status decline. Observational data indicate patients diagnosed on average 5.3 years after first manifestations with a mean FEV1 of 52% predicted value had delayed diagnosis associated with worse overall survival and transplant-free survival, and the delay was not related to specific clinical characteristics, implying limited sensitivity of the clinical picture. Accordingly, most medical societies recommend targeted testing of individuals investigated for lung disease possibly associated with A1AT deficiency and of relatives of identified cases; recommendations also include testing adult patients diagnosed with "asthma" with persistent airflow obstruction or unexplained bronchiectasis to identify atypical A1AT deficiency presentations.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^115aYohy]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency augmentation therapy — The panel conditionally recommends A1AT augmentation therapy to patients who do not smoke or who formerly smoked with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV₁] < 80% predicted; associated with emphysema), with documented deficiency genotypes and severely reduced A1AT level (< 11 μmol/L or < 0.57 g/L) in addition to receiving optimal pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for COPD.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a re-surfacing adult liver disorder [^115uGWh1]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) arises from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) that lead to AAT retention in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, causing proteotoxic liver injury and loss-of-function lung disease. The homozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗ZZ genotype) is responsible for the majority of severe AATD cases and can precipitate both paediatric and adult liver diseases, while the heterozygous Pi∗Z mutation (Pi∗MZ genotype) is an established genetic modifier of liver disease. We review genotype-related hepatic phenotypes/disease predispositions. We also describe the mechanisms and factors promoting the development of liver disease, as well as approaches to evaluate the extent of liver fibrosis. Finally, we discuss emerging diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of this often neglected disorder.

### Anti-proteases and alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy [^113vEnQb]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease that first highlighted the importance of protease balance in normal lung homeostasis. Proteases such as neutrophil elastase are important in many pulmonary diseases. However, the first commercially licensed anti-protease therapy was used for emphysema in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The 4 commercial alpha-1 protease inhibitor preparations in the United States are currently given intravenously to augment the serum and alveolar epithelial lining fluid concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Since the discovery of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in 1963, many genetic polymorphisms of the SERPINA1 gene have been discovered. Because neutrophilic inflammation is the hallmark of usual COPD, anti-protease therapy also has been explored in this disease. Further trials with different dosing schema, inhaled therapy, and in different disease states are all ongoing. These studies would be facilitated by having COPD outcomes that are independent of measurement of air flow and achievable in smaller populations over a short period of time.

### Pulmonary cellular toxicity in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^1123jnjB]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by mutations in SERPINA1, the gene encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT, an antiprotease with immunomodulatory functions, is an abundant serum protein secreted mainly by hepatocytes. AAT is also known to be produced by extrahepatic cells, including by those that contribute to the pool present in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid. Patients with AATD who are homozygous for the Z mutation (ZZ-AATD) are susceptible to lung and liver disease. Although AATD-associated liver disease results from accumulation of misfolded, polymerized Z-AAT within hepatocytes and associated gain-of-function toxicity, AATD-associated emphysema has been attributed primarily to loss of antiprotease function, unopposed neutrophil elastase activity, and resultant pulmonary parenchymal destruction.

Protease-antiprotease imbalance alone, however, does not fully explain the pulmonary phenotype in AATD. Multiple studies have identified proinflammatory consequences of Z-AAT polymer deposition in the lung interstitium, including activation and trafficking of innate immune cells. In addition, antiprotease replacement via AAT augmentation therapy alone is not sufficient to fully arrest accelerated pulmonary function decline in some individuals with ZZ-AATD. Prior work has identified extrahepatic cells that produce AAT, including myeloid cells, and airway epithelial cells. More recently, single-cell RNA sequencing data sets of adult human lung tissue have consistently demonstrated SERPINA1 transcript expression in alveolar type 2 cells (AT2s) and macrophages. AT2s are facultative progenitors of the distal lung, the structure primarily injured in emphysema observed in AATD. Whether the human alveolar epithelium produces AAT protein in either healthy or diseased lungs, however, has not been established. Here, we report that AAT protein is expressed by human adult lung AT2s and macrophages, resulting in intrinsic cellular stress among resident lung cells in ZZ-AATD.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: does augmentation therapy work? [^112yqTkh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

There are important take-home messages from this real-world study of individuals with AATD. First is that the presence of respiratory symptoms in this genetically homogeneous group sets the stage for both an increase in mortality and steeper declines in lung function. Second, the loss of lung function as determined by FEV₁ differs over time in the lung index group. Only during the "rapidly" declining phase is FEV₁ rate of decline, GOLD stage 2, useful in identifying a treatment effect. Using FEV₁ rate of decline in all individuals with AATD, regardless of their FEV₁ percent predicted at the time of enrollment, will not be an adequate outcome variable, because change in FEV₁ is sufficient only in those individuals with GOLD stage 2.

Studies using FEV 1 change as a primary outcome would be feasible only in subgroups of lung index subjects with AATD. The challenge in using this group is that they likely represent a small proportion of enrollable subjects, generating even greater challenges for recruiting subjects for a treatment trial in this rare inherited disease. On the basis of the results of this real-world study of the effectiveness of IV AAT augmentation therapy as well as other studies demonstrating "biochemical efficacy" and reduction in loss of lung density over time, perhaps it is time to accept that AAT augmentation is a clinically effective therapy for individuals with AATD.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency augmentation therapy — eligibility and panel stance: Individuals who have documented SERPINA1 genotypes associated with A1AT deficiency, have severely reduced functional A1AT level (< 11 µmol/L or < 0.57 g/L), and are receiving optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be offered and encouraged to receive augmentation therapy. The panel, guided by a patient participant, estimated that patients would place a high value on preserving lung density (as a valid surrogate marker of slowing emphysema progression) and reducing mortality as treatment goals.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — objectives and target population for testing and augmentation therapy states that this systematic review with meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline was undertaken to address 2 questions, asking which populations are most appropriate for targeted testing and whether A1AT augmentation therapy is effective in patients with COPD and documented A1AT deficiency. The guideline provides direction on targeted testing and augmentation therapy in patients with COPD with emphysema, adult-onset asthma with persistent airflow obstruction, and unexplained bronchiectasis; for this purpose, patients with COPD have a FEV₁, FVC < 0.7, and those with A1AT deficiency have documented SERPINA1 genotypes. Patients with COPD and severe A1AT deficiency (< 11 μmol/L or < 0.57 g/L) are the target recipients for augmentation therapy, and the guideline does not address A1AT deficiency related liver disease, necrotizing panniculitis, anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibody-positive vasculitis, or mass screening/targeted testing of neonates.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency recognition and diagnostic delay — Despite knowledge and prior targeted screening recommendations, this condition remains underdiagnosed and is often recognized late; in one study mean FEV1 and DLco at diagnosis were already reduced by 50%. Clinical presentation is typically indistinguishable from other COPD, and up to a third of patients with severe A1AT deficiency have greater upper-lobe involvement; delayed or missed diagnosis may relate to overreliance on "classical" features and other factors, justifying a more systematic approach to patient evaluation.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a conformational disease associated with lung and liver manifestations [^112owC9Y]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serine anti-protease produced chiefly by the liver. A1AT deficiency is a genetic disorder characterized by serum levels of less than 11 mumol/L and is associated with liver and lung manifestations. The liver disease, which occurs in up to 15% of A1AT-deficient individuals, is a result of toxic gain-of-function mutations in the A1AT gene, which cause the A1AT protein to fold aberrantly and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The lung disease is associated with loss-of-function, specifically decreased anti-protease protection on the airway epithelial surface. The so-called 'Z' mutation in A1AT deficiency encodes a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at position 342 in A1AT and is the most common A1AT allele associated with disease. Here we review the current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of A1AT deficiency and the best clinical management protocols.

### Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency: best clinical practice [^111toLXT]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

alpha(1)-Antitrypsin (AAT), a 52 kDa plasma protein, is produced mainly in the liver. It is the most abundant circulating serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin). It has also previously been called protease inhibitor to reflect its function as a general inhibitor of serine proteases. Its main physiological role is to inhibit neutrophil elastase and it contributes to the innate immune system as an anti-inflammatory protein. Severe AAT deficiency is most prevalent in northern Europeans affecting about 1 in 3000 of the population. AAT deficiency predisposes individuals who smoke to developing pulmonary emphysema in the fourth-fifth decade of adult life and to childhood cirrhosis in about 10% of cases, with the initial presentation being prolonged neonatal jaundice. The mean interval from presentation with symptoms to diagnosis in adults is about 8 years. The condition is under-recognised and under-diagnosed. The only effective current treatment for the severe liver disease that occurs in childhood currently is liver transplantation. Replacement therapy with purified AAT from human plasma is being used in clinical practice for the lung disease though it is not known whether this influences the outcome of this chronic condition. The liver pathology arises from intracellular polymerisation of mutant protein, and attenuation of polymerisation is a potential target for therapy.

### An electronic health record-based strategy to enhance detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^113pUGyj]. Respiratory Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is severely underrecognized and delayed diagnosis is associated with harm, strategies to enhance early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are needed.

Methods

The study intervention was placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency within an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard that houses prompts to providers to implement guideline-based recommendations. This recommendation was for all patients assigned a diagnosis of COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed in 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard.

Results

After the prompt, whereas testing was still performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (ie, from 1.2% to 4.6%, P < .05). This did not result in detection of new patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The rate of testing increased both for alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, though the rate of genotype testing was 2–5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum level.

Conclusions

The results of this preliminary study of a detection strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency show that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when indicated in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased the frequency of testing. Still, that only 4.6% of those in whom testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was indicated were tested in the post-intervention period shows that, as for all other alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-targeted detection interventions to date, the impact of the intervention was marginal and that other strategies remain needed to mitigate underrecognition. A focus on combining targeted detection strategies (eg, coupling enhanced awareness with free testing) and population-based screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is suggested.

### Health status decline in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a feasible outcome for disease modifying therapies? [^116r3cb6]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Unlike interventions that have short or medium term effects in COPD (improvement in FEV 1, health status or reduction in exacerbations), therapies that modify disease progression present greater challenges to objective and subjective measures of efficacy. Physiological progression has classically been characterised by FEV 1 decline although recent COPD studies indicated that not all patients decline leading to attempts to identify "rapid decliners" for study enrichment by patient characteristics such as Emphysema biomarkers such as CC16 or neutrophilic proteinase footprints.

Health related outcomes relate to both FEV 1 and exacerbations. A mean clinically important difference (MCID) is defined for the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and is a preferred secondary and co-primary outcome by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognising its clinical relevance. However entry into clinical trials alone improves both compliance and health status (HS) and clinical impact has to be judged above this placebo effect.

Large COPD trials provide some evidence of disease modification (slowing FEV 1 decline) in post hoc analysis of TORCH and prospective analysis of SUMMIT studies. However in rarer conditions predisposing to COPD, like Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), where treatments such as augmentation therapy might be expected to modify disease progression, it is impractical to deliver powered studies with conventional outcomes. The number needed to determine the effect on FEV 1 decline is deemed prohibitive so a more direct measure of the pathology (emphysema progression) by Computed Tomography has been accepted as a surrogate outcome by the FDA. Nevertheless despite consistent double blind studies of disease modification there remains uncertainty about whether augmentation improves other outcomes, such as HS, although there is observational evidence that mortality is reduced.

Disease modification in COPD is becoming an important pharmaceutical objective and several anti-inflammatory and anti proteinase strategies are being developed and undergoing phase1/2 testing. The delivery of phase 3 clinical trials needs to address the use of SGRQ in trial design as outlined by the FDA. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether HS defined by the SGRQ could be employed as part of future AATD trials to provide clearer evidence of patient benefit and how the decline of lung physiology influences the SGRQ decline in a cohort of closely monitored patients with AATD never treated with antitrypsin augmentation therapy.

Concluding Comments

The evidence presented in this review suggests that CT scanning is a useful imaging tool to phenotype and measure interventions in AATD. CT lung density seems to be a clinically relevant outcome for emphysema trials. Because some caveats remain, more research is needed before it can be used routinely in clinical practice.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor for COPD associated with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the evidence [^117KRBw7]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome measures and mortality prediction in patients with AATD

COPD is a progressive condition characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible. Pathological changes can be found in the central and peripheral airways, lung parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. The destruction of the lung parenchyma or pulmonary emphysema is associated with abnormal permanent enlargement of the distal airspaces beyond the terminal bronchioles accompanied by destruction of the alveolar walls, and without obvious fibrosis. It is well established that AATD is associated with early-onset emphysema; in addition, the presence of airway disease, including a high prevalence of bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening, has been reported. In AATD, emphysema is predominantly distributed in the basal region of the lung and is associated with a greater degree of airflow obstruction. This is in contrast to the impairment of gas exchange typically seen with emphysema distributed in the apical zone.

The early identification of these pathological changes is key to preventing widespread destruction of the lung parenchyma. FEV 1 has been traditionally regarded as the 'gold standard' endpoint for the assessment and monitoring of obstructive airways disease, and has been proposed as a potential surrogate marker for emphysema progression. However, FEV 1 lacks the sensitivity to effectively chart disease progression in patients with AATD. Changes in FEV 1 occur slowly and unevenly over time. Therefore, demonstrating a therapeutic benefit would require a placebo-controlled trial of at least 5 years duration, and the recruitment of a minimum of 1000 subjects. Compared with usual COPD, the recruitment of sufficient numbers of patients for clinical trials of rare diseases such as AATD is difficult. Furthermore, emphysema can be present in usual COPD and AATD even when FEV 1 is in the normal range.

### Health status decline in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a feasible outcome for disease modifying therapies? [^112f6ZsB]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Relevance to clinical trial design

These data have important implications for clinical trials of disease modifying therapies in AATD and non deficient COPD. Age itself (without COPD) has an effect on HS although clearly from a lower baseline than in COPD. AATD is considered a more rapidly progressive type of COPD but even those with established COPD stratified for rapid FEV 1 decline had an overall median annual increase in total SGRQ score that was only + 0.5 points higher than those with no age corrected FEV 1 decline. Indeed even when stratified into moderate and severe COPD (typical of patients currently included in clinical trials) the differences remained small and statistically insignificant.

Our data was generated from a specialised research programme with annual follow up, which conceivably has a similar placebo effect on HS to that seen in clinical trials and may reflect changes in patient expectations as well as close monitoring and better adherence to background therapy. Despite similar close monitoring, many interventional trials in COPD demonstrate a greater treatment effect on HS parameters (≥ MCID of 4 points for SGRQ total score) which may reflect the nature of the trials aimed at both short term improvement in lung function and modification of exacerbations (e.g.). However, in trials of augmentation therapy in AATD to date no signal has been detected either statistically or close to the MCID leading to scepticism about efficacy despite significant effects on emphysema progression. This failure may reflect both the size of the studies in this rare condition and the lack of any immediate improvement in lung function (and hence a noticeable clinical signal) for disease modifying treatments like augmentation.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: the learning goes on… [^1123KeAZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

So how might this have an effect?

The Z variants of AAT can spontaneously polymerize and these are proinflammatory, being found in the lung tissues in close proximity to neutrophils. This property may be an amplification factor for the inflammation generated by cigarette smoke or established COPD. This would explain why smokers who are MZ develop mild COPD compared with control subjects and why this, rather than smoking, leads to progressive airflow obstruction. Whether this progression is worse than in a matched MM cohort should be explored (as suggested by the authors) to clarify this concept. So, still more to learn!

LT is indicated for decompensated cirrhosis due to α-1-antitrypsin deficiency (I-A). Screening to exclude lung disease with pulmonary function tests and chest imaging should be undertaken in patients with α-1-antitrypsin deficiency being evaluated for LT (I-A).

### Cleaning up α-1 antitrypsin deficiency related liver disease [^112RbumJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the most common genetic disorders arising due to mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene affecting primarily the lung and the liver. This review summarizes the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of different AATD genotypes and discusses the recent therapeutic developments. The focus is on the severe, rare homozygous Pi∗ZZ and the common heterozygous Pi∗MZ genotype.

Recent Findings

Pi∗ZZ individuals harbor an up to 20 times higher risk of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis than noncarriers and liver transplantation is currently the only available therapeutic option. AATD constitutes a proteotoxic disorder arising from hepatic AAT accumulation and the currently most promising data come from a phase 2, open-label trial of fazirsiran, a hepatocyte-targeted siRNA. Pi∗MZ subjects display an increased risk of advanced liver disease and at the latter stage, a faster deterioration than individuals without AAT mutation.

Summary

Although the fazirsiran data offer a glimpse of hope to AATD patients, a consensus on appropriate study endpoint, a careful patient selection as well as monitoring of long-term safety will be essential for an approval.

### An electronic health record-based strategy to enhance detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^116NSrHk]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is severely underrecognized and delayed diagnosis is associated with harm, strategies to enhance early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are needed. Methods: The study intervention was placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency within an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard that houses prompts to providers to implement guideline-based recommendations. This recommendation was for all patients assigned a diagnosis of COPD based on relevant International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The rate of testing for and detecting individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was assessed in 12 one-month intervals before and after implementing the dashboard. Results: After the prompt, whereas testing was still performed in only a small percentage of guideline-concordant instances, the rate of testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency increased 3.8-fold (ie, from 1.2% to 4.6%, P < .05). This did not result in detection of new patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The rate of testing increased both for alpha-1 antitrypsin serum levels and genotypes in each month after the intervention, though the rate of genotype testing was 2–5-fold lower than the rate of testing for serum level. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study of a detection strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency show that placing a reminder to test for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency when indicated in an electronic medical record health maintenance dashboard significantly increased the frequency of testing. Still, that only 4.6% of those in whom testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency was indicated were tested in the post-intervention period shows that, as for all other alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-targeted detection interventions to date, the impact of the intervention was marginal and that other strategies remain needed to mitigate underrecognition. A focus on combining targeted detection strategies (eg, coupling enhanced awareness with free testing) and population-based screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is suggested.

### The impact of delayed diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: the association between diagnostic delay and worsened clinical status [^1124G2ri]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is frequently underrecognized. Individuals with symptoms often experience long diagnostic delays. Although a delayed diagnosis is logically presumed to be associated with adverse effects, confirmatory evidence that a delay in diagnosis confers harm is sparse. The current study characterized the association between a delayed diagnosis and the clinical status at the time of diagnosis.

Methods

Patients with newly diagnosed severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin received questionnaires that assessed self-reported diagnostic delay, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test. Results of spirometry were retrieved and the relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and FEV 1% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were assessed.

Results

Forty subjects were recruited (31 with PI*ZZ, 9 with PI*SZ). Values for FEV 1% predicted, SGRQ, and COPD Assessment Test were available for 17, 40, and 32 subjects, respectively. The relationship between the diagnostic delay interval and all outcomes was directionally consistent with an adverse impact of increasing diagnostic delay. For each additional year of diagnostic delay, the subject's FEV 1% predicted decreased by 0.3% (P = 0.66), The SGRQ Total score increased by 1.6 points (P < .001), and the COPD Assessment Test score increased by 0.7 points (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

The results of this analysis were consistent with a delayed diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency being associated with worse COPD-related symptoms and functional status, and with a trend toward worsened air-flow obstruction. Given that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with accelerated emphysema progression, these findings underscore the importance of early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and reinforce guidelines that endorse alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency testing in all adults with fixed air-flow obstruction and first-degree relatives of individuals with severe deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin.

### Ethical considerations in gene selection for reproductive carrier screening [^114ykYUe]. Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Most people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are homozygous for the Z allele. In people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, lung disease generally starts in adulthood and is exacerbated by smoking and exposure to other lung irritants. Approximately 80–100% of people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency will develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Stoller et al.). Whilst liver disease in people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can occur at any age, the most severe form occurs in infancy, resulting in severe liver damage and death in approximately 2% of children with the ZZ genotype.

As Ruby and Lee's case (Box 3) illustrates, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency provides a good example of the ethical complexity in the notion of severity. The clinical presentation of this condition is both variable and unpredictable. It is however a gene with a relatively high carrier rate (Wienke et al.). A phenotype of severe liver damage and death at a young age would be a reasonable inclusion for RGCS, yet this occurs infrequently and cannot be predicted with certainty. The majority of cases of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are adult-onset, and can be mitigated to an extent by avoiding exposure to environmental lung irritants.

### Higher healthcare cost and utilization before and after diagnosis of AATD in the United States [^1125eG9Z]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder. Mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene may result in reduced levels of AAT, which are associated with an increased risk of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There could also be an increased risk for liver disease. Over 100 genetic variants of the AAT gene have been identified. Variants associated with severely reduced levels of AAT, the null-null (no AATD mRNA or protein production), and ZZ (low levels and functionality of AATD) phenotypes, place an individual at a high risk of lung disease compared to the general population. More moderately reduced levels of AAT are seen with the SZ (< 57 mg/dL AATD protein) phenotype, which is associated with a mild increased risk of lung disease. PiZZ is a common single-gene defect found in AATD patients. It is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children with AATD. A comprehensive review of AATD genotypes and their presentations has recently been published.

Evidence-based guidance for the management of AATD recommends preventive strategies, such as smoking cessation and minimization of exposure to respiratory irritants, to prevent the development of emphysema. In addition, patients with serum levels of AAT less than 11 μM who have moderate emphysema (FEV 1 in the range of 30% — 65% predicted) may benefit from a slower decline in lung function with augmentation therapy consisting of purified plasma-derived AAT for intravenous administration. For patients with more severe emphysema, augmentation offers the potential to prolong survival.

Early recognition of AATD provides the opportunity to implement these preventive strategies and treatment interventions to potentially minimize the progression of lung disease. AATD testing is recommended for all COPD patients and others with symptomatic fixed airway obstruction and unexplained bronchiectasis or liver disease. Despite these testing guidelines, findings from patient surveys indicate that patients experience extended periods and multiple medical visits before diagnosis. Findings from these surveys report a mean time interval from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of AATD ranging from 5.6 to 8.3 years. The delay in diagnosis may have an impact beyond the progression of lung damage. Unfavorable effects on work, relationships with family and friends, and health insurance status have been reported. The utilization of healthcare resources is also impacted as patients report healthcare visits to multiple providers in search of a diagnosis.

### 5 year expression and neutrophil defect repair after gene therapy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^114rBZRg]. Molecular Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a monogenic disorder resulting in emphysema due principally to the unopposed effects of neutrophil elastase. We previously reported achieving plasma wild-type alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations at 2.5%–3.8% of the purported therapeutic level at 1 year after a single intramuscular administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 alpha-1 antitrypsin vector in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficient patients. We analyzed blood and muscle for alpha-1 antitrypsin expression and immune cell response. We also assayed previously reported markers of neutrophil function known to be altered in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficient patients. Here, we report sustained expression at 2.0%–2.5% of the target level from years 1–5 in these same patients without any additional recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype-1 alpha-1 antitrypsin vector administration. In addition, we observed partial correction of disease-associated neutrophil defects, including neutrophil elastase inhibition, markers of degranulation, and membrane-bound anti-neutrophil antibodies. There was also evidence of an active T regulatory cell response (similar to the 1 year data) and an exhausted cytotoxic T cell response to adeno-associated virus serotype-1 capsid. These findings suggest that muscle-based alpha-1 antitrypsin gene replacement is tolerogenic and that stable levels of M-AAT may exert beneficial neutrophil effects at lower concentrations than previously anticipated.

### Identification of alpha-1 antitrypsin-deficient subjects with normal spirometry who may benefit from alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement [^113rJeV4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Fraughen and colleagues showed that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation conferred a survival advantage by comparing the survival probability of AAT-deficient subjects from Ireland (where AAT augmentation is not given readily) with those from Austria and Switzerland (where AAT augmentation is given more readily). They also identified two groups of AAT-deficient subjects: the lung index group (defined as AAT-deficient individuals who had undergone AAT testing for respiratory reasons or who had airflow limitation on initial spirometry, with just over 50% previously or currently receiving AAT augmentation) and the non–lung index group (who underwent testing for other reasons and presumably no airflow limitation on initial spirometry, with ∼90% having never received AAT augmentation). This important study showed survival advantage with AAT replacement despite no observable improvement in FEV 1, except for those in the lung index group with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage 2 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for whom there was a significant improvement in FEV 1 with AAT augmentation.

1 INTRODUCTION

α 1 ‐Antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor (PI) that protects lung tissue from proteolytic damage by inhibiting neutrophil elastase, a powerful enzyme with broad substrate specificity. 1 Therefore, individuals with AAT deficiency (AATD), an autosomal co‐dominant condition, are at increased risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 2, 3 In addition, these individuals are often at risk of liver disease due to polymerization and retention of AAT in hepatocytes, where the majority of AAT is produced. 2

Between 0.02% and 0.04% of individuals suffer from AATD. 3 However, despite being commonly described as a rare disease, AATD is highly under‐recognized, with less than 10% of individuals with AATD identified 4, 5, 6 and with delays of more than 5 years between initial symptoms and diagnosis. 7 Although younger individuals who are often asymptomatic may understandably escape medical attention, data suggest that, despite a majority of adults with the deficiency allele PI*ZZ manifesting COPD‐related symptoms in the fourth and fifth decades, few clinicians identify AATD as the cause. 5 The lack or delay of a diagnosis of AATD inevitably delays the initiation of augmentation therapy with AAT if indicated, transplantation, supportive therapies such as smoking cessation, and genetic and psychological counseling.

Since the discovery of AATD in the 1960s, knowledge and understanding of AAT and its deficiency have progressed significantly, although effective screening methods and non‐intravenous therapy have remained elusive. The following is a comprehensive review of AATD primarily for physicians who treat COPD or asthma, highlighting advances into the epidemiology, screening, and treatment of AATD. These data are especially important for allergists because a third of AATD patients enter the healthcare system through allergists, and unfortunately, as noted in reference 9, this often delays the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. 8, 9

### New variants of α-1-antitrypsin: structural simulations and clinical expression [^111SHtcX]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Owing to the considerable diversity of AAT-deficient variants, the present study aimed to provide a practical framework for the identification and analysis of new AAT mutations. This approach successfully combines the use of clinical data derived from standard laboratory tests, phenotyping, genotyping assays, and supporting computational modelling tools to delineate the impact of new SNV in the population. In this way, the determination of the functional impact of these rare deficient phenotypes will help to establish the requirements for the clinical management of serpinopathies. Additionally, the identification of these novel mutations should be incorporated in the diagnostic tools for the screening of AATD.

### Augmentation therapy for severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency improves survival and is decoupled from spirometric decline – A multinational registry analysis [^117J7rcJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) in 1963 and the confirmation of its key role in the development of emphysema in 1967, our understanding of the biochemical nature of the lung disease has progressed steadily.

Plasma-purified intravenous AAT (IV-AAT) as augmentation therapy for severe AATD was shown to be biochemically effective as early as 1981, increasing levels of AAT in blood and in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF). A further study by Wewers and colleagues in 1987 showed that IV-AAT, administered once weekly at a dose of 60 mg/kg, increased AAT levels in blood and ELF above a putative protective threshold throughout the course of treatment, leading to approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1987. However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate significant clinical efficacy, in part because of low statistical power as a consequence of AATD being a rare genetic condition. The lack of conclusive RCT data has hampered acceptance of this therapeutic approach, and IV-AAT is not reimbursed by insurers or national health systems in many parts of the world.

Various metrics have been evaluated to assess the clinical effectiveness of IV-AAT, including decline in FEV 1, lung densitometry (,–), pulmonary exacerbations, quality of life, and survival. The overall conclusions of these papers are that severe AATD deficiency, in itself, does not predict clinical outcomes and that there is significant heterogeneity in disease progression as well as response to IV-AAT, thus making studying the effects of IV-AAT challenging and potentially cost prohibitive. Power calculations suggest that studies would require 300–500 subjects with a follow-up time period of at least 3 years to show a benefit in FEV₁ decline, whereas 342 subjects per treatment arm would be needed to detect a 40% reduction in mortality in a 5-year study of subjects with a baseline FEV₁ of 35–49% predicted. Other clinical endpoints such as D CO are considered unsuitable for large multicenter studies, in part because of the irreproducibility of the data.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency testing — two-step algorithm and sequencing standard. Testing for alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency most commonly involves serum or plasma A1AT levels and targeted PCR genotyping, but these methods may misclassify some cases; a clear solution proposed is gene sequencing. The authors propose DNA sequencing of the SERPINA1 coding regions (exons 2–5) as the gold standard and propose a two-step approach: with moderate clinical suspicion, an A1AT ≥ 23 μmol/L (≥ 1.2 g/L) rules out severe deficiency (except rare dysfunctional variants), and with high clinical suspicion they suggest DNA sequencing as the initial test. As rationale, genetic mutations are invariable while A1AT levels may vary between repeat tests, some variants have normal circulating A1AT yet represent actual deficiency, and knowledge of the genotype is essential to understand the functional deficiency present.

### Small airways disease in patients with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^113o8Lc3]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder, characterized by panacinar emphysema mainly in the lower lobes, and predisposes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at a younger age, especially in patients with concomitant cigarette smoking. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (a1-AT) is a serine protease inhibitor that mainly blocks neutrophil elastase and maintains protease/antiprotease balance in the lung and AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene that encodes a1-AT protein. PiZZ is the most common genotype associated with severe AATD, leading to reduced circulating levels of a1-AT. Besides its antiprotease function, a1-AT has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects and AATD results in defective innate immunity. Protease/antiprotease imbalance affects not only the lung parenchyma but also the small airways and recent studies have shown that AATD is associated with small airway dysfunction. Alterations in small airways structure with peripheral ventilation inhomogeneities may precede emphysema formation, providing a unique opportunity to detect early disease. The aim of the present review is to summarize the current evidence for the contribution of small airways disease in AATD-associated lung disease.

### Clinical and functional characteristics of individuals with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: EARCO international registry [^115oxHUv]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare disease that is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary emphysema. The European AATD Research Collaboration (EARCO) international registry was founded with the objective of characterising the individuals with AATD and investigating their natural history.

Methods

The EARCO registry is an international, observational and prospective study of individuals with AATD, defined as AAT serum levels < 11 μM and/or proteinase inhibitor genotypes PI*ZZ, PI*SZ and compound heterozygotes or homozygotes of other rare deficient variants. We describe the characteristics of the individuals included from February 2020 to May 2022.

Results

A total of 1044 individuals from 15 countries were analysed. The most frequent genotype was PI*ZZ (60.2%), followed by PI*SZ (29.2%). Among PI*ZZ patients, emphysema was the most frequent lung disease (57.2%) followed by COPD (57.2%) and bronchiectasis (22%). Up to 76.4% had concordant values of FEV1(%) and KCO(%). Those with impairment in FEV1(%) alone had more frequently bronchiectasis and asthma and those with impairment in KCO(%) alone had more frequent emphysema and liver disease. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age, male sex, exacerbations, increased blood platelets and neutrophils, augmentation and lower AAT serum levels were associated with worse FEV1(%).

Conclusions

EARCO has recruited > 1000 individuals with AATD from 15 countries in its first 2 years. Baseline cross sectional data provide relevant information about the clinical phenotypes of the disease, the patterns of functional impairment and factors associated with poor lung function.

### Higher healthcare cost and utilization before and after diagnosis of AATD in the United States [^11292Qoh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that can be associated with lung disease. Early recognition of this condition may provide the opportunity to minimize the progression of lung disease. Unfortunately, patients typically experience symptoms for years before a diagnosis is made. This delay in diagnosis takes a toll on the patient emotionally and physically and is therefore likely to need costly healthcare resources.

To examine the impact of that delay in diagnosis on the use of healthcare resources and cost of care, this study analyzed data from a medical insurance claims database. Medical costs, (defined in this context as all treatment and non-pharmacy costs), and utilization (emergency room visits, and hospitalizations), were examined for 1 year before diagnosis and up to 3 years following diagnosis in 1,258 patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Following diagnosis, patients were less likely to visit the emergency room or be admitted to the hospital. Healthcare costs (the sum of medical and pharmacy costs), were initially higher in the year following diagnosis but declined in subsequent years following diagnosis. This study suggests that strategies to promote diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency earlier when symptoms are not as severe may reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, as well as healthcare costs over time.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common autosomal codominant disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin, a serine protease inhibitor mainly produced in the liver. Mutations in SERPINA1 cause the accumulation of misfolded proteins, primarily in the liver and/or lungs, leading to liver cirrhosis and emphysema. Several disease models of AATD have been described using organoids, iPSCs, or patient-specific hiPSCs that recapitulate key phenotypic features of AATD such as increased alpha-1 antitrypsin retention or endoplasmic reticulum stress. AATD patient-derived hiPSCs have been used to deepen the knowledge of AATD molecular mechanisms, exploring the role of Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, inflammatory response, unfolded protein response, or the establishment of AATD-associated gene expression profiles. – Importantly, organoids and hiPSCs have been pivotal for drug discovery and therapeutic approaches. hiPSCs were used to correct and insert AATD mutations by adenine and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing, piggyBack, transcription activator-like effector, and zinc finger nuclease technology, with the successful rescue of cellular phenotypes. Importantly, hIPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells were successfully transplanted into AATD transgenic mice in which the "Z" patient mutation was introduced, which resulted in a progressive repopulation of the mouse livers. Moreover, AATD patient-derived hiPSCs and organoids have been used to create a high-throughput screening platform, and several compounds have been tested as treatment options for AATD.

### Treatment for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: does augmentation therapy work? [^115Hrh2e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

On the basis of these challenges, it is unlikely that a large placebo control study of augmentation therapy using FEV 1 as a primary outcome variable will ever be completed. Does this mean that augmentation therapy is not effective? The RAPID Study, a phase 3 trial of Zemaira (alpha-1-antitrypsin), in AATD individuals and emphysema using a robust and logical outcome variable, computed tomomograpy densitomtry, demonstrated that augmentation therapy reduced the loss of lung density (ie. lung tissue) but did not modify lung function, exacerbations, or hospitalizations. How, then, can augmentation therapy be confirmed to be effective therapy that reduces the progression of lung disease in individuals with AATD?

In this issue of the Journal, Fraughen and colleagues (pp.) used a unique group of AATD longitudinal registries from three European countries to address the issue of the effectiveness of augmentation therapy. By comparing lung function and mortality in countries with socialized healthcare systems and generally standardized chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care, the authors compared data from Ireland, a country with limited access to augmentation therapy, with data from Austria and Switzerland, which have had augmentation therapy available for several years. In this study, they determined the real-world longitudinal effect of IV AAT augmentation therapy. In the study, 619 largely ZZ individuals with AATD were evaluated for rate of decline of FEV 1 per year and survival in groups with and without the benefit of augmentation therapy for a mean duration of 12.8 years. Importantly, the baseline characteristics of the study cohort were similar among the three registries, with the exception of augmentation therapy.

### 5 year expression and neutrophil defect repair after gene therapy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^1145barp]. Molecular Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a monogenic disorder resulting in emphysema due principally to the unopposed effects of neutrophil elastase. We previously reported achieving plasma wild-type alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations at 2.5%-3.8% of the purported therapeutic level at 1 year after a single intramuscular administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 1 alpha-1 antitrypsin vector in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficient patients. We analyzed blood and muscle for alpha-1 antitrypsin expression and immune cell response. We also assayed previously reported markers of neutrophil function known to be altered in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficient patients. Here, we report sustained expression at 2.0%-2.5% of the target level from years 1–5 in these same patients without any additional recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype-1 alpha-1 antitrypsin vector administration. In addition, we observed partial correction of disease-associated neutrophil defects, including neutrophil elastase inhibition, markers of degranulation, and membrane-bound anti-neutrophil antibodies. There was also evidence of an active T regulatory cell response (similar to the 1 year data) and an exhausted cytotoxic T cell response to adeno-associated virus serotype-1 capsid. These findings suggest that muscle-based alpha-1 antitrypsin gene replacement is tolerogenic and that stable levels of M-AAT may exert beneficial neutrophil effects at lower concentrations than previously anticipated.

### Non-invasive testing for liver pathology in α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^115LNLxH]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is a genetic condition which affects the production of alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver. The consequences of this can result both in liver and lung pathology. Previous work has identified the particular significance of the PiZZ genotype in the development of early onset emphysema (said to be the cause of 1%–2% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), as well as liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Developments in hepatology have included scoring systems for liver disease assessment and monitoring, such as the APRI (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio) and FIB-4 score (see below). Other key non-invasive liver assessments include ultrasound scansand transient elastography(eg, Fibroscan), the use of which aims to replace or better inform need for invasive investigation with liver biopsy.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and quality of life of patients with α-1-antitrypsin deficiency [^115qdgiU]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder that results in a reduced concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the body due to a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. AAT plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory reactions in the lungs and preventing tissue damage caused by proteases. AAT deficiency, particularly in chronic smokers, can lead to the early onset of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema. AATD can also cause liver diseases and rare conditions such as inflammation of the subcutaneous fat (panniculitis) or vasculitis.

Patients with AATD face a particular challenge during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic as it was speculated that they might have an increased risk of developing severe disease outcomes if infected with SARS-CoV-2. AAT might play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as it inhibits the protease TMPRSS2 and thus restricts the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. Furthermore, AAT is essential for maintaining various physiological functions such as coagulation, immunomodulation, and inflammation regulation.

Apart from the physical symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection, the pandemic has also had a marked impact on mental health globally, with a significant rise in anxiety, stress, and depression due to quarantine measures and the risk of infection. The implementation of social distancing measures during the pandemic has exacerbated the impact on the quality of life (QoL) for individuals with AATD by imposing limitations on their daily activities. Additionally, individuals with AATD, particularly those with poor lung function, already face an increased risk of developing mental illnesses. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of individuals with AATD remains unclear, highlighting the need to investigate this area. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of individuals with AATD. Specifically, we aimed to identify sociodemographic and disease-related factors that contribute to stress-related symptoms during the pandemic and explore the potential mediating role of SGRQ in the relationship between poor lung function and stress-related symptoms.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^113JNkBr]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency augmentation therapy — clinical effects and safety in trials indicate that, with one exception, randomized controlled trials found no significant effect on FEV1, FVC, DLco or shuttle walk test performance, whereas a 1-year inhaled A1AT trial reported significantly better FEV1 versus placebo. The RAPID study's 2-year open label extension showed continued lung density protective effect, and after 4 years changes in CT lung density were positively associated with changes in FEV1 and vital capacity, although CT scan lung density estimates have not been shown to guide real-world treatment. Inhaled augmentation therapy in an RCT showed a small but significant increase in exacerbation rate with no differences in hospitalizations and severe adverse events, with increased exacerbation symptoms but no change in exacerbation severity, and overall RCTs have not shown any increase in overall adverse events. A dose–response question is being explored in the 3-year SPARTA trial studying augmentation therapy at 60 and 120 mg/kg/week vs placebo.

### Lung inflammation in α-1-antitrypsin deficient individuals with normal lung function [^1113rdKo]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study supports a multitude of AAT biological functions including modulation of several pathogenic processes underlying lung destruction. We demonstrate that normal environmental exposures might not only lead to a consistent airway inflammation, but also lead to continued infiltration of inflammatory cells within the AATD airways prior to the clinical evidence of lung disease. Our results suggest that AATD lung inflammation prior to significant lung damage might be modulated by early treatment with AAT replacement therapy and other anti-inflammatory therapies. Furthermore, our data also provide further rationale for the use of NE inhibitors in AATD as well as other lung diseases associated with NE-induced inflammation.

### Assessment and monitoring of lung disease in patients with severe alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: a European Delphi consensus of the EARCO group [^114Yg5Sk]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There are multiple complications and comorbidities associated with AATD that places a significant clinical burden on patients. These include COPD, emphysema, and bronchiectasis, as well as liver complications such as fibrosis and steatosis. Patients with AATD often experience a poor quality of life (QoL), while caregivers experience stress, anxiety, and loss of personal time. In addition to this, AATD is associated with high medical costs and healthcare resource utilization, notably when augmentation therapy is prescribed. This form of therapy with purified AAT is the only specific treatment for AATD and aims to increase patient survival, control symptoms, and prevent the progression of AATD-associated emphysema.

Effective management of severe AATD is crucial to reduce the burden placed on patients, caregivers, and hospital resources. As clinicians rarely encounter patients with AATD, physicians treating these patients rely heavily on published guidelines on how to assess, monitor, and treat patients. Multiple guidelines have been published on AATD and are derived from COPD management recommendations, thus there is no guidance on the assessment and follow up of severe AATD-specific respiratory disease. Additionally, there is substantial variation in recommendations regarding how to manage routine clinical issues. Conflicting information on how to manage AATD arises partly from the low prevalence and paucity of specific clinical trials, in addition to differences in regional prevalence, availability of augmentation therapy, and insurance environments. Establishing a consensus of assessment and management guidelines specific to severe AATD is, therefore, essential to achieve standardized treatment pathways to improve patient outcomes and reduce disease burden. We particularly focus on the severe end of the AATD spectrum (i.e. patients with Pi*ZZ, Pi*ZNull, and Pi*NullNull genotypes) as these patients are the most compromised and have specific treatment options available to them, such as augmentation therapy. Those with intermediate forms of AATD, such as those with the Pi*MZ, Pi*SZ, and Pi*SS genotypes, have a different set of challenges, including a lack of data that justifies this treatment (since these patients are explicitly excluded from randomized controlled trials); however, the diagnosis pathway for these patients is clear and is outlined in the most recent set of European guidelines. For those with severe AATD, establishing a set of consensus guidelines specific to these patients is one of several missions of the European Reference Network for respiratory diseases (ERN-LUNG) — a network of European healthcare providers dedicated to ensuring and promoting excellence in care and research for the benefit of patients affected by rare respiratory diseases.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) screening in COPD — "The World Health Organization recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of COPD should be screened once for AATD, especially in areas with high AATD prevalence". The phenotype description states, "Although the classical patient is young (< 45 years) with panlobular basal emphysema, it has become recognized that delay in diagnosis has led to identification of some AATD patients when they are older and have a more typical distribution of emphysema (centrilobular apical)". A laboratory indicator is that "A low concentration (< 20% normal) is highly suggestive of homozygous deficiency".

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing — We conditionally recommend testing for A1AT deficiency in all individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at the time of diagnosis, individuals with adult-onset asthma with persistent airway obstruction, and individuals with unexplained bronchiectasis. We suggest genetic testing with DNA sequencing of the SERPINA1 gene as the initial test for individuals with high clinical suspicion for A1AT deficiency, and initial measurement of serum A1AT levels in individuals with moderate clinical suspicion of A1AT deficiency, followed by genetic testing with DNA sequencing of SERPINA1 gene if A1AT level is < 23 μmol/L (< 1.2 g/L). Following identification of an abnormal gene for A1AT in individuals, whether heterozygote or homozygote, we suggest first-degree relatives be provided genetic counseling and offered testing for A1AT deficiency.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin augmentation trials — endpoint feasibility and design: The familiar forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) endpoint of many COPD trials is widely regarded as unfeasible because randomization of 700–1000 patients for a 5-year study period is not feasible; accordingly, the largest published randomized controlled trial has been the RAPID trial, a 2-year intervention in 180 patients, whose completion took 7 years and 24 international study sites, and a 5-year placebo-controlled trial based on FEV1 as the primary outcome is unlikely to happen. Computed tomography (CT) scan lung density has been proposed as a clinically relevant endpoint and has been shown to be more closely linked to survival than measures of lung function, such as FEV1.

### Association between circulating α-1 antitrypsin polymers and lung and liver disease [^1167J7km]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is considered one of the most common genetic disorders in adults, with a prevalence of 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in Europe. AATD is characterised by low circulating levels of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein caused by specific mutations in the SERPINA1 gene resulting in a misfolded protein and intracellular liver polymerization. SERPINA1 is highly polymorphic with at least 120 mutations having been described, and of these, 60 are deficient variants. The normal allele present in 95% of healthy individuals is defined as the M allele, and the most common deficient variants are S and Z. The alleles of SERPINA1 are codominant, therefore, individuals heterozygous and homozygous for the Z allele have AAT plasma concentrations of 50% and 10 to 15% of normal, respectively.

In normal conditions, the protein is mainly synthesised and secreted by hepatocytes and its main function is to protect lung tissue from damage caused by proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase. In the presence of the Z allele, most of the AAT synthesised polymerises and accumulates in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cells as inclusion bodies. These inclusions are associated with neonatal hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, lower concentrations of circulating AAT predispose to early onset panlobular emphysema in individuals with smoking history.

Polymers of AAT have also been identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and alveolar walls of carriers of the Z allele. In a study by Alam et al. it was observed that cigarette smoking accelerated polymerisation of AAT in patients homozygous for the Z allele, leading to a greater depletion of the protection against neutrophil elastase in the lung. Later, other authors found that these circulating polymers (CP) of AAT were present in serum samples of AATD Pi*ZZ and mixed phenotypes patients, probably due to secretion to the circulation from liver cells.

However, little is known about the role of CP of AAT in the pathogenesis of disease in patients with AATD. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine CP concentrations in individuals with different genotypes of AAT and to investigate the association between CP and the severity of lung and liver disease in patients with AATD homozygous and heterozygous for the Z allele.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: the learning goes on… [^117HNL9Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial patients with AAT deficiency were homozygous for the Z variant gene and these subjects had typical blood levels of AAT of < 8 μM (i.e. below the putative protective threshold).

Although such patients represent the vast majority of subjects receiving augmentation therapy, studies have identified multiple variants of AAT, although most have AAT levels in the normal range (17–47 μM).

The S variant has a mild reduction in blood level and SZ heterozygotes have AAT levels that range from the protective threshold of 11 to 28 μM, suggesting at least some may be at risk and benefit from augmentation therapy. Currently, such patients are being treated (as well as MZ heterozygotes who have even higher AAT levels) at great cost (∼$80 million/yr in the United States alone) despite lack of demonstrable benefit.

Whether SZ patients are at increased risk of COPD has long been contentious, with some studies saying yes and some no. The problem of perceived risk largely relates to acquisition bias. Patients with established COPD are usually tested if young, with severe disease, and perhaps a limited smoking and/or family history of COPD. Family testing identifies further deficient subjects and more COPD. However, COPD can run in families without AAT deficiency, suggesting unknown genetic concordance as well as common social and environmental risk factors. Thus, whether an abnormal AAT genotype is an association with or cause of COPD remains uncertain.

In this issue of the Journal, Franciosi and colleagues (pp.) have addressed the uncertainty by a process that overcomes some of these potential confounders using the Irish AAT deficiency registry. For the initial risk assessment, index cases were identified and family members invited for testing to identify nonindex SZ siblings by phenotype or genotype. MM and MS family members were also recruited because neither genotype is a recognized risk factor for COPD, resulting in 70 subjects with nonindex SZ and 46 control subjects.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency diagnostic testing — The panel "felt strongly that individuals with A1AT deficiency should be sought and diagnosed", and "we suggest initial measurement of serum A1AT levels, followed by genetic testing with DNA sequencing of the coding regions of the SERPINA1 gene if A1AT level is < 23 μmol/L (< 1.2 g/L). (Conditional recommendation; low quality evidence)". For high clinical suspicion, "we favored DNA sequencing of the coding exons of the SERPINA1 gene rather than targeted genotyping, as the latter can only test for a limited number of known mutations", whereas "when the clinical suspicion is not as strong, measuring serum level of A1AT protein is suggested, followed by genetic testing if the A1AT level is low". If relying only on targeted panels, "clinicians must be aware that very rare or previously unknown deficiency genotypes may go undetected", and "clinicians should work collaboratively with the laboratory to obtain DNA sequencing", noting that "DNA sequencing is used by most laboratories in Canada as a secondary step only if a suspected deficiency remains unexplained by targeted genotyping of known deficiency genes".

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin null mutations and severity of emphysema [^114ovTYH]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an autosomal-codominant disorder, caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene on chromosome 14. Individuals affected by the most common mutations, SZ and ZZ, have serum AAT concentrations of 25% and 15% of normal levels, and present a higher risk of emphysema. Mutations causing total absence of serum AAT (Null mutations) were suggested to be associated with very early onset emphysema but their clinical phenotype is poorly known.

Hypothesis

Absence of AAT in Null mutations results in more severe emphysema as compared to ZZ and SZ.

Methods

We genotyped all known Dutch subjects (n = 12) with absent serum AAT, and compared their lung function values (FEV1 and KCO) with those of individuals with ZZ and SZ genotype, matched for age and smoking history.

Results

All subjects with absent serum AAT presented homozygous Null mutations. In three subjects, a new mutation in exon 2 of the SERPINA1 gene was found. Subjects with Null mutations showed significantly lower lung function values than SZ and ZZ individuals (p = 0.000 and 0.001 for FEV1 and KCO, respectively). In all groups, there was a positive correlation between serum AAT and lung function values (p = 0.025 and 0.014 for FEV1 and KCO, respectively).

Conclusions

Serum levels of AAT are correlated with the severity of pulmonary phenotype. Subjects with Null mutations should be considered a subgroup at particularly high risk of emphysema within AAT deficiency (AATD). Early detection of carriers of this genotype would be important for preventive and therapeutic interventions.

### Hepatobiliary phenotypes of adults with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^115RAiJs]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common, potentially lethal inborn disorder caused by mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Homozygosity for the 'Pi*Z' variant of AAT (Pi*ZZ genotype) causes lung and liver disease, whereas heterozygous 'Pi*Z' carriage (Pi*MZ genotype) predisposes to gallstones and liver fibrosis. The clinical significance of the more common 'Pi*S' variant remains largely undefined and no robust data exist on the prevalence of liver tumours in AATD.

Design

Baseline phenotypes of AATD individuals and non-carriers were analysed in 482380 participants in the UK Biobank. 1104 participants of a multinational cohort (586 Pi*ZZ, 239 Pi*SZ, 279 non-carriers) underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment. Associations were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and alcohol consumption.

Results

Among UK Biobank participants, Pi*ZZ individuals displayed the highest liver enzyme values, the highest occurrence of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (adjusted OR (aOR) = 21.7 (8.8–53.7)) and primary liver cancer (aOR = 44.5 (10.8–183.6)). Subjects with Pi*MZ genotype had slightly elevated liver enzymes and moderately increased odds for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (aOR = 1.7 (1.2–2.2)) and cholelithiasis (aOR = 1.3 (1.2–1.4)). Individuals with homozygous Pi*S mutation (Pi*SS genotype) harboured minimally elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but no other hepatobiliary abnormalities. Pi*SZ participants displayed higher liver enzymes, more frequent liver fibrosis/cirrhosis (aOR = 3.1 (1.1–8.2)) and primary liver cancer (aOR = 6.6 (1.6–26.9)). The higher fibrosis burden was confirmed in a multinational cohort. Male sex, age ≥ 50years, obesity and the presence of diabetes were associated with significant liver fibrosis.

Conclusion

Our study defines the hepatobiliary phenotype of individuals with the most relevant AATD genotypes including their predisposition to liver tumours, thereby allowing evidence-based advice and individualised hepatological surveillance.

### Practical genetics: α-1-antitrypsin deficiency and the serpinopathies [^111o1Z2h]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha(1)-antitrypsin) is the archetypal member of the serine proteinase inhibitor or serpin superfamily. The most common severe deficiency variant is the Z allele, which results in the accumulation of mutant protein within hepatocytes. This 'protein overload' causes neonatal hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The lack of circulating plasma alpha(1)-antitrypsin results in early-onset panlobular emphysema. The mechanism underlying the deficiency of Z alpha(1)-antitrypsin is due to an aberrant conformational transition within the protein and the formation of chains of polymers that tangle within the secretory pathway of hepatocytes. This mechanism also underlies the plasma deficiency of other members of the serpin superfamily to cause a class of diseases called the serpinopathies. Specifically mutant alleles of antithrombin, C1-inhibitor and alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin have been reported that favour the spontaneous formation of polymers and the retention of protein within hepatocytes. The consequent lack of plasma antithrombin, C1-inhibitor and alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin results in thrombosis, angio-oedema and emphysema, respectively. Moreover, the polymerisation of mutants of neuroserpin results in the retention of polymers within neurones to cause the inclusion body dementia, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies or FENIB. We review here the genetic and molecular basis and clinical features of alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency, and show how this provides a platform to understand the other serpinopathies.

### Epidemiology and outcomes of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Sweden 2002–2020: a population-based cohort study of 2286 individuals [^113pit4H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alpha‐1‐antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes alpha‐1‐antitrypsin (AAT), a critical protein involved in protecting lung tissue from damage caused by neutrophil elastase. Although AATD lung disease is caused by AAT deficiency, AATD liver disease is caused by the aggregation of misfolded AAT in the liver. AAT deficiency or dysfunction is a prominent genetic cause of chronic pulmonary and liver diseases in adults, leading to significant morbidity and mortality.

The disease was described in 1962 by Laurell in Malmö, Sweden, where the Swedish AAT register was started in 1991. However, AATD is often unrecognized. Approximately 20% of all Swedes with AATD are estimated to be registered. It is unclear how many Swedish individuals are undiagnosed or diagnosed but not registered in the AAT database, which relies on active reporting from physicians caring for these patients.

The incidence, prevalence, natural history, and prognosis of this disease are incompletely known. AATD is considered an uncommon condition, with variable prevalence rates worldwide. The overall prevalence of AATD is estimated to range from 0 to 30 in 100,000 individuals in the general population. There is significant regional and ethnic variation in the prevalence rates, and little is known about the incidence rates.

It is important to differentiate genetic AATD from clinically diagnosed AATD. Many studies have focused on the epidemiology of genetic variants in the SERPINA1 gene, but fewer have examined patients diagnosed with AATD. Individuals detected through screening have mortality rates similar to those of the general population. Diagnosed AATD patients likely represent the AATD patient populations observed in clinical medicine. Because clinically diagnosed AATD is rare, its frequency and outcome may be best studied in population‐based healthcare databases.

Our primary objectives were to describe the demographic characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed AATD in Sweden from 2002 to 2020, to estimate the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed AATD as of December 31, 2020, and to provide risk estimates for outcomes including overall mortality and lung and liver transplantation.

The secondary objectives were to estimate the proportions of individuals diagnosed at a pulmonary or gastroenterology department, as a proxy for the first disease manifestation; to provide risk estimates for incident nonfatal lung disease and cirrhosis; to estimate proportions of patients with newly diagnosed AATD with comorbidities at baseline, including lung disease and cirrhosis; and to investigate whether neonatal cholestasis, sometimes the presenting symptom, was more common among individuals later diagnosed with AATD.

### Long-term clinical outcomes following treatment with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor for COPD associated with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a look at the evidence [^111NzFhC]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Between 2007 and 2010, the number of at-risk individuals in the United States who were tested for AATD doubled. Despite this, AATD is under-diagnosed, and of the estimated 100,000 Americans thought to be affected, fewer than 10% have been diagnosed. Therefore, there is a need to identify symptomatic patients who may benefit from A 1 -PI therapy. In addition, patients with AATD are often misdiagnosed. Respiratory symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, dyspnea and excessive sputum production, are also common to other respiratory conditions such as smoking-related COPD or asthma. As a result, patients can experience long delays before obtaining an accurate diagnosis, with average delays of 6 years being reported.

The consequences of delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis can be severe. In addition to lung complications, AATD is associated with liver damage; clinical presentation is variable but ranges from neonatal hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in adults. Currently, for severe liver disease, there is no known treatment beyond liver transplantation, and for selected patients with end-stage lung disease, lung transplantation is a valuable treatment option. If not treated by lung transplant, patients with AATD and a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) below 20% predicted have a 2-year mortality of 40%. Between 2011 and 2014, the median waiting list time for a lung transplant in the US was 226 days (95% confidence interval: 187, 268) for patients aged 35–49 years (last available data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network). In May 2005, a new system was developed, and for the majority of patients, its introduction has reduced the time to lung transplant and the risk of death whilst on the waiting list.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^116qxunB]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — genetic basis and associated respiratory risk notes that Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is the major antiprotease in plasma and functions primarily to inhibit neutrophil elastase, and deficiency occurs because of the inheritance of two protease inhibitor (Pi) deficiency alleles in the SERPINA1 gene located on chromosome 14. The normal protein phenotype has been designated M, often expressed as Pi*M, and the most common proteins leading to circulating A1AT deficiency are Z and S caused by c.1096G > A (p.E342K) and c.863A > T (p.E264V), respectively. The presence of two deficiency alleles, most commonly Pi*ZZ, results in significantly reduced serum levels of A1AT and is associated with a markedly increased risk for the development of COPD, classically in the form of basilar, pan-lobular emphysema.

### The TNFalpha gene relates to clinical phenotype in α-1-antitrypsin deficiency [^11236Eex]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The current study conducted on the UK national registry of AATD presents data to indicate that variation in TNFα influences phenotype in AATD. It further supports the hypothesis that the range of COPD phenotypes may be driven by specific underlying genetic susceptibilities in a similar manner to usual COPD.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype: a pro / con debate on a working hypothesis [^115DpaQe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a significantly under-diagnosed genetic condition caused by reduced levels and/or functionality of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), predisposing individuals to lung, liver or other systemic diseases. The management of individuals with the PI*MZ genotype, characterized by mild or moderate AAT deficiency, is less clear than of those with the most common severe deficiency genotype (PI*ZZ). Recent genetic data suggest that the PI*MZ genotype may be significantly more prevalent than currently thought. The only specific treatment for lung disease associated with severe AATD is the intravenous infusion of AAT augmentation therapy, which has been shown to slow disease progression in PI*ZZ individuals. There is no specific evidence for the clinical benefit of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals, and the risk of emphysema development in this group remains controversial. As such, current guidelines do not support the use of AAT augmentation in PI*MZ individuals. Here, we discuss the limited data on the PI*MZ genotype and offer pro and con perspectives on pursuing an AAT-specific therapeutic strategy in PI*MZ individuals with lung disease. Ultimately, further research to demonstrate the safety, risk/benefit balance and efficacy of AAT therapy in PI*MZ individuals is needed.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin mutations: is one too many? [^115RdcFd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the main strengths of the study was that a large number of non-Hispanic white patients were sequenced across the entire SERPINA1 coding region. Larger sample sizes for different ethnic groups need to be studied, but the identification of group-specific variants provides a good rationale for performing such studies. Another strength was that the study participants all had significant smoke exposure, thus reducing the potential for lack of penetrance of the variants. The availability of measurements of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin was an important asset in this study, as it helped guide the interpretation of the genetic association data.

This study illustrates the difficulty in analyzing rare genetic variants: Although there may be significant associations when considered in aggregate (i.e.g.ene-based burden testing), there are often too few individuals with each variant to test individually with sufficient power. Nevertheless, rare variants are potentially important for the individual patient, and therefore additional large-scale studies such as this are warranted.

Genetic testing strategy for alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency — The guideline aligns with recommendations to use targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping for at least the Pi*S and Pi*Z alleles, although it advocates for DNA sequencing because there are more than 300 genetic variants in SERPINA1 and only DNA sequencing allows testing for all of them in a single assay, and, considering variability in A1AT protein serum levels, it states we recommend SERPINA1 sequencing before embarking on A1AT replacement therapy.

### The impact of diagnostic delay on survival in α-1-antitrypsin deficiency: results from the Austrian alpha-1 lung registry [^116ui878]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a delayed diagnosis of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency was associated with significantly worse overall survival and transplant-free survival in our cohort, independent from age, smoking status, BMI, pulmonary function and long-term oxygen treatment. This suggests that efforts to ensure early AATD diagnosis should be intensified. Particularly, in accordance with the relevant guidelines, all patients with COPD, emphysema, poorly responsive or late-onset asthma, and relatives of AATD patients should be tested.

### The prevalence of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in Ireland [^113STRYt]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the Z and S allele frequencies in Ireland are among the highest in the world, with large numbers of individuals at risk of disease due to AATD in the Irish population. The vast majority of these individuals remain undetected. The importance of an early diagnosis of AATD cannot be over-emphasised as the resulting appropriate medical follow-up and lifestyle changes can help prevent or at least postpone the development of the lung and liver disease associated with this condition.

### Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype: a pro / con debate on a working hypothesis [^111DikPh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Most of the published evidence relating to the management of individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is based on patients with the PI*ZZ or PI*Znull genotypes, who have a severe deficiency in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), with plasma levels < 11 µM (< 52 mg/dL) compared with the normal range of 19–47 µM (102–254 mg/dL). Nevertheless, there are an estimated 6–7 million people with AATD in the United States (US) alone, including those with mild or moderate deficiency genotypes. Individuals who are heterozygous for the Z allele, such as those with the PI*MZ genotype, who have AAT serum levels of 11–28 µM (62–151 mg/dL), or approximately 60% of the normal range, may be at risk of developing lung and/or liver disease if they have other predisposing risk factors. Previous studies have found that among patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the prevalence of the PI*MZ genotype ranges from 1 to 22%.

Despite the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for pathologic changes in AAT-deficient individuals, and the fact that AAT augmentation therapy is the only disease-modifying therapeutic approach for patients with AATD-associated lung disease, current guidelines do not recommend the use of augmentation therapy in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype. However, there is a lack of consensus among treating physicians on how PI*MZ individuals should be monitored and treated, and whether AAT augmentation therapy could be a treatment strategy in some PI*MZ patients. Here, we summarize the evidence supporting a potential AAT-specific therapeutic approach in individuals with the PI*MZ genotype, and also discuss reasons why focus on this approach may not be warranted.

### Basic and clinical aspects of the alpha1-antitrypsin… [^116sqKFK]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

A deficiency of the major serum α 1-globulin, the α 1-antitrypsin, was first described in five patients by Laurell and Eriksson in Sweden in 1963. It soon became obvious that severe α 1-antitrypsin deficiency was familial, and highly associated with chronic lung disease, having its onset in the third or fourth decade of life. Since the early descriptions of this common deficiency state, it has become clearly associated with familial emphysema in some families, familial infantile cirrhosis in others, and occasionally with a combination of childhood lung and liver disease in siblings. For the pediatrician, severe α 1-antitrypsin deficiency now enters into the differential diagnosis of both chronic pulmonary disease in childhood and obstructive jaundice in the newborn period. In addition, low levels of α 1-anrirtysin in serum are characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome, and elevations of this protein may be found in a variety of clinical situations.

The α 1-antitrypsin probably functions as a major control protein against the tissue-damaging effects of both endogenous and exogenous enzymes. This review will cover several basic and clinical features of this protein with respect to its importance in pediatrics. CHEMISTRY AND METABOLISM A 50, 000 molecular weight glycoprotein, the α. 1-antitrypsin is synthesized in the parenchymal cells of the liver and is secreted into serum as the major α 1-globulin, comprising approximately 4% of the total serum protein level. Alpha 1-antitrypsin is present in many body fluids, having been found in microgram per milliliter quantities in nasal secretions, tears, saliva, pulmonary secrelions, duodenal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, cobstrum, and mother's milk.

Overview of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Individuals with AATD have low serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin). They have an increased risk of developing a form of chronic obstructive lung disease called emphysema, caused by damage to the small air sacs in the. AATD may lead to respiratory failure, a need for lung transplantation, and eventually death. The only specific medication approved for raising the blood levels of AAT in severe AATD patients with emphysema is weekly intravenous treatment with A1-PI, purified from human plasma.  Participants with ATTD spoke about their ongoing struggle with shortness of breath while exercising or even at rest. They told of wheezing, productive coughing, frequent exacerbations, exhaustion and anxiety. Some participants, with liver disease, described their experiences with bleeding, failure to thrive, and complications caused by. medications received after liver transplantation.

 Participants stressed that one of the biggest challenges to effective therapy was the cost of augmentation therapy and insurance limitations. They also mentioned the need for optimal dosing strategies, and the narrow range of treatment options, especially for liver- affected individuals. Other issues they cited were access to treatment, side effects,… 6 better, and more innovative ways to treat AATD. Many participants indicated that options for treatment are not ideal, and are often accompanied by discomfort or risk.  Participants shared that the ideal treatment would be a cure, through gene therapy or through a lung or liver transplant, with no accompanying side effects or need for. is, can cause a very bad spasm of the alveoli in my lungs and brings on a great shortness of breath crisis.
