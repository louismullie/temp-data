## Question

What are the treatment options for periodic limb movement disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for periodic limb movement disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing PLMD from restless legs syndrome. Then, I should identify and modify exacerbating factors. Next, I will check iron status and correct deficiencies. After that, I'll select pharmacologic options aligned with guideline direction and risk profiles. I will then note therapies to avoid, consider special populations, add non-pharmacologic adjuncts, and close with monitoring and long-term management considerations, all while cross-checking recommendations against AASM 2025 and AAN 2016 guidance.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame and not jump to conclusions: PLMD requires polysomnography demonstrating periodic limb movements of sleep with clinical sleep disruption or daytime impairment, in the absence of the sensory urge-to-move phenotype of RLS; typical PSG thresholds are PLMS index greater than 15/hour in adults and greater than 5/hour with arousals in children, which I should verify against scoring conventions and guideline context before proceeding.

> Next, I should review exacerbating factors as the first-line step per guideline general principles for RLS/PLMS physiology; let me check that I'm comprehensive: reduce alcohol and caffeine, treat comorbid OSA, and reconsider medications that can worsen PLMS such as serotonergic antidepressants, sedating antihistamines, and antidopaminergic agents, while noting that triazolam and valproic acid should be avoided in patients with PLMS per AASM 2025; hold on, I should also verify the antidepressant nuance — mirtazapine and possibly venlafaxine have higher PLMS risk, whereas bupropion may reduce PLMS and is a reasonable alternative in depressed patients who need an antidepressant [^113W5JpB] [^111aHoAM] [^115rfWJW] [^1177fPFc].

> I need to check iron status early because iron handling is central in RLS/PLMS; the AASM good practice statement recommends fasting morning iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation, avoiding iron 24 hours prior, and then treating based on thresholds — adults with serum ferritin 75 ng/mL or less or transferrin saturation under 20 percent should receive iron supplementation, starting with oral ferrous sulfate plus vitamin C, while pediatric patients should be treated if ferritin is below 50 ng/mL, and IV iron is appropriate when oral therapy is inadequate or ferritin is 75–100 ng/mL in adults where IV is preferred [^114bhdcp] [^112LQezZ] [^114NcAuB].

> Wait, let me verify the pediatric iron outcome data to ensure I am not overpromising on efficacy; a pediatric sleep clinic cohort reported approximately 73 percent clinical improvement after IV iron, with robust ferritin rises, though the design was retrospective and not diagnostic-specific, so I should frame this as supportive but not definitive evidence [^111p4CGJ].

> Now, for pharmacologic therapy selection when PLMS-driven sleep disruption persists after corrections, I should confirm first-line direction: gabapentinoids are preferred for most patients given efficacy for nocturnal symptoms and lower augmentation risk than dopaminergics in RLS, with AASM 2025 recommending gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, or pregabalin for adults with RLS, and AAN 2016 supporting gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin for improvements in objective sleep and quality of life and suggesting pregabalin over pramipexole when augmentation avoidance is a priority; hmm, wait a minute, I initially listed plain gabapentin as first-line for PLMD, but I should correct that nuance — evidence is strongest for gabapentin enacarbil and pregabalin, while data for plain gabapentin in RLS/PLMS outcomes are more limited in higher-quality trials, so I will prioritize enacarbil or pregabalin and consider gabapentin when clinically appropriate and tolerated [^1131Dk7e] [^113jt49H] [^117FjKaD] [^1159FpY2] [^11417akw] [^116hge6b].

> Hold on, I should verify where dopaminergics fit because PLMI reduction is often a key endpoint in PLMD; AAN 2016 indicates pramipexole and ropinirole improve the periodic limb movement index and can be considered when targeting PLMI in insomnia contexts, whereas AASM 2025 advises avoiding routine use of pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine, or levodopa in adults with RLS due to long-term augmentation risk but notes a short-term role for patients prioritizing symptom control; I need to ensure the patient is counseled explicitly about augmentation and impulse control risks, and I should remember rotigotine has evidence for reducing PLM-associated nocturnal blood pressure surges, which might matter in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity [^1156MhtX] [^117AF7ZY] [^116UF6xk] [^116m3jZT] [^116Am2BY].

> For refractory cases, I should confirm the opioid guidance; extended-release oxycodone is conditionally recommended in adults not responding to other treatments, and oxycodone/naloxone combinations may be considered where available, with careful risk–benefit discussion and monitoring for dependence, respiratory depression, and sleep-disordered breathing exacerbation [^114FvnWR] [^116k7xDk].

> Next, I need to ensure I avoid ineffective or harmful therapies; AASM 2025 specifically recommends against triazolam and valproic acid in adults with PLMS, and AAN 2016 lists several agents with insufficient evidence for RLS symptom control including clonazepam, bupropion, clonidine, selenium, rifaximin, botulinum neurotoxin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and valerian; but wait, let me reconsider dipyridamole because it appears in AASM 2025 as a conditional option in adults with RLS — its role in PLMD is less defined, so if considered, it should be framed as experimental or adjunctive after established options [^111aHoAM] [^116hge6b] [^111CoDLw].

> I will now examine special populations and verify nuances: in pediatrics, prioritize iron repletion first, be cautious with antidepressants such as mirtazapine which may worsen PLMS, and recognize PLMD prevalence and common comorbidities such as OSA and ADHD; in ESRD, PLMS may predict mortality, gabapentin can be considered with renal dosing, and AASM 2025 advises avoiding levodopa and rotigotine except for short-term use when necessary; in stroke, PLMS are common and often contralateral to the lesion, so management should emphasize treating the underlying condition while addressing sleep disruption [^112LQezZ] [^114zZfWB] [^111dACxm] [^114fLyoj] [^114M7N8D] [^115Dq3Ui] [^111s4Xfb].

> Let me consider non-pharmacologic adjuncts and not overstate their impact; pneumatic compression prior to usual symptom onset is a reasonable option for patients preferring non-drug approaches, sleep hygiene optimization is foundational, and for comorbid OSA, CPAP may reduce PLMS in some patients though responses vary; peroneal nerve stimulation is an emerging modality with a conditional recommendation in adults with RLS and could be considered in selected refractory cases after standard measures [^112w4FUG] [^113DFp7E] [^1141Fbwb].

> I should confirm a monitoring plan and explicitly watch for augmentation if dopaminergics are used; red flags include earlier onset of symptoms, spread to arms, and overall intensification, prompting slow taper and transition to non-dopaminergic agents; I need to recheck iron studies every 6–12 months during supplementation, reassess sleep quality and daytime function regularly, and consider repeat polysomnography if symptoms persist to quantify PLMS burden and rule in other sleep pathologies, keeping in mind the scoring framework and the long-term complications profile that can evolve over time [^116Am2BY] [^116dV3UW] [^114fYzn4] [^111Lo2qD].

> To synthesize into a pragmatic algorithm without skipping verification steps: diagnose PLMD with PSG after excluding RLS sensory symptoms, address exacerbating factors including medications, substances, OSA, and iron deficiency, initiate iron repletion per thresholds, start with a gabapentinoid prioritizing gabapentin enacarbil or pregabalin for efficacy and lower augmentation risk, then if inadequate and PLMI reduction is the priority consider a short-term trial of a dopamine agonist with thorough augmentation counseling or rotigotine in select cardiovascular-risk contexts, and reserve extended-release oxycodone for severe refractory cases, while avoiding triazolam and valproic acid and maintaining longitudinal monitoring for augmentation, sleep outcomes, and iron indices aligned with AASM 2025 and AAN 2016 guidance [^114fYzn4] [^113W5JpB] [^1159FpY2].

---

The treatment of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) focuses on **mitigating exacerbating factors** [^113W5JpB] and **iron repletion** when ferritin is low [^114bhdcp]; **gabapentinoids** are first-line pharmacotherapy [^1131Dk7e], and dopamine agonists are reserved for short-term use because of augmentation risk [^116UF6xk]. Nonpharmacologic measures include **sleep hygiene, exercise, and pneumatic compression** [^112w4FUG]; benzodiazepines or opioids are second-line for refractory cases. Regular monitoring for **augmentation** and adverse effects is essential; avoid triazolam and valproic acid [^116MMsZQ] [^111aHoAM].

---

## Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacological interventions are **foundational** and should be initiated before or alongside pharmacotherapy [^114fYzn4].

- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular schedules, avoiding caffeine/alcohol, and a conducive sleep environment [^113W5JpB].

- **Exercise**: Moderate aerobic activity improves sleep and reduces PLMS.

- **Pneumatic compression**: Consider for patients preferring nonpharmacologic options [^112w4FUG].

- **Address comorbidities**: Treat OSA [^113DFp7E] and avoid serotonergic/antidopaminergic drugs that worsen PLMS [^115rfWJW] [^113W5JpB].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacotherapy is indicated when **nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient** [^114fYzn4].

---

### Iron supplementation

Iron deficiency is common in PLMD; **supplementation is recommended** when ferritin is low [^114bhdcp].

| **Iron preparation** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Ferrous sulfate | Ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20% | Recommended [^114NcAuB] |
| IV ferric carboxymaltose | Ferritin 75–100 ng/mL or oral intolerance | Recommended [^114bhdcp] |
| IV ferumoxytol | Alternative IV option | Recommended [^114bhdcp] |

---

### Gabapentinoids

Gabapentinoids are **first-line** due to efficacy and a lower augmentation risk [^1159FpY2].

- **Gabapentin**: Effective for PLMD.

- **Pregabalin**: Effective and preferred when avoiding augmentation [^1159FpY2].

- **Gabapentin enacarbil**: Effective, especially with insomnia or mood symptoms [^117FjKaD].

---

### Dopaminergic agents

Dopamine agonists reduce PLMS but carry augmentation risk; **use short-term** or only when benefits outweigh risks [^116UF6xk].

| **Dopaminergic agent** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pramipexole | - Short-term use <br/> - Avoid long-term due to augmentation | Conditional [^116UF6xk] |
| Ropinirole | - Short-term use <br/> - Avoid long-term due to augmentation | Conditional [^116UF6xk] |
| Rotigotine | - Short-term use <br/> - Avoid long-term due to augmentation | Conditional [^116UF6xk] |
| Levodopa | - Short-term use <br/> - Avoid long-term due to augmentation | Conditional [^116UF6xk] |

---

### Benzodiazepines and opioids

Second-line options for refractory cases include **benzodiazepines** (e.g. clonazepam) and **opioids** (e.g. extended-release oxycodone).

---

## Special considerations

- **Augmentation**: Monitor for symptom worsening with dopaminergic agents; switch to gabapentinoids or opioids if needed [^116UF6xk] [^116Am2BY].

- **Pediatric PLMD**: Use iron supplementation and gabapentinoids; avoid dopaminergic agents due to limited data.

- **Comorbid conditions**: Tailor treatment to comorbidities and side-effect profiles [^116dV3UW] [^113DFp7E].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies include **Dipyridamole**, which may be considered in select adults [^111CoDLw], and **High-frequency peroneal nerve stimulation**, which may also be considered [^1141Fbwb].

---

## Treatments to avoid

Avoid **triazolam** and **valproic acid** in PLMD [^116MMsZQ] [^111aHoAM].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess efficacy, side effects, and **augmentation**, and to adjust therapy as needed [^114fYzn4].

---

Begin with **nonpharmacologic measures** and iron repletion when indicated [^114bhdcp]; then use **gabapentinoids as first-line pharmacotherapy** [^1131Dk7e], reserving dopamine agonists for short-term use because of augmentation risk [^116UF6xk].

### Clinical symptomatology and treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder [^115H8fpS]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) suffer from sensory and motor symptoms evoked in the limbs at rest. Symptoms increase in the evening and during the night. The circadian rhythm and the presence of involuntary periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS), which are frequently associated with arousals, probably cause the leading symptom of sleep disturbances in RLS. Patients who do not have typical RLS symptoms but whose polysomnography shows PLMS that either impact sleep continuity or daytime functioning are diagnosed as having the periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). Dopaminergic agents, such as levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDI) and dopamine agonists, are considered the treatment of choice for RLS and PLMS. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptomatology, and diagnosis of RLS and PLMD, focusing on treatment strategies for both disorders.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^114hsR4A]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

- **General guidelines**: View the patient straight from the front so that both arms are visible simultaneously. Assess tremor for more than 5 seconds per condition, ideally 30 seconds per position.

- **Activation conditions**:
	- **Rest**: Ideally performed when the subject is completely relaxed on a bed, particularly for tremor of the head and lower limbs. If bed rest is not possible, use an armchair with hands dangling down from the armrests or ask the patient to have both forearms pronated in a relaxed position.
	- **Rest with cognitive co-activation**: Ask the patient to perform tasks such as serial sevens, naming as many animals as possible, or spelling a difficult word. Note increased tremor amplitude (e.g. Parkinson's tremor) or reduced tremor amplitude (e.g. functional tremor).
	- **Rest with motor co-activation**: Request the patient to make tapping movements with the contralateral hand. Observe for resting tremor in the arms during walking and note increased tremor amplitude (e.g. Parkinson's tremor) or reduced tremor amplitude (e.g. functional tremor).
	- **Change from rest to posture**: To identify re-emergent tremor, ask the patient to rapidly extend the wrist and observe whether this leads to a tremor reset, which is a transient (greater than 1–2 seconds) suppression of tremor amplitude, often seen in Parkinson's tremor.
	- **Postural tremor**: Look for tremor when the arms are extended towards you (palms down), as well as when the hands are supinated and pronated. Note position dependence, as seen in dystonic tremor.

### Bupropion SR reduces periodic limb movements associated with arousals from sleep in depressed patients with periodic limb movement disorder [^1177fPFc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Antidepressant-induced periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) may limit the tolerability of some antidepressant medications and interfere with treatment response. Given the role of dopamine in PLMD and the effects of bupropion sustained-release (SR) on central dopaminergic function, we hypothesized that bupropion SR would not be associated with antidepressant-induced PLMD.

- **Method**: In an expanded case-series design, we compared the effects of bupropion SR, after about 10 weeks of treatment, on measures of PLMD, depression, and sleep in 5 depressed (Research Diagnostic Criteria) patients who also met criteria for having pretreatment PLMD. Depression was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Patients were considered to have PLMD if polysomnographic recordings showed more than 5 periodic limb movements per hour of sleep that were associated with arousals from sleep.

- **Results**: Bupropion SR treatment was associated with a reduction in measures of PLMD and an improvement in depression.

- **Conclusion**: These results show that bupropion SR is not associated with antidepressant-induced PLMD. Rather, bupropion SR treatment reduces objective measures of PLMD in depressed patients with the disorder.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115CM7uZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

The first step in diagnosing tremor is identifying hyperkinetic movements as 'tremulous'. Tremor is defined as an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part. The most important alternative diagnosis is myoclonus, especially high-frequency cortical myoclonus (e.g. in familial cortical myoclonus), polyminimyoclonus (e.g. in multiple system atrophy), peripheral myoclonus (which sometimes occurs in inflammatory neuropathies or radiculopathies), or asterixis (a negative myoclonus that looks like a flapping tremor of the hands when the wrists are extended). Moreover, the rhythmic, low-frequency jerks in ongoing focal epilepsy (epilepsia partialis continua) can be misinterpreted as unilateral jerky rest tremor. Generally, a 'jerky' aspect ought to raise suspicion of myoclonus as the movement disorder in question, rather than tremor. However, the distinction between high-frequency myoclonus and tremor on the basis of 'rhythmicity' is complicated by the fact that tremor is almost never perfectly rhythmic. In fact, a jerky or irregular aspect is part of the characteristic phenotype of some tremor syndromes, such as dystonic tremor or Holmes tremor. When in doubt, polymyography can be used to differentiate between myoclonus and tremor: polymyography is further described in step 3. Naturally, tremor and myoclonus are not mutually exclusive: patients can have both movement disorders.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^111giW8U]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical phenotype of paediatric movement disorders involves a structured diagnostic approach, beginning with key steps.

- **Step 1: Is it a movement disorder?** The first step is to distinguish normal, physiological developmental motor patterns from pathological movement disorders. Infantile fidgety movements and startles that resemble chorea and myoclonus typically disappear around the age of 3 months. Dystonic-like features may appear from birth and persist until the age of 16 years. The development of goal-directed movements, occurring between 3 to 6 months, coincides with the appearance of ataxic-like features, which can persist until the age of 12 years. It may be challenging to distinguish these physiological patterns from pathological movement disorders. Monitoring a child's development is essential to evaluate how the movement pattern evolves. Generally, physiological patterns subside with typical psychomotor development. Additionally, neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, may mimic movement disorders.

- **Step 2: Classify the movement disorder phenotype and identify the most prominent disorder**. The second step involves classifying the movement disorder phenotype and identifying the most prominent movement disorder. Clinical clues assist in distinguishing between different movement disorder phenotypes. Movement disorders are categorized into three major groups: hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, and ataxia. In children, hyperkinetic movement disorders are more prevalent and include tics, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are rare in children. Ataxia is not typically categorized alongside hypo- or hyperkinetic disorders.

### The scoring of movements in sleep [^111Lo2qD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) has categorized sleep-related movement disorders into simple, repetitive movement disorders such as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), sleep bruxism, and rhythmic movement disorder, and parasomnias, including REM sleep behavior disorder and disorders of partial arousal, such as sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors. Many parasomnias are characterized by complex sleep behaviors that seem purposeful, goal-directed, and voluntary, but are outside the individual's conscious awareness and therefore inappropriate. All of the sleep-related movement disorders described here have specific polysomnographic findings.

For the purpose of developing and/or revising specifications and polysomnographic scoring rules, the AASM Scoring Manual Task Force on Movements in Sleep reviewed background literature and assessed evidence from 81 relevant articles published between 1966 and 2004. Subsequent evidence grading identified limited evidence for the reliability and/or validity of polysomnographic scoring criteria for periodic limb movements in sleep, REM sleep behavior disorder, and sleep bruxism. The published scoring criteria for rhythmic movement disorder, excessive fragmentary myoclonus, and hypnagogic foot tremor/alternating leg muscle activation were empirical and based on descriptive studies. The literature review disclosed no published evidence defining the clinical consequences of excessive fragmentary myoclonus or hypnagogic foot tremor/alternating leg muscle activation.

### EFNS guidelines on management of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in sleep [^113HpJKx]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, the EFNS Task Force was established to propose guidelines for managing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). After determining the objectives for management and the search strategy for primary and secondary RLS and PLMD, a review of the scientific literature up to 2004 was conducted. This review focused on drug classes and interventions employed in treatment, including drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, and other treatments. Previous guidelines were consulted.

All trials were analyzed according to their class of evidence, and recommendations were formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Dopaminergic agents were found to have the best evidence for efficacy in primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible, although augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were available for RLS in children or during pregnancy.

The following Level A recommendations can be offered: For primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin, pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa, and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving symptoms. Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD.

### The influence of antidepressants on restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements: A systematic review [^115rfWJW]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is frequently comorbid with medical conditions treated with antidepressant medications, such as depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, and chronic insomnia disorder. Evidence from case reports and cross-sectional studies suggests that antidepressants may induce or worsen restless legs syndrome and increase periodic limb movements. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to identify and collate all prospective studies that measured restless legs syndrome symptoms and/or periodic limb movements following the introduction of an antidepressant. Eighteen studies were eligible for inclusion. Data indicate that onset or exacerbation of restless legs syndrome and a rise in the frequency of periodic limb movements are uncommon following the initiation of an antidepressant.

Among the various antidepressants, mirtazapine may be associated with higher rates of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements. One small study of normal volunteers suggested that venlafaxine may be associated with an increase in restless legs syndrome symptoms and periodic limb movements. Sertraline, fluoxetine, and amitriptyline appear to increase periodic limb movements that do not disrupt sleep and are thus unlikely to be clinically significant. On the other hand, bupropion may reduce restless legs syndrome symptoms, at least in the short term. Sedating antidepressants such as trazodone, nefazodone, and doxepin do not seem to aggravate periodic limb movements. The evidence is limited by poor study design and inadequate use of standardized questionnaires.

### European guidelines on management of restless legs syndrome: Report of a joint task force by the European Federation of Neurological Societies, the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society [^114ZEbsp]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the first European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines in 2005 on the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS; also known as Willis-Ekbom disease), there have been major therapeutic advances in the field. Furthermore, the management of RLS is now a part of routine neurological practice in Europe. New drugs have also become available, and further randomized controlled trials have been undertaken. These guidelines were undertaken by the EFNS in collaboration with the European Neurological Society and the European Sleep Research Society.

- **Objectives**: To provide an evidence-based update of new treatments published since 2005 for the management of RLS.

- **Methods**: First, we determined what the objectives of management of primary and secondary RLS should be. We developed the search strategy and conducted a review of the scientific literature up to 31 December 2011 (print and electronic publications) for the drug classes and interventions employed in RLS treatment. Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analyzed according to class of evidence, and recommendations made according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating.

- **Recommendations**: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment of RLS. However, for the long-term treatment of RLS, rotigotine is considered effective, gabapentin enacarbil is probably effective, and ropinirole, pramipexole, and gabapentin are considered possible treatments.

### Drug-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease. Should success in clinical management be a function of improvement of motor repertoire rather than amplitude of dyskinesia [^116KjSj3]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence-based practice aims to apply the best available evidence from scientific investigations to clinical decision-making. To effectively manage dyskinesia, it is crucial to understand the influence of dyskinesia on voluntary movements. This understanding helps to address the challenges patients face when planning and executing movements from their motor repertoire.

It is essential to distinguish between activities of daily living and the motor repertoire of patients. Activities of daily living are critical for minimal functional independence, while the motor repertoire includes all movements important for a good quality of life for each specific patient. As a result, the motor repertoire is personalized and varies significantly based on the movements patients wish to perform regularly.

Furthermore, assessing whether other symptoms accompany dyskinesia, which may contribute to motor deficits, is key. At the time of writing, several algorithms have been proposed for managing dyskinesia. These algorithms often focus on significantly reducing or eliminating dyskinesia without necessarily considering how the proposed strategy impacts patients' motor repertoire. Notably, some patients might prefer mild dyskinesia over undergoing medication changes, especially if dyskinesia does not impede their motor repertoire.

Indeed, the reduction in dyskinesia through a reduction in medication, while at times justified, should not automatically be prioritized over the patient's overall motor functioning.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^117J1SHN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder worldwide, but diagnosis is challenging. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement that proposes a tremor classification along two independent axes: a clinical tremor syndrome and its underlying aetiology. In line with this statement, we propose a stepwise diagnostic approach that leads to the correct clinical and aetiological classification of upper limb tremor. We also describe the typical clinical signs of each clinical tremor syndrome. A key feature of our algorithm is the distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, where tremor is accompanied by bradykinesia, cerebellar signs, dystonia, peripheral neuropathy, or brainstem signs. This distinction subsequently informs the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, such as neurophysiology, laboratory testing, structural and dopaminergic imaging, and genetic testing. We highlight treatable metabolic causes of tremor, as well as drugs and toxins that can provoke tremor. The stepwise approach facilitates appropriate diagnostic testing and avoids unnecessary investigations. We expect that the approach offered in this article will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### A 9-year-old female with iron deficiency has severe periodic limb movements while taking mirtazapine for insomnia [^114zZfWB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mirtazapine is a Food and Drug Administration-approved atypical antidepressant used off-label for insomnia. It has been associated with movement disorders in adults. A 9-year-old female was seen in the sleep clinic for symptoms of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, restless sleep, and growing pains. Mirtazapine was started prior to presentation for severe insomnia.

A sleep study showed frequent repetitive leg movements prior to sleep onset as well as significant periodic limb movement disorder with a periodic limb movement index of 25.1/hour. The child was found to have a ferritin level of 23 ng/mL and an iron saturation of 10%. Concerns arose that the presence of iron deficiency along with the use of mirtazapine may have contributed to the elevated periodic limb movement index.

After starting iron therapy to treat the child's iron deficiency, mirtazapine was weaned off, with further clinical improvements in sleep quality reported. A follow-up sleep study showed a resolution of her periodic limb movement disorder with a periodic limb movement index of 1.4/hour. This is the first pediatric case to describe a sleep-related movement disorder associated with the use of mirtazapine and polysomnographic data to support resolution after discontinuation of mirtazapine along with iron therapy.

### Restless legs symptoms without periodic limb movements in sleep and without response to dopaminergic agents: A restless legs-like syndrome [^111xATSb]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients fulfilling the essential criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS), but who lack a response to conventional dopaminergic treatment and the presence of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), are occasionally encountered. The aim of this study was to systematically characterize this population. In a consecutive series of 117 patients meeting the essential criteria for RLS, we assessed the presence of the following supportive criteria: PLMS > 15/h on polysomnography and favorable response to dopaminergic treatment.

We differentiated patients with 'classical RLS' (RLS-C; fulfilling at least one of the selected supportive criteria) from those with 'RLS-like syndrome' (RLS-L) where supportive criteria were not fulfilled. There were 103 RLS-C and 14 RLS-L patients. Compared with RLS-C patients, RLS-L patients were significantly younger, more severely affected by RLS symptoms, and more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities than RLS-C patients. This study proves the existence of patients with severe RLS symptoms, but without PLMS and without response to dopaminergic treatment, who are clinically distinct from patients with 'classical RLS'.

### Correlates of periodic limb movements of sleep in the pediatric population [^111dACxm]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Periodic limb movements of sleep are clinically underdiagnosed in children. Polysomnography is the most accurate diagnostic test. There is a paucity of information regarding polysomnography findings in children. We evaluated the prevalence and correlates of pediatric periodic limb movements detected by polysomnography. Periodic limb movements of sleep were identified in 77 of 982 polysomnograms, with a prevalence of 7.8% and male predominance (47 boys; 30 girls). The mean age was 9.4 ± 4.2 years (range 1–19 years), and the body mass index was 24.1 ± 12.3.

Mean sleep time was 395.4 ± 73.4 minutes, of which rapid eye movement sleep constituted 16.6% ± 6.7%, and slow-wave sleep, 22% ± 10%. Sleep efficiency was 93.8 ± 9.83. Periodic limb movement index was 9.78 ± 7.9, periodic limb movement arousal was 4.5 ± 8.4, arousal index was 27.8 ± 12.4, and peak end-tidal CO₂ was 48.9 ± 10.5 mm Hg. Associated diagnoses included obstructive sleep apnea in 36 (46.8%); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 10 (13%); migraine, seizures, and narcolepsy each in 7 (9.1%); autism spectrum disorders in 5 (6.5%). Decreased serum ferritin levels were noted, with a mean of 26.1 µg/L in 29 (96.6%).

Prospective studies may clarify the significance of incidental pediatric periodic limb movements in sleep detected on polysomnograms.

### Rotigotine's effect on PLM-associated blood pressure elevations in restless legs syndrome: An RCT [^116m3jZT]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Periodic limb movements (PLM) are present in 85%–95% of patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS) and occur both during wakefulness preceding sleep onset (PLMW) and during sleep (PLMS). PLMS often coincide with brief cortical arousals from sleep, and both PLMS and PLMW are associated with elevations in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) and changes in heart rate (HR), including an increase followed by a decrease. In patients with RLS, PLMS-associated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases of 10 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases of 20 mm Hg, and heart rate (HR) increases of approximately 7–10 beats per minute have been observed. These transient increases in sympathetic activity may convey an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The dopamine receptor agonist rotigotine has demonstrated efficacy in improving sensory symptoms and the PLM index (PLMI) in patients with RLS. As PLM are associated with blood pressure (BP) elevations, their reduction through medication may have beneficial effects on nocturnal BP profiles. Our study, titled "Effects of Neupro on Cardiovascular Observations in Patients With RLS (SP0977)" (ENCORE), evaluated the effects of the rotigotine transdermal system on nocturnal SBP elevations associated with PLM in patients with moderate to severe RLS.

### Treating severe refractory and augmented restless legs syndrome [^112LzMeq]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurologic disorder present to a clinically significant degree in 2% to 3% of the adult population, more commonly with advancing age and in women, that dramatically affects sleep and quality of life. Addressing factors that worsen RLS (e.g. iron deficiency, antidepressant or antihistamine administration, OSA) is an important first step in treatment. RLS can generally be well treated with medications such as the alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands (A2Ds) gabapentin, pregabalin, and gabapentin enacarbil or, if these are poorly tolerated or lack efficacy, the dopamine agonists (DAs) pramipexole, ropinirole, or rotigotine.

Oral or IV iron supplementation is often efficacious as initial treatment in patients with low-normal serum indexes. However, at least one-third of patients do not achieve acceptable symptom relief from initial treatments. Furthermore, DAs, the most commonly used medications for RLS, commonly produce augmentation, a progressive, long-term, iatrogenic worsening of RLS symptoms characterized by increasing severity as well as temporal and anatomic extension of symptoms.

If dopaminergic augmentation of RLS is present, substitution of an A2D or opioid for the DA is the primary goal. However, given the profound rebound RLS and insomnia that occur with even small dose reductions of DAs, the initial change should be the addition of one of these alternate treatments. Once adequate doses or symptom relief are achieved with the second agent, subsequent very slow down-titration and discontinuation of the DA is often potent.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114fYzn4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in adults and pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths. This was based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statement**: The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RLS. In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies, including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron-binding capacity). Testing should ideally be administered in the morning, avoiding all iron-containing supplements and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Analysis of iron studies greatly influences the decision to use oral or intravenous (IV) iron treatment. Consensus guidelines, which have not been empirically tested, suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be considered.

### What treatment works best for restless legs syndrome? Meta-analyses of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic medications [^115pCPYc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, only dopamine agonists are licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in various countries, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed with other treatments. We conducted comprehensive meta-analyses and indirect comparisons of RCTs for all currently recommended treatments of RLS.

- **Methods**: We searched the Central, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Outcome measures were the international RLS study group severity scale (IRLS), clinical global impression-improvement (CGI-I), periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and psychosocial parameters such as quality of life (QoL). We also conducted indirect comparisons by testing for heterogeneity between the substance groups.

- **Results**: Placebo (58 trials) and actively (4 trials) controlled RCTs with dopamine agonists (38 trials), levodopa (4 trials), anticonvulsants (13 trials) — most of them with α₂δ ligands (11 trials) — opioids (1 trial), and iron treatments (6 trials) were included (9,596 patients). Although treatment effects showed large variations, changes in the IRLS in the substance groups were comparable (P = 0.78), with a mean reduction in the IRLS of -5.47 points for dopamine agonists, -5.12 points for anticonvulsants (α₂δ ligands and levetiracetam), and -4.59 points for iron treatments. The CGI-I indicated slightly different treatment effects between the substance groups, while PLMI changes during treatment differed (P = 0.002), showing a marked decrease with dopamine agonists (-22.50/h), levodopa (-26.01/h), and oxycodone (-34.46/h) compared with placebo.

### Practice guideline summary: Treatment of restless legs syndrome in adults: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^115LyDtY]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

The American Academy of Neurology's (AAN) 2016 guidelines address the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in adults, particularly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with secondary RLS associated with ESRD on hemodialysis, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of gabapentin or IV iron dextran. Additionally, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the preferential use of gabapentin or levodopa over other agents in these patients.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115Hd484]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

If there are additional signs "of uncertain significance" in a patient who otherwise fulfills the criteria for essential tremor (ET), the recent consensus classifies this as ET plus. This could include impaired tandem gait, questionable dystonic posturing, memory impairment, or other mild neurological signs. Likewise, ET with tremor at rest should be classified here.

Over the last few years, there has been considerable discussion over the term "ET plus". A recent study showed that, in ET patients with lower limb tremor, 110 out of 133 (83%) were reclassified as ET plus, and these patients were older than the ET group. This indicates that many patients with ET have additional symptoms, which may be integral to the disease, reflect comorbidity, or may be related to aging.

Another issue is that it is not easy to determine the clinical significance of additional symptoms. Specifically, two recent studies have shown that there is only fair agreement between movement disorders experts when assessing soft signs, and modest inter-rater agreement between axis 1 diagnoses, especially between ET plus and dystonic tremor. Neurophysiological measures, such as temporal discrimination thresholds, also cannot provide clear distinctions between ET and dystonic tremor, although this may be useful when classifying indeterminate tremors.

These findings show that the borders between some clinical tremor syndromes are not fixed, which may indicate a shared pathophysiological basis. Accordingly, it has been argued that "ET plus" may represent a state condition, such that additional signs emerge during certain stages of ET.

### Long-term management issues in restless legs syndrome [^116Am2BY]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a neurologic movement and sleep disorder with lifelong symptoms causing considerable morbidity. Several short-term and some long-term open-label and double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome. Long-term treatment, however, is associated with the emergence of vexing long-term side effects that pose a challenge for physicians. These long-term complications can be broadly categorized as disease-related (impact on sleep and acute exacerbation of restless legs syndrome symptoms) and medication issues (augmentation, sleep attacks, impulse control disorders, addiction and dependence, site reaction, occasionally sleep apnea, fibrotic complications, and weight gain).

### Intravenous iron therapy in the pediatric sleep clinic: a single institution experience [^111p4CGJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The initial reports of intravenous (IV) iron administration have been promising for children with restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and restless sleep disorder. The aim of the study was to further evaluate the clinical response to IV iron supplementation in children seen in a pediatric sleep clinic.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of children cared for in a single pediatric sleep clinic who also underwent IV iron infusion. Pre- and post-IV data regarding their sleep symptoms and ferritin levels were abstracted.

- **Results**: Overall, 63 pediatric sleep patients underwent IV iron infusion, mostly with ferric carboxymaltose (n = 60), for restless legs syndrome (n = 30), periodic limb movement disorder (n = 22), and restless sleep disorder (n = 17). Of the 59 patients with clinical follow-up, 39 (73%) noted improvement in at least one symptom, while 14 (26%) didn't notice improvement or noticed worsening symptoms. Of the 59 patients with pre-infusion and post-infusion labs, the average ferritin level increased from 21.7 (13.3) to 147.9 (120.9) μg/L [P < .001]. Comparing patients who experienced clinical improvement vs. those who did not, there were no statistically significant differences in change in ferritin levels [P = 0.278], sex [P = 0.452], or age [P = 0.391]. Ferritin change with infusion according to diagnostic subgroups (restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder/restless sleep disorder) was examined, and no significant differences were noted [F (2,56) = 0.852, P = 0.432].

### Magnesium supplementation for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: A systematic review [^1134Vhop]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Magnesium supplementation is often suggested for restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) based on anecdotal evidence that it relieves symptoms and because it is also commonly recommended for leg cramps. We aimed to review all articles reporting the effects of magnesium supplementation on changes in RLS and/or PLMD. We conducted a systematic search looking for all relevant articles, and two reviewers read all article titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were scored for their quality as interventional trials.

We found 855 abstracts, and 16 of these could not be definitively excluded for not addressing all aspects of our research question. Seven full-text articles were unlocatable, and one was ineligible, which left eight studies with relevant data. One was a randomized placebo-controlled trial, three were case series, and four were case studies. The RCT did not find a significant treatment effect of magnesium but may have been underpowered. After quality appraisal and synthesis of the evidence, we were unable to make a conclusion as to the effectiveness of magnesium for RLS/PLMD. It is not clear whether magnesium helps relieve RLS or PLMD, or in which patient groups any benefit might be seen.

### Effects of apomorphine on flexor reflex and periodic limb movement [^115Gk2GG]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that periodic leg movements (PLM) and spinal flexor reflex (FR) share common mechanisms. Although dopaminergic agents improve PLM in humans and strongly influence spinal FR circuitry in animal studies, their effects on FR have not been documented in humans. We describe a 65-year-old man with PLM after overnight withdrawal of dopaminergic agents. The electromyographic pattern of spontaneous PLM closely resembled that of the FR elicited by medial plantar nerve stimulation. Thirty minutes after subcutaneous injection of apomorphine, both PLM and FR were completely abolished. These findings demonstrate that dopaminergic agents can suppress exaggerated FR in humans and support the hypothesis of common mechanisms for PLM and FR.

### REM sleep behaviour disorder [^115KwGiG]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD):

- **Definition**: RBD is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of normal skeletal muscle atonia during REM sleep, leading to the enactment of dreams, often resulting in violent or injurious behaviors.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of RBD is thought to involve dysfunction of the brainstem circuits responsible for maintaining normal REM sleep atonia and suppressing behaviors during REM sleep, particularly the sublaterodorsal nucleus and the magnocellular nucleus of the medulla. This dysfunction may be due to neurodegenerative processes, such as Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RBD in the general population is estimated at 0.5%, with a higher prevalence of 2–7% in the elderly, depending on the diagnostic tool used.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RBD include male gender, age over 50 years, and the presence of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Other risk factors include antidepressant use and a history of traumatic brain injury.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, RBD typically presents with dream-enacting behaviors such as talking, shouting, punching, kicking, biting, or jumping out of bed, which can lead to injury. Non-violent behaviors may include laughing, gesturing, crying, and singing. These behaviors often gradually increase in frequency and intensity over time.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Idiopathic RBD has a high likelihood of being associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

### A genetic risk factor for periodic limb movements in sleep [^111ef6qN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs and is a major cause of sleep disruption. Periodic limb movements in sleep are detectable in most patients with RLS and represent an objective physiological metric.

- **Methods**: To search for sequence variants contributing to RLS, we performed a genomewide association study and two replication studies. To minimize phenotypic heterogeneity, we focused on patients with RLS who had objectively documented periodic limb movements in sleep. We measured serum ferritin levels, as iron depletion has been associated with the pathogenesis of RLS.

- **Results**: In an Icelandic discovery sample of patients with RLS and periodic limb movements in sleep, we observed a genomewide significant association with a common variant in an intron of BTBD9 on chromosome 6p21.2 (odds ratio, 1.8; P = 2×10⁻⁹). This association was replicated in a second Icelandic sample (odds ratio, 1.8; P = 4×10⁻⁴) and a U.S. sample (odds ratio, 1.5; P = 4×10⁻³). With this variant, the population attributable risk of RLS with periodic limb movements was approximately 50%. An association between the variant and periodic limb movements in sleep without RLS (and the absence of such an association for RLS without periodic limb movements) suggests that we have identified a genetic determinant of periodic limb movements in sleep (odds ratio, 1.9; P = 1×10⁻¹⁷). Serum ferritin levels were decreased by 13% per allele of the at-risk variant (95% confidence interval, 5 to 20; P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: We identified a common genetic variant that is associated with periodic limb movements in sleep, which may be an important genetic determinant of this condition.

### Pharmacotherapy of motor symptoms in early and mid-stage Parkinson's disease: Guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^115SA88d]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

How effective is the additional administration of dopamine agonists compared to placebo in the treatment of PD patients with fluctuations?

- **Background**: Additional dopamine agonists are recommended as a treatment of choice for advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations.

- **Results**: These recommendations are based on five systematic reviews of dopamine agonist therapy in PD with motor fluctuations and one systematic review of apomorphine infusion. There is a consensus publication on apomorphine treatment, a review article, and an RCT on sublingual apomorphine. The addition of dopamine agonists to levodopa treatment in advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations results in:

1. Prolonged time in the on-state without troublesome dyskinesias
2. Reduced time in the off-state
3. Improved motor symptoms in the on-state (according to UPDRS III)
4. Improved UPDRS II (ADL) score

These effects are observed with both extended-release (once daily) and standard-release (three times daily) formulations of pramipexole and ropinirole. Impulse control disorders can occur with any dopaminergic treatment, but the risk is greater with dopamine agonist therapy than with levodopa treatment. There is an association between dopamine agonist therapy and increased daytime sleepiness.

- **Practical advice for dopamine agonist therapy**: Extended-release formulations of pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine primarily offer advantages in terms of medication management and likely improve compliance. Caution should be exercised if the patient is older and/or suffers from vascular dysautonomia.

### Rotigotine's effect on PLM-associated blood pressure elevations in restless legs syndrome: An RCT [^1157rLVk]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional trial was conducted to investigate the effects of the rotigotine patch on periodic limb movement (PLM)-associated nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SBP) elevations.

Patients with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome (RLS) were randomized to receive either rotigotine (optimal dose [1–3 mg/24 h]) or placebo. Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) assessments were performed during polysomnography at baseline and at the end of the 4-week maintenance period. The primary outcome was the change in the number of PLM-associated SBP elevations (defined as the slope of linear regression ≥ 2.5 mm Hg/beat-to-beat interval over 5 consecutive heartbeats [≥ 10 mm Hg]). Additional outcomes included total SBP elevations, PLM-associated and total diastolic BP (DBP) elevations, periodic limb movements index (PLMI), and PLM in sleep arousal index (PLMSAI).

Of 81 randomized patients, 66 (37 in the rotigotine group, 29 in the placebo group) were included in efficacy assessments. PLM-associated SBP elevations were significantly reduced with rotigotine compared to placebo (least squares mean treatment difference [95% confidence interval (CI)] −160.34 [−213.23 to −107.45]; p < 0.0001). Rotigotine-treated patients also experienced a greater reduction compared to placebo in total SBP elevations (−161.13 [−264.47 to −57.79]; p = 0.0028), PLM-associated SBP elevations (−88.45 [−126.12 to −50.78]; p < 0.0001), total DBP elevations (−93.81 [−168.45 to −19.16]; p = 0.0146), PLMI (−32.77 [−44.73 to −20.80]; p < 0.0001), and PLMSAI (−7.10 [−11.93 to −2.26]; p = 0.0047). Adverse events included nausea in the rotigotine group.

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements disorder in the pediatric population [^117Vv63E]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are common neurological disorders in childhood that are often underdiagnosed. Given that many pediatricians and pediatric pulmonologists with an interest in sleep medicine encounter children with RLS and PLMS in their practice, a comprehensive review of these disorders from a pediatric perspective is crucial. This helps in understanding basic pathophysiology, clinical features for early diagnosis, and effective management.

Recent awareness about these disorders in children has increased. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recently published pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria. Exciting discoveries regarding the basic pathophysiology of these conditions have enhanced understanding. Genetics plays a significant role in their development, and management strategies have been very successful in treating these conditions.

RLS occurs in 1 out of 120 school-age children. Diagnosis is often not suspected, as children may present with atypical symptoms and associated comorbid conditions. This review discusses RLS and PLMS in the pediatric population and provides an overview of their pathophysiology, clinical presentation, risk factors, neurobehavioral consequences, and newer diagnostic criteria, along with recent advances in their management.

### Periodic leg movements in sleep and periodic limb movement disorder: Prevalence, clinical significance and treatment [^116B1T23]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) are a frequent finding in polysomnography, with a prevalence estimated to be 4–11% in adults. In childhood, PLMS rarely occur, although medical conditions like sleep apnea syndrome or neuropsychiatric disorders can lead to high rates of PLMS. In the elderly, PLMS are also common in subjects without sleep disturbances.

In sleep studies, PLMS are found most frequently in restless legs syndrome (RLS) and often occur in narcolepsy, sleep apnea syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. Some patients with otherwise unexplained insomnia or hypersomnia reveal an elevated number of PLMS, a condition defined as periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). PLMS are also found in various medical and neurological disorders that do not primarily affect sleep.

- **Clinical significance and treatment**: In sleep disorders related to dopaminergic dysfunction, such as RLS, PLMS are considered to be a symptom of the disease. In other disorders like primary insomnia, the clinical relevance of PLMS is still being controversially discussed. Studies with findings both pro and contra are referenced. At the time of writing, only a few studies have evaluated the efficacy of therapeutic substances in reducing PLMS in PLMD patients, and their results need to be confirmed in controlled randomized trials.

### Pediatric periodic limb movement disorder: Sleep symptom and polysomnographic correlates compared to obstructive sleep apnea [^111idHpQ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This study aims to describe the prevalence, sleep-related correlates, and polysomnographic correlates of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in a large pediatric case series, and compare these to pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Although periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) have been described in multiple pediatric publications, PLMD has not been widely addressed.

- **Methods**: All PLMD cases, defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd edition criteria with a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of less than 3, and OSA cases, defined by RDI of 3 or more and PLMS of less than 5, from a single pediatric sleep practice over a two-year period, were included. Chart, questionnaire, and polysomnographic data were compiled from 468 referred children, among which 66 PLMD cases were identified (14%).

- **Results**: The PLMD cases, with a mean age of 8.1 years (range 1–17), were clinically characterized by frequent sleep onset and maintenance problems, difficulty awakening, restless sleep, leg pain/discomfort at night, and parasomnias. Compared to 90 OSA children, those with PLMD had a history of significantly more sleep onset and maintenance problems, leg pain/discomfort at night, parasomnias, getting out of bed at night, and a family history of restless legs syndrome. Polysomnographically, PLMD cases had more awakenings, stage 1 sleep, stage shifts, and spontaneous arousals.

- **Conclusions**: These data indicate that pediatric PLMD has important clinical and polysomnographic correlates. Additionally, PLMD has many characteristics that are different from pediatric OSA, suggesting that PLMD is a distinct pediatric syndrome.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^111FiSPf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

We have proposed a stepwise diagnostic approach for patients presenting with upper limb tremor to guide clinicians in establishing a clinical tremor syndrome and performing relevant tests to determine its etiology. The proposed diagnostic algorithm aligns with the latest consensus statement and encourages clinicians to distinguish between isolated and combined tremor syndromes based on clinical features. This distinction is critical as it informs our choices for diagnostic testing.

We believe that our diagnostic algorithm will be useful to practicing neurologists, regardless of their expertise in movement disorders. The stepwise setup tapers diagnostic tests, starting with those that are easily available and indicated for most patients, and finishing with more specialized diagnostic procedures, including considerations for next-generation genetic testing. By following the presented steps, the long list of possible causes for tremor is reduced to manageable portions. We hope that the approach proposed in this article will decrease diagnostic uncertainty and increase diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^115FMAEh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020).

Although tremor is the most common movement disorder and frequently encountered by neurologists, diagnosing it accurately can be challenging. The clinical presentation of a patient with tremor can range from a relatively isolated symptom to a complex syndrome incorporating multiple signs and symptoms. In 2018, the Task Force on Tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement proposing a tremor classification along two independent axes: determination of a clinical syndrome based on clinical features (axis 1) and determination of an aetiology (axis 2).

For example, a bilateral upper limb action tremor without other neurological signs is classified as essential tremor (ET) on axis 1. The same patient may have a mutation in a gene that often causes dystonia; this is classified as the aetiology on axis 2. However, the axis 1 diagnosis of ET does not change until dystonia develops, if it ever does.

In the paper, we propose a practical approach in line with the consensus statement to aid practicing clinicians in diagnosing patients with tremor. While this approach has not been tested yet, it is based on the literature and aligns with steps taken at our expertise centres for movement disorders.

- **Clinical syndrome identification**: The first three steps we propose will lead to the identification of a clinical syndrome corresponding to axis 1.
- **Establishing aetiology**: The subsequent steps will help in establishing an aetiology where possible (axis 2).

Because of its prevalence and diagnostic complexity, we focus on visible upper limb tremors.

### Stellate ganglion block for refractory periodic limb movement disorder: Case report [^1159bWCr]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) involves periodic, stereotypic movements of the upper and lower extremities during sleep. Propriospinal myoclonus (PSM) involves repetitive, irregular, myoclonic jerks starting in the midthoracic region and propagating to adjacent segments through propriospinal pathways. Limited evidence exists for interventional modalities, but this report discusses the utility of stellate ganglion block (SGB) for PLMD.

A review was conducted on one patient record who underwent SGB for PLMD. In this case, successful treatment of refractory PLMD with SGB was observed.

This case demonstrates complicated PLMD that was refractory to numerous treatment modalities. However, the stellate ganglion block was shown to significantly improve the patient's painful nocturnal spasms. The hallmark of PLMD is myoclonic movement of the upper and lower extremities, thought to be due to hyperactivity of propriospinal neurons. The stellate ganglion is considered a source of sympathetic nervous system activation, and blocking the ganglion with local anesthetic reduces sympathetic activity. SGB for PLMD has not been previously described; however, our results indicate that communication between motor neurons and the sympathetic nervous system is possible due to the plasticity of propriospinal interneurons. While the indication for SGB is rapidly expanding, its application for PLMD is truly novel. Further research is desperately needed to establish SGB as a solid treatment modality for PLMD.

### Nocturnal hypoxemia and periodic limb movement predict mortality in patients on maintenance hemodialysis [^114fLyoj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders, including sleep-disordered breathing and periodic limb movements during sleep, are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading causes of death in patients with ESRD. This study investigated the association between sleep disorders and mortality in patients with ESRD.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Thirty patients on maintenance hemodialysis, who were clinically stable for over two months, underwent overnight polysomnography to evaluate sleep parameters.

- **Results**: All patients were followed for a median of 48 months (range: 14 to 62 months), and 14 of them died during the follow-up period. Among the sleep parameters, the percent of sleep time with arterial oxygen saturation < 90% (T < 90%), mean arterial oxygen saturation, and periodic limb movement index score were associated with significant increases in the risk of death. However, associations of the apnea-hypopnea index or oxygen desaturation index with mortality were not significant. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for death per one standard deviation increment in the log-transformed T < 90% and periodic limb movement index score were 2.10 (1.06 to 4.15) and 2.48 (1.11 to 5.52), respectively, after adjusting for age.

- **Conclusions**: We found that nocturnal hypoxemia and periodic limb movement during sleep, rather than apnea itself, were associated with an increased risk for death in patients with ESRD. However, conclusions from this study should be drawn with caution, because they are limited by the small sample size.

Regarding the medical management of restless legs syndrome, particularly with dopaminergic agents, the AAN 2016 guidelines recommend offering ropinirole to improve objective sleep measures, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and wake after sleep onset. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, or levodopa for improving these objective sleep measures.

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements of sleep: Fact, fad, and fiction [^111h166f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are common disorders seen in sleep disorder centers. Although RLS is universally thought to cause daytime sleepiness, the role of PLMS in causing sleepiness, or any symptom, has been more controversial. Recent publications have shown that PLMS do not cause either subjective or objective sleepiness but may be a marker for respiratory effort-related arousals. Regarding patients with end-stage renal disease, PLMS may indicate mortality. In this same group of patients, gabapentin and normalization of hematocrit may be effective therapies for RLS/PLMS. Melatonin may prove to be an alternative therapy for PLMS.

### Practice guideline summary: Treatment of restless legs syndrome in adults: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112z3r2z]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

To make evidence-based recommendations regarding restless legs syndrome (RLS) management in adults, articles were classified per the 2004 American Academy of Neurology evidence rating scheme. Recommendations were tied to evidence strength.

In moderate to severe primary RLS, clinicians should consider prescribing medication to reduce RLS symptoms. Strong evidence supports the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and gabapentin enacarbil (Level A); moderate evidence supports ropinirole, pregabalin, and IV ferric carboxymaltose (Level B). Clinicians may consider prescribing levodopa (Level C). Few head-to-head comparisons exist to suggest agents preferentially, and cabergoline is rarely used due to risks of cardiac valvulopathy. Augmentation risks with dopaminergic agents should also be considered.

When treating periodic limb movements of sleep, clinicians should consider prescribing ropinirole (Level A) or pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, or pregabalin (Level B). For subjective sleep measures, clinicians should consider prescribing cabergoline or gabapentin enacarbil (Level A), or ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine, or pregabalin (Level B). For patients failing other treatments for RLS symptoms, clinicians may consider prescribing prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone where available (Level C).

In patients with RLS with ferritin levels ≤ 75 μg/L, clinicians should consider prescribing ferrous sulfate with vitamin C (Level B). When nonpharmacologic approaches are desired, clinicians should consider prescribing pneumatic compression (Level B).

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements in patients with movement disorders: Specific considerations [^113nr7BX]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with potentially serious and highly distressing treatment complications. The role and potential implications of periodic leg movements during sleep range from being a genetic risk marker for restless legs syndrome to being a cardiovascular risk factor. Diagnosing restless legs syndrome in patients with daytime movement disorders is challenging, as it needs to be differentiated from other sleep-related movement disorders. This article provides an update on the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome as an independent disorder, examines the role of periodic leg movements, and reviews the association of restless legs syndrome with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.

### More than sleepiness: Prevalence and relevance of nonclassical symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea [^113DFp7E]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movements, and OSA are interrelated conditions. Restless legs syndrome is a common chronic sensory-motor neurological disorder, which can coincide with OSA. The prevalence of RLS in patients with OSA varies between 7% and 36%, which is higher than in the normal population. Recent data have shown that 21% of patients with OSA have RLS, with the proportion of women (60%) with OSA-RLS being higher than for men (40%). Patients with OSA-RLS reported more insomnia-specific symptoms than those with only OSA, such as sleep-related worries.

In a study conducted among 1,317 patients admitted to a sleep apnea clinic, women with OSA reported restless legs symptoms more frequently than men (43.1% vs. 17.2%). Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by involuntary periodic limb movements that occur repetitively during sleep (PLMS). PLMS are commonly observed in patients with OSA. Among 303 adult patients with OSA, 98 had a significant number of PLMS (32%). In a study by Lee et al, 861 patients with OSA who underwent full-night CPAP titration polysomnography (PSG) were examined. The proportions of individuals with PLMS on both PSGs (persistent PLMS), those with CPAP-emergent PLMS, and those with CPAP-resolved PLMS were 12.9%, 9.2%, and 3.9%, respectively.

Benbir Senel et al. performed cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) analysis in these different categories. They found that PLMS related to the A1 subtype of CAP were observed to decrease under CPAP titration more than PLMS related to the A3 subtype of CAP. The A3 subtype of CAP was higher in patients with vanishing PLMS than those with newly emergent PLMS. The newly emergent PLMS were most observed in patients with.

### Role of sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-wake disturbances for stroke and stroke recovery [^111s4Xfb]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) are significant concerns post-stroke. In two series involving 96 and 137 patients examined within 15 days or at one month following a stroke, 12% and 13% respectively met the criteria for RLS. This condition is characterized by an urge for limb movements that improves with activity but worsens in the evenings, nights, and at rest. Two-thirds of patients presented with bilateral RLS symptoms, while one-third experienced unilateral symptoms contralateral to the stroke. RLS often coincided with PLMS, defined as involuntary periodic limb movements during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Patients with RLS exhibited higher neck circumferences and a higher prevalence of diabetes than those without RLS. Notably, sleep quality was reduced in these patients. PLMS are even more prevalent than RLS among stroke patients. In a case-control study involving 35 patients with acute supratentorial ischemic stroke, a PLMS index greater than 5 per hour was observed in 77% of stroke patients, in contrast to 29% of age- and sex-matched controls. PLMS were contralateral to the stroke in 70% of cases and bilateral in 30%.

In patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), they experience dream enactment behaviors, manifesting as a loss of atonia and increased phasic muscle activity during REM sleep. Following initial observations of RBD in patients with brainstem infarcts, a recent assessment of 119 ischemic stroke patients estimated the prevalence of RBD to be approximately 11%. Among those with RBD, 46% had brainstem infarcts.

### Sleep disturbance in movement disorders: Insights, treatments and challenges [^112naUoP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are central features of many movement disorders, exacerbating motor and non-motor symptoms and impairing quality of life. Understanding these disturbances is clinically important and may enhance our comprehension of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and recognized primary sleep disorders. Additionally, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for sleep disruption across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for alpha-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years.

Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medications used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affect sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, the ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep, and the treatment of sleep disturbances to improve quality of life.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^114id34R]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder worldwide, but diagnosis is challenging. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement that proposes a tremor classification along two independent axes: a clinical tremor syndrome and its underlying aetiology. In line with this statement, we propose a stepwise diagnostic approach that leads to the correct clinical and aetiological classification of upper limb tremor. We also describe the typical clinical signs of each clinical tremor syndrome.

A key feature of our algorithm is the distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, where tremor is accompanied by bradykinesia, cerebellar signs, dystonia, peripheral neuropathy, or brainstem signs. This distinction subsequently informs the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, such as neurophysiology, laboratory testing, structural and dopaminergic imaging, and genetic testing. We highlight treatable metabolic causes of tremor, as well as drugs and toxins that can provoke tremor. The stepwise approach facilitates appropriate diagnostic testing and avoids unnecessary investigations. We expect that the approach offered in this article will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.
