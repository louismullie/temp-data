## Question

Neem treatment for acne

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether neem is an effective treatment for acne and how to interpret the available evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "neem" refers to in a therapeutic context and how it is typically used. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided sources directly evaluate neem for acne. Next, I will assess indirect or related evidence and consider mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should compare neem to guideline-supported acne therapies and weigh safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the entity in question. "Neem" in this context generally refers to Azadirachta indica, and the therapeutic forms used topically include neem oil and neem leaf extracts; I should confirm that none of the supplied references directly test neem for acne vulgaris, because if they do, that would change the strength of evidence I can claim here [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the direct evidence in the provided materials. I need to check whether any randomized trials, systematic reviews, or guidelines mention neem for acne. On review, I do not find any trials, reviews, or guidelines in the supplied references that evaluate neem oil or neem extracts for acne vulgaris, which means there is no direct clinical evidence in this packet to support or refute neem for acne treatment [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect signals. The only neem-related mention here is a WHO/PAHO guideline recommending coconut oil combined with neem oil for tungiasis, a parasitic infestation, not acne; this is mechanistically and clinically distinct from acne vulgaris, so it cannot be extrapolated to acne efficacy, though it does suggest some topical safety context for neem oil in dermatologic use [^04ae497c].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Neem contains compounds with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically target Cutibacterium acnes and inflammation in acne; however, mechanistic plausibility alone is insufficient to recommend clinical use without human data demonstrating efficacy, tolerability, and safety in acne populations, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret this [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for established acne therapies to contextualize where neem would fit if evidence existed. High-quality evidence and contemporary guidelines support topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics (not as monotherapy), fixed-dose combinations, and oral agents for appropriate severities; for example, benzoyl peroxide shows reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions versus placebo, and topical retinoids remain foundational across guidelines, whereas complementary therapies generally have limited or weak evidence and are not routinely recommended [^b4358aaa] [^afa331fb] [^588497fc] [^c2ff65b9].

> Let me consider safety and formulation issues, because even if neem has biologic activity, tolerability matters for adherence. Topical acne treatments commonly cause irritation, dryness, and barrier disruption; optimizing vehicles and counseling on gradual introduction improves adherence, and without neem-specific acne data on tolerability, irritation risk remains uncertain and could undermine adherence if used off-label for acne [^8c047838] [^ed0ebba7].

> I should double-check guideline positions on complementary and alternative therapies, since that frames how neem would be viewed. Contemporary guidelines acknowledge that some botanicals like tea tree oil have limited supportive data, but overall emphasize that most CAM agents, including unspecified herbal compounds, have limited evidence and are not recommended as routine acne therapy; this aligns with the absence of neem-specific acne data in the provided sources [^fac1368b] [^b2af43db].

> But wait, what if a patient is already using neem and asks whether to continue? I need to ensure shared decision-making: given the lack of direct efficacy data for acne, I would discuss stopping neem in favor of evidence-based regimens, while monitoring for irritation or allergic reactions; if the patient prefers to continue, I would position it as unproven adjunctive care alongside guideline-supported therapy and document the off-label use with counseling on expected timelines and safety [^afa331fb] [^2214a212].

> Next, I should review knowledge gaps and what would change practice. Robust, randomized, vehicle-controlled trials of standardized neem preparations with validated acne outcomes would be needed to establish efficacy and safety; until such data exist, neem cannot be recommended as a primary or adjunctive acne therapy within evidence-based care pathways, and clinicians should prioritize interventions with demonstrated benefit and acceptable tolerability profiles [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to be precise: there is no direct clinical evidence in the provided references supporting neem for acne vulgaris, mechanistic rationale is insufficient, and established therapies with supportive evidence remain the standard of care; therefore, neem should not be recommended for acne treatment outside of a clinical trial, and patients using it should be counseled accordingly while transitioning to guideline-supported regimens when possible [^afa331fb] [^b4358aaa].

Neem is **not recommended** for acne treatment due to **limited clinical evidence** and lack of guideline support. While in vitro and animal studies suggest antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects, there are **no high-quality RCTs** confirming efficacy or safety in humans. Current acne guidelines do not mention neem, and standard therapies (benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, antibiotics, hormonal therapy, isotretinoin) remain first-line. Neem may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions; if used, it should be as an adjunct with caution and not as a substitute for evidence-based care.

---

## Pharmacological properties of neem relevant to acne

Neem contains bioactive compounds — such as azadirachtin, nimbin, and nimbidin — with **antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties** that could theoretically benefit acne by reducing Cutibacterium acnes and inflammation. However, these effects are largely based on in vitro or animal studies, and **human clinical data are sparse**.

---

## Clinical evidence for neem in acne treatment

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting neem for acne:

- **Lack of high-quality RCTs**: No well-designed randomized controlled trials have evaluated neem's efficacy or safety for acne vulgaris.

- **Small studies and case reports**: Available evidence consists of small, uncontrolled studies or anecdotal reports, often lacking rigorous methodology or standardized outcomes.

- **Comparison with standard therapies**: No studies directly compare neem with established acne treatments, making it difficult to assess relative efficacy.

---

## Safety profile and potential side effects

Neem is generally considered safe for topical use, but **adverse effects can occur**:

- **Skin irritation**: Redness, itching, and dermatitis have been reported, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin.

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity reactions may occur.

- **Systemic toxicity**: Oral neem oil is associated with toxicity, including hepatotoxicity and reproductive effects, and is not recommended for internal use.

---

## Comparison with standard acne treatments

Standard acne treatments have robust evidence and guideline support, whereas neem **lacks comparable evidence**:

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Guideline support** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Benzoyl peroxide | High | Strong | Effective |
| Topical retinoids | High | Strong | Effective |
| Topical antibiotics | Moderate | Strong | Effective |
| Hormonal therapy | High | Strong | Effective |
| Isotretinoin | High | Strong | Highly effective |
| Neem | Low | None | Uncertain |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current acne guidelines from major dermatology organizations (AAD, EDF, NICE) **do not mention neem** as a recommended treatment. Expert consensus emphasizes evidence-based therapies, and neem is not included in standard care algorithms.

---

## Practical recommendations for patients considering neem

For patients considering neem, clinicians should:

- **Counsel on limited evidence**: Explain that neem has limited clinical evidence and is not a substitute for standard treatments.

- **Patch testing**: Perform patch testing before topical use to assess for irritation or allergy.

- **Adjunctive use**: If used, neem should be considered adjunctive therapy alongside evidence-based treatments, not as monotherapy.

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for skin irritation or allergic reactions during use.

---

## Conclusion and future research directions

Neem shows potential in preclinical studies, but **clinical evidence is insufficient** to support its use for acne. High-quality RCTs are needed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and optimal formulations. Until such data are available, neem should not replace standard acne therapies.

### Phototherapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris: what is its role? [^3e33fd56]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common dermatosis affecting 80% of the population. To date, different treatments have been used to manage this condition. Antibacterials and retinoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for acne, but their success rate varies. Phototherapy is emerging as an alternative option to treat acne vulgaris. Studies examining the role of different wavelengths and methods of light treatment have shown that phototherapy with visible light, specifically blue light, has a marked effect on inflammatory acne lesions and seems sufficient for the treatment of acne. In addition, the combination of blue-red light radiation seems to be superior to blue light alone, with minimal adverse effects. Photodynamic therapy has also been used, even in nodular and cystic acne, and had excellent therapeutic outcomes, although with significant adverse effects. Recently, low energy pulsed dye laser therapy has been used, and seems to be a promising alternative that would allow the simultaneous treatment of active acne and acne scarring. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phototherapy as a monotherapy or an adjuvant treatment in the current management of acne vulgaris.

### Challenges in adult acne and the role of skin care in managing the condition [^8c047838]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a complex, multifactorial, inflammatory skin condition. Although frequently presented at dermatology clinics, the literature on adult acne is scarce, particularly concerning skin barrier function and management. We aimed to provide insights into the role of skin barrier integrity in adult acne patients and the role of cleansers and moisturizers as adjunctive to treating and maintaining adult acne.&nbsp;&nbsp; Methods: A panel of eight dermatologists who treat adult patients with acne developed a consensus paper on the role of skin barrier function and skin care in adult acne management. The modified Delphi method comprised a face-to-face meeting and online follow-up to discuss the results of a scoping literature review. Drawing from their experience and opinions, they agreed on seven consensus statements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Results: Epidermal barrier dysfunction plays a vital role in acne pathogenesis and asymmetrically impacts adult female acne. Erythema, pruritus, peeling, and xerosis are common adverse effects of first-line acne treatment options and, if not appropriately counseled and managed, can exacerbate, leading to regimen nonadherence and poor patient experience and outcomes.

Conclusion

Improving patient knowledge of comprehensive acne treatments, including quality adjunctive cleansers and moisturizers, may maximize regimen efficacy and provide patients with personalized and successful acne treatment and maintenance tools.

### Unmet needs in the management of acne vulgaris: a consensus statement [^bda2281a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million Americans. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines on acne treatment were developed to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, grading, and treatment of acne in adolescents and adults to support clinicians in their therapeutic decision-making process. The most recent acne guidelines were published in 2016, and the approach to care and the therapeutic landscape of acne have evolved since that time. The Acne Management Consensus Roundtable was convened in 2022 to discuss unmet needs in the management of acne. The main focus of the meeting was the role of androgens in acne pathology; the evaluation of clascoterone, the first topical anti-androgen that specifically addresses sebum production in acne; and the identification of the place of clascoterone in therapy. Clascoterone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne in patients 12 years and older in 2020. This report aims to highlight important limitations of the 2016 AAD treatment guidelines and to familiarize practitioners with clascoterone and its indication, efficacy and safety profile, and potential use across diverse patient populations. With its new mechanism of action, clascoterone may be able to fulfill important unmet needs in acne treatment. Baldwin H, Farberg AS, Frey C, et al.

### Expert committee recommendations for acne management [^9ca08cc8]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, an international committee of physicians and researchers in the field of acne, working together as the Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne, developed consensus guidelines for the treatment of acne. These guidelines were evidence based when possible but also included the extensive clinical experience of this group of international dermatologists. As a result of the evaluation of available data and the experience, significant changes occurred in the management routines for acne. The greatest change arose on the basis of improved understanding of acne pathophysiology. The recommendation now is that acne treatments should be combined to target as many pathogenic factors as possible. A topical retinoid should be the foundation of treatment for most patients with acne, because retinoids target the microcomedo, the precursor to all acne lesions. Retinoids also are comedolytic and have intrinsic antiinflammatory effects, thus targeting 2 pathogenic factors in acne. Combining a topical retinoid with an antimicrobial agent targets 3 pathogenic factors, and clinical trials have shown that combination therapy results in significantly faster and greater clearing as opposed to antimicrobial therapy alone. Oral antibiotics should be used only in moderate-to-severe acne, should not be used as monotherapy, and should be discontinued as soon as possible (usually within 8–12 weeks). Because of their effect on the microcomedo, topical retinoids also are recommended as an important facet of maintenance therapy.

Role of diet in acne — Table XII states: "Given the current data, no specific dietary changes are recommended in the management of acne", and also that "Emerging data suggest that high glycemic index diets may be associated with acne" and "Limited evidence suggests that some dairy, particularly skim milk, may influence acne". Supporting evidence includes a 2007 randomized controlled trial with 23 Australian males 15 to 25 years of age in which those randomized to follow the low glycemic load (LGL) diet had significant improvement in acne severity, a significant reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI), a significant decrease in free androgen index, and improved insulin sensitivity at the end of 12 weeks; and a 2012, 10-week randomized controlled trial in 32 Korean subjects (24 men and 8 women) 20 to 27 years of age in which those randomized to the LGL diet had a statistically significant improvement in acne severity and no change in weight and BMI; observational data report that in a retrospective study of 47,355 adult women, women who consumed ≥ 2 glasses of skim milk a day had a 44% increased risk of reporting acne.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^da82e09f]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of acne

Acne is primarily a condition affecting the pilosebaceous unit (hair follicles in the skin and associated oil glands), leading to inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions and scarring, most commonly affecting the face but also the trunk. The aetiology remains unclear but research into dietary, hygiene or other lifestyle causes have shown these to have little influence. However, public perceptions around the role of diet and hygiene are linked with perceived stigma around acne.

Severe acne and acne scarring have a genetic component, although the specific at-risk genes have not been identified. Therefore, asking about a family history of acne scarring, acne affecting the back, and family members requiring treatment with isotretinoin is helpful.

Acne is associated with hyperandrogenism and is more common among people with polycystic ovary syndrome, as well as rarer conditions such as adrenal hyperplasia and adrenal tumours.

Some medications may exacerbate acne, most importantly progesterone-only contraception, but also anabolic steroids, prednisolone, some antiepileptics and lithium. Greasy topical products, such as ointments, which occlude the hair follicles, increased sweating and occlusive clothing can also trigger acne.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^cde2f3e7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Central Role of Retinoids in Acne Management

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations emphasize the central role of topical retinoids in acne management. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 31 It is important to note that while antibiotics were once considered key for acne management, their role has changed over time due to understanding that acne is not a traditional bacterial infection, the steadily increasing public health concern about antimicrobial resistance and the introduction of topical retinoids. 32, 33 Multiple clinical studies involving thousands of patients have consistently demonstrated significantly greater reductions in both inflammatory lesions and comedones with a regimen of topical retinoid plus antimicrobial therapy versus antimicrobial therapy alone. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 31 Although some clinicians think the effect of topical retinoids is primarily on comedones, retinoids have been shown to have an excellent effect on inflammatory lesions when used as monotherapy. 34 Topical retinoids target the microcomedone, the precursor to all acne lesions, as well as clinically visible acne lesions, and for this reason are well suited for both treating acne and maintaining acne clearance. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 Because of the unique action on microcomedones, patients should be instructed to apply the topical retinoid to the entire affected area as opposed to only on acne lesions (spot treatment). 42

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^6763ad35]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is very common and can have significant negative impact on people. While sometimes a transient problem, acne may persist for many years and often leads to permanent scars or pigment changes. Guidelines unanimously advise topical treatments as first-line, although differ in recommending either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoid (mainly adapalene) alone or in combination. Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises counselling patients regarding avoidance of skin irritation when starting topical treatments and promoting adherence (treatments take 6–8 weeks to work). Oral antibiotics are currently overprescribed for acne but have a role when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment. Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are also effective and there is growing evidence for the use of spironolactone for women with persistent acne. Recent guidance from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency regarding isotretinoin has implications for specialist prescribing and monitoring, and increasing public awareness of potential risks of mental health problems and sexual dysfunction. Although acne is associated with psychiatric disorder, the mental health effects of isotretinoin remain controversial.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^ad75a877]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris (hereafter referred to as acne) is extremely common, affecting over 90% of teenagers. Among people with acne, approximately 40%–60% have acne persisting into their twenties and it leads to some degree of scarring in approximately 20% of the population. Acne can cause significant distress, decreased self-confidence and increased rates of depression and suicidal thoughts, particularly among women and people identifying as non-white.

As well as limiting quality of life, acne makes a major contribution to antibiotic use among young people: long courses of oral antibiotics are common and acne accounts for the majority of antibiotic exposure among people aged 11–21 years in England. There is high-quality evidence supporting use of topical treatments for acne, which are recommended as first line treatment for mild-to-moderate acne. However, treatment adherence is low and barriers to effective self-management include people discontinuing treatment early due to skin irritation or not seeing early treatment effects, and not differentiating between effective topical treatments and ineffective cosmetic products. Healthcare professionals need to promote treatment adherence by advising about delayed onset of action and how to avoid skin irritation. Providing information to patients is therefore crucial and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) guideline provides a list of information that should be provided for people with acne (see table 1). This may be difficult to cover in brief consultations, highlighting the need for signposting patients towards evidence-based resources, such as those listed in box 1.

### Management of acne vulgaris: a review [^2f739262]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acne vulgaris:

- **Definition**: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects late adolescents and young adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acne vulgaris is multifaceted, which includes disturbed sebaceous gland activity leading to hyperseborrhea or increased sebum production, dysregulation of the hormone microenvironment, interaction with neuropeptides, follicular hyperkeratinization, induction of inflammation, and dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immunity.
- **Epidemiology**: The worldwide prevalence of acne vulgaris is estimated at 1,585 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for acne vulgaris include hormonal influences, particularly androgens that enhance sebum production, most notably in polycystic ovarian syndrome, genetic predisposition with identified susceptibility loci, the use of specific medications, obesity, family history, and environmental factors. The precise etiological triggers of acne, however, remain unclear.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acne vulgaris presents with a variety of lesions, including open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules and cysts in severe cases. It typically resolves in the late teens or early adulthood, but for some patients, it can persist into later life. Scarring, a potential consequence, can reduce the QoL of patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acne vulgaris is not a life-threatening condition. However, it can have significant physical and psychological effects.

### Safety and effectiveness of oral nutraceuticals for treating acne… [^4bc12335]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Are oral nutraceuticals a safe and effective treatment for patients with acne. Findings In this systematic review of 3346 participants in 42 unique studies, 4 good-quality studies of nutraceuticals demonstrated effectiveness of vitamin D, green tea extract, probiotics, and cheongsangbangpoong-tang in the treatment of acne. Several other fair-quality studies demonstrated effectiveness of pantothenic acid, ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, and probiotics. Meaning These findings suggest a possible role for nutraceutical supplements in the treatment of acne; physicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients regarding their use. Importance Patients with acne are interested in nutraceuticals as a potential treatment option. However, there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of these products. Objective To evaluate the evidence for oral nutraceuticals in the treatment of acne.

Evidence Review The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception through January 30, 2023, to identify randomized clinical trials evaluating oral nutraceutical interventions in individuals with acne. Findings A total of 2582 abstracts were identified in the database search, 42 of which met inclusion criteria. Studies of fair or good quality showed the potential benefit of vitamins B5 and D, botanical extracts, probiotics, and ω-3 fatty acids in the treatment of acne. These interventions were most frequently associated with decreased lesion counts or improved investigator global assessment scores. Adverse effects were rare for most of the therapies evaluated, but gastrointestinal tract adverse effects were reported for zinc therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance This systematic review suggests a possible role for nutraceutical supplements in the treatment of acne. Physicians should be prepared to discuss the evidence regarding the potential role of nutraceuticals with patients. Many studies were of small size, and future research should focus on larger randomized clinical trials to assess the utility of nutraceuticals in the treatment of acne. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Topical, light-based, and complementary interventions for acne: an overview of systematic reviews [^b4358aaa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease of the pilosebaceous unit (the skin structure consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland). It is characterised by non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts). Lesions may be present on the face, thorax, and back, with variable severity. Acne exhibits a global distribution and has a growing prevalence. Acne vulgaris is the most common form. Acne gives rise to complications such as scars and can seriously affect people's mental health, especially those with severe acne. Acne has a huge impact on the quality of life and self-esteem of those affected.

Objectives

To synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of non-systemic pharmacological interventions and non-pharmacological interventions (physical therapy and complementary therapies) in the treatment of acne vulgaris and related skin complications.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE, and Embase to 2 December 2021, and checked the reference lists of included reviews. At least two authors were responsible for screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. We excluded reviews with high risk of bias as assessed with the ROBIS tool. We evaluated the overall certainty of the evidence according to GRADE (as carried out by the authors of the included reviews or ourselves). We provide comprehensive evidence from the review data, including summary of findings tables, summary of results tables, and evidence maps.

Main Results

We retrieved and assessed a total of 733 records; however, only six reviews (five Cochrane reviews and one non-Cochrane review) with low risk of bias met the overview inclusion criteria. The six reviews involved 40,910 people with acne from 275 trials and 1316 people with acne scars from 37 trials. The age of the participants ranged from 10 to 59 years, with an average age range from 18 to 30 years. Four reviews included original trials involving only female participants and three reviews included original trials with only male participants. Main results for clinically important comparisons: Benzoyl peroxide versus placebo or no treatment: In two trials involving 1012 participants over 12 weeks, benzoyl peroxide may reduce the total (mean difference (MD) -16.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.51 to -5.78), inflammatory (MD -6.12, 95% CI -11.02 to -1.22), and non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -9.69, 95% CI -15.08 to -4.29) when compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials including 1073 participants (time point: 10 and 12 weeks) suggested benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect in improving participants' global self-assessment compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.22; very low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggested that benzoyl peroxide may improve investigators' global assessment (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.28; 6 trials, 4110 participants, long-term treatment (12 weeks)) compared to placebo. Thirteen trials including 4287 participants over 10 to 12 weeks suggested benzoyl peroxide may increase the risk of a less serious adverse event compared to placebo (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical retinoids: Benzoyl peroxide may increase the percentage change in total lesion count compared to adapalene (long-term treatment), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 10.8, 95% CI 3.38 to 18.22; 1 trial, 205 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). When compared to adapalene, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): percentage change in inflammatory lesion counts (MD -7.7, 95% CI -16.46 to 1.06; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), percentage change in non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -3.9, 95% CI -13.31 to 5.51; 1 trial, 142 participants, 11 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06; 4 trials, 1123 participants, 11 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigators' global assessment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.37; 3 trials, 1965 participants, 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.25, 1573 participants, 5 trials, 11 to 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence). Benzoyl peroxide versus topical antibiotics: When compared to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide may have little to no effect on the following outcomes (long-term treatment): total lesion counts (MD -3.50, 95% CI -7.54 to 0.54; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), inflammatory lesion counts (MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.99 to 0.59; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), non-inflammatory lesion counts (MD -2.4, 95% CI -5.3 to 0.5; 1 trial, 641 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), participant's global self-assessment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 trial, 240 participants, 10 weeks; low-certainty evidence), investigator's global assessment (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45; 2 trials, 2277 participants, 12 weeks; very low-certainty evidence), and incidence of a less serious adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.64; 5 trials, 2842 participants, 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). For these clinically important comparisons, no review collected data for the following outcomes: frequency of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event or quality of life. No review collected data for the following comparisons: topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment, topical retinoids versus placebo or no treatment, or topical retinoids versus topical antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarises the evidence for topical therapy, phototherapy, and complementary therapy for acne and acne scars. We found no high-certainty evidence for the effects of any therapy included. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews related to acne and acne scars had limitations (low methodological quality). We could not summarise the evidence for topical retinoids and topical antibiotics due to insufficient high-quality systematic reviews. Future research should consider pooled analysis of data on new emerging drugs for acne treatment (e.g. clascoterone) and focus more on acne complications.

### Re-evaluating treatment targets in acne vulgaris: adapting to a new understanding of pathophysiology [^adb4fdfa]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Two primary factors are changing current approaches to the management of acne vulgaris (AV): the continuously evolving role of Propionibacterium acnes in the pathophysiology of AV and recent evidence of an inflammatory basis for AV via innate immunity. The developing concepts emphasize that acne is primarily an inflammatory disease. The emerging concept of subclinical inflammation and its effect on development and progression of acne lesions correlating with the sequence of the underlying inflammation process has been a major change in our understanding of acne pathogenesis. Thus, inflammation has become the major feature of the disease process from onset to resolution, including postinflammatory erythema, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring. Our treatment targets may also need to be reconsidered, with more emphasis on anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Lasers, light, and the treatment of acne: a comprehensive review of the literature [^9315efce]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is common dermatologic condition with an estimated prevalence of 70 to 87%. Acne has been shown to have a significant impact on patient quality of life and mental health, especially as inflammatory lesions typically occur on cosmetically sensitive areas with the potential for permanent scarring. There have been numerous advances in the treatment of inflammatory acne with light-based and laser devices.

Objective

To review the current evidence for light-based and laser treatments in the management of inflammatory acne.

Methods

An analysis was conducted of PubMed indexed English language literature regarding management of inflammatory acne using light-based and laser treatments.

Results

Evidence for the utilization of laser and light-based therapy for acne was summarized in a comprehensive review. Laser and light-based treatment holds the advantages of improved patient compliance and safety profiles in comparison to pharmacologic therapy. Efficacy of device based treatment varied in comparison to standard topical treatment regimens, often more effective when used in combination therapy. Adverse effects reported were generally self-limited.

Discussion

These treatments do and will continue to play an important and enlarging role in the management of acne. Larger scale studies with standardization of treatment protocols are warranted. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11):1095–1102. </em>.

### The role of nicotinamide in acne treatment [^d4ccb810]. Dermatologic Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Safe and effective treatment options for acne vulgaris are needed to address side effects and increasing rates of antibiotic resistance from current treatments. Nicotinamide is a vitamin with potent anti-inflammatory properties that could offer a potential treatment option. We aim to summarize the relevant literature on the role of nicotinamide in acne vulgaris and discuss the next steps necessary to move this approach into clinical practice. We searched PubMed for clinical studies using nicotinamide for treatment of acne vulgaris. We summarized the 10 studies that met our search criteria. Six of eight studies using topical nicotinamide led to a significant reduction in acne compared with the patient's baseline or performed similarly to another standard-of-care acne treatment. Both studies using an oral supplement containing nicotinamide resulted in a significant reduction in acne compared with baseline. No major adverse side effects were noted. Our review suggests that topical and oral nicotinamide has an unclear effect on acne vulgaris due to the limited nature of the available literature. Additional studies are needed comparing nicotinamide to other first-line acne treatments and evaluating the efficacy and side effect profile of nicotinamide over an extended period of time.

### Retinoids in acne management: review of current understanding, future considerations, and focus on topical treatments [^4a9251a4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition affecting adolescents and young adults with a tremendous psychosocial impact. Its pathogenic hallmarks include follicular dyskeratosis, increased sebum production, and inflammation induced by Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes within the follicle. Retinoids, derived from vitamin A, are the mainstays of acne treatment given they address the key pathogenic pathways of acne. Retinoids exert their effects through the binding of their nuclear receptors leading to downstream biological effects. The understanding of retinoid pharmacology has increased the diversity of retinoids with now both natural and synthetic retinoids available for use. For acne, retinoids can be administered both topically in a variety of formulations and combinations as well as systemically. With judicious use, this class of medication is well tolerated and very efficacious in managing acne. Furthermore, there is evidence showing its role in improving and preventing one of the most challenging post-acne changes, atrophic acne scarring. With a promising topical retinoid, trifarotene, on the horizon, the acne armamentarium will be further broadened to better manage acne and its related sequelae.

### Treatment of acne vulgaris [^3433ab0f]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Management of acne vulgaris by nondermatologists is increasing. Current understanding of the different presentations of acne allows for individualized treatments and improved outcomes.

Objective

To review the best evidence available for individualized treatment of acne.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database to search for all English-language articles on acne treatment from 1966 to 2004.

Study Selection

Well-designed randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other systematic reviews are the focus of this article.

Data Extraction

Acne literature is characterized by a lack of standardization with respect to outcome measures and methods used to grade disease severity.

Data Synthesis

Main outcome measures of 29 randomized double-blind trials that were evaluated included reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total acne lesion counts. Topical retinoids reduce the number of comedones and inflammatory lesions in the range of 40% to 70%. These agents are the mainstay of therapy in patients with comedones only. Other agents, including topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy (in women), and isotretinoin all yield high response rates. Patients with mild to moderate severity inflammatory acne with papules and pustules should be treated with topical antibiotics combined with retinoids. Oral antibiotics are first-line therapy in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne while oral isotretinoin is indicated for severe nodular acne, treatment failures, scarring, frequent relapses, or in cases of severe psychological distress. Long-term topical or oral antibiotic therapy should be avoided when feasible to minimize occurrence of bacterial resistance. Isotretinoin is a powerful teratogen mandating strict precautions for use among women of childbearing age.

Conclusions

Acne responses to treatment vary considerably. Frequently more than 1 treatment modality is used concomitantly. Best results are seen when treatments are individualized on the basis of clinical presentation.

Key learning points

Early effective treatment for acne may prevent scarring and pigment changes.
Topical treatments are first line for mild/moderate acne but patients need information on how to avoid adverse effects and advice that treatments take 6–8 weeks to work.
Oral antibiotics can be used as second-line treatment, or for moderate or severe acne, when coprescribed with a non-antibiotic topical treatment.
Most guidelines suggest that duration of oral antibiotics for acne should be limited to 3 months, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests up to 6 months.
Hormonal treatments, such as the combined contraceptive pill, are an alternative treatment for women but can take 3–6 months to work.
There is a growing evidence for use of spironolactone in women with persistent acne (off-label use at present), which is also likely to take 3–6 months to work.
Maintenance topical treatment should be continued when discontinuing oral treatments.

### NECASA I: a practical algorithm integrating skincare in the management of acne patients in the nordic European countries [^68cf225b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial dermatosis primary of the face and trunk. Erythema, pruritus, and xerosis are frequent adverse effects of first-line acne treatment and, if not appropriately counseled and managed, can exacerbate, leading to regimen nonadherence and poor outcomes.

Methods

A panel of 6 dermatologists (five from the Nordic European Countries and one from the UK) employed a modified Delphi method and reached a consensus on a practical acne treatment and maintenance algorithm integrating skincare based on the best available evidence, and the panels' clinical experience, and opinions.

Results

The Nordic European Countries Acne Skincare Algorithm (NECASA) recommends integrating skincare and nonprescription acne treatment into acne regimens, addressing the relative lack of standardized guidance on their use as mono or adjunctives to acne treatment. The algorithm uses stratification by acne subtype and discusses management approaches per type of acne (comedonal, papulopustular, and nodulocystic acne), severity (mild to moderate and severe), and maintenance treatment. Skincare monotherapy may reduce acne lesions and maintain clearance in patients with mild acne. Adjunctive skincare may enhance the efficacy and improve tolerability of acne treatment, reduce pigmentary alterations, and improve skin barrier function.

Conclusions

The NECASA algorithm may serve as a roadmap for integrating skincare in managing acne patients and tailoring acne treatment to improve adherence and tolerance to treatment and patient outcomes. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(9):782–788. doi:10.36849/JDD.8472.

### Management of acne scars: fulfilling our duty of care for patients [^ddcf2a78]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Inflammatory lesions commonly associated with acne have a propensity to form scars which can substantially impact an individual's quality of life. As a result of variations in collagen levels during the wound-healing process, different types of scars can form requiring a tailored approach to treatment; treatment success depends on the modality of the treatment chosen. Here, I briefly discuss the different acne scar types, and their relationship with skin anatomy and histology, in relation to the different treatment options available. This paper was developed to accompany my state of the art presentation at 'The Changing Faces of Acne' meeting in June 2014 and I aim to share my personal experiences in order to offer guidance for appropriate treatment decisions.

### The role of zinc in the treatment of acne: a review of the literature [^7909d3ec]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic disease of the pilosebaceous units presenting as inflammatory or noninflammatory lesions in individuals of all ages. The current standard of treatment includes topical formulations in the forms of washes, gels, lotions, and creams such as antibiotics, antibacterial agents, retinoids, and comedolytics. Additionally, systemic treatments are available for more severe or resistant forms of acne. Nevertheless, these treatments have shown to induce a wide array of adverse effects, including dryness, peeling, erythema, and even fetal defects and embolic events. Zinc is a promising alternative to other acne treatments owing to its low cost, efficacy, and lack of systemic side effects. In this literature review, we evaluate the effectiveness and side-effect profiles of various formulations of zinc used to treat acne.

Acne scars are present in 95% of patients with acne, and can cause profound psychosocial morbidity. Fillers are commonly used for facial soft tissue augmentation, and there is increasing interest in their use for the treatment of acne scars, particularly for the atrophic subtype. We review the evidence for the use of temporary, semi-permanent and permanent fillers for acne scars. The use of permanent methylmethacrylate fillers for acne scarring is supported by a randomized controlled trial, and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. There is initial evidence supporting the use of poly-L-lactic acid and hyaluronic acid fillers, but evidence is still lacking about the use of polyacrylamide and polyalkylimide fillers.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^e13c3b50]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Acne vulgaris — endocrinologic evaluation is summarized as follows: Routine endocrinologic evaluation (eg, for androgen excess) is not recommended for the majority of patients with acne, whereas laboratory evaluation is recommended for patients who have acne and additional signs of androgen excess. While the role of androgens in acne pathogenesis is well known, endocrinologic evaluation is only warranted in certain cases, because most acne patients will have normal hormone levels, and testing is primarily indicated for patients with clinical features or a history of hyperandrogenism. In prepubertal children, these features include: acne, early-onset body odor, axillary or pubic hair, accelerated growth, advanced bone age, and genital maturation, and growth charts and a hand film for bone age are good screening tools before specific hormonal testing. In postpubertal females, clinical signs, such as infrequent menses, hirsutism, androgenic alopecia, infertility, polycystic ovaries, clitoromegaly, and truncal obesity warrant further hormonal testing, and recalcitrant acne caused by androgen excess can also be seen in both men and women with nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (eg, 21-hydroxylase deficiency). The most common cause of elevated androgens of ovarian origin is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and diagnosis of PCOS in adult females requires 2 of the 3 following criteria: androgen excess (clinical or biochemical), ovulatory dysfunction (oligo- or anovulation), or polycystic ovaries (based on ultrasonographic findings); in adolescent females, the diagnosis of PCOS can be made based on hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea. A typical hormone-screening panel includes free and total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone.

The MHRA licensed indication for isotretinoin is for severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne, or acne that is at risk of permanent scarring) that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy. The licence states that it should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. The MHRA has defined the groups of healthcare professionals who can take the role of Lead Prescriber in making the decision to initiate isotretinoin treatment following a face-to-face assessment with the patient.

Acne conglobate (severe nodular cystic acne) and acne fulminans (acne conglobate with systemic symptoms) require urgent specialist dermatology review and potentially earlier treatment with isotretinoin. Otherwise, it is first necessary to follow the stepwise management of acne recommended in the NICE guidance.

Isotretinoin is an effective treatment for severe acne. There are a number of known and potential adverse effects associated with treatment. Most people will experience dryness of the skin and lips, which can be helped by emollients and lip balm, and a flare in acne is common at the start of treatment. Both of these adverse effects are dose dependent. Blood abnormalities are reasonably common, but in healthy people are usually not serious.

Isotretinoin is highly teratogenic, and therefore, pregnancy must be avoided during treatment and for 1 month after stopping. All people with childbearing potential (people who may be able to become pregnant) must be entered into the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP).

### Botulinum toxin A in the management of acne vulgaris: evidence and recommendations [^2da0d595]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

There is sufficient evidence to indicate the need for further studies evaluating the effects of BTX-A on patients with acne vulgaris. These studies should be double-blinded randomized control trials, and use several doses of BTX-A, in order to elucidate therapeutic benefit, minimal viable dosing, and dose-response relations. If the treatment is found to be efficacious, it would be a safe and local management option to consider, particularly in those hoping to avoid treatment with the high-side-effect alternatives that currently form the foundation of acne management.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne [^570d4dcf]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions in children and adolescents. The presentation, differential diagnosis, and association of acne with systemic pathology differs by age of presentation. Current acknowledged guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pediatric acne are lacking, and there are variations in management across the spectrum of primary and specialty care. The American Acne and Rosacea Society convened a panel of pediatric dermatologists, pediatricians, and dermatologists with expertise in acne to develop recommendations for the management of pediatric acne and evidence-based treatment algorithms.

Methods

Ten major topic areas in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric acne were identified. A thorough literature search was performed and articles identified, reviewed, and assessed for evidence grading. Each topic area was assigned to 2 expert reviewers who developed and presented summaries and recommendations for critique and editing. Furthermore, the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, including ratings for the strength of recommendation for a body of evidence, was used throughout for the consensus recommendations for the evaluation and management of pediatric acne. Practical evidence-based treatment algorithms also were developed.

Results

Recommendations were put forth regarding the classification, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of pediatric acne, based on age and pubertal status. Treatment considerations include the use of over-the-counter products, topical benzoyl peroxide, topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Simplified treatment algorithms and recommendations are presented in detail for adolescent, preadolescent, infantile, and neonatal acne. Other considerations, including psychosocial effects of acne, adherence to treatment regimens, and the role of diet and acne, also are discussed.

Conclusions

These expert recommendations by the American Acne and Rosacea Society as reviewed and endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics constitute the first detailed, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of pediatric acne including issues of special concern when treating pediatric patients.

### Managing acne vulgaris: an update [^eb6be84e]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Early effective treatment for acne improves patient well-being and may prevent permanent scars or pigment changes. Initial management includes a range of topical treatments, with the option of adding oral antibiotics for patients with more severe acne. There are significant opportunities for reducing oral antibiotic prescribing in acne. These include: promoting effective use of topical treatments; avoiding prolonged courses of oral antibiotics; coprescribing topical treatments alongside oral antibiotics; continuing topical treatments as maintenance treatment and considering alternatives, such as the combined contraceptive pill and spironolactone in primary care. When acne is unresponsive to these measures, timely referral for consideration of isotretinoin should be initiated.

### Is there a place for biologics in acne? [^c6a2f816]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a multifactorial pathogenesis involving follicular hyperkeratinization, sebaceous gland dysregulation, microbial dysbiosis — particularly involving Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis — and complex immune-mediated mechanisms, on which T helper cell 1 (T h 1) and T h 17 pathways are central players. This evolving understanding has led to the exploration of biologic therapies targeting cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-17, and IL-23. However, clinical trials to date have not demonstrated efficacy of biologics in moderate to severe acne. In contrast, some case reports and studies suggest clinical improvement with TNFα and IL-17A inhibitors in severe, treatment-resistant acne, although these presentations often overlap with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), raising questions about diagnosis and underlying disease mechanisms. Furthermore, in various monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes where "acne-like" lesions are part of the clinical spectrum, biologic therapies have shown effectiveness. These observations suggest that in such contexts, the lesions may reflect HS or HS-like pathology rather than true acne, potentially explaining the therapeutic benefit of biologicals in this context. This review synthesizes current insights into the immunopathogenesis of acne and critically evaluates the rationale, evidence, and limitations of biologic therapy in its treatment. While biologics hold promise in defined inflammatory dermatoses, their role in the management of acne vulgaris remains unproven and may be limited to specific phenotypes that overlap with autoinflammatory or HS-related conditions.

Acne vulgaris can be easy to diagnose yet difficult to evaluate and manage, especially when it presents in infancy and childhood. The differential diagnosis of acne varies by age and, in some cases, may warrant a work-up in order to rule out underlying systemic abnormalities. Likewise, treatment strategies can be influenced by the patient's age. In this article, we present an overview of the clinical presentations of acne by age, an approach to patient evaluation, and a general strategy for management of this common and important disease.

Role of diet in acne — observational studies associate milk intake with acne. A cohort of girls found acne was associated with total milk intake, whole milk, low-fat milk, and skim milk, whereas a boys-only study found association with skim milk only. A Malaysian case control study involving 88 Malaysian subjects 18 to 30 years of age found that the frequency of milk and ice cream consumption was significantly higher in patients with acne compared to controls, and subjects who consumed milk or ice cream ≥ 1 time per week had a 4-fold increased risk of having acne with no association for cheese or yogurt. Also in 2012, another case control study involving 563 Italian subjects 10 to 24 years of age found increased risk with milk consumption, with the association more marked with skim milk and again no association with cheese or yogurt. Despite small preliminary studies of antioxidants (including oral zinc), probiotics, and fish oil, the existing evidence is not strong enough to support any recommendations regarding these dietary factors at this time.

AMNESTEEM (AM-NES-TEAM)

 (Isotretinoin Capsules, USP)

Read the Medication Guide that comes with Amnesteem before you start taking it and each time you get a prescription. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?

Amnesteem®is used to treat a type of severe acne (nodular acne) that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics.
Because Amnesteem can cause birth defects, Amnesteem is only for patients who can understand and agree to carry out all of the instructions in the iPLEDGE REMS.
Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems.

Birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby, and early (premature) births. Patients who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant must not take Amnesteem. Patients must not get pregnant:
for one month before starting Amnesteem
while taking Amnesteem
for one month after stopping Amnesteem.
If you get pregnant while taking Amnesteem, stop taking it right away and call your doctor. Doctors and patients should report all cases of pregnancy to:
FDA MedWatch at 1-800-FDA-1088, and
the iPLEDGE Pregnancy Registry at 1-866-495-0654
Serious mental health problems. Amnesteem may cause:
depression
psychosis (seeing or hearing things that are not real)
suicide. Some patients taking Amnesteem have had thoughts about hurting themselves or putting an end to their own lives (suicidal thoughts). Some people tried to end their own lives. And some people have ended their own lives.
Stop Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you or a family member notices that you have any of the following signs and symptoms of depression or psychosis:
start to feel sad or have crying spells
lose interest in activities you once enjoyed
sleep too much or have trouble sleeping

### The use of acneceuticals to improve acne care: introduction of a new term and review of the literature [^eccc8010]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory skin condition that commonly presents to the dermatology clinic. Treatment generally involves the use of pharmaceutical agents and procedural techniques. Recently, the importance of over-the-counter skin care in acne has been recognized in many studies. This paper introduces the term acneceuticals to encompass a wide range of FDA- monographed, yet non-prescription ingredients proven to alter the structure and function of acneic skin.

Methods

A panel of 8 dermatologists with an interest in acne and skin care performed a literature review of active skin care in acne. The role of acneceuticals in the treatment of acne - as monotherapy, adjunctive, and maintenance therapy - was evaluated using a modified Delphi approach. Studies were limited to in vivo human trials involving acne. Individual actives were assessed separately.

Results

The quality of evidence was moderate-to-low for many of the ingredients. Most of the actives included in the final assessment had been studied in vehicle-controlled, blinded, often comparative studies but enrolled a small number of subjects. In these studies, the acneceuticals were found to reduce lesion count, reduce sebum production, and improve efficacy of existing pharmacologic therapies.

Conclusion

Acneceuticals have demonstrated benefits in treating acne, alone or in conjunction with established pharmaceutical agents. These data allow us to make quality recommendations for our patients that should be a part of every patient encounter. The recommendations also serve as a guide for patients searching the internet for beneficial self-care products. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24(3):281–288. doi:10.36849/JDD.8817.

### Harnessing the anti-inflammatory effects of topical dapsone for management of acne [^c9bae610]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Data continue to establish the role of inflammation, not only in the pathogenesis of acne but also in the development of its most devastating sequelum, scarring. Although topical therapy is preferred by most acne patients and the physicians who treat them, historically no topical intervention has provided primarily anti-inflammatory effects. Topical dapsone 5% gel offers documented efficacy for the reduction of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions. It has been proven safe, presenting none of the hematologic risks associated with oral dapsone. Data suggest the vehicle formulation enhances healing and contributes to tolerability, making topical dapsone 5% gel a worthwhile anti-inflammatory treatment for many patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^d74e2f75]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The analyses presented here informed national guidance for the management of acne vulgaris in England, published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who worked with the British Association of Dermatologists for this purpose. The guideline was developed by a committee of academics, health professionals and service users with expertise and experience in acne vulgaris.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs of treatments for acne vulgaris were conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free‐text terms and study‐type filters where appropriate. The search was undertaken in August 2019 and reruns were performed in May 2020 (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).

Selection criteria for the systematic review and the network meta‐analysis

A systematic review of RCTs of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne vulgaris was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020154100) and is provided in full in Appendix S2 (see Supporting Information).

The review included people with acne vulgaris of all ages (except neonatal acne) and severity levels. Populations with postinflammatory dyspigmentation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), refractory acne or receiving maintenance treatment were excluded. Separate analyses were conducted for mild‐to‐moderate and moderate‐to‐severe acne. Reported severity levels in each study were used for study categorization into mild‐to‐moderate or moderate‐to‐severe acne. Based on the committee's expert advice, if severity was unclear or reported as 'moderate', the study was categorized as mild‐to‐moderate acne if each participant had only noninflammatory lesions, or < 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≤ 30, whereas the study was categorized as moderate‐to‐severe acne if each participant had ≥ 3 nodules (regardless of the number of other inflammatory lesions), or ≥ 35 inflammatory lesions, or if the average number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was ≥ 40. If this information could not be obtained or the mean number of inflammatory lesions per study participant was 31–39, the study was excluded from the review.

### Toward evidence-based practice in acne: consensus of an Asian working group [^7c96c2dc]. The Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is common throughout the world and often perceived by both patients and clinicians as an inconsequential disease of adolescence. In reality, however, acne is a chronic medical disease that lasts for years and causes a considerable impact on quality of life. Many patients with acne experience emotional problems due to their disease, which can lead to reduced social interactions and even a lower likelihood of employment. Little has been written specifically about acne in Asian patients in the English-language medical published work, perhaps due to an assumption that the management of acne is the same in all populations. A group of acne experts from nine Asian countries and the USA met to review and discuss acne care within the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on evidence-based medicine. This group developed a care algorithm using results of clinical trials as well as knowledge of practice patterns.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^9faefce5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common disease among people in Asia. International guidelines and treatment recommendations emphasize the central role of topical retinoids in the management of acne. However, topical retinoids remain underutilized in clinical practise, which may be in part due to fear of retinoid-associated dermatitis/lack of experience, particularly in Asian patients. There is a perception that Asian skin has a greater tendency toward sensitivity compared with Caucasian skin. In our clinical experience, topical retinoid therapy can be used with excellent effect to treat Asians with acne. This article discusses available published work regarding the use of topical retinoids in Asian populations, and presents tips for utilizing these important agents in daily practise. Optimizing use of topical retinoids may improve adherence and, in turn, therapeutic outcomes and patient satisfaction.

Miscellaneous therapies and physical modalities — evidence and opinions are summarized as follows: There is limited evidence to recommend the use and benefit of physical modalities for the routine treatment of acne, including pulsed dye laser, glycolic acid peels, and salicylic acid peels, whereas intralesional corticosteroid injections are effective in the treatment of individual acne nodules. There is limited evidence published that addresses the efficacy of comedo removal for the treatment of acne, but the work group states comedo removal is often helpful when comedones are resistant to other therapies. Studies suggest that chemical peels may improve acne, though large, multicenter, double-blinded control trials comparing peels to placebo and comparing different peels are lacking; glycolic acid and salicylic acid chemical peels may be helpful for noninflammatory (comedonal) lesions, but multiple treatments are needed and the results are not long-lasting. Some laser and light devices may be beneficial for acne, but additional studies are needed, with evaluated options including pulsed dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, fractionated and nonfractionated infrared lasers, the fractionated CO2 laser, and nonlaser light devices such as radiofrequency, intense pulsed light, photopneumatic therapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

### Current issues in the treatment of acne vulgaris [^eccddaf5]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is an extraordinarily common skin condition in adolescents. The mainstays of acne treatment have remained largely unchanged over recent years. In the context of increasing antibiotic resistance worldwide, there is a global movement away from antibiotic monotherapy toward their more restrictive use. Classically reserved for nodulocystic acne, isotretinoin has become the drug of choice by dermatologists for moderate to severe acne. Given the virtually ubiquitous nature of acne in teenagers, there remains an appreciable need for novel therapies. In this article, we will cover the currently used acne treatments, evaluate the issues and data supporting their use, explore the issues of compliance and the mental health implications of acne care, and recommend directions for the field of acne management in adolescents in the years ahead.

### Importance of vehicles in acne therapy [^ed0ebba7]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topiucal drug therapy is an intuitively sound approach to the management of skin diseases. Depositing medication at the site of disease involvement is potentially effective and reduces systemic exposure. Topical drugs are absorbed usually by passive diffusion. In clinical practice, the choice of an optimized formulation that will be effective and well tolerated is essential. Data confirm that patient adherence with therapy leads to better outcomes and lower long-term treatment costs, while poor adherence is directly linked to poor treatment outcomes and patient dissatisfaction. Local cutaneous irritation, which may be linked to components of the formulation and/or to the active drug itself, is a common cause of non-adherence. Well-designed drugs are important in the management of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea. Formulators have sought to improve treatment efficacy and tolerability by several different techniques, such as delayed release of the active drug, fixed combinations of two different molecules, or incorporating ingredients into the formulation vehicle that improve epidermal barrier function and offset the irritating effects of the active drugs.

### What's new in acne? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2009–2010 [^80cf4939]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

This review highlights clinically important findings about acne treatment identified in nine systematic reviews published or indexed in the period March 2009 to February 2010. A systematic review of dietary influences on acne suggested that a possible role of dietary factors in acne cannot be dismissed, as the studies to date have not been sufficiently large or robust. Another review looked at benzoyl peroxide, which may be enjoying a comeback because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, and suggested that there was a lack of evidence that stronger preparations were more effective than weaker ones. The same team also carried out a systematic review addressing the question of whether topical retinoids cause an initial worsening of acne. They found no evidence to suggest initial worsening of acne severity, although there was evidence of skin irritation that typically settled by 8–12 weeks. A review of oral isotretinoin and psychiatric side-effects reinforced a possible link between the two, although it pointed out that the better-quality primary studies were still inconclusive. An updated Cochrane Review confirmed the efficacy of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) in reducing acne lesion counts. It also found that the evidence to support COCs containing cyproterone acetate over others was very limited. Another Cochrane Review failed to show any benefit of spironolactone for acne, based on limited studies. Three reviews examined laser and light therapies, and found some evidence of superiority only for blue or blue/red light treatment over placebo light, but a general absence of comparisons against other acne treatments. Photodynamic therapy had consistent benefits over placebo but was associated with significant side-effects and was not shown to be better than topical adapalene.

### Recommendations for using over-the-counter products as adjunctive acne care in Asian phototypes: improving treatment outcomes and managing side effects [^ae407b2e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common inflammatory skin disorder prevalent among all ethnic groups. This review aimed to investigate the current literature regarding the potential benefit of over-the-counter (OTC) adjuncts (eg, moisturizers, cleansers) for acne patients focusing on Asian phenotypes.

Methods

An online procedure was employed to review the role of adjunctive OTC acne treatment. A panel consisting of dermatologists with expertise in treating Asian acne patients participated in a pre-meeting survey that collected information regarding their recommendation habits for OTC products in acne patients. Recommendations on using OTC products as an adjunct for treating acne in Asians are based on the pre-meeting survey results, evidence from literature presented during a series of plenary lectures, and discussions conducted during a stepwise program of sessions.

Results

Many topical treatments have been associated with adverse events (AEs) (eg, skin dryness, erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, pruritus). Multiple studies on topical acne treatments have found that Asians display greater sensitivity and less tolerability than Caucasians to acne treatment. Skincare as an adjunct to acne treatment may reduce dryness or irritation, particularly important in Asians with acne.

Conclusions

Advisors agreed that cleansers and moisturizers should be considered for their beneficial adjunctive role in the armamentarium of acne treatment and maintenance strategies. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(11): 1213–1221. doi:10.36849/JDD.6259.

Acne vulgaris — combined oral contraceptives (COCs) approved options and efficacy are summarized as follows: There are currently 4 COCs approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne — ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone acetate/ferrous fumarate, ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone, and ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone/levomefolate; the mechanism of action is antiandrogenic and trials show COCs reduce acne, including inflammatory and comedonal lesion counts. A 2012 Cochrane metaanalysis included 31 trials with a total of 12,579 women; Nine trials compared a COC to placebo and all reduced acne; Seventeen trials compared 2 COCs with no consistent differences; and Only 1 small study versus an oral antibiotic found no significant difference in self-assessed improvement.

### Optimizing the use of topical retinoids in Asian acne patients [^fe0e4e9e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Acne vulgaris is a common disease among people in Asia. International guidelines and treatment recommendations emphasize the central role of topical retinoids in the management of acne. However, topical retinoids remain underutilized in clinical practise, which may be in part due to fear of retinoid‐associated dermatitis/lack of experience, particularly in Asian patients. There is a perception that Asian skin has a greater tendency toward sensitivity compared with Caucasian skin. In our clinical experience, topical retinoid therapy can be used with excellent effect to treat Asians with acne. This article discusses available published work regarding the use of topical retinoids in Asian populations, and presents tips for utilizing these important agents in daily practise. Optimizing use of topical retinoids may improve adherence and, in turn, therapeutic outcomes and patient satisfaction.
