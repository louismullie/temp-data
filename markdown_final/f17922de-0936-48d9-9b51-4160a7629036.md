## Question

How does famotidine compare with omeprazole?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how famotidine compares with omeprazole across indications, efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and guideline positioning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms and what that implies for acid suppression. Then, I should verify guideline-based efficacy for GERD phenotypes, especially erosive esophagitis versus endoscopy-negative disease. Next, I will review safety profiles and drug–drug interactions, followed by pharmacokinetics and practical dosing considerations. After that, I need to consider special populations, including renal and hepatic impairment, and examine deprescribing and step-down strategies. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical takeaways and note any caveats where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation, because that drives clinical performance; famotidine is a reversible H2 receptor antagonist reducing histamine-mediated acid output and subject to pharmacologic tolerance, whereas omeprazole irreversibly inhibits the parietal cell H+/K+ ATPase, suppressing the final common pathway and avoiding tolerance, which should translate into more potent and sustained acid suppression for PPI therapy compared with H2RA therapy [^112DKKdV].

> I should confirm guideline direction for erosive esophagitis; the ACG guideline explicitly recommends PPIs, not H2RAs, for healing erosive esophagitis and suggests an 8-week, once-daily, pre-meal PPI trial for typical GERD symptoms without alarms, so omeprazole is the evidence-based first-line here, even though high-dose famotidine has shown healing in trials, because H2RAs underperform for mucosal healing relative to PPIs in this phenotype [^117MHSEa] [^1128iSbs].

> Wait, let me verify symptom control in endoscopy-negative GERD; the FDA label shows famotidine 20 mg twice daily improves symptoms versus placebo by two weeks, but network meta-analyses and Cochrane-type syntheses consistently demonstrate PPIs outperform H2RAs for complete or adequate heartburn relief in endoscopy-negative disease, with omeprazole 20 mg ranking among the most efficacious regimens, so clinically I would expect omeprazole to provide superior symptom relief on average [^116soj3y] [^111BGAk9] [^1144pKgT].

> Hold on, I should verify peptic ulcer disease and H pylori contexts; limited comparative data suggest similar short-term ulcer healing with famotidine or omeprazole in specific procedural ulcer settings, but for secondary prevention under aspirin exposure, pantoprazole outperformed high-dose famotidine in preventing recurrent ulcers or erosions, and for H pylori triple therapy, eradication rates are broadly comparable when substituting an H2RA for a PPI, although contemporary North American regimens preferentially use PPIs as the acid suppression backbone rather than H2RAs [^115suX6q] [^115f8Xos] [^1118T5yu].

> Next, I should review stress ulcer prophylaxis nuances; famotidine is well-established for SUP at 20 mg twice daily orally or intravenously in many protocols, and limited ICU data suggest early pH targets may be met as well or better initially with famotidine versus a comparator PPI formulation, though clinical bleeding outcomes are similar over short observation and institutional practices vary, so I need to avoid overgeneralizing that one class is universally superior for SUP outside of specific high-risk cohorts and protocolized care [^112w6p8s] [^115NNufe].

> I will now examine safety and drug–drug interactions; famotidine is generally well tolerated but carries clinically relevant CNS toxicity risk in older adults and in renal impairment due to prolonged half-life, which mandates dose adjustment and vigilance, whereas omeprazole is broadly safe but has a higher propensity for CYP2C19- and CYP3A4-mediated interactions and theoretical long-term risks that are likely small in absolute terms when appropriately indicated, and regarding clopidogrel, results are mixed with one crossover trial suggesting higher high on-treatment platelet reactivity with omeprazole versus pantoprazole or famotidine, while another randomized trial found no significant difference when comparing esomeprazole to famotidine, so if antiplatelet interaction is a concern, I should prefer minimizing CYP2C19 inhibition or choose an H2RA when clinically acceptable [^116Ecnxw] [^111sYUjT] [^111eiR5s] [^1161VuS7] [^114TLBDk] [^116qZE6A] [^111ofaxZ].

> Let me consider pharmacokinetics and administration because these affect real-world outcomes; famotidine has 40–45% bioavailability, short half-life, and predominantly renal elimination necessitating dose adjustments as renal function declines, whereas omeprazole exerts a prolonged pharmacodynamic effect despite a short plasma half-life, is best dosed 30–60 minutes before a meal, and displays potency advantages when used twice daily rather than increasing the once-daily dose, with immediate-release formulations offering somewhat more flexible timing in some studies, all of which favor omeprazole for convenience and sustained acid control in typical GERD [^115sZE6S] [^112pCfNg] [^112DKKdV] [^113w7isN] [^112DKKdV].

> But wait, what about special populations; in renal impairment I should double-check dosing because famotidine's half-life can exceed 20 hours when creatinine clearance is less than 10 mL/min and dose reductions are required, while omeprazole generally requires no renal adjustment, in hepatic impairment famotidine is acceptable without dose change and may be preferred if hepatic metabolism is a concern, in older adults I must screen for renal function to mitigate famotidine CNS toxicity, and for pregnancy I almost said "famotidine category B and omeprazole category C", but hmm, wait a minute, the FDA's pregnancy categories are obsolete under the PLLR and I should not rely on letter categories; both agents have been used in pregnancy when clinically indicated, though guidelines highlight sucralfate as a preferred option in pregnancy, so I need to individualize and avoid categorical overstatements here [^115sZE6S] [^113UdaDu] [^111eiR5s] [^117MHSEa].

> I need to check optimization and deprescribing guidance to balance benefit and risk; best practice is to use PPIs at the lowest effective dose and regularly reassess the indication, with de-escalation to on-demand therapy or to an H2RA as appropriate once symptoms are controlled, which supports a strategy of initiating omeprazole for induction and then considering step-down to famotidine in responders who no longer require continuous high-potency suppression, while maintaining a plan for long-term management if GERD is confirmed [^115VgCy6] [^112xR2qe] [^113AnTt4].

> Hold on, I should verify nocturnal symptom management; in selected patients with persistent nocturnal acid breakthrough on a PPI, adding bedtime famotidine can reduce nocturnal acidity across CYP2C19 phenotypes, though this is an adjunctive tactic rather than a replacement for optimized PPI timing and dose, and tolerance with prolonged H2RA use may attenuate benefit, so this should be used thoughtfully and reassessed [^1143XnKR] [^112DKKdV].

> Putting this together, omeprazole is preferred for healing and symptom control in erosive and non-erosive GERD, for aspirin-related ulcer prevention, and for H pylori regimens by contemporary practice, whereas famotidine remains useful for on-demand symptom relief, maintenance or step-down therapy, stress ulcer prophylaxis protocols, and in scenarios prioritizing minimal CYP interactions or hepatic impairment, with renal function dictating famotidine dosing and CNS vigilance in older adults, which aligns with guideline-based care and pharmacologic plausibility [^117MHSEa] [^1128iSbs] [^115f8Xos] [^112w6p8s] [^1161VuS7] [^115sZE6S].

---

Omeprazole provides **stronger acid suppression** [^112DKKdV] and is preferred for GERD [^1128iSbs], erosive esophagitis [^117MHSEa], and H. pylori regimens [^112Ya1v5]. Famotidine is best for **rapid symptom relief** [^116soj3y] or short-term use, especially when PPIs are contraindicated or for on-demand therapy [^112xR2qe]. Omeprazole has **more drug interactions** [^1161VuS7] and long-term risks (e.g. fractures, infections) [^115VgCy6], whereas famotidine has fewer interactions and is safer for long-term use. Choose therapy based on indication, duration, and patient risk profile.

---

## Mechanism of action

Famotidine is an H2RA that **blocks histamine H2 receptors on parietal cells**, reducing acid secretion [^112DKKdV]; its onset is rapid (within 1 hour) [^115sZE6S] but it is less potent than PPIs [^116wxLyh]. Omeprazole is a PPI that **irreversibly inhibits H+/K+ ATPase** [^112DKKdV], providing stronger, longer-lasting acid suppression [^116wxLyh]; onset is slower (hours) but the duration is longer [^112DKKdV].

---

## Clinical efficacy

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

In GERD, **Omeprazole** is superior for symptom control [^112Ucp9A] and healing, especially in erosive esophagitis; guidelines recommend an 8-week, once-daily PPI trial [^1128iSbs] before meals [^112pCfNg]. Famotidine is effective for **mild disease or on-demand use** but is less effective for healing erosive esophagitis [^117MHSEa].

---

### Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

In peptic ulcer disease, **Omeprazole** is more effective for healing and preventing recurrence [^114oVcxn], including NSAID-related ulcers [^115f8Xos]. Famotidine is effective for **short-term ulcer healing** [^115PufNV] but less effective for preventing recurrence [^115f8Xos].

---

### Helicobacter pylori eradication

In Helicobacter pylori eradication, **Omeprazole** is integral to standard triple/quadruple regimens [^112Ya1v5] and achieves superior eradication rates. Famotidine is **less effective** in eradication regimens.

---

## Safety and adverse effects

### Short-term use

For short-term use, **Famotidine** is generally well tolerated, with common effects including headache, dizziness, constipation, and diarrhea [^111sYUjT]. Omeprazole is also generally **well tolerated**, with common effects including headache, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [^111ofaxZ].

---

### Long-term use

For long-term use, **Famotidine** has minimal long-term risks; rare CNS effects can occur in elderly patients or those with renal impairment. Omeprazole is associated with **fractures, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, C. difficile infection, and pneumonia** [^1161VuS7].

---

## Drug interactions

Famotidine has **minimal interactions** and does not significantly affect CYP enzymes. Omeprazole has **significant interactions via CYP2C19 inhibition** (e.g. clopidogrel, warfarin, diazepam) [^114TLBDk] [^1161VuS7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Condition** | **Preferred therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| GERD (erosive) | Omeprazole | Superior healing and symptom control [^1128iSbs] |
| GERD (mild, on-demand) | Famotidine | - Rapid relief <br/> - Fewer long-term risks [^112xR2qe] |
| Peptic ulcer disease | Omeprazole | Superior healing and prevention [^114oVcxn] |
| H. pylori eradication | Omeprazole | Integral to standard regimens [^116Q36Ad] |
| Short-term symptom relief | Famotidine | - Rapid onset [^116soj3y] <br/> - Minimal interactions [^116Ecnxw] |
| Long-term therapy | Omeprazole (lowest effective dose) | - Superior efficacy <br/> - Monitor for adverse effects [^113AnTt4] |

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Famotidine preferred due to fewer interactions and lower long-term risks.

- **Patients on multiple medications**: Famotidine preferred due to minimal interactions [^1161VuS7].

- **Patients requiring rapid relief**: Famotidine preferred for rapid onset [^115sZE6S].

- **Patients requiring long-term therapy**: Omeprazole preferred; use lowest effective dose and monitor for adverse effects [^113AnTt4].

---

## Cost and availability

Both are available OTC and by prescription, and **famotidine is generally less expensive**.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Famotidine** | **Omeprazole** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | H2RA | PPI |
| Onset | Rapid (≤ 1 hour) | Slower (hours) |
| Duration | Shorter | Longer |
| Efficacy | Moderate | High |
| Long-term safety | Minimal risks | - Fractures <br/> - Infections <br/> - Deficiencies |
| Drug interactions | Minimal | Significant (CYP2C19) |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |

---

Famotidine and omeprazole are both effective acid suppressants, but **omeprazole is preferred for GERD, erosive esophagitis, and H. pylori regimens** due to stronger, longer-lasting suppression [^1128iSbs] [^112Ya1v5] [^116wxLyh]. Famotidine is suitable for rapid relief, short-term use, or when PPIs are contraindicated, with fewer interactions and lower long-term risks [^1161VuS7].

### Famotidine [^116soj3y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo in a U.S. study that enrolled patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and without endoscopic evidence of erosion or ulceration of the esophagus. Famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. was statistically significantly superior to 40 mg h.s. and to placebo in providing a successful symptomatic outcome, defined as moderate or excellent improvement of symptoms.

By two weeks of treatment, symptomatic success was observed in a greater percentage of patients taking famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. compared to placebo (p ≤ 0.01). Symptomatic improvement and healing of endoscopically verified erosion and ulceration were studied in two additional trials. Healing was defined as complete resolution of all erosions or ulcerations visible with endoscopy. The U.S. study comparing famotidine 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. to placebo and famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., showed a significantly greater percentage of healing for famotidine 40 mg b.i.d. at weeks 6 and 12 (p ≤ 0.01 vs placebo, p ≤ 0.05 vs famotidine 20 mg b.i.d., p ≤ 0.01 vs famotidine 20 mg b.i.d.).

As compared to placebo, patients who received famotidine had faster relief of daytime and nighttime heartburn, and a greater percentage of patients experienced complete relief of nighttime heartburn. These differences were statistically significant. In the international study, when famotidine 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. was compared to ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., a statistically significantly greater percentage of healing was observed with famotidine 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - a position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^112Ya1v5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

- **Summary of the evidence**: PPI therapy in both uninvestigated and functional dyspepsia (FD) is widespread. Indeed, these drugs represent a key component of all the currently employed H. pylori eradication regimens. The search for and eradication of the infection is the first-line therapy in the young dyspeptic patient without alarm symptoms. In those patients with persisting symptoms despite successful eradication or naïve-uninfected patients with epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), short-term 4–8 week PPI treatment should be attempted. Finally, PPI co-therapy is indicated in patients with NSAID-associated dyspepsia, also with the aim of preventing GI events.

Dyspepsia is a common GI condition seen in clinical practice. It is not a single disease but rather a complex of symptoms referable to the upper GI tract that often overlaps with other disease entities. In front of a patient with dyspeptic complaints, physicians should carefully evaluate the history and perform a physical examination to assume that symptoms arise from the upper GI tract. If the patient is young (< 45 years), and there are no alarm symptoms, endoscopy and/or functional investigations are usually not performed; the condition is labeled as "uninvestigated" dyspepsia, and treatment is empirical. On the contrary, if endoscopy does reveal a structural abnormality, management of dyspepsia relies on the treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. PU, reflux esophagitis, or malignancy). When endoscopy is negative (which is the case in more than 70% of patients with dyspeptic symptoms), FD could be considered.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in the tables referenced.

- **Digestive system concerns**: Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs, and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly alter their pharmacokinetics. PPIs influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) and with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance.

- **Extra-digestive effects**: A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) has a considerable potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to its high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. Thus, DDIs represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics). Additionally, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects who are extensive metabolizers.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^115VgCy6]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the world. Developed for the treatment and prevention of acid-mediated upper gastrointestinal conditions, these agents are being used increasingly for indications where their benefits are less certain. PPI overprescription imposes an economic cost and contributes to polypharmacy. In addition, PPI use has been increasingly linked to a number of adverse events (PPI-associated adverse events [PAAEs]). Therefore, de-prescribing of PPIs is an important strategy to lower pill burden while reducing real costs and theoretical risks. The purpose of this clinical update was to provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements about how to approach PPI de-prescribing in ambulatory patients.

- **Methods**: Our guiding principle was that, although PPIs are generally safe, patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit based on scientific evidence or prior treatment response. Prescribers are responsible for determining whether PPI use is absolutely or conditionally indicated and, when uncertainty exists, to incorporate patient perspectives into PPI decision-making. We collaboratively outlined a high-level "process map" of the conceptual approach to de-prescribing PPIs in a clinical setting. We identified the following three key domains that required BPA guidance: documentation of PPI indication; identifying suitable candidates for consideration of de-prescribing; and optimizing successful de-prescribing. Co-authors drafted one or more potential BPAs, supported by lite…

### Choosing wisely: Recommendations of the American Gastroenterological Association [^114vcG6S]. Choosing Wisely (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), specifically in relation to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the AGA 2012 guidelines recommend titrating long-term acid suppression therapy with PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) to the lowest effective dose needed to achieve therapeutic goals for the pharmacological treatment of patients with GERD.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^115fXd7s]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for their remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are many valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications.

Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need the flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then can one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

### Effect of esomeprazole versus famotidine on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel: a double-blind, randomized trial [^116qZE6A]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Previous studies showed that esomeprazole does not interfere significantly with the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, interacts with clopidogrel. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the influence of esomeprazole and famotidine on the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel.

- **Methods**: Patients with acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary interventions treated with aspirin and clopidogrel cotherapy were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or famotidine 40 mg daily. Platelet reactivity units (PRUs) were measured at baseline and on day 28. The primary analysis involved the PRU values on day 28.

- **Results**: There were 44 patients in the esomeprazole group and 44 in the famotidine group. The baseline PRUs of the two groups were comparable (esomeprazole vs. famotidine, 229.1 ± 85.6 vs. 220.4 ± 83.0, P = 0.63). The PRUs on day 28 were 242.6 ± 89.7 and 237.5 ± 79.2 in the groups receiving esomeprazole and famotidine, respectively (mean difference 5.1, 95% CI -30.8 to 41.0, P = 0.78).

- **Conclusions**: The platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was not significantly different between patients receiving esomeprazole and those receiving famotidine. Neither esomeprazole nor famotidine reduced the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01062516).

### Famotidine [^117D3Wmp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, intractable ulcers, or those unable to take oral medication, famotidine injection may be administered until oral therapy can be instituted. The recommended dosage for famotidine injection in adult patients is 20 mg intravenously every 12 hours. However, the doses and regimen for parenteral administration in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have not been established.

- **Dosage for pediatric patients < 1 year of age**:
	- The studies described in the precautions section for pediatric patients under 1 year suggest the following starting doses for GERD: 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension once daily in patients under 3 months of age, and 0.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily for patients 3 months to under 1 year of age. Patients should also receive conservative measures, such as thickened feedings. The use of intravenous famotidine in pediatric patients under 1 year with GERD has not been adequately studied.

- **Dosage for pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age**:
	- According to studies in the precautions section for pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age, the starting dose is 0.25 mg/kg intravenously, either injected over not less than two minutes or as a 15-minute infusion, every 12 hours, up to a maximum of 40 mg per day.

### Prospective, randomized comparison of lansoprazole suspension, and intermittent intravenous famotidine on gastric pH and acid production in critically ill neurosurgical patients [^115NNufe]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of studies comparing stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) agents in high-risk neurosurgical patients. In this prospective, randomized study, critically ill neurosurgical patients received either lansoprazole 30 mg suspension via NG/NJ tube daily or famotidine 20 mg IV every 12 hours for SUP. Gastric pH and residual volumes were recorded for 3 days, and adverse events were monitored for 7 days after admission.

There were 51 patients randomized to lansoprazole (n = 28) or famotidine (n = 23) who received SUP for at least 3 days. All patients had at least two risk factors for SRMD, and 75% had a baseline GCS of less than 9. On day 1 of therapy, more famotidine patients had a gastric pH of 4 or higher at least 80% of the time compared to lansoprazole patients (74% vs. 36%, P = 0.01, respectively); however, there was no difference on days 2 and 3. Enteral feedings on day 1 predicted a pH of 4 or higher (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the percentages of time that gastric residual volumes were less than 28 mL (P = NS). Heme-positive aspirates were present in 18–39% of patients (P = NS); one patient receiving famotidine met the criteria for overt bleeding. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17% of the famotidine group and 4% in the lansoprazole group (P = NS).

Neurosurgery ICU patients receiving famotidine for SUP achieved a gastric pH of 4 or higher more often than lansoprazole-treated patients, but only on day 1 of the 3-day study period. Both agents were equally effective in reducing gastric acid production. There was no difference in the incidence of mucosal damage and thrombocytopenia.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111Fx7bN]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used to manage GERD due to their powerful inhibition of gastric acid secretion. However, there are controversies regarding their efficacy in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease. A previous systematic review demonstrated that the rate of therapeutic response to PPIs after 4 weeks of treatment was lower in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease compared to those with EE, by a factor of about 20%. Nevertheless, a Cochrane review demonstrated the superiority of PPI therapy in terms of relief of heartburn in endoscopy-negative reflux disease compared with histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or prokinetics. More recently, the novel drug class of potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) has been compared with other acid-suppressive treatments in endoscopy-negative reflux disease, although with conflicting results. Alginate-based therapy, with its raft-forming properties, may also be beneficial in GERD, as demonstrated by various studies. In patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease, evidence suggests that alginates improve symptoms either as monotherapy or when combined with PPIs as add-on therapy.

There are, however, considerable uncertainties in terms of the choice of drug to treat patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease, compounded by the fact that most studies of drug therapy for GERD have focused their attention on patients with EE.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116FQzoF]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Although endoscopy-negative reflux disease represents the most common phenotypic presentation of GERD, less is known about the efficacy of the different available drugs in patients with this condition compared with EE. In addition, in the last 15 years, it has become clear that patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease are markedly heterogeneous from a pathological and clinical point of view and should be further subclassified by means of pH-impedance testing. This technique is able to detect any kind of chemical reflux and has enabled such patients to be divided into several subgroups on the basis of their reflux patterns, including those with reflux hypersensitivity or functional heartburn, whose symptoms may be less responsive to acid-suppressive treatments. This should be incorporated into the design of future therapeutic trials in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease.

Despite the limitations discussed, which relate to the included and available trials, we believe our network meta-analysis is the first to report efficacy and safety of PPIs, H2 RAs, PCABs, and alginates compared with each other or with placebo in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease. Our results confirm the superiority of PPIs, as a class, compared with other drugs in treating endoscopy-negative reflux disease. However, it must be noted that generic formulations of PPIs may have reduced drug absorption and efficacy due to intragastric degradation of the active ingredient, compared with branded PPI formulations. Nevertheless, the majority of RCTs did not report whether they.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1138JWLD]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Another systematic review with meta‐analysis evaluated the efficacy of PPIs (10 trials), H2RAs (five trials), and prokinetics (one trial) for both complete and adequate heartburn relief in patients with endoscopy‐negative reflux disease. Similar to our results, the authors concluded that PPIs were more efficacious than H2RAs in terms of complete and adequate heartburn relief. Moreover, they demonstrated that PPIs were more efficacious than cisapride. As international guidelines do not recommend prokinetics as monotherapy or add‐on therapy for routine GERD management, we did not include trials on prokinetics in our network. Most of these prior meta‐analyses included patients with endoscopy‐negative reflux disease diagnosed according to a negative upper endoscopy and typical GERD symptoms.

Our network meta‐analysis provides updated evidence on PPIs and H2RAs for endoscopy‐negative reflux disease, as well as data for PCABs and alginates, whose efficacy and safety in endoscopy‐negative reflux disease had not been examined in previous meta‐analyses. Regarding PCABs, at the time of writing, only tegoprazan has been approved for endoscopy‐negative reflux disease in South Korea. Four weeks of tegoprazan 50 mg and 100 mg have been demonstrated to be more efficacious than placebo in achieving complete resolution of both heartburn and regurgitation. Conversely, vonoprazan showed variable results in this patient group. Our results, although based on only three trials, demonstrated that tegoprazan 100 mg o.d. was only just superior to placebo for achieving complete relief between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks.

### Effects of omeprazole and famotidine on fibroblast growth factor-2 during artificial gastric ulcer healing in humans [^115suX6q]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Endoscopic mucosal resection is a widely accepted technique for the treatment of early gastric cancers. However, large ulcers induced by the treatment should be treated promptly. This study aimed to compare the effects of omeprazole and famotidine on ulcer healing and fibroblast growth factor-2 levels in gastric ulcers induced by endoscopic mucosal resection.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients indicated for endoscopic mucosal resection were enrolled in the study. They were treated with either omeprazole (n = 8) or famotidine (n = 8) following endoscopic mucosal resection. Endoscopy was performed on days 4, 7, and 28 during each treatment period. Levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 in biopsy specimens were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at the time of and after endoscopic mucosal resection. Histological variables were also assessed.

- **Results**: Ulcer healing rates observed under endoscopy showed no difference between the two treatment groups. In both groups, levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 slightly increased on day 4; however, the values were not different at any time point. There were no differences in histological variables on days 4 and 7, but fibromuscular hyperplasia was significantly greater in the omeprazole group than in the famotidine group on day 28 (P < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Omeprazole and famotidine have equivalent value for the treatment of ulcers induced by endoscopic mucosal resection. Although omeprazole had a more potent effect on fibromuscular hyperplasia than famotidine, such a difference does not seem to be explained by fibroblast growth factor-2 levels.

### Double-blind randomized trials of single-tablet ibuprofen/high-dose famotidine vs. ibuprofen alone for reduction of gastric and duodenal ulcers [^116AKUSN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The two different primary endpoints in the individual studies were chosen to address the more clinically relevant endpoint of upper GI ulcers (gastric and/or duodenal) and the traditional US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) endpoint of gastric ulcers. In clinical practice, physicians and patients are concerned about preventing ulcers, whether they are gastric or duodenal, and many clinical trials use this primary endpoint. However, the FDA generally approves antisecretory medications for the prevention of gastric ulcers (e.g. lansoprazole and esomeprazole). These two trials were designed for registration, and in pretrial meetings, the FDA agreed to the use of the different endpoints in the two trials.

Comparison between treatment arms of the crude proportions of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test stratified by the two randomization risk factor strata (use of low-dose aspirin and other anticoagulants, prior ulcer history) was specified as the primary statistical analysis at the time of sample size calculation and study initiation. Before study termination and unblinding, the primary analysis was changed to a comparison between treatment arms of the life table estimates of the proportion of patients with ulcers at 24 weeks, employing a modified χ² using the sum of squares from the life table in the error term, with the comparison of crude proportions using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test maintained as a secondary analysis. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) and absolute risk reductions were calculated using crude proportions.

### Short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists and prokinetics for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease-like symptoms and endoscopy negative reflux disease [^1159DgQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Heartburn affects 25% of the adult population on a monthly basis and represents the core symptom of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Treatment is readily available and puts a large demand on healthcare budgets. A majority of GORD patients show no endoscopic abnormalities, and in daily practice, most patients are treated empirically.

- **Objectives**: Summarise, quantify and compare the efficacy of the short-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), and prokinetics in adults with GORD and endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD).

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2003), and EMBASE (January 1988 to December 2003).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials focussing on symptomatic outcomes after short-term treatment for GORD using proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, or prokinetic agents. Participants had to be classifiable in the empirical treatment group (no endoscopy used in treatment allocation) or in the endoscopy negative reflux disease group (no endoscopic signs of erosive oesophagitis).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-seven trials (8402 participants) were included: thirteen in the empirical treatment group, ten in the ENRD group, and four in both. In empirical treatment of GORD, the relative risk (RR) for heartburn remission in placebo-controlled trials for PPI was 0.37 (two trials, 95% confidence interval).

### Anaphylaxis to omeprazole: Diagnosis and desensitization protocol [^111gfqQE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Omeprazole is an inhibitor of the parietal cell enzyme H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase. Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, and hypotension, induced by omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors are rare.

- **Objectives**: To confirm the immediate-type mechanism of anaphylactic reactions to the repeated administration of omeprazole using skin testing, and to enable safe administration of the drug after successful oral desensitization.

- **Methods**: Intradermal skin tests were performed with omeprazole (0.04 and 0.4 mg/mL) prepared from the oral and intravenous commercial preparations and with pantoprazole (0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL) prepared from the oral commercial preparation. Skin tests were repeated after completion of the desensitization. Oral desensitization was applied at a starting dose of 0.001 mg of omeprazole, and a full dose of 16 mg was achieved after 5.6 hours, resulting in a cumulative dose of 32.6 mg.

- **Results**: Intradermal skin test results were positive to omeprazole and pantoprazole at all tested concentrations. After successful desensitization, omeprazole was administered in the full dose uneventfully. The wheal size of the intradermal skin tests performed after completion of the desensitization was significantly reduced.

- **Conclusion**: When indicated, this newly designed desensitization protocol may be used in patients with omeprazole-induced anaphylaxis.

### Interchangeable use of proton pump inhibitors based on relative potency [^116wxLyh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used, their relative potency and ideal dosing regimens remain unclear. We analyzed data from randomized clinical trials that performed pH testing in patients receiving solid-dose PPI formulations (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole) for a minimum of five days. Omeprazole equivalency and the surrogate biomarker, percentage time with pH > 4 over a 24-hour period (pH4time), were used to compare PPI effectiveness for different PPIs given once, twice, or three times daily.

We found that increasing the strength of once-daily PPIs (9–64 mg omeprazole equivalents) increased pH4time linearly from approximately 10.0 to 15.6 hours; however, higher doses produced no further increase in pH4time. Increasing the frequency to twice-daily PPIs increased pH4time linearly, from approximately 15.8 to 21.0 hours. Three-times daily PPIs performed similarly to twice-daily PPIs. The costs of PPIs varied greatly, but the cost variation was not directly related to potency.

We conclude that PPIs can be used interchangeably based on potency. Using twice-daily PPIs is more effective in increasing efficacy than increasing once-daily PPI dosage. Omeprazole and lansoprazole (30 mg), and 20 mg of esomeprazole and rabeprazole are functionally equivalent.

### Famotidine is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers or erosions [^115f8Xos]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Little is known about the efficacy of H(2)-receptor antagonists in preventing the recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers. We compared the efficacy of high-dose famotidine with that of pantoprazole in preventing recurrent symptomatic ulcers or erosions.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 160 patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers or erosions, with or without a history of bleeding. Patients were given either famotidine (40 mg, morning and evening) or pantoprazole (20 mg in the morning and placebo in the evening). All patients continued to receive aspirin (80 mg daily). The primary endpoint was recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers or erosions within 48 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 130 patients (81.1%) completed the study; 13 of 65 patients in the famotidine group reached the primary endpoint (20.0%; 95% one-sided confidence interval [CI] for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0) compared with 0 of 65 patients in the pantoprazole group (P < .0001, 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0). Gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly more common in the famotidine group than in the pantoprazole group (7.7% [5/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0226–1.0; p = 0.0289), as was re-dyspepsia caused by ulcers or erosions (12.3% [8/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0560–1.0; p = 0.0031). No patients had ulcer perforation or obstruction.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers or erosions, high-dose famotidine therapy is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing the recurrence of these conditions.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Overall, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, like any drug therapy, is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks for most patients. Nevertheless, those without a clear clinical indication are exposed only to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines is the sole rational approach to ensuring effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Effect of famotidine on outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension: A randomized controlled trial [^111nmnNK]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Similar to the primary outcome, no statistical differences were found for any secondary end point. The mean change from baseline in log-transformed BNP level was 0.08 higher in the placebo arm and 0.05 higher in the famotidine arm (difference, –0.02; 95% CI, –0.31 to 0.26; p = 0.86). The RV basal diameter increased by a mean of 0.9 mm in the placebo arm and decreased by a mean of 1.5 mm in the famotidine arm (difference, –2.3 mm; 95% CI, –4.8 to 0.1 mm; p = 0.06).

At 24 weeks, mean tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 0.7 mm higher in the placebo arm and 0.1 mm higher in the famotidine arm (difference, –0.6 mm; 95% CI, –2.3 to 1.2 mm; p = 0.52). The emPHasis-10 score decreased by 1.3 in the placebo arm and 1.7 in the famotidine arm, reflecting a qualitative improvement in subjective quality of life in both arms (difference, –0.4; 95% CI, –4.0 to 3.3; p = 0.85).

At 24 weeks, the OR for improvement to NYHA functional class I or II in the famotidine arm relative to the placebo arm was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.13–1.15; p = 0.09). A similar number of participants underwent PAH-specific therapy augmentation in each arm, including 5.3% in the placebo arm and 8.1% in the famotidine arm (common risk difference, 2.8; 95% CI, –10.2% to 16.7%; p = 0.68).

Exploratory post hoc analyses did not suggest a dominant impact from influential outliers, and sensitivity analyses for missing data are included (e-Fig 1, e-Appendix 1).

### Proton pump inhibitors: An update [^111Y5bhT]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Since their introduction in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors have demonstrated gastric acid suppression superior to that of histamine H2-receptor blockers. Proton pump inhibitors have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. Proton pump inhibitors have minimal side effects and few significant drug interactions, and they are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. The proton pump inhibitors omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and the recently approved esomeprazole appear to have similar efficacy.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^113yWdx7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The literature searches identified 406 articles. After removing 50 duplicates and excluding nonrelevant studies, a total of 135 references were reviewed and used by the steering committee to develop 27 pilot statements concerning risk factors and interventions for reflux-like symptoms. The pilot statements, along with supporting articles, were shared with the expert panel. Each study's level of supporting evidence, assigned by the steering committee using a scale of 1 to 6, was also provided.

- **Consensus procedure**: In the first consensus meeting, statements and evidence were reviewed. Based on panel discussion and agreement, three statements were added, and four were eliminated. The revised pilot statements formed the basis for the steering committee to develop a set of 21 directive statements. These were shared, accompanied by supporting evidence, for anonymous voting using the Qualtrics online platform. For each statement, experts, including the steering committee, indicated their level of agreement on a scale from 1 to 6 (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree with major reservation; 3 = disagree with minor reservation; 4 = agree with major reservation; 5 = agree with minor reservation; 6 = strongly agree). Results were analyzed by the meeting facilitator, and the consensus threshold was set a priori as agreement (level 5 or 6) by at least 67% of respondents.

During the second meeting, round one voting results were reviewed.

### Platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel in patients treated with omeprazole, pantoprazole, and famotidine: A prospective, randomized, crossover study [^114TLBDk]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Concerns about an inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on clopidogrel metabolism have been raised. Because the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel is dependent on the genetically determined activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes system, it is important to examine the interaction between different PPIs and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) after controlling for genetic variability. The study aimed to assess the effect of two PPIs and a histamine-2 (H2) receptor-blocker on platelet reactivity in a crossover trial, where each patient was alternately treated with each drug.

- **Hypothesis**: Omeprazole reduces HPR more than other PPI or H2 blockers.

- **Methods**: Patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least one month were assigned to three consecutive one-month treatment periods. During these periods, they were treated with each of the three study medications twice daily: omeprazole 20 mg, famotidine 40 mg, and pantoprazole 20 mg. At the end of each treatment phase, platelet function was evaluated with the Verify Now system using two cutoff values (> 208 P2Y12 reaction units [PRUs] and > 230 PRUs) for the definition of HPR.

- **Results**: Patients with HPR were older than those without HPR (62 ± 10 vs. 55 ± 8 years, respectively, P = 0.03). HPR was more prevalent during omeprazole therapy compared to famotidine or pantoprazole (48%, 33%, and 31%, respectively, for the 208 PRU cutoff, P = 0.04; and 37%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, for the 230 PRU cutoff, P = 0.003).

### Double-blind randomized trials of single-tablet ibuprofen/high-dose famotidine vs. ibuprofen alone for reduction of gastric and duodenal ulcers [^113sGoVm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used as analgesics. Ibuprofen is the most commonly used non-aspirin NSAID, with about one-quarter of the US population aged 17 years or older reporting ibuprofen intake in the past month. The main factor limiting NSAID use is the development of upper gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects, including ulcers, complications such as bleeding, and dyspepsia. Strategies recommended to decrease GI injury in NSAID users include co-therapy with misoprostol or proton-pump inhibitors and/or the use of COX-2 selective inhibitors.

Histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) have not been recommended for preventive therapy in NSAID users because, when given in standard doses, they significantly decrease duodenal but not gastric ulcers. However, a Cochrane systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials lasting three months or more identified one study showing a significant benefit of double-dose H2RAs in reducing both gastric ulcers (relative risk (RR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval, 0.18–0.97) and duodenal ulcers (RR = 0.19, 0.04–0.85). The relative risks for proton-pump inhibitor versus placebo co-therapy in the meta-analysis were 0.40 (0.32–0.51) for gastric ulcers and 0.19 (0.09–0.37) for duodenal ulcers.

Although many national and international groups recommend protective therapy for NSAID users at increased risk of GI events, most such patients are not prescribed protective therapy. In addition, patients may not take their protective co-therapy along with their NSAID, especially if they are not experiencing any symptoms, leading to decreased adherence.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112Ucp9A]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis involved comprehensive searches of MEDLINE (1946 to February 1, 2022), EMBASE and EMBASE Classic (1947 to February 1, 2022), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 2005 to February 1, 2022). We additionally hand-searched conference proceedings from Digestive Diseases Week, the American College of Gastroenterology, United European Gastroenterology Week, and the Asian Pacific Digestive Week, covering the period between 2006 and February 2022 to identify studies published exclusively in abstract form.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists (H2 RAs), potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs), or alginates, either against each other or a placebo, were considered. Eligible studies included adult participants, with more than 90% being over the age of 16 years, diagnosed with endoscopy-negative reflux disease. This condition was defined by heartburn and/or regurgitation symptoms and a normal upper endoscopy, regardless of positive pH monitoring and impedance testing of ≥ 24 hours duration conducted off anti-reflux medications. The studies had to involve a therapy duration of at least 2 weeks, using any dosage or combination of the aforementioned drugs.

- **Outcomes**: Eligible studies were required to report on either the failure to achieve complete relief or adequate relief from gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation) in patients with endoscopy-negative reflux disease. The first period of crossover RCTs was also included.

### Ppi use in the OTC era: who to treat, with what, and for how long [^113NY6YW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be the most effective class of medication to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The availability of over-the-counter (OTC) and generic PPIs provides consumers with options other than antacids and histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for self-medication of heartburn and acid regurgitation. Medical concerns arising from these developments include the management of patients in whom symptoms persist despite OTC PPI, proper administration of PPIs, and potential masking of more serious pathology, such as malignancy.

Studies indicate that different forms of PPI administration will likely become more acceptable, such as on-demand and intermittent therapy. Prospective clinical trials show the efficacy of these strategies of noncontinuous PPI administration and the potential for cost reduction in GERD management. Newer agents such as reversible acid pump antagonists will compete for selected markets in the future, further expanding the role of alternative dosing regimens.

Ultimately, therapy should be tailored to individual patients, as no single strategy will be optimal for the entire population with GERD symptoms.

### Short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists and prokinetics for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease-like symptoms and endoscopy negative reflux disease [^115aR1An]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of adults experience heartburn, the cardinal feature of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), at least monthly. The evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected GORD is associated with a substantial economic burden. Most patients are treated empirically, without specific diagnostic evaluation. They include a wide range of underlying oesophageal injury. The severity of oesophageal injury can only be established in those who have undergone upper endoscopy. Patients without visible damage to the oesophagus are referred to as having endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD). The pathogenesis of ENRD, as well as its response to treatment, may differ from GORD with oesophagitis.

- **Objectives**: Summarize, quantify, and compare the efficacy of the short-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA), and prokinetics in adults with GORD, treated empirically and in those with endoscopy negative reflux disease (ENRD).

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2005), and EMBASE (January 1988 to December 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials focusing on symptomatic outcome after short-term treatment for GORD using proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, or prokinetic agents. Studies were included provided that participants could be classified in the empirical treatment group (no endoscopy used in treatment allocation) or in the endoscopy negative reflux disease group.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs coincides with a surge in literature concerning their safety and efficacy, complicating the creation of evidence-based guidelines for their use. Scarpignato et al. conducted a study on behalf of three Italian scientific societies, collaborating with panels of international reviewers. They addressed 13 clinical scenarios characterized by uncertainty in PPI prescription and common drug misuse. The study involved a systematic literature review of nearly 500 papers, culminating in a narrative review on the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy for each scenario.

- **Key messages**: Table 1 outlines appropriate PPI use across the 13 scenarios, categorizing them into long-term, short-term, or inappropriate use. Notably, the table lists many usages not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The global literature, however, provides substantial evidence supporting PPI efficacy beyond FDA indications.

### Comparison of an increased dosage regimen of rabeprazole versus a concomitant dosage regimen of famotidine with rabeprazole for nocturnal gastric acid inhibition in relation to cytochrome P450 2C19 genotypes [^1143XnKR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

A concomitant dosage regimen of a histamine 2 receptor antagonist with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effectively decreases the incidence of nocturnal acid breakthrough, an issue encountered when treating acid-related diseases with a PPI alone. The study compared the effectiveness of an increased dosage regimen of rabeprazole with a concomitant dosage regimen of rabeprazole and famotidine, considering cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotype status, on nocturnal acid inhibition.

- **Methods**: Fifteen Helicobacter pylori-negative volunteers, including 5 homozygous extensive metabolizers (EMs), 6 heterozygous EMs, and 4 poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2C19, took 20 mg rabeprazole, 40 mg rabeprazole, and 20 mg rabeprazole plus 20 mg famotidine at bedtime (10 PM) over 8 days. The subjects then underwent 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on day 8.

- **Results**: For the 20-mg rabeprazole, 40-mg rabeprazole, and concomitant dosage regimens, the median percent times and ranges when nocturnal intragastric pH values were lower than 4.0 were as follows:

	- **Homozygous EMs**: 78.8% (47.5%-98.0%), 45.3% (29.0%-52.2%), and 15.5% (0.0%-40.8%) respectively.

### Control of 24-hour intragastric acidity with morning dosing of immediate-release and delayed-release proton pump inhibitors in patients with GERD [^113w7isN]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the effects of immediate-release omeprazole and two different delayed-release proton pump inhibitors on 24-hour intragastric acidity in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients, a study was conducted.

Because of its unique pharmacokinetic properties, immediate-release omeprazole does not need to be dosed before a meal to control intragastric acidity. Previous studies showed the effectiveness of immediate-release omeprazole in controlling nocturnal intragastric acidity with bedtime dosing. This is the first study to compare the effects of prebreakfast dosing of immediate-release omeprazole and delayed-release lansoprazole and pantoprazole on 24-hour intragastric acidity.

The study aimed to compare the effects of prebreakfast dosing of immediate-release omeprazole 40 mg capsules, lansoprazole 30 mg capsules, and pantoprazole 40 mg tablets on 24-hour intragastric acidity.

In this open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study, fifty-five patients with GERD received seven consecutive once-daily morning doses of each drug. On day seven, intragastric pH was recorded for 24 hours.

After seven days, the percentage of time with intragastric pH > 4 over 24 hours was 59.7% (14.3 hours) with immediate-release omeprazole, 48.8% (11.7 hours) with lansoprazole (P = 0.005), and 41.8% (10.0 hours) with pantoprazole (P < 0.001). The median intragastric pH was significantly higher with immediate-release omeprazole than with lansoprazole (P = 0.003) or pantoprazole (P < 0.001). All drugs were well tolerated.

When dosed in the morning, immediate-release omeprazole demonstrated superior control of intragastric acidity compared to delayed-release lansoprazole and pantoprazole.

### Comparison of tegoprazan and lansoprazole in patients with erosive esophagitis up to 4 weeks: A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator phase 4 trial [^1166wKks]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

In recent decades, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), defined as the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, has increased worldwide. In Korea, the prevalence of GERD is 3.4%–6.4%. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of various acid-related disorders, including GERD and peptic ulcer disease. Recently, potassium competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) such as vonoprazan, fexuprazan, and tegoprazan have been marketed as replacements for PPIs in clinical practice. Of note, P-CABs display rapid onset and have a longer half-life than PPIs. Moreover, the time of dosing of P-CABs is flexible, unlike that of most PPIs.

In previous studies, P-CABs revealed excellent efficacy in treating erosive esophagitis (EE). In a recent meta-analysis, 8-week administration of P-CABs showed results similar to those of PPIs in individuals with EE. Although most studies have compared vonoprazan with PPIs, one study compared tegoprazan with esomeprazole. In this study, the up-to-week-8 mucosal healing rate of tegoprazan was 96%, whereas that of esomeprazole was approximately 93%, demonstrating the non-inferiority of tegoprazan in the treatment of EE. A recent clinical trial also showed the non-inferior efficacy of fexuprazan to esomeprazole in treating EE. Based on these results, recent guidelines have proposed that the effect of P-CABs was comparable to that of PPIs in the initial treatment of patients with GERD.

### Famotidine [^115sZE6S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of orally administered famotidine reveal that it is incompletely absorbed, with a bioavailability of 40 to 45%. Famotidine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. After oral doses, peak plasma levels occur within 1 to 3 hours. Plasma levels after multiple doses are similar to those following a single dose. In plasma, 15 to 20% of famotidine is protein bound. The elimination half-life ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 hours, with the drug being eliminated via renal (65 to 70%) and metabolic (30 to 35%) routes. A renal clearance rate of 250 to 450 mL/min suggests some tubular excretion. Additionally, 25 to 30% of an oral dose and 65 to 70% of an intravenous dose are recovered in the urine as unchanged compound. The only identified metabolite in humans is the S-oxide.

There is a strong relationship between creatinine clearance values and the elimination half-life of famotidine. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, defined as a creatinine clearance of less than 10 mL/min, the elimination half-life of famotidine may exceed 20 hours. Therefore, dose or dosing interval adjustments may be necessary in cases of moderate and severe renal insufficiency [see precautions, dosage, and administration].

In elderly patients, no clinically significant age-related changes in the pharmacokinetics of famotidine have been observed. However, in elderly patients with decreased renal function, drug clearance may be reduced [see precautions, geriatric use].

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - a position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the safest classes of drugs. Although concerns have been raised about their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support these concerns publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks for most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks, thereby making the benefit-to-harm balance very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed, and attempts should be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of the drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing the discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for the maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however…

### Self-selection and use patterns of over-the-counter omeprazole for frequent heartburn [^111aKkZr]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration approval and subsequent launch of over-the-counter (OTC) omeprazole raises the question of whether consumers would use OTC omeprazole appropriately in a "real world" setting.

- **Methods**: A 3-month observational study was conducted in an OTC setting to determine whether consumers could (1) correctly self-select to use omeprazole for frequent heartburn, (2) comply with a product label that calls for 14 consecutive days of once-daily dosing, and (3) use more than 14 doses of medication only under the advice of a physician. Consumers were interviewed at 5 shopping malls in geographically distinct areas of the United States and asked whether they had heartburn. Of the 1999 self-reported heartburn sufferers, 866 determined the product was appropriate for their condition and purchased the product; of these, 758 (88%) returned diaries documenting product usage and physician contact.

- **Results**: OTC consumers accurately self-selected; more than 90% of participants had heartburn 2 or more days/week. Analysis of diary data showed a high degree of compliance with label use directions; only 3% of subjects took more than 14 doses without consulting a physician. After 3 months, 43% of subjects did not have a recurrence of heartburn. Overall, 75% of subjects had contact with a physician about heartburn before, during, or soon after the study (26% contacted a physician during the 3-month study). Of the 758 subjects, only 1 subject took more than 14 tablets without consulting a physician and had a recurrence of heartburn.

- **Conclusions**: Actual use data suggest that consumers can appropriately self-select and use OTC omeprazole for frequent heartburn as per the label directions.

### Famotidine [^113J8R4J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

These studies suggest that a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/dose of famotidine oral suspension may be of benefit for the treatment of GERD for up to 4 weeks once daily in patients less than 3 months of age and twice daily in patients 3 months to less than 1 year of age; however, the safety and benefit of famotidine treatment beyond 4 weeks have not been established. Famotidine should be considered for the treatment of GERD only if conservative measures, such as thickened feedings, are used concurrently and if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.

- **Pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age**: Use of famotidine in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, as well as the following studies in pediatric patients. In published studies involving small numbers of pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years, the clearance of famotidine was similar to that seen in adults. In pediatric patients aged 11 to 15 years, oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean AUC similar to that observed in adults treated orally with 40 mg. Similarly, in pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years, intravenous doses of 0.5 mg/kg were associated with a mean AUC comparable to that in adults treated intravenously with 40 mg. Limited published studies also suggest that the relationship between serum concentration and acid suppression is similar in pediatric patients aged 1 to 15 years as compared with adults. These studies suggest that the starting dose for pediatric patients aged 1 to 16 years is 0.25 mg/kg intravenously, injected over a period not less than suggested.

### On-demand treatment of acute heartburn with the antacid hydrotalcite compared with famotidine and placebo: Randomized double-blind cross-over study [^114EXHWi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Antacids are widely used in the self-treatment of gastroesophageal reflux-induced complaints, but respective studies are lacking.

- **Goals**: To compare the efficacy and safety of hydrotalcite with the H2 receptor antagonist famotidine and placebo in the on-demand treatment of acute heartburn under daily practice conditions.

- **Study**: Five hundred sixty-two individuals in 4 centers were randomized in a double-blind, double-dummy, 3-fold cross-over study to single-dose treatments of 1000 mg hydrotalcite, 10 mg famotidine, or placebo. Heartburn severity and relief were measured with numerical and visual rating scales.

- **Results**: A significantly better heartburn relief score was achieved 60 minutes after the administration of hydrotalcite compared with placebo (primary end point, P < 0.0001). Better efficacy was also observed 30 minutes and 3 hours after the intake of hydrotalcite in comparison with famotidine or placebo. A significant decrease in heartburn severity compared with placebo occurred within 10 minutes for hydrotalcite and was faster compared with both controls.

- **Conclusions**: For subjects self-administering antacids for episodic heartburn, antacid hydrotalcite provides symptom relief significantly faster and, within the first 3 hours postdosing, more effective than famotidine or placebo. These results suggest that on-demand treatment of hydrotalcite is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for heartburn.

### Famotidine [^115PufNV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Famotidine has been evaluated for its effectiveness in long-term maintenance treatment of duodenal ulcers. The drug was administered at a dosage of 20 mg orally at bedtime and compared to a placebo in two double-blind, multicenter studies involving patients with endoscopically confirmed healed duodenal ulcers.

In the U.S. study, the observed ulcer incidence within 12 months for patients treated with placebo was found to be 2.4 times greater than for those treated with famotidine. Specifically, 23.4% of the 89 patients treated with famotidine experienced ulcer recurrence, compared to 56.6% of the 89 patients receiving placebo (p < 0.01). These findings were corroborated by an international study, where 35.7% of the 307 patients treated with famotidine experienced ulcer recurrence, in contrast to 75.5% of the 325 patients treated with placebo (p < 0.01).

The efficacy of famotidine was also assessed in patients with endoscopically confirmed active benign gastric ulcers. In both U.S. and international multicenter, double-blind studies, patients received 40 mg of famotidine orally at bedtime, which was compared to placebo. Antacids were permitted, but their consumption did not significantly differ between the famotidine and placebo groups. The incidence of ulcer healing, accounting for dropouts as unhealed, was significantly higher with famotidine than placebo at weeks 6 and 8 in the U.S. study, and weeks 4, 6, and 8 in the international study, with healing confirmed by endoscopy (p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.01).

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111BGAk9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms at ≥ 4 weeks of treatment was reported in twelve RCTs. Data concerning the efficacy of all the interventions of interest were analyzed, with a total of 5,793 patients recruited, of whom 4,898 received active treatment. The network plot is provided in Figure S4A. Pooled analysis revealed moderate levels of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 67.2%). There was no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry, suggesting no publication bias or other small study effects.

Dexlansoprazole 60 mg o.d. ranked first in efficacy (RR of failure to achieve adequate relief of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms = 0.45; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.70, P-score 0.90). Dexlansoprazole 30 mg o.d. ranked second (RR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.81, P-score 0.77), and rabeprazole 20 mg o.d. third (RR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.87, P-score 0.62). Rabeprazole 10 mg o.d. and omeprazole 20 mg o.d. were also significantly more efficacious than placebo. However, 30 mL of alginate q.i.d. in combination with omeprazole 20 mg o.d., famotidine 20 mg o.d., 20 mL of alginate t.i.d., esomeprazole 40 mg or 20 mg o.d., rabeprazole 5 mg o.d., and omeprazole 10 mg o.d. were all no more efficacious than placebo.

After indirect comparison of active treatments, dexlansoprazole 60 mg o.d. was found to be superior to omeprazole 10 mg o.d. and esomeprazole 20 mg o.d., but there were no other significant differences.

### Famotidine [^111eiR5s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Of the 4,966 subjects in clinical studies who were treated with famotidine, 488 subjects (9.8%) were 65 and older, and 88 subjects (1.7%) were greater than 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects; however, greater sensitivity of some older patients cannot be ruled out.

No dosage adjustment is required based on age (see clinical pharmacology in adults, pharmacokinetics). This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Dosage adjustment in the case of moderate or severe renal impairment is necessary (see precautions, patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency and dosage and administration, dosage adjustment for patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency).

### Famotidine versus omeprazole, in combination with amoxycillin and tinidazole, for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1118T5yu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Eradication regimens combining two antibiotics with a proton pump inhibitor have been studied intensively. In contrast, only a few studies have focused on the potential role of H2-receptor antagonists in eradication therapy. The mechanism involved in the synergy between antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors remains controversial.

- **Objectives**: To compare the results of two triple-therapy regimens, differing only in the antisecretory drugs used, for patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, and to assess the impact of primary resistance to metronidazole on treatment outcomes.

- **Methods**: A total of 120 patients with peptic ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia were randomly assigned to a 2-week course of either famotidine 40 mg twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a day, and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (FAT group; n = 60), or omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a day, and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (OAT group; n = 60). Upper endoscopy was performed prior to treatment and at least 4 weeks after completion of treatment and discontinuation of the antisecretory therapy. H. pylori status was assessed by a biopsy urease test, histology, and culture.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication of H. pylori was achieved in 48 of the 60 patients (80%; 95% confidence interval: 70–90%) in the FAT group, compared to 50 of the 60 patients (83.3%; 95% confidence interval: 74–93%) in the OAT group. In the per protocol analysis, eradication therapy was achieved in 48 out of 53 patients (90.6%; 95% confidence interval: 83–98%) treated with FAT, and 50 out of…

### Does my patient still have reflux when PPI therapy does not work [^114st9zL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition worldwide. The management of this disease is often unsatisfactory due to the complexity of patient presentations and suboptimal diagnostic testing, particularly in those with a poor response to acid-suppressive therapy. In this mini-review, we discuss some new strategies employed for patients with suspected GERD to better understand the disease pathophysiology. We compare these strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach for managing this challenging group of patients.

### Alternative therapeutic approaches to chronic proton pump inhibitor treatment [^114y9XKq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic consumption of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) by patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease is very common due to their potent and profound effect on acid secretion, which results in an unsurpassed rate of symptom resolution and esophageal healing. However, over the past few years, there have been a growing number of reports about various side effects caused by chronic PPI treatment. Concerns have been raised by patients and physicians alike about the common practice of prescribing PPIs, often more than once daily, on a long-term basis.

As a result, there has been a resurgence of interest in alternative therapeutic modalities for chronic PPI treatment. These include novel endoscopic and surgical techniques, as well as other available therapeutic strategies likely to be revisited, such as histamine-2-receptor antagonists, intermittent and on-demand PPI treatment, and antireflux surgery, among others.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1144pKgT]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

- **Failure to achieve complete relief of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks of treatment**: Seven RCTs reported data concerning the efficacy of PPIs, H2 RAs, PCABs, or alginates in terms of the failure to achieve complete relief of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks of treatment. In total, 4325 patients were recruited, of whom 3925 received active treatment. The network plot is provided in Figure S1. Pooled analysis revealed no statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0.0%).

Omeprazole 20 mg o.d., esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. and 40 mg o.d., 20 mL of alginate t.i.d., famotidine 20 mg o.d., omeprazole 10 mg o.d., cimetidine 200 mg q.i.d., rabeprazole 10 mg o.d., and tegoprazan 100 mg o.d. were all significantly more efficacious than placebo. Among these, omeprazole 20 mg o.d. (RR of failure to achieve complete relief of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms = 0.43; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.56, P-score 0.94) ranked first, indicating a 94% probability of being the most efficacious when all treatments, including placebo, were compared. However, esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. (RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.58, P-score 0.91), and 40 mg o.d. (RR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60, P-score 0.81) performed similarly and were ranked second and third, respectively (Figure 2A). Famotidine 40 mg o.d., rabeprazole 5 mg o.d., and tegoprazan 50 mg o.d. were no more efficacious than placebo. After an indirect comparison of active treatments, omeprazole 20 mg o.d., esomeprazole 20 mg or 40 mg o.d., and 20 mL of alginate t.i.d. were superior to all other active treatments.

### Pharmacology of acid suppression in the hospital setting: Focus on proton pump inhibition [^112DKKdV]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The more potent and longer-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion provided by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), as compared with histamine-2-receptor antagonists, is largely due to differences in their mechanism of action. PPIs block histamine-2-, gastrin-, and cholinergic-mediated sources of acid production and inhibit gastric secretion at the final common pathway of the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase proton pump. In contrast, histamine-2-receptor antagonists cannot block receptor sites other than those mediated by histamine. It seems that the rapid loss of acid suppression activity by the histamine-2-receptor antagonists may be attributed to tolerance. Such tolerance has not occurred in patients receiving PPIs because these agents are irreversible inhibitors of the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase proton pump.

For these reasons, patients who have acid-related disorders requiring high levels of acid suppression do not respond well to intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonists and would be excellent candidates for intravenous PPI therapy. Candidates for intravenous PPIs also include patients who cannot receive oral PPIs and those who may need the higher acid suppression therapy provided by the intravenous route rather than the oral route. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous pantoprazole in maintaining adequate control of gastric acid output during the switch from oral to intravenous therapy in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

### Impact of anti-peptic ulcer disease medications on type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in patients with PUD: A population-based retrospective cohort study [^115dEQBr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-peptic ulcer disease (PUD) medications focus on reducing gastric acid and enhancing mucosal defense. H2 receptor antagonists, such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, and roxatidine, inhibit the H2 receptor, reducing 90% of basal, food-stimulated, and nocturnal acid production. While effective, long-term use often leads to ulcer recurrence. H2 receptor antagonists have additional benefits, such as reducing hunger and postprandial blood glucose levels. Previous studies have reported an inverse relationship between H2 receptor antagonist use and insulin resistance (OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.95). Cimetidine amplifies insulin secretion and, along with ranitidine, reduces postprandial glucose levels significantly. In the present study, H2 receptor antagonist treatment was associated with a 34% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), further highlighting their potential therapeutic benefits.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole, directly inhibit the stomach's proton-pump, blocking the final stage of acid secretion and controlling both basal and nocturnal acid release. PPIs also inhibit H. pylori growth and are currently the first-line PUD therapy, surpassing H2 receptor antagonists. Studies have explored the relationship between PPIs and glycemic control, with mixed results. For example, Singh et al. conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study assessing pantoprazole's effects on glucose-insulin homeostasis in T2DM patients, finding reduced HbA1c levels and increased gastrin levels. This suggests that PPIs may enhance β-cell activity.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114hfL3k]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

We identified no new trials of either H2 receptor antagonists (H2 RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) since a network meta-analysis published in 2019, so we used the pairwise data from that meta-analysis to inform this guideline. Overall, there was a benefit of H2 RAs over placebo. The relative risk (RR) of symptoms not improving in 12 trials, containing 2,268 patients, was reduced with H2 RAs versus placebo (0.79; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92). Similarly, the RR of symptoms not being cured in eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs), randomizing 1,668 patients, was reduced with H2 RAs versus placebo (0.83; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98). Total adverse events and treatment withdrawals were no more likely with H2 RAs than with placebo in seven trials. However, the trial quality was low, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 77% for symptom improvement and I2 = 87% for symptom cure), and many of these RCTs were older and recruited patients whose symptom profiles would no longer be considered compatible with functional dyspepsia (FD), including those with reflux-predominant dyspepsia.

In the network meta-analysis, there were 16 RCTs of PPIs, using low, standard, or high doses of these drugs in FD, containing 6,017 patients, which reported on improvement in symptoms. Overall, standard dose PPIs (RR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) and low dose PPIs (RR = 0.89; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97) were more efficacious than placebo, but there was no benefit of high dose PPIs (RR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01), with significant heterogeneity.
