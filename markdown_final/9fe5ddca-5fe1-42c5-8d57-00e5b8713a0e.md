## Question

In a patient with ESRD and cancer whose baseline hemoglobin is around 7, is DAPT contraindicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is contraindicated in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, and severe anemia with hemoglobin around 7 g/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline bleeding and ischemic risk conferred by ESRD, cancer, and severe anemia. Then, I should evaluate the incremental bleeding risk and potential ischemic benefit of DAPT specifically in CKD/ESRD cohorts. Next, I will consider how profound anemia at Hb ~7 g/dL modifies hemostasis and risk–benefit. After that, I need to integrate cancer-specific considerations, including ESA safety and oncologic guidance. Finally, I will synthesize whether DAPT is relatively contraindicated and outline practical management options, including anemia optimization and shortest-possible antiplatelet strategies if DAPT is unavoidable.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk profile. ESRD confers both thrombotic and hemorrhagic tendencies due to uremic platelet dysfunction and vascular disease, which already shifts the patient into a high bleeding risk phenotype even before adding antithrombotics. I need to check the anemia severity next: Hb ~7 g/dL is far below CKD anemia targets; KDIGO and UK Kidney Association guidance generally manage to maintain Hb roughly in the 10–12 g/dL range with individualized goals, underscoring that an Hb of 7 g/dL represents profound physiologic compromise and a potential bleeding marker or ongoing loss that must be investigated and corrected first [^116zSyq8] [^116zSyq8]. Hold on, I should verify cancer's contribution: malignancy can amplify both bleeding and thrombosis depending on tumor biology and therapies; importantly, oncology guidance emphasizes evaluating alternative causes of anemia before initiating ESAs, reinforcing that the anemia itself requires etiologic workup and stabilization prior to intensifying antiplatelet therapy.

> Next, I should review DAPT-specific data in CKD/ESRD. Evidence in dialysis patients is limited, and guidelines often exclude or are ambiguous about ESRD, so extrapolation must be cautious. Wait, let me verify bleeding signals with abbreviated DAPT in high bleeding risk CKD: in the XIENCE Short DAPT program, CKD patients still had substantial BARC 2–5 bleeding with 1-month DAPT, implying that even short courses are not benign in this population [^112QLWmt]. I will now examine prolonged DAPT: in CKD cohorts, longer DAPT reduced ischemic events but raised bleeding events, reinforcing the need for a tailored harm–benefit assessment rather than routine prolongation [^117T96dE]. A broader CKD antiplatelet meta-analysis also flags increased bleeding hazards, further cautioning against aggressive platelet inhibition without compelling indication in CKD patients [^114aoceA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider how severe anemia interacts with DAPT. Although direct studies at Hb ~7 g/dL are lacking here, severe anemia impairs platelet margination/adhesion and, when combined with uremic platelet dysfunction, plausibly compounds bleeding risk; concurrently, CKD anemia guidelines prioritize raising Hb toward ~10 g/dL before adding therapies that increase bleeding, which suggests correcting anemia first to restore hemostatic reserve and oxygen delivery before exposing the patient to DAPT-related bleeding risk [^116zSyq8] [^116zSyq8]. Hmm, wait a minute — because the absence of direct Hb 7 data limits certainty, I should double-check: no document here states an absolute DAPT contraindication at Hb 7, but the mechanistic and indirect evidence indicates significant synergy toward bleeding if DAPT is added on top of ESRD and profound anemia.

> Next, I should review cancer-specific considerations that might sway toward or against intensifying antiplatelet therapy. Let me first confirm ESA-related safety: multiple ESA labels carry boxed warnings for increased risks of death, MI, stroke, thromboembolism, vascular access thrombosis, and tumor progression or recurrence when hemoglobin is targeted above 11 g/dL, so if ESAs are used, they should be at the lowest dose to avoid transfusion and with oncology intent in mind, not to normalize Hb, particularly when cure is intended [^1117DGmp] [^1119hYfN] [^117Mnf1a]. I need to check HIF-PHI use as well: roxadustat is not recommended in active malignancy and has adverse safety signals in non-dialysis CKD, so it is not an attractive anemia-correction alternative in this scenario [^115sEGck]. But wait — oncology guidance also stresses confirming and treating reversible causes of anemia before ESAs, and avoiding ESAs when the treatment intent is curative, which again emphasizes correction and cautious use rather than rapid erythropoiesis to permit aggressive antiplatelet therapy [^1129kt37] [^116JRSua].

> Now I should synthesize whether DAPT is contraindicated. I should confirm: no source here declares an absolute contraindication to DAPT in ESRD with Hb ~7 and active cancer, but the aggregate of ESRD-associated bleeding diathesis, high bleeding with DAPT even when shortened in CKD, and profound anemia implies that DAPT is relatively contraindicated unless the ischemic indication is compelling and immediate, such as very recent PCI with high stent thrombosis risk where no safe alternative exists [^112QLWmt] [^114aoceA]. Let me reconsider prolonged DAPT: in CKD it can reduce ischemic events but increases bleeding, which in a profoundly anemic, ESRD, cancer patient likely tips toward net harm unless the stent-related risk is extreme and time-limited strategies can be used [^117T96dE]. I should also verify practice guidance language: perioperative and complex DAPT decisions emphasize individualized, multidisciplinary balancing of bleeding versus thrombosis, which fits this case for declaring DAPT a relative contraindication pending hematologic stabilization and team consensus [^115ee2t1].

> If DAPT is absolutely necessary, I need to ensure the approach minimizes bleeding exposure. Hold on, I should verify shortest-duration options: contemporary data support 1-month DAPT in high bleeding risk settings with selected modern DES, acknowledging nontrivial bleeding even at one month; beyond that, single antiplatelet therapy should be resumed as soon as feasible with vigilant monitoring [^112QLWmt]. I should double-check peri-procedural guidance: multidisciplinary coordination among cardiology, nephrology, oncology, and the procedural team is recommended to individualize DAPT duration and timing, and to consider deferring elective PCI until anemia is corrected if clinically safe, or using strategies that permit shorter DAPT courses when revascularization cannot be delayed [^115ee2t1].

> Next, I should review anemia optimization before and during any antiplatelet therapy. Let me first confirm targets: CKD anemia care generally aims to raise Hb toward approximately 10–12 g/dL using iron repletion and cautious ESA dosing, with close monitoring and explicit avoidance of targeting Hb > 11 g/dL due to harm; in active cancer, ESAs are used only for chemotherapy-induced anemia, at the lowest dose to avert transfusion, and avoided when the oncologic intent is curative, so iron repletion and bleeding source control are pivotal first steps here [^11529EC7] [^116zSyq8] [^1117DGmp] [^1119hYfN] [^117Mnf1a] [^1129kt37] [^116JRSua]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence because correction will be dynamic: UKKA recommends more frequent Hb checks during correction or after dose changes and monthly or longer intervals in maintenance, which is germane if any antiplatelet therapy proceeds [^114iX4WB]. But wait — given Hb ~7 g/dL, transfusion thresholds are often individualized; without explicit thresholds here, the principle remains to restore oxygen-carrying capacity and hemostatic reserve promptly while investigating and managing tumor- or uremia-related bleeding sources before or concurrent with any unavoidable DAPT exposure [^1129kt37].

> Final clinical determination: I should state this explicitly and sanity-check. DAPT is relatively contraindicated in ESRD with active cancer and severe anemia around Hb ~7 g/dL because the compounded bleeding risk likely outweighs ischemic benefit unless there is an absolute, time-critical indication such as very recent PCI with high stent thrombosis risk; in such a narrow circumstance, use the shortest feasible DAPT course (for example, 1 month with an appropriate DES) with rapid de-escalation to single antiplatelet therapy, while aggressively correcting anemia and coordinating multidisciplinary oversight [^112QLWmt] [^114aoceA] [^1111FAvT]. If there is no immediate, compelling indication for DAPT, prioritize anemia correction, bleeding source evaluation, and single antiplatelet or alternative strategies, and revisit the antiplatelet plan once hemoglobin and bleeding risk are stabilized through guideline-concordant CKD and oncology-directed care [^11529EC7] [^116zSyq8] [^1129kt37] [^115ee2t1].

No, ESRD with cancer and baseline hemoglobin around 7 g/dL is not an absolute contraindication to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) [^1111FAvT]. However, these patients are at high bleeding risk [^114aoceA] and require individualized risk–benefit assessment, close monitoring, and multidisciplinary management [^115ee2t1]. DAPT should be used only when the ischemic benefit clearly outweighs the bleeding risk, with the shortest effective duration [^112QLWmt] and careful anemia management [^116zSyq8].

## Clinical considerations for DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia

### Bleeding risk

- ESRD patients have increased bleeding risk due to uremic platelet dysfunction, anticoagulation during dialysis, and frequent invasive procedures [^114aoceA].

- Cancer further increases bleeding risk through tumor-related bleeding, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, and mucosal involvement.

- Severe anemia (Hb ~7 g/dL) exacerbates bleeding risk and may necessitate transfusions, increasing complications.

---

### Ischemic risk

Ischemic risk is heightened in ESRD due to a substantial cardiovascular burden, including coronary artery disease and stent thrombosis, often necessitating DAPT after PCI [^115ee2t1]. Cancer further elevates thrombotic risk through tumor-related hypercoagulability and chemotherapy effects. Therefore, balancing ischemic and bleeding risks is critical in this population [^117T96dE].

---

## Evidence and guidelines regarding DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia

- There are no absolute contraindications to DAPT in ESRD patients with cancer and severe anemia; decisions should be individualized based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors [^1111FAvT].

- The Cochrane review on antiplatelet agents in CKD emphasizes individualized risk–benefit assessment due to increased bleeding risk in CKD patients [^114aoceA].

- The European Dialysis Working Group recommends individualized decisions to minimize bleeding while reducing thrombotic risk [^1111FAvT].

- Shorter DAPT durations (e.g. 1 month) may be considered in high bleeding risk patients, including those with CKD, without significantly increasing ischemic events [^112QLWmt] [^115ee2t1].

---

## Clinical management strategies

### Anemia management

Optimize anemia management with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron supplementation to maintain hemoglobin within recommended targets (typically 10–12 g/dL) [^116zSyq8], and monitor hemoglobin regularly, adjusting ESA therapy as needed [^11529EC7] [^114iX4WB].

---

### DAPT management

DAPT management should prioritize the shortest effective duration [^112QLWmt] based on individualized ischemic and bleeding risk [^115ee2t1]. Patients require regular surveillance for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and intracranial hemorrhage. If the bleeding risk outweighs the ischemic benefit, alternative antiplatelet strategies or monotherapy should be considered [^117T96dE].

---

### Multidisciplinary approach

A multidisciplinary approach engages cardiology, nephrology, oncology, and hematology specialists in decision-making, with regular reassessment of patient status and therapy adjustments as needed [^115ee2t1].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

- ESRD patients on DAPT have increased bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and bleeding requiring transfusion [^114aoceA].

- Cancer patients on DAPT have increased bleeding risk due to tumor-related bleeding and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia [^117J57FC].

- Severe anemia increases transfusion requirements and associated complications.

### Pros and cons of antithrombotic therapy in end-stage kidney disease: A 2019 update [^1111FAvT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients manifest both an increased thrombotic risk and a hemorrhagic tendency. A significant number of patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis have cardiovascular comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, or venous thromboembolism, and different indications for treatment with antithrombotics, whether for primary or secondary prevention. Unfortunately, few randomized controlled trials are available on antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy in dialysis patients. Consequently, cardiology and nephrology guidelines often provide ambiguous recommendations or exclude these patients entirely.

There is a pressing need for an expert consensus to provide physicians with useful information to make informed decisions in scenarios requiring antithrombotics. The European Dialysis Working Group presents up-to-date evidence on this topic, encouraging practitioners to choose among alternatives to limit bleeding and minimize atherothrombotic and cardioembolic risks. In the absence of clear evidence, clinical settings and consequent therapeutic strategies are discussed by highlighting data from observational studies both for and against using antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, either alone or in combination. Until new studies illuminate these unclear clinical situations, the treatment objective should be minimizing thrombotic risk while reducing bleeding events.

### One-month versus three-month dual-antiplatelet therapy in high bleeding risk patients with chronic kidney disease [^112QLWmt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Shortening the duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was shown to be effective and safe in patients at high bleeding risk (HBR). We aimed to investigate the effect of 1- versus 3-month DAPT on outcomes after drug-eluting stent in HBR patients with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data from three prospective single-arm studies (XIENCE Short DAPT Program) enrolling HBR patients after successful coronary implantation of cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stent (XIENCE, Abbott) were analyzed. Subjects were eligible for DAPT discontinuation at 1 or 3 months if free from ischemic events. The primary endpoint was all-cause death or any myocardial infarction. The key secondary endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 2 to 5 bleeding. Outcomes were assessed from 1 to 12 months after PCI. CKD was defined as baseline creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min.

Of 3,286 patients, 1,432 (43.6%) had CKD. One-month versus 3-month DAPT was associated with a similar 12-month risk of the primary outcome irrespective of CKD status (CKD: 9.5% vs. 10.9%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.22; no-CKD: 6.6% vs. 5.6%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.73; p interaction 0.299). Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2 to 5 bleeding rates were numerically but not significantly lower with 1-month versus 3-month DAPT in both CKD (9.9% vs. 12%) and no-CKD (6.4% vs. 9.0%) patients. In conclusion, in HBR patients, 1-month versus 3-month DAPT was associated with a similar risk of ischemic complications.

### Daptomycin [^115EydfX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of daptomycin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, daptomycin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.

### Vafseo [^114wAW69]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease in adults on dialysis**: The efficacy and safety of Vafseo administered once daily for the treatment of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis were demonstrated in two global, multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority, open-label trials. These trials involved a total of 3923 patients with dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) (INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2).

	- **Patients in each trial were randomized in a 1**:1 ratio to receive Vafseo with a starting dose of 300 mg once daily, or darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously or intravenously as per the prescribing information for 52 weeks to assess the efficacy endpoints. Vafseo was titrated in increments of 150 mg up to 600 mg to achieve the hemoglobin (Hb) target. After 52 weeks, patients continued study medication to assess long-term safety until the event-driven major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) endpoints were reached.

	- Efficacy in each study was based on the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period (Weeks 24 to 36). An additional efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the secondary evaluation period (Weeks 40 to 52). MACE was defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke, and was evaluated in both trials.

### Aranesp [^1117DGmp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning**: ESAs increase the risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, thrombosis of vascular access, and tumor progression or recurrence. See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

- **Chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the lowest Aranesp dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.

- **Cancer**: ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers. Use the lowest dose to avoid RBC transfusions. Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy. ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure. Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course.

### Prostate specific antigen levels and prostate cancer detection rates in patients with end stage renal disease [^111EmYy3]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with end stage renal disease and prostate cancer are ineligible to receive a renal transplant at most centers until an acceptable cancer-free period is demonstrated. To our knowledge, previously established prostate specific antigen reference ranges have not been validated in patients with end stage renal disease. We determined age-stratified 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges and the prostate cancer detection rates at specific prostate specific antigen intervals for patients with end stage renal disease.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 775 male patients with end stage renal disease who were on the waiting list for a renal transplant and had undergone a serum prostate specific antigen test. Prostate specific antigen was stratified by age at the time of the blood test, and 95th percentile reference ranges were calculated for each decade. A total of 80 patients underwent prostate biopsy due to increased prostate specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination. We calculated the cancer detection rates for specific prostate specific antigen reference ranges.

The age-specific 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges were identified as follows: 0 to 4.0 ng/ml for ages 40 to 49 in 137 patients; 0 to 5.3 ng/ml for ages 50 to 59 in 257 patients; 0 to 10.5 ng/ml for ages 60 to 69 in 265 patients; and 0 to 16.6 ng/ml for ages 70 to 79 years in 69 patients. The cancer detection rate was 44%, 38%, and 67% for prostate specific antigen levels of 2.5 to 4.0, 4 to 10, and greater than 10 ng/ml, respectively.

### Cancer risk among elderly persons with end-stage renal disease: a population-based case-control study [^111BnQvH]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

In contrast, the strong increase in multiple myeloma risk in the first 1–2 years after ESRD diagnosis, and declining risk over longer time intervals, could be attributed to reverse causality, such that multiple myeloma leads to renal failure. This situation could arise if multiple myeloma was undiagnosed at the initiation of dialysis, or if the diagnosis date is in error in the cancer registry due to delayed reporting. Maisonneuve et al. also noted the excess of multiple myeloma cases and likewise attributed this observation to prevalent cases. Finally, treatment of glomerulonephritis with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may predispose to certain types of cancers such as kidney cancer, bladder cancer, and multiple myeloma.

Our findings of markedly low risk of prostate cancer deserve comment. A biologically protective effect of ESRD seems unlikely, because the inverse association was present only for localized cancer and not for distant/metastatic cancer. We believe that the inverse association instead may be a manifestation of screening. Recommendations for prostate cancer screening using PSA testing and digital rectal examination are presently in flux, but screening has typically been considered only for men who have an extended life expectancy. One possibility is that, due to their lower life expectancy, men with ESRD do not receive screening with the PSA test as frequently as other men, which could lead to an apparent deficit of prostate cancer. Indeed, it is estimated that 40% of prostate cancer cases in the U.S. are detected through PSA testing. Among controls, we found…

A patient with end-stage renal disease received two doses of dalbavancin for a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) arteriovenous fistula infection and presented five weeks later with infective endocarditis secondary to vancomycin, daptomycin, and dalbavancin nonsusceptible MRSA. The resistance was associated with walK and scrA mutations, reduced long-chain lipid content, and reduced membrane fluidity.

### UK Kidney Association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114AwHr4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, with a specific focus on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend maintaining hemoglobin levels between 95 and 115 g/L in children under 2 years of age. This applies to both those with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those receiving dialysis while on ESA therapy, reflecting the lower normal range in that age group.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^117RhEz2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Few drug dosing recommendations for patients receiving home hemodialysis (HHD) have been published, which has hindered the adoption of HHD. HHD regimens vary widely and differ considerably from conventional, thrice-weekly, in-center hemodialysis in terms of treatment frequency, duration, and blood and dialysate flow rates. Consequently, vancomycin and daptomycin clearances in HHD are also likely to be different. Therefore, HHD dosing regimens must be developed to ensure efficacy and minimize toxicity when these antibiotics are used. Many HHD regimens are used clinically; this study modeled ten common HHD regimens and determined optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing for each HHD regimen.

- **Methods**: Monte Carlo simulations using pharmacokinetic data derived from the literature and demographic data from a large HHD program treating patients with end-stage kidney disease were incorporated into a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Virtual vancomycin and daptomycin doses were administered post-HHD, and drug exposures were determined in 5,000 virtual patients receiving ten different HHD regimens. Serum concentration monitoring with subsequent dose changes was incorporated into the vancomycin models. Pharmacodynamic target attainment rates were determined for each studied dose. The lowest possible doses that met predefined targets in virtual patients were chosen as optimal doses.

- **Results**: HHD frequency, total dialysate volumes, and HHD durations influenced drug exposure and led to different dosing regimens to meet targets. Antibiotic dosing regimens were identified.

### Daptomycin use in neutropenic patients with documented gram-positive infections [^113TsYEA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes associated with daptomycin treatment of documented gram-positive infections in patients with neutropenia.

- **Methods**: All patients with neutropenia (≤ 500 cells/m³) and at least one documented gram-positive culture from 2006–2009 were identified from a retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry (Cubicin® Outcome Registry and Experience (CORE®)). Investigators assessed patient outcomes (cured, improved, failed, nonevaluable) at the end of daptomycin therapy. All patients were included in the safety analysis.

- **Results**: The efficacy population comprised 186 patients; 159 (85%) patients experienced either cure (n = 108, 58%) or improvement (n = 51, 27%) as an outcome. Success rates (cure plus improved) based on the lowest white blood cell count during daptomycin treatment were 98/116 (84%) for ≤ 100 cells/m³ and 61/70 (87%) for 101–499 cells/m³ [P = 0.6]. Most patients had cancer; 135/186 (73%) had hematological malignancies, 26/186 (14%) had solid tumors, and 9 (5%) had both. One hundred fifty-six (84%) patients received other antibiotics before daptomycin treatment; 82% received vancomycin, of which 31% failed. The most common infections were bacteremia (78%), skin and skin structure infections (8%), and urinary tract infections/pyelonephritis (6%). The most common pathogens were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (47%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%). The median (min, max) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3.6, 8.3). The median (min, max) duration of daptomycin therapy was…

### Aminoglycosides in hemodialysis patients: Is the current practice of post-dialysis dosing appropriate [^117RU842]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Aminoglycosides have been widely used in end-stage renal failure patients for treating infections caused by gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Traditionally, these agents are administered post-dialysis to avoid premature dialytic clearance, although no studies confirm that this dosing strategy represents the optimal treatment regimen.

In recent years, a more complete understanding of the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of aminoglycosides has led to a global change in clinical practice from multiple to once-daily dosing in patients with normal renal function. The aim has been to provide intermittent pulses to maximize the peak concentration relative to overall drug exposure. These same considerations strongly support the administration of aminoglycosides before, rather than after, hemodialysis.

This study will review the key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations in aminoglycoside dosing, the relationship between serum aminoglycoside concentrations and efficacy/toxicity, the influence of renal function and hemodialysis on aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and the mounting population pharmacokinetic and clinical study evidence supporting a paradigm shift in aminoglycoside dosing from post-dialysis to predialysis.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^116RWgSh]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

This present study also used the previously developed "virtual TDM" technique to mimic the clinical situation and further guide the subsequent dosing for clinicians. The MCS analysis indicated that targeting pre-dialysis concentrations of 20–24 mg/L after one week of our recommended initial regimens would attain and maintain an AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L for the following week in most simulated patients with 10 different HHD settings (Fig. 3). Thus, virtual TDM was designed to target a pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L to ensure target attainment in virtual patients with all simulated HHD settings.

This pre-dialysis concentration target may result in a slightly higher new maintenance dose (MD) than necessary in some HHD settings. For example, the adjusted MD after TDM using this target pre-dialysis concentration in 3-hour HHD occurring 5 times a week resulted in target (AUC 24h ≥ 400 mg∙h/L) attainment in almost all virtual patients, but a higher proportion of patients had AUC 24h ≥ 600 mg∙h/L. However, this pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L was found to be the best predictor for attaining targets in all simulated HHD settings.

This target pre-dialysis concentration of 24 mg/L is also higher than those (15–20 mg/L) recommended in patients receiving thrice weekly intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in the vancomycin consensus guidelines. Of note, this guideline recommendation is based on another MCS study showing that pre-dialysis vancomycin concentrations of 10–20 mg/L would result in mean AUC 24h from 250 to 450 mg∙h/L in patients receiving thrice-weekly IHD. The mean new TDM-based vancomycin MD in all HHD settings was not significantly different.

### Vancomycin and daptomycin dosing recommendations in patients receiving home hemodialysis using Monte Carlo simulation [^116TTNLB]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Few drug dosing recommendations for patients receiving home hemodialysis (HHD) have been published, which has hindered the adoption of HHD. HHD regimens vary widely and differ considerably from conventional, thrice-weekly, in-center hemodialysis in terms of treatment frequency, duration, and blood and dialysate flow rates. Consequently, vancomycin and daptomycin clearances in HHD are also likely to be different; therefore, HHD dosing regimens must be developed to ensure efficacy and minimize toxicity when these antibiotics are used. Many HHD regimens are used clinically. This study modeled ten common HHD regimens and determined optimal vancomycin and daptomycin dosing for each HHD regimen.

- **Methods**: Monte Carlo simulations using pharmacokinetic data derived from the literature and demographic data from a large HHD program treating patients with end-stage kidney disease were incorporated into a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Virtual vancomycin and daptomycin doses were administered post-HHD, and drug exposures were determined in 5,000 virtual patients receiving ten different HHD regimens. Serum concentration monitoring with subsequent dose changes was incorporated into the vancomycin models. Pharmacodynamic target attainment rates were determined for each studied dose. The lowest possible doses that met predefined targets in virtual patients were chosen as optimal doses.

- **Results**: HHD frequency, total dialysate volumes, and HHD durations influenced drug exposure and led to different dosing regimens to meet targets. Antibiotic dosing regimens were identified.

### Procrit [^1119hYfN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In controlled trials for **chronic kidney disease**, patients experienced increased risks of death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not elevate these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. It is advised to use the lowest Procrit dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Cancer** studies revealed that ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To mitigate these risks, along with the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions should be utilized [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. ESAs should be used only for anemia resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)], and are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is a cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)]. Treatment should be discontinued after completing a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Perisurgical** considerations include a recommendation for Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis due to increased DVT risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Optimizing renal replacement therapy in older adults: A framework for making individualized decisions [^114aEjGL]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

It is often difficult to synthesize information about the risks and benefits of recommended management strategies in older patients with end-stage renal disease since they may have more comorbidity and lower life expectancy than patients described in clinical trials or practice guidelines. In this review, we outline a framework for individualizing end-stage renal disease management decisions in older patients.

The framework considers three factors: life expectancy, the risks and benefits of competing treatment strategies, and patient preferences. We illustrate the use of this framework by applying it to three key end-stage renal disease decisions in older patients with varying life expectancy: choice of dialysis modality, choice of vascular access for hemodialysis, and referral for kidney transplantation.

In several instances, this approach might provide support for treatment decisions that directly contradict available practice guidelines, illustrating circumstances when strict application of guidelines may be inappropriate for certain patients. By combining quantitative estimates of benefits and harms with qualitative assessments of patient preferences, clinicians may be better able to tailor treatment recommendations to individual older patients, thereby improving the overall quality of end-stage renal disease care.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO/ASH clinical practice guideline update [^1129kt37]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cancer-related anemia, specifically with respect to initial assessment, ASCO/ASH 2019 guidelines recommend eliciting appropriate history, performing a physical examination, and obtaining diagnostic tests. The aim is to identify alternative causes of anemia aside from chemotherapy or an underlying hematopoietic malignancy. Such causes should be appropriately addressed before offering ESAs.

### Benefit and risk of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation in patients with chronic kidney disease: A nationwide cohort study [^117T96dE]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not clearly established. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with 6–12 months (standard) versus 12–24 months (prolonged) DAPT according to CKD.

- **Methods**: Using a nationwide, claim-based database, we retrospectively evaluated the association between DAPT duration and clinical outcomes, including death, composite ischemic events, and composite bleeding events between 1 and 3 years after PCI. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Of 73,941 eligible patients, 13,425 (18.2%) had CKD, and 49,019 (66%) were prescribed prolonged DAPT. Prolonged DAPT had no significant impact on the risk of clinical outcomes in patients with normal renal function.

- **Results**: In patients with CKD, prolonged DAPT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.95) and composite ischemic events (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78–0.96), and a higher risk of composite bleeding events (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02–1.37). The benefit of prolonged DAPT on reducing composite ischemic events increased significantly in patients with worsened renal dysfunction (p interaction = 0.02), while there was no significant interaction between its bleeding risk and renal dysfunction (p interaction = 0.22).

- **Conclusions**: While standard DAPT would be recommended in patients with normal renal function, a tailored decision for DAPT duration should be considered in those with CKD to balance the benefits and risks effectively.

### We give aminoglycoside antibiotics at the end of hemodialysis [^1129Ypgd]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

We often administer dialyzable medications after dialysis to ensure that adequate concentrations are maintained in the body until the next session. In the case of aminoglycosides, we may have the opportunity to dose more aggressively predialysis and then use the clearance of the drug by dialysis to limit toxicities. Predialysis aminoglycoside dosing is intriguing, although studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of this approach are necessary before it can be used routinely.

### Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in chronic kidney disease patients with cancer [^111p9hYC]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of anemia remains an important component in the care of patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) remain a key anemia treatment strategy in this patient population. However, anemia management in this group can become more complicated by a history of malignancy. There has been a great deal of scientific work and clinical trials in oncology that have revealed certain concerns and risks of ESA use in patients with cancer. In this review, we bring together knowledge from nephrology and oncology literature to help nephrologists understand the implications for ESA treatment when CKD/ESRD is complicated by cancer. We also suggest an approach to the management of anemia in this patient group with active or previous malignancy.

### Retacrit [^117Mnf1a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, controlled trials have indicated that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Use the lowest Retacrit dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Cancer**: ESAs have been shown to shorten overall survival and/or increase the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. To decrease these risks, and the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Use ESAs only for anemia resulting from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is a cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)]. Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Perisurgery**: Due to the increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), DVT prophylaxis is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^11529EC7]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly in relation to iron therapy monitoring, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend measuring hemoglobin concentration in patients with anemia of CKD when clinically indicated and at least at the following intervals according to the stage of CKD:

- **Stage 3–5, non-dialysis or peritoneal dialysis**: Every 3 months
- **Stage 5, on hemodialysis**: Every month.

### Nosocomial infection with vancomycin-dependent enterococci [^1179bWDn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Renal insufficiency was the other risk factor identified in our study. The ecological impact of vancomycin exposure is magnified and extended in patients with renal insufficiency, especially those with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis (all 3 of our patients and 5 of the 16 previously reported cases), where a single dose persists in the patient's body for many days. The emergence of novel strains of Staphylococcus aureus exhibiting resistance to vancomycin has also been reported in this clinical setting. The prevalence of nosocomial infection or colonization with VDE can only be determined by the use of media containing vancomycin when processing cultures from patients at risk for VDE infection, namely those who have had prolonged exposure to vancomycin or third-generation cephalosporins, especially if they are already known to be colonized or infected by VRE.

These infections are clearly not trivial, although their clinical importance remains to be fully determined. Five of the 16 previously reported VDE infections were bacteremias. VDE was considered the immediate cause of death in one of our patients and a contributory cause in another. Green et al. reported the spontaneous reversion of VDE to nondependence at 1 in 10⁶, which we confirmed in all three of our strains. Thus, vancomycin discontinuation alone may not be sufficient to treat patients with VDE infection, especially if the patient has renal failure.

The best management of infection with VDE — beyond source control and treatment with linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, or daptomycin — remains to be determined.

### Dapzura RT [^1159bYZb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In the event of overdosage, supportive care is advised with maintenance of glomerular filtration. Daptomycin is cleared slowly from the body by hemodialysis, with approximately 15% of the administered dose removed over 4 hours, and by peritoneal dialysis, with approximately 11% of the administered dose removed over 48 hours. The use of high-flux dialysis membranes during 4 hours of hemodialysis may increase the percentage of the dose removed compared to that removed by low-flux membranes.

### Daptomycin [^116T5Equ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage in patients with renal impairment**:

	- **Adult patients**: No dosage adjustment is required for adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) greater than or equal to 30 mL/min. For those with CLCR less than 30 mL/min, including those on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the recommended dosage regimen is 4 mg/kg for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) or 6 mg/kg for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections, administered once every 48 hours. When possible, administer daptomycin for injection after hemodialysis on dialysis days [see warnings and precautions (5.2, 5.10), use in specific populations (8.6), and clinical pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Pediatric patients**: The dosage regimen for pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been established.

- **Preparation and administration of daptomycin for injection**:

	- There are different formulations of daptomycin with variations in reconstitution and storage. It is critical to adhere to the reconstitution and storage procedures outlined in the labeling.

	- **Reconstitution of daptomycin for injection vial**: Daptomycin for injection comes in single-dose vials, each containing 500 mg of daptomycin as a sterile, lyophilized powder. Reconstitute the contents of the vial with 0.9% sodium chloride injection, using aseptic technique, to achieve a concentration of 50 mg/mL as follows:

		- To minimize foaming, avoid vigorous agitation or shaking of the vial during or after reconstitution.

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^114aoceA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may differ in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients undergoing any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021, through contact with the Information Specialist and using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD or included people in broader at-risk populations for which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias.

### Single-dose daptomycin pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients [^111xExsp]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Daptomycin has concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and its usage is increasing in haemodialysis units. The manufacturer recommends a 4–6 mg/kg dose administered every 48 hours for patients receiving haemodialysis. However, there are no published data about daptomycin pharmacokinetics and clearance during haemodialysis. The recommended dosing regimen could conflict with asymmetric thrice-weekly haemodialysis, which yields two ~44-hour and one ~68-hour interdialytic periods. This study is the first to evaluate daptomycin pharmacokinetics in haemodialysis patients, assess the extent of daptomycin dialytic removal, and model serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hours.

- **Methods**: Six otherwise healthy subjects on chronic haemodialysis (55.3 ± 16.1 years old, three females, 66.2 ± 14.2 kg) received a single 6 mg/kg dose of daptomycin post-haemodialysis, infused over 30 minutes. Serial blood samples were collected for ~44 hours (pre-next haemodialysis) and throughout the subsequent haemodialysis session with a high permeability haemodialyser. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters determined by compartmental analysis were used to model trough serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hours with 6-, 8-, and 10-mg/kg post-haemodialysis doses.

- **Results**: The haemodialysis session in this trial yielded mean urea and daptomycin reduction ratios of 79.6 ± 5.8% and 57.6 ± 9.2%, respectively. Daptomycin half-life was 19.4 ± 6.5 and 3.8 ± 1.1 hours 'off' and 'on haemodialysis', respectively, with minimal rebound 1 hour post-haemodialysis.

Regarding the use of daptomycin IV (also known as Cubicin, Cubicin RF, Dapzura TR) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- **Dosing guidelines**: Dose as in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Start at a dose of 4 mg with a maximal dose of 6 mg. The maximal frequency is q48h.
- **Monitoring parameters**: Monitor serum creatinine. Additionally, monitor for myopathy.

### Use of daptomycin in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal urinary tract infections: A short case series [^112WXoKc]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

As determined using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, CKD 2 indicates a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m², CKD 3 indicates a GFR of 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m², and CKD 4–5 indicates a GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

Follow-up durations included microbiologic assessment (urine culture) performed approximately 3 days, with clinical assessments conducted up to approximately 7 days post-treatment.

- **Use of unusually high per-weight dose**: The high dose was recommended by the ID specialist for the concomitant management of Staphylococcus spp. bacteremia.

- **ID consult**: This resulted in the clinical decision to treat every 24 hours instead of every 48 hours for more rapid results in this patient.

Daptomycin-based courses of antibiotic treatment achieved clinical cure and successful eradication of VRE in all patients in this representative sample of a diverse patient population in our medical facility. Indwelling catheters are common sites of infection, and similar results of daptomycin treatment were observed in patients with and without Foley catheters. Daptomycin was effective at eradicating VRE in patients regardless of whether they had had previous UTIs. Additionally, daptomycin eradicated VRE regardless of the level of renal function. Overall, daptomycin was well tolerated, and no reports of adverse events such as alteration of kidney function, muscle weakness or pain, and elevated levels of CPK enzymes were included. For most patients, CPK levels were measured at the time of daptomycin therapy initiation and once or twice more in the following 7 to 10 days. Even for the patient receiving the highest dose (13 mg/kg, patient 3), no elevation was above the normal CPK range.

### Change in hemoglobin trajectory and darbepoetin dose approaching end-stage renal disease: Data from the trial to reduce cardiovascular events with aranesp therapy trial [^112yg1RN]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease-associated anemia is multifactorial and includes decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), iron deficiency, inflammation, and EPO resistance. To better understand the trajectory of these parameters, we described temporal trends in hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, transferrin saturation, C-reactive protein (CRP), and darbepoetin dosing in the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT).

- **Methods**: We performed a post hoc analysis of 4,038 participants in TREAT. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to determine the trajectory of parameters of interest prior to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine the overall differences in biomarker values and differences in trajectories between those who did and did not develop ESRD.

- **Results**: Hb declined precipitously in the year prior to the development of ESRD (irrespective of treatment assignment), and was on average 1.15 g/dL (95% CI -1.26 to -1.04) lower in those who developed ESRD versus those who did not, at the time of ESRD/end of follow-up. Simultaneously, the mean darbepoetin dose and CRP concentration increased, while serum ferritin and transferrin saturations were > 140 μg/L and 20%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Our analyses provide descriptive insights regarding the temporal changes of Hb, darbepoetin dose, and related parameters as ESRD approaches in participants of TREAT. Hb declined as much as 1–2 years prior to the development of ESRD, without biochemical evidence of iron deficiency.

### Vafseo [^115sEGck]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety of Vafseo has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults not on dialysis, and its use is not recommended in this setting [see Indications and Usage (1)].

In large clinical trials in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis (PRO2TECT-1 and PRO2TECT-2), an increased risk of mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, serious acute kidney injury, serious hepatic injury, and serious gastrointestinal erosions was observed in patients treated with Vafseo compared to darbepoetin alfa.

- **Malignancy**: Because increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 levels may be associated with unfavorable effects on cancer growth, Vafseo has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. In the INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2 clinical trials, malignancies were observed in 2.2% (1.3 per 100 PY) of patients treated with Vafseo and 3.0% (1.8 per 100 PY) of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### C.E.R. A. once every 4 weeks corrects anaemia and maintains haemoglobin in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis [^1163fAPf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Stable response, defined as ≥ 75% of the scheduled Hb values within the range of 10–12 g/dL and ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline for any 8-week time period, regardless of the requirement for dose adjustment, was found in 105 patients (68.6%) treated with C.E.R. A. compared with 112 patients (72.7%) treated with darbepoetin alfa, which was not significant. The total number of patients requiring any dose change to achieve a stable Hb response under this definition was similar in the C.E.R. A. and darbepoetin alfa treatment groups, with 65 patients (61.9%) versus 64 patients (57.1%), respectively, also not significant. The mean number of dose changes per patient associated with a stable response was very similar between treatment groups, with 1.12 for C.E.R. A. and 1.10 for darbepoetin alfa.

Multiple dose adjustments (≥ 5 adjustments) were required by fewer patients treated with C.E.R. A. compared with those receiving darbepoetin alfa during the study (10.7% versus 21.3%, respectively). Correspondingly, the change in median dose from baseline to evaluation with C.E.R. A. was very small compared with the dose change in patients treated with darbepoetin alfa (6.6% versus 35.6%, respectively).

Ten patients (6.5%) in the darbepoetin alfa group received one or more transfusions compared with five patients (3.3%) in the C.E.R. A. group, which was not significant. The reasons given for transfusions were similar in the two treatment groups.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: Problems and solutions. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels. To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base.

The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline-developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources in generating a common evidence report, whose recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally. This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### Exjade [^1118ZVkj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Renal failure, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage**:

- **Renal failure**: Exjade can cause acute renal failure and death, particularly in patients with comorbidities and those who are in the advanced stages of their hematologic disorders. Evaluate baseline renal function prior to starting or increasing Exjade dosing in all patients. Exjade is contraindicated in adult and pediatric patients with an eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m². Measure serum creatinine in duplicate prior to initiation of therapy. Monitor renal function at least monthly. For patients with baseline renal impairment or increased risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function weekly for the first month, then at least monthly. Reduce the starting dose in patients with preexisting renal disease. During therapy, increase the frequency of monitoring and modify the dose for patients with an increased risk of renal impairment, including use of concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, and pediatric patients with volume depletion or overchelation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

- **Hepatic failure**: Exjade can cause hepatic injury including hepatic failure and death. Measure serum transaminases and bilirubin in all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 2 weeks during the first month, and at least monthly thereafter. Avoid use of Exjade in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment and reduce the dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions].

### Daptomycin in the treatment of bacteremia [^113sRWzv]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience with daptomycin in the treatment of bacteremia. Patients with a diagnosis of catheter-related or non-catheter-related bacteremia and no other concurrent infection were identified from the Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) 2004. Treatment success was determined by investigators using protocol criteria and defined as cure or improvement.

Of 168 patients with bacteremia, 126 were clinically evaluable. Of those, 52 (41%) patients were aged ≥ 66 years, 54 (43%) received daptomycin in an intensive care unit, and 25 (20%) had chronic renal failure. The most common pathogens isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (33%), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (30%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (30%).

Of the 126 patients, 86% received daptomycin after previous antibiotic therapy and most (69%) received concomitant antibiotics with daptomycin. Daptomycin therapy was started at a median dose of 4.0 mg/kg (range, 2.5 to 9.2 mg/kg).

Daptomycin therapy had an overall clinical success rate of 89%. Clinical success was independent of baseline renal function, daptomycin dose, pathogen, first-line use, or concomitant antibiotic therapy. These results support the findings of a recent study in which daptomycin was demonstrated to be an effective option in the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia.

Data in the study provide insight into the clinical experience using daptomycin to treat bacteremia caused by other gram-positive pathogens. Given the limitations of retrospective studies and lack of further information, more research is necessary.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: Reading between the (guide)line(s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist health-care providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on evidence and expert judgment.

Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Retacrit [^113ZqoMV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For pediatric patients with CKD, initiate Retacrit treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 12 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of Retacrit. The recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (ages 1 month or older) is 50 Units/kg 3 times weekly, either intravenously or subcutaneously.

For patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer, physicians should refer to warnings and precautions (5.1 and 5.2).

- **Zidovudine-treated patients with HIV infection**:
	- **Starting dose**: The recommended starting dose in adults is 100 Units/kg as an intravenous or subcutaneous injection 3 times per week.
	- **Dose adjustment**: If hemoglobin does not increase after 8 weeks of therapy, increase the Retacrit dose by approximately 50 to 100 Units/kg at 4- to 8-week intervals until hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusions or 300 Units/kg. Withhold Retacrit if hemoglobin exceeds 12 g/dL. Resume therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose when hemoglobin declines to less than 11 g/dL.

Discontinue Retacrit if an increase in hemoglobin is not achieved at a dose of 300 Units/kg for 8 weeks.

### Higher hemoglobin levels and quality of life in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: No longer a moving target [^115d8Nyb]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

International clinical practice guidelines for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease suggest target hemoglobin levels ≤ 11.5 g/dl (115 g/l), with individualized consideration of slightly higher hemoglobin targets to improve quality of life. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials demonstrates no significant improvement in quality of life with erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy targeting higher hemoglobin levels. Limitations of the available data suggest that individualized targets should nonetheless remain an option in future clinical practice guidelines.

### Aligning kidney function assessment in patients with cancer to global practices in internal medicine [^115tmXwa]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

We recommend the use of eGFR CKD-EPI to guide the dosing of anticancer drugs whose dose is dependent on kidney function, except in specific clinical situations or for a select group of anticancer drugs where eGFR CKD-EPI may be unsuitable.

- **Evidence quality/certainty**: Clinical consensus; strength of recommendation: strong.

- **Directly measured GFR is preferred to guide the initial dosing**:
	- For a select group of anticancer drugs, including but not limited to carboplatin, cisplatin, and methotrexate (≥ 500 mg/m²).
	- For anticancer drugs whose dose is dependent on kidney function in specific clinical situations, including but not limited to patients with extremes of body size or muscle mass, amputees, and persons with paraplegia or conditions of skeletal muscle.

- **eGFR CKD-EPI adjusted to an individual's body surface area (BSA) is not routinely advised to guide dosing of anticancer drugs over standardized eGFR CKD-EPI, except for carboplatin**. Anticancer drug dosing based on weight descriptors (e.g. BSA, weight) may impact the performance of BSA-adjusted eGFR CKD-EPI to guide dosing, especially as body size/composition will be accounted for twice in dose calculation.

- **BSA-adjusted eGFR CKD-EPI is a suitable alternative to directly measured GFR for use in the Calvert formula when dosing carboplatin**, especially where eGFR CKD-EPI is 45–125 mL/min/1.73 m², the treatment intent is non-curative, and the patient is neither an amputee, paraplegic nor has conditions of skeletal muscle, and is without extremes of body size or muscle mass.

### Cancer risk among elderly persons with end-stage renal disease: a population-based case-control study [^115ZAAcu]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an elevated cancer risk. Cancer risk increases with age, but associations of ESRD with specific malignancies are incompletely studied for older individuals.

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based case-control study (1,029,695 cancer and 99,610 controls) among the U.S. elderly using SEER-Medicare linked data. We defined ESRD as the presence of dialysis claims in the three months prior to selection.

- **Results**: Although ESRD was not associated with excess cancer risk overall (odds ratio 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.91–1.14), risk was specifically increased for cancers of the stomach (1.45; 1.16–1.81), small intestine (1.92; 1.27–2.92), colon (1.17; 1.00–1.36), liver (1.53; 1.16–2.01), biliary tract (1.78; 1.20–2.65), lung (1.17; 1.02–1.34), cervix (2.12; 1.39–3.23), kidney (2.42; 2.01–2.92), and for multiple myeloma (1.77; 1.40–2.24) and chronic myeloid leukemia (1.74; 1.08–2.80). The association between liver cancer and ESRD was attenuated upon adjustment for hepatitis B and C infection or diabetes mellitus. Multiple myeloma risk was highest with short ESRD duration (p < 0.0001), possibly reflecting reverse causality, while kidney cancer risk showed a borderline rise over time (p = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: Among elderly individuals with ESRD, the excess risks for some cancers may reflect immune dysfunction or a high prevalence of other risk factors, such as viral infections or diabetes mellitus. Our results underscore the need for studying biological pathways of carcinogenesis in ESRD.

### Cancer patterns and association with mortality and renal outcomes in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: a matched cohort study [^1138xHRr]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

In Cox proportional hazard models, a cancer history at baseline showed a strong association with all-cause mortality in the univariate model (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.39–1.93; p < 0.001). The strength of association persisted in all four multivariate models developed by adding covariates in a stepwise manner. In a multivariate model (model 4) in the matched sample, which included all initial clinical and demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, and eGFR, the presence of cancer showed an independent association with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.12–1.78; p = 0.004).

- **Multivariate models**:
	- **Model 1**: Adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity.
	- **Model 2**: Adjusted for all covariates of model 1 plus smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus.
	- **Model 3**: Adjusted for all covariates of model 2 plus ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease.
	- **Model 4**: Adjusted for all covariates of model 3 plus estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI).

There was no clear correlation observed between cancer status and reaching end-stage renal disease (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.81–1.25; p = 0.97). Additionally, CKD progression, as determined by the rate of decline in eGFR, was not different between the groups (cancer patients −0.96 versus −1.24 mL).

HR - Hazard ratio, CI - Confidence interval. Statistically significant p-values are displayed in bold (i.e. p < 0.05).

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^113cf2UM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 3.1 - Treatment of anaemia - Erythropoiesis stimulating agents**: We recommend that treatment with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) should be offered to patients with anaemia of CKD who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function and to avoid blood transfusion, especially in patients considered suitable for transplantation (1B).

	- **Audit Measure**: Proportion of patients on renal replacement therapy (on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3 months) with Hb level < 100 g/L who are not prescribed an ESA.

	- **Rationale**: Treatment of anaemia in CKD with ESA can be expensive, takes time to work, and carries a small but significant risk to the patient. It is therefore reasonable, as with any therapy, to treat only those who are expected to benefit in the time frame that therapy is being considered. For example, patients with severe sepsis, inflammation, or acute bleeding are unlikely to respond. Patients with a very short life expectancy (days or weeks) are not likely to survive long enough for therapy to provide benefit in terms of an increase in Hb. The clinician and patient should agree on a therapeutic plan and, at an appropriate time, review whether therapy is providing enough benefit to continue treatment.

- **Guideline 3.2 - Treatment of anaemia - Choice of ESA**: We recommend that the decision on the choice of ESA is based on the local availability of ESAs (1B).

	- **Audit Measure**: Each renal unit should audit the type, route and frequency of administration, and weekly dose of ESA prescribed.

	- **Rationale**: Many studies have been published.

### Dosing of daptomycin in intensive care unit patients with acute kidney injury undergoing extended dialysis — a pharmacokinetic study [^112z13q9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

Daptomycin is a new intravenous cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, licensed for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, including both susceptible and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. It is also used for treating various infections due to susceptible organisms, including serious and life-threatening Gram-positive infections, vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, and right-sided endocarditis with associated bacteremia. Currently, no dosing recommendations exist for this drug for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing renal replacement therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in critically ill patients with AKI undergoing extended dialysis (ED), a frequently used means of renal replacement therapies in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. A prospective, single-dose pharmacokinetic study was performed in the medical and surgical ICUs of a tertiary care center. The aim was to investigate critically ill patients with anuric AKI being treated with ED and receiving daptomycin (n = 10). Daptomycin (6 mg/kg) was administered 8 hours before ED was started.

- **Results**: Key pharmacokinetic parameters like half-life in critically ill patients treated with ED were comparable to healthy controls. The dialyzer clearance for daptomycin was 63 ± 9 ml/min. Based on the amount of the drug recovered from the collected spent dialysate, the mean fraction of the drug removed by one dialysis treatment was 23.3%.

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that pat

### Comparative effectiveness studies to improve clinical outcomes in end stage renal disease: The DEcIDE patient outcomes in end stage renal disease study [^117AR7F9]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for End-stage Renal Disease (CHOICE) study is a longitudinal observational cohort study of 1,041 incident dialysis patients. Originally funded by AHRQ, it measures several aspects of patients' experiences and outcomes related to their choice of renal replacement therapy. The CHOICE study includes a highly demographically diverse sample of patients cared for across the US in urban and rural settings, receiving either peritoneal dialysis or in-center hemodialysis. With initial enrollment in 1995 and ongoing passive follow-up, the CHOICE study population has more detailed information about comorbidity, laboratory data, process of care, and clinical outcomes than registries and other retrospective data sources, enhancing its benefits for use in effectiveness studies. CHOICE data are linked to the USRDS registry to obtain information on patients' health conditions and health care utilization. Additionally, CHOICE data are linked to the National Death Index to confirm patients' vital status and cause-specific mortality, which are verified through comprehensive chart reviews.

Dialysis Clinic, Inc (DCI) is the largest non-profit provider of dialysis care and the third largest dialysis provider in the US, serving approximately 13,000 patients at 209 dialysis facilities in 27 states. The population of patients within DCI is diverse and demographically representative of the US dialysis population, with an overrepresentation of African Americans. Information about comorbid conditions, hospitalization dates, oral and intravenous medications, and quality of life is also available.

**Dosage modification for end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis**: No starting dose adjustment is required in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. However, given the decreased exposure compared to patients with normal renal function, subsequent doses may be increased gradually up to 2-fold based on safety and tolerability [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114iX4WB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, particularly in relation to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring hemoglobin concentration every 2–4 weeks during the correction phase or following a dose adjustment. For stable patients in the maintenance phase of ESA treatment, monitoring should occur every 1–3 months. More frequent monitoring should be considered based on clinical circumstances.

### Anemia management in cancer patients with chronic kidney disease [^116mv3W4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2019). Low credibility.

Cancer and kidney disease are linked by causality and comorbidities. Observational data show an increased risk of malignancy as renal function declines. Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), which are the cornerstone therapy for anemia patients with chronic kidney disease and cancer, are associated with increased risks for cancer, cancer-related mortality, progression of disease, and thromboembolic events. This article examines the recently published guidelines for ESA use in cancer patients from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology and attempts to contextualize them to the care of patients with coexistent CKD, cancer, and anemia.

### Aranesp [^116okFQs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When treating patients who have chronic kidney disease and cancer, physicians should refer to Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2).

- **Conversion from epoetin alfa to Aranesp in patients with CKD on dialysis**: Aranesp is administered less frequently than epoetin alfa. Administer Aranesp once weekly in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa 2 to 3 times weekly. Administer Aranesp once every 2 weeks in patients who were receiving epoetin alfa once weekly. Estimate the starting weekly dose of Aranesp for adults and pediatric patients on the basis of the weekly epoetin alfa dose at the time of substitution. Maintain the route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous injection). For pediatric patients receiving a weekly epoetin alfa dose of < 1,500 Units/week, the available data are insufficient to determine an Aranesp conversion dose.

- **Conversion from epoetin alfa to Aranesp in patients with CKD not on dialysis**: Refer to Table 1. The dose conversion depicted in Table 1 does not accurately estimate the once monthly dose of Aranesp.

- **Patients on cancer chemotherapy**: Initiate Aranesp in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL, and if there is a minimum of two additional months of planned chemotherapy. Use the lowest dose of Aranesp necessary to avoid RBC transfusions.

- **Recommended starting dose**: The recommended starting dose and schedules are: 2.25 mcg/kg every week subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course; 500 mcg every 3 weeks subcutaneously until completion of a chemotherapy course.

### The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with CKD and cancer: A clinical approach [^115Qds9R]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been used to manage anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce transfusion requirements and anemia symptoms. The lack of objective benefit from normalizing hemoglobin (Hb) levels and increased evidence of ESA-induced complications in persons with anemia has resulted in clinicians generally attempting to maintain Hb levels in the 10- to 11-g/dL range. In 2000, concerns arose in patients with cancer due to associations of ESA use with increased mortality, thrombotic complications, and cerebrovascular accidents, which led to a change in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration oncology guidelines regarding the limitation of ESA use for chemotherapy-induced anemia. However, no guidance was provided for individuals with CKD and cancer.

Persons with CKD with remote or active malignancy should receive the lowest ESA doses possible that achieve a maximum Hb level of 10 g/dL. Based on data, although ESAs may promote progression or worsen outcomes in some cancers, there is a lack of evidence that ESAs increase the likelihood of developing new cancers in patients on dialysis or in earlier stages of CKD.

### The efficacy of daptomycin versus vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in patients with impaired renal function [^115r6gMk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Concerns regarding the efficacy of daptomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections in patients with impaired renal function are reflected in a recent package insert change by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, this decision was based on a small subgroup analysis, and it is unclear if this is a true association.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with MRSA bacteremia treated at a tertiary hospital from 2001 to 2011 who received either vancomycin or daptomycin. We used propensity score and multivariable logistic regression to assess the outcome of treatment failure via blinded adjudication, in daptomycin- vs. vancomycin-treated subjects and the interaction with renal function.

- **Results**: One hundred fifty patients were analyzed, 100 in the vancomycin arm and 50 in the daptomycin arm. The average age was 61 years, and 60% were men. Of the patients treated with daptomycin or vancomycin, 29 (58%) and 51 (51%), respectively, had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 50 mL/minute/1.73 m². There was an odds ratio (OR) of 0.45 (95% confidence interval, .11–1.79) for daptomycin-treated patients and OR of 0.46 (95% CI, .11–1.94) for those with a GFR of < 50 mL/minute/1.73 m². There was no significant interaction between them (P = 0.54).

- **Conclusions**: In patients with MRSA bacteremia, daptomycin efficacy was not affected by GFR level and was similar to vancomycin.

### Diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease in advanced and end-stage renal disease [^115ee2t1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that in patients undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery performed less than 4 to 6 months after BMS or DES implantation, DAPT should be continued unless the relative risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit of preventing stent thrombosis. Furthermore, DAPT should be continued for at least 6 months in patients with DESs if the risk of surgical delay is greater than the risk of DES thrombosis. Importantly, the ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend that perioperative management of DAPT should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team, including the operating surgeon, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and patient, to weigh the risks of bleeding and stent thrombosis in an individualized fashion.

Important factors to consider in perioperative DAPT management are the type, number, and size of stents versus the risk of delaying renal transplantation in favor of prolonging DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis. Newer generations of DESs with enhanced biocompatibility and reduced thrombogenicity may require only 1 to 6 months of DAPT, depending on the type of stent, but more evidence is needed. These considerations highlight that DAPT should be tailored to the individual patient. For example, patients requiring multivessel PCI with the use of a DES for lesions involving coronary ostia, long lesions, bifurcation lesions, or chronic total occlusions, or cases in which the minimal stent area achieved is small, may benefit from a prolonged course of DAPT. In contrast, patients with a high bleeding risk or single-vessel disease who undergo procedures may require a different approach.

### Management conundrum in a case of renal cell cancer (RCC) on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for recently placed coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) [^117J57FC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A man in his 50s presented in an emergency with breathlessness and chest discomfort. Upon evaluation, he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease, with more than 80% narrowing of the right coronary and left circumflex arteries. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and was started on dual antiplatelet (DAPT) therapy. After starting DAPT, the patient developed gross haematuria with a drop in haematocrit. Further evaluation revealed a left renal mass with urinary bladder clots.

Because of the risk of stent thrombosis on stopping DAPT, radical nephrectomy was deferred. The patient underwent left renal artery angioembolisation and bladder clot evacuation. On follow-up, the patient was stable with a gradual decrease in renal mass size. After a year, the patient underwent definitive surgery. The patient is doing well in four years of follow-up with no metastasis.

### Renal function and clinical outcome of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism randomized to receive apixaban or dalteparin. Results from the Caravaggio trial [^116L7zkv]. Haematologica (2022). High credibility.

The Caravaggio trial was a multinational, prospective, randomized, open-label, with blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE), non-inferiority study aimed at assessing whether oral apixaban was non-inferior to dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer. The rationale, design, and results of the Caravaggio study were described previously.

The trial was performed in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. The protocol and its amendments were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each trial center. All patients provided written informed consent.

Consecutive adult patients with cancer who had symptomatic or incidental acute proximal DVT or PE were randomized to receive oral apixaban (10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily) or subcutaneous dalteparin (200 IU per kilogram of body weight once daily for the first month, followed by 150 IU per kilogram once daily) for 6 months. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in the online supplementary data. Only patients with baseline creatinine assessment at randomization were included in this pre-specified analysis.

Patients were excluded if their creatinine clearance was less than 30 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Renal impairment (RI) was classified into the conventional five stages.

- **Study outcomes**: This analysis has two co-primary outcomes: major bleeding and recurrent venous thromboembolism (reVTE).

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^116EG7JK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may differ for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased.

- **Objective**: To summarize the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD.

- **Search methods**: In January 2011, we conducted a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials comparing any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD or included people in broader at-risk populations where data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and participants at risk, which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data was pooled using the random-effects model.

### Dapzura RT [^11757pSt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Decreased efficacy in patients with moderate baseline renal impairment**: Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding the clinical efficacy of daptomycin for injection treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CLCR) < 50 mL/min. Only 31 out of 534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin for injection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min. In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], were lower in daptomycin for injection-treated adult patients with baseline CLCR < 50 mL/min. A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 6 was not observed in comparator-treated patients. Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment.

- **Risk in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI)**: Dapzura RT contains sorbitol, an inactive ingredient, and may precipitate a metabolic crisis that could include, but is not limited to, life-threatening hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic failure in patients with HFI. The minimum amount of sorbitol at which serious adverse reactions may occur in these patients is not known. Obtain a careful history of

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116zSyq8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend achieving hemoglobin levels between 100 and 120 g/L in adults, young patients, and children aged ≥ 2 years with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) or those receiving dialysis on ESA therapy.
