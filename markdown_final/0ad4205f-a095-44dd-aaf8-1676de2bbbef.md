## Question

what labs do i need to evaluate hyperhidrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests are needed to evaluate hyperhidrosis and how to decide when to order them based on the clinical presentation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing primary focal hyperhidrosis from secondary generalized hyperhidrosis. Then, I should verify which red flags mandate laboratory evaluation. Next, I will outline a tiered testing strategy for secondary causes, starting with first-line screens and escalating to targeted endocrine and oncologic workups. After that, I need to consider special populations and medication-induced cases. Finally, I will integrate quality-of-life tools and summarize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check each recommendation against guidelines and key reviews before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework, because I need to ensure I am not over-ordering tests in primary focal disease. Primary focal hyperhidrosis is typically bilateral, symmetric, localized to palms, soles, axillae, or craniofacial regions, begins before age 25, and lacks systemic features; in contrast, secondary hyperhidrosis tends to be generalized or asymmetric, starts later, and may be accompanied by weight change, fevers, flushing, or medication use, so I should anchor on this distinction before ordering any labs [^115JdZ68] [^1118MAeV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most patients with classic primary focal hyperhidrosis do not require laboratory testing, and diagnosis is clinical. I should double-check that assertion against the literature and consensus statements, which indeed emphasize that routine labs are unnecessary in typical primary cases and that subjective severity scales correlate reasonably with objective measures, supporting a clinical diagnosis in this phenotype [^111zVNpE].

> Next, I should review red flags that mandate a secondary workup. I need to ensure I do not miss these. Generalized, asymmetric, unilateral, or new-onset sweating after age 40, diaphoresis with fever, weight loss, flushing, palpitations, tremor, or features suggesting endocrine tumors should prompt targeted laboratory evaluation. Likewise, a new medication temporal relationship or a family history of tumor syndromes increases pretest probability and justifies testing [^1118MAeV] [^117VKxAY].

> For first-line screening when secondary hyperhidrosis is suspected, I will now examine the core tests that efficiently cover common etiologies. Let me verify the essentials. A reasonable initial panel includes TSH to screen for hyperthyroidism, a basic metabolic panel with renal and hepatic indices, fasting glucose or HbA1c for dysglycemia, and a CBC to assess for infection, hematologic disease, or occult malignancy; I should confirm that these align with primary care and endocrine guidance for undifferentiated presentations with systemic features, which they do [^116xqtXM] [^115sC2c5].

> Wait, I should verify thyroid testing strategy nuances so I do not overcall disease. TSH is the appropriate first test for suspected thyrotoxicosis; if TSH is abnormal, free T4 helps define overt versus subclinical disease, and in patients already on levothyroxine or when central disease is suspected, concurrent free T4 with TSH is prudent to avoid missing central etiologies; repeating TSH in 3–6 months is sensible given biological variability and assay limitations before labeling someone as hyperthyroid [^116xqtXM] [^111gYAAK] [^116XK1nC].

> If clinical features raise concern for catecholamine-secreting tumors, I should confirm the best initial biochemical test. Fractionated plasma metanephrines offer high sensitivity for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma but have lower specificity in sporadic cases, especially with advancing age; thus, I need to interpret positive results cautiously and consider repeating testing or using 24-hour urine metanephrines in equivocal scenarios to reduce false positives [^117VKxAY] [^117VKxAY].

> But wait, what if the phenotype suggests acromegaly? I should double-check the recommended first test. Serum IGF-1 is the initial laboratory screen when acromegaly is suspected, with oral glucose suppression testing reserved for elevated or equivocal IGF-1 results; hyperhidrosis can be a cutaneous clue in this context, so I should integrate the full phenotype before proceeding to imaging [^112pUTUc].

> I will now examine the scenario of suspected POEMS syndrome, because hyperhidrosis can be a prominent feature. I need to ensure I order the right panel. Initial workup should include CBC, CMP, fasting glucose, TSH, PTH, prolactin, cortisol, LH, serum immunoglobulins with SPEP/UPEP and immunofixation, serum free light chains, VEGF, and IL-6, with adjunct imaging and electrophysiology as indicated; this is supported by NCCN guidance for suspected POEMS and helps avoid delays in diagnosis [^113CtQzM] [^115WArRc].

> Let me consider medication-induced hyperhidrosis, since I should confirm that a careful medication review precedes any invasive workup. SSRIs, SNRIs, stimulants such as methylphenidate, and TNF-alpha inhibitors are recognized triggers; if a temporal relationship is clear, a trial of discontinuation or substitution, when clinically feasible, may obviate further testing, though I should still screen for common secondary causes if features are atypical or systemic [^116ipCki] [^113SviRk].

> For pediatric patients, I need to ensure I do not overtest typical primary focal disease. However, if symptoms are generalized, asymmetric, or accompanied by growth concerns, I should broaden the evaluation. A reasonable approach is to add TSH, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and consider IGF-1 if features of acromegaly are present, while tailoring the scope to the history and exam; this balances the high prevalence of primary focal disease with the need to detect secondary causes early in development [^112pUTUc].

> Next, I should review how to quantify disease burden and treatment response, because objective labs are not the primary endpoint in most hyperhidrosis care. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the hyperhidrosis-specific HidroQoL provide validated, clinically meaningful measures; I should confirm that these tools track treatment effects and have established minimal important differences, which they do, supporting their routine use to complement clinical assessment and, when needed, gravimetric or starch-iodine testing [^111GPNYE] [^114PjEMY] [^116rWW7b].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency and avoid gaps. In typical primary focal hyperhidrosis, no labs are indicated. In atypical or generalized presentations, start with TSH, CBC, BMP, and fasting glucose/HbA1c, then escalate to metanephrines, IGF-1, or POEMS-directed testing based on clinical suspicion. Throughout, integrate HDSS/DLQI/HidroQoL to guide severity assessment and treatment response, and avoid anchoring bias by revisiting the differential if new red flags emerge [^1118MAeV] [^115sC2c5] [^111GPNYE].

> In summary, I should confirm that laboratory testing in hyperhidrosis is selective and hypothesis-driven: reserve testing for secondary features or atypical primary presentations, begin with a focused screen for thyroid, metabolic, hematologic, and end-organ function, and proceed to specialized endocrine or oncologic assays only when pretest probability and clinical features justify them. This approach minimizes unnecessary testing while safeguarding against missed secondary disease [^115JdZ68] [^115sC2c5] [^117VKxAY].

Routine labs are not required for typical primary hyperhidrosis [^111zVNpE]; order tests only when secondary causes are suspected [^1118MAeV]. For **secondary hyperhidrosis**, obtain **CBC, CMP, TSH, fasting glucose or HbA1c** [^115sC2c5], and consider **24-hour urine catecholamines/metanephrines** if pheochromocytoma is suspected [^notfound]. Use the **HDSS** [^116rWW7b] or **HidroQoL** [^111GPNYE] to assess severity and quality of life; reserve specialized tests (e.g. POEMS panel, acromegaly workup) for specific clinical suspicions [^113CtQzM] [^112pUTUc].

---

## Indications for laboratory testing

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated** for primary hyperhidrosis [^111zVNpE] but is essential when secondary hyperhidrosis is suspected [^notfound]. Secondary hyperhidrosis may result from endocrine, metabolic, infectious, or medication-related causes, and laboratory evaluation helps identify these underlying conditions [^notfound].

| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Assess liver and kidney function, electrolytes, and glucose [^notfound] |
| Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) | Screen for hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism [^116XK1nC] |
| Fasting glucose or HbA1c | Screen for diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance [^notfound] |

---

### Specialized laboratory tests

Specialized tests are indicated based on **clinical suspicion** of specific secondary causes:

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| 24-hour urine catecholamines and metanephrines | Suspected pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma [^notfound] |
| Serum cortisol, ACTH | Suspected Cushing's syndrome |

| Infectious disease screening (HIV, TB, malaria) | Suspected infectious causes [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical assessment tools

In addition to laboratory tests, **clinical assessment tools** are recommended to evaluate the severity and impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life:

- **Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS)**: A simple, validated tool to assess disease severity and treatment response [^116rWW7b].
- **Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index (HidroQoL)**: A patient-reported outcome measure assessing quality of life impacts in hyperhidrosis [^111GPNYE].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary hyperhidrosis**: No routine laboratory testing is required. Diagnosis is clinical, based on characteristic features and exclusion of secondary causes [^115JdZ68].
- **Secondary hyperhidrosis**: Basic laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, TSH, fasting glucose or HbA1c) are recommended. Additional specialized tests should be ordered based on clinical suspicion of specific underlying conditions [^notfound].
- **Clinical assessment tools**: HDSS and HidroQoL are recommended to assess disease severity and quality of life impact [^111GPNYE].

---

Laboratory testing for hyperhidrosis should be **individualized** based on clinical suspicion of secondary causes. Routine testing is not required for primary hyperhidrosis, but targeted laboratory evaluation is essential when secondary hyperhidrosis is suspected.

### Primary pediatric hyperhidrosis: a review of current treatment options [^1152Fx5N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically necessary for thermoregulation. Primary hyperhidrosis is localized; it can affect the axillae, palms, soles, face, and other areas and is idiopathic. The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in the United States is estimated to be 2.8% of the population, with about one-half (1.4%) of these individuals having the axillary form. Hyperhidrosis occurs in both children and adults, with the average age of onset of primary hyperhidrosis being 14–25 years. This disorder can be detrimental to a patient's social, professional, psychological, and physical well-being. Early detection and management can significantly improve a patient's quality of life, yet hyperhidrosis remains widely under diagnosed and under treated, particularly among pediatric patients. The purpose of this article is to review the treatment of pediatric hyperhidrosis, and to increase awareness and inspire further research on this important and often overlooked medical problem.

Efficacy of BTX Injections

Eight studies describing the effect of BTX injections for the treatment of focal hyperhidrosis were included. The serotype used in given trials differed, with six studies using BTX A and two studies using BTX B with a dose range of 50–200 units and 2.250–20.000 units, respectively. Placebo treatment using 0.9% sodium chloride solution was compared to BTX injections for axillary hyperhidrosis in six studies, for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis in one study, respectively. We were able to evaluate the following outcome parameters for the comparative meta-analysis with placebo: > 50% sweat reduction from baseline at weeks 2–6 in the gravimetric analysis expressed as risk difference (RD) for axillary hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.51, 0.76], Z = 9.93, P < 0.0001, I² = 83%, five studies) and for craniofacial and lower limb hyperhidrosis (RD: 0.60, 95% CI [0.23, 0.96], Z = 3.21, P < 0.001, I² = 0%, two studies) (Fig. 4); reduction of ≥ 2 points on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale at week 2–8 expressed as RD (RD: 0.56, 95% CI [0.42, 0.69], Z = 8.16, P < 0.00001, I² = 56%, four studies) (Fig. 5); and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index at weeks 2–8 from baseline expressed as mean difference (MD) (MD: − 5.55, 95% CI [− 7.11, − 3.98], Z = 6.95, P < 0.00001, I² = 70%, four studies) (Fig. 6).

### A 44-week open-label study evaluating safety and efficacy of topical glycopyrronium tosylate in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116BpYRp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The onset of both common and anticholinergic TEAEs occurred mainly in the first 12 weeks of treatment in the open-label extension and decreased thereafter (Table 3), indicating that TEAEs did not increase with a longer duration of exposure. Similarly, rates of drug withdrawal because of TEAEs remained relatively stable over the study course (Table 3). The incidence of dry mouth was higher in the first 4 weeks of the open-label extension for patients who were newly exposed to GT in the open-label extension (i.e. had received VEH during the double-blind lead-in trials), though rates of drug withdrawal because of TEAEs were not higher in this patient population (Table 2 of the ESM). Most patients (n = 371 [67.5%]) had no LSRs; of those patients that reported LSRs, erythema (n = 116 [21.1%]), burning/stinging (n = 73 [13.3%]), and pruritus (n = 68 [12.4%]) were most common. Local skin reactions were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity (Fig. 2), the frequency and severity did not increase over the course of the open-label extension, and a total of 11 patients had LSRs that were associated with study discontinuation. No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory testing, vital signs, and physical examination were observed over 44 weeks of treatment in the open-label extension.

This article summarizes the main principles for the appropriate use of laboratory testing in the diagnosis and management of thyroid disorders, as well as controversies that have arisen in association with some of these biochemical tests. To place a test in perspective, its sensitivity and accuracy should be taken into account. Ordering the correct laboratory tests facilitates the early diagnosis of a thyroid disorder and allows for timely and appropriate treatment. This article focuses on a comprehensive update regarding thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxine/triiodothyronine, thyroid autoantibodies, thyroglobulin, and calcitonin. Clinical uses of these biochemical tests are outlined.

Hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) — field thresholds and testing emphasize glucose cutoffs and dehydration severity. If someone with diabetes is found to be hyperglycemic (plasma glucose level > 250 mg·dL−1), assess for HHS or DKA, and individuals with type 1 diabetes should be able to test for blood or urine ketones if they have unexplained hyperglycemia. In HHS, serum glucose level usually > 600 mg·dL−1 with extreme dehydration with a fluid deficit of 8 to 12 L.

Limitations of the Study

The present meta-analysis, while synthesizing the current evidence on the treatment of PAH with BTX-A, encounters several limitations that must be considered when interpreting the findings. Firstly, there is a scarcity of studies reporting the long-term maintenance effects of BTX-A injections. Understanding the duration of effectiveness is crucial for both clinicians and patients in deciding the frequency and necessity of repeated interventions.

Additionally, the dosage variation of BTX-A and the potential differences in efficacy between different manufacturers (e.g. Botox vs. Dysport) have not been thoroughly investigated. The conversion ratio of BTX-A to BTX-B and its implications in clinical practice likewise require more robust evidence.

Lastly, the adverse reaction profile of BTX-A, although generally favorable compared to placebo, needs to be assessed in larger cohorts to determine its true incidence and severity. This is particularly important for patients and practitioners when balancing the risk-benefit ratio of treatments.

In conclusion, while this meta-analysis provides insights into the treatment of PAH with BTX-A, future research should focus on large-scale RCTs with consistent outcome measures and longer follow-up periods to validate these findings and guide clinical decision-making.

### Validation of new items for diagnosing primary hyperhidrosis, and estimation of the prevalence of primary hyperhidrosis [^116jTfJM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Multi-Specialty Working Group on the Recognition, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis has developed evidence-based consensus criteria for diagnosing primary hyperhidrosis (PHH).

Objectives

To validate new questionnaire items for self-reported classification of PHH based on the consensus criteria and to estimate the prevalence of PHH.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study. Questionnaires containing the index tests and reference tests were distributed to blood donors at blood banks between June and December 2021 in Region Zealand, Denmark. The index tests were the two questions 'Have you had troublesome sweating?' and 'Have you ever had troublesome sweating?', which were used to create six single-item algorithms for classifying PHH. The reference test comprised the consensus criteria.

Results

Overall, 1071 (95.9%) of 1083 eligible blood donors completed the index tests. The reference test classified 59 participants as having PHH and 980 as not having PHH, generating a prevalence of 5.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4–7.3]. The algorithms with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity were algorithm 2 with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.77–0.99) and specificity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.95), and algorithm 5 with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI 0.80–0.99) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90–0.94).

Conclusions

With high diagnostic accuracy, these items allow for the identification of individuals with and without PHH, which may prove useful in epidemiological research. Validation in the general population is warranted.

### Delusional hyperhidrosis: a case report and recommendations for management [^113qptLX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delusional hyperhidrosis, a psychocutaneous disease in which patients complain of excessive sweating without objective findings, proposes a challenge for dermatologists to treat. Failure to recognize and manage this disorder may engender the excessive use of inappropriate medical resources, such as seeing multiple specialists and using therapies including botulinum toxin, as well as have serious impacts on patient quality of life.

Here, we present a case of undiagnosed delusional hyperhidrosis that had led to the misuse of several medical treatments. We offer recommendations for the management of this disease and emphasize the importance of performing a physical examination in all patients reporting symptoms of hyperhidrosis.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Two independent researchers (SJ and LPH) extracted data from the included trials using standardized data extraction tables. This approach ensured consistency and reduced the potential for error or bias in the data collection process. Both researchers have significant experience in evidence-based medicine and are well-versed in the nuances of data extraction for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

In instances where a randomized controlled trial reported multiple outcome measures (e.g. 2 or 3), we summarize and include all of them; event outcomes in our analysis. This comprehensive approach provides a broader perspective on the efficacy and safety profiles of the interventions assessed.

When confronted with insufficient data in a particular study, we contacted the corresponding author to request the missing information. This proactive measure was taken to ensure that the meta-analysis was as comprehensive and accurate as possible, thereby enhancing the validity of our conclusions.

Any disagreement between two researchers during the data extraction process were resolved through consensus. This involved engaging in detailed discussions to understand each other's perspectives and using critical thinking to reach a mutually acceptable decision. This process helped to mitigate personal biases and ensured that the data extracted were both accurate and reliable.

Introduction

Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by sweat production exceeding that which is necessary to maintain thermal homeostasis. Hyperhidrosis affects ~ 15.3 million people in the USA (prevalence of 4.8%) and adversely impacts quality of life to an extent comparable to, or greater than, the impact of psoriasis or eczema. Approximately half of those with hyperhidrosis experience excessive underarm sweating (i.e. axillary hyperhidrosis), the most commonly affected area.

Treatments for hyperhidrosis have included over-the-counter and prescription antiperspirants, oral anticholinergic drugs, onabotulinumtoxinA, iontophoresis (application of mild electrical current through water), and ablation or removal of the sweat glands. These treatments differ in efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost, and the more invasive procedures carry a risk of serious and/or irreversible side effects. Reports that hyperhidrosis may be underdiagnosed, that patients often delay or avoid seeking treatment, and that patients are dissatisfied with currently available treatments indicate that greater awareness of hyperhidrosis as a medical condition and new treatment options are needed.

Objective measures of sweat production, including gravimetric measurements at discrete time points, can be highly variable due to temperature, humidity, and the sometimes-episodic nature of sweating, which can vary with time of day, emotional state, and daily activities. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which capture a patient's treatment experience, should accompany objective measures of sweat production to adequately assess therapeutic impact. None of the existing PROs used to assess hyperhidrosis severity, including the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), meet current US regulatory standards to support product approvals and labeling. In particular, the DLQI and the PGIC, albeit widely used in dermatology clinical trials, are not specific for hyperhidrosis. Furthermore, while the HDSS is a disease-specific instrument with acceptable validity, reliability, and responsiveness, its development did not include patient input, which is now a recommended component of instrument development. In addition, the HDSS combines two distinct concepts — tolerability and interference in daily activities — into the same item, limiting the interpretation of study results.

### Impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life and its assessment [^113QsW62]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is an embarrassing condition that may interfere with routine activities, cause emotional distress, and disturb both professional and social lives of patients. Objective examination is variable and unreliable, so efforts have been made in the last 15 years to substantiate the limitations of these patients, especially in primary focal hyperhidrosis. Almost all therapeutic studies use standardized or self-designed instruments to evaluate the impact of the disease on quality of life and the improvement achieved by treatment. This article gives an overview of the difficulties with which patients with hyperhidrosis are confronted and of research investigating the restrictions.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^111Gjdhk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.7 Syndromes of Severe Insulin Resistance (SIR)

Syndromes of SIR are a heterogeneous group of disorders that may be genetic or acquired. They are sometimes attributable to primary defects in insulin action, for instance due to monogenic changes directly affecting the insulin signalling pathways for example, in the insulin receptor (INSR), or to autoantibodies downregulating the insulin receptor (Type B insulin resistance). Far more commonly, however, they are caused by acquired or genetic defects in adipose tissue development or function, usually manifest as anatomical lipodystrophy, which sometimes occurs in the context of more complex developmental syndromes.

SIR most commonly presents around puberty in females (which may be precocious). Despite the severe metabolic derangements that define it, the sentinel complaint often relates to ovulatory dysfunction and symptoms of androgen excess. Consideration of SIR when evaluating a patient with hyperandrogenism is thus important in ensuring timely diagnosis. Suspicion of SIR should arise in patients with clinical or biochemical features of insulin resistance that is disproportionate to their body mass index (BMI) and/or a strong family history of insulin resistance or diabetes. Acanthosis nigricans and/or skin tags are important clinical clues to the presence of IR and should always be sought. Atypical distribution of adipose tissue, including a Cushingoid habitus, and unusually severe fatty liver, dyslipidaemia, history of pancreatitis and a muscular appearance of the limbs are strong clues to underlying lipodystrophy (Table 2).

Table 2
Clinical and biochemical features of severe insulin resistance in patients with severe androgen excess.

Arbitrary biochemical definitions of SIR are sometimes suggested. These include a fasting insulin concentration > 150 pmol/l, or a peak insulin on glucose tolerance testing of > 1500 pmol/l in those with a BMI < 30 kg/m² and normal glucose tolerance. In those with absolute insulin deficiency, an exogenous insulin requirement of greater than 3 units/kg/day is also suggestive. However, many patients have partial pancreatic decompensation, making it difficult to evaluate insulin concentrations precisely in the context of hyperglycaemia. Thus, diagnosis usually relies on a combination of clinical and biochemical features. Biochemical testing may also help to identify SIR subtypes. Patients with INSR mutations are protected from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidaemia, even though these are usually central features of lipodystrophy. While serum adiponectin concentration is preserved or increased in insulin receptor signalling defects, it is reduced in lipodystrophy or obesity (Table 2).

### A review of the etiologies and key clinical features of secondary hyperhidrosis [^1118MAeV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary hyperhidrosis is a multifactorial condition that poses unique diagnostic and management challenges. Distinguishing secondary from primary hyperhidrosis remains difficult due to overlapping symptoms. This review consolidates existing evidence on the numerous underlying causes and pathophysiologic mechanisms of secondary hyperhidrosis across various disciplines. Secondary hyperhidrosis typically manifests in the fourth decade of life or later, whereas primary hyperhidrosis usually begins earlier. Generalized hyperhidrosis often suggests a secondary cause, though the distribution can vary, including focal symmetric/asymmetric or regional patterns depending on the underlying condition. Key clinical features such as lack of family history and associated symptoms provide additional clues favoring a secondary etiology. Recognizing these distinct characteristics is crucial for accurate differentiation between secondary and primary hyperhidrosis, thereby guiding appropriate evaluation and management of the underlying cause.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

### A comprehensive approach to the recognition, diagnosis, and severity-based treatment of focal hyperhidrosis: recommendations of the Canadian hyperhidrosis advisory committee [^116cu34D]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life. Current treatment guidelines ignore disease severity.

Objective

The objective was to establish clinical guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

Methods and Materials

A working group of eight nationally recognized experts was convened to develop the consensus statement using an evidence-based approach.

Recommendations

An algorithm was designed to consider both disease severity and location. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) provides a qualitative measure that allows tailoring of treatment. Mild axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 2) should initially be treated with topical aluminum chloride (AC). If the patient fails to respond to AC therapy, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A; axillae, palms, soles) and iontophoresis (palms, soles) should be the second-line therapy. In severe cases of axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 3 or 4), both BTX-A and topical AC are first-line therapy. Iontophoresis is also first-line therapy for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis should be treated with oral medications, BTX-A, or topical AC as first-line therapy. Local surgery (axillary) and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (palms and soles) should only be considered after failure of all other treatment options.

Conclusions

These guidelines offer a rapid method to assess disease severity and to treat primary focal hyperhidrosis according to severity.

### Epidemiology of hyperhidrosis in 2 population-based health care databases [^113sBGtu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Population-based and clinical case reports of hyperhidrosis (HH) provide prevalence estimates that vary widely across reported studies because of differences in case ascertainment.

Objective

In this study, we specify diagnostic, symptom, and prescription codes for HH to estimate incidence and prevalence for the United Kingdom and the United States.

Methods

Data from UK and US health care databases were analyzed to ascertain HH cases and estimate incidence and prevalence from health care records during calendar years 2011 through 2013.

Results

On the basis of 2013 data for the United States and United Kingdom, between 1.0% and 1.6% of these populations have health care records indicating diagnosis or treatment of HH. Women accounted for approximately 60% of incident and prevalent cases in both databases.

Limitations

Because the case ascertainment methods rely on available data for those seeking health care, we may have underestimated the number of HH cases in both countries.

Conclusions

The findings represent a plausible estimate for incidence and prevalence of HH among persons seeking medical care for excessive sweating. Improved practices for identifying HH in clinical settings may increase the sensitivity and specificity of future studies and improve characterization and quantification of the population burden of this significant disease.

### Are patients better than the laboratory in assessing sweating? Validation study [^111zVNpE]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a hereditary condition characterized by excessive sweating affecting a variety of areas, including the palms. In most cases, the decision to treat a patient is based only on the patient's own description of the symptoms because laboratory tests have not been established in clinical practice.

Objective

To validate a subjective self-assessment scale for sweating in comparison with an objective method of quantifying evaporation from the skin surface.

Methods

We studied palmar sweating in 20 patients with primary focal hyperhidrosis and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Four times in each subject, we obtained measurements of the evaporation in palms and the self-evaluation scale (SES) scores on a proportional scale from 0 (no sweating) to 10 (worst imaginable sweating).

Results

Good correlation was found between the SES score and evaporation assessment (R = .65). The SES score was easier to obtain and provided better diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. They leveled out at over 80% when a score of 3 was used as the threshold level; for evaporimetry, sensitivity equalled specificity at 70% at the threshold 90 mg -2h(-1).

Conclusion

We confirm the usefulness of the SES in assessing palmar sweating and discuss the current restrictions in its use in clinical diagnosis. We propose that the scale can be added effortlessly to research or clinical protocols to provide the necessary validation in wider spectra of patients.

### Incorporating diagnosis and treatment of hyperhidrosis into clinical practice [^116zn2Gy]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Proper billing and coding are essential to document the diagnosis of hyperhidrosis and to assure proper reimbursement for treatment. Providers should become familiar with the payment policies of local health plans to streamline the preauthorization process that is often needed for many treatments commonly used for hyperhidrosis. Having a preprinted letter of medical necessity and patient intake forms that record the necessary historical information about the disease, previous treatments, and other pertinent information will help increase the speed of the office flow. This article presents algorithms for treatment of the various forms of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

### Acquired idiopathic anhidrosis: a diagnosis often missed [^114rxEky]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired idiopathic anhidrosis (AIA) is an uncommon entity characterized by anhidrosis in the absence of any neurologic or sweat gland abnormalities.

Objective

The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical profile in a cohort of patients diagnosed with AIA at a tertiary dermatologic center.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated cases seen during a 10-year period. Inclusion criteria included all cases of generalized or partial anhidrosis with no obvious causes, confirmed by provocative starch-iodine sweat test. Ectodermal dysplasias, poral dysfunction from chronic dermatoses, autonomic dysfunction, and drug-induced causes were excluded.

Results

Fifteen Chinese patients were diagnosed with AIA, mostly healthy young men with no significant medical or drug history, with variable extent of body surface area involvement. Serum immunoglobulin E, a complete blood cell count, thyroid function test, and antinuclear antibody levels were unremarkable. Anhidrotic areas revealed normal eccrine appendages with mild perivascular and perieccrine lymphocytic infiltrate. There were no neurologic abnormalities.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study.

Conclusion

Our study shows that AIA seems to be a heterogeneous group with no major dysfunction other than anhidrosis. Proper recognition and evaluation is paramount, especially for at-risk populations, so that appropriate measures on the prevention of heat injuries can be instituted.

### Acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis: a case series of two caucasian patients [^113rEFqJ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) is a rare disorder characterized by insidious or sudden onset of the inability to sweat involving > 25% of body surface area in the absence of other neurologic or sweat gland abnormalities and typically affects young, healthy, Asian men. Here, we describe two Caucasian teenagers with the diagnosis. They both had variable responses to prednisone, one in the setting of an elevated ANA, suggesting an autoimmune or inflammatory pathomechanism of the disorder. It is essential the clinician recognizes this rare entity and initiates timely intervention to prevent the serious consequences of hyperpyrexia.

### Laboratory testing in hyperthyroidism [^115vWkpj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism is difficult (full text available online: http://education.amjmed.com/pp1/272). Clinical symptoms and signs are often non-specific, and there is incomplete correlation between structural and functional thyroid gland changes. Laboratory testing is therefore indispensible in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. Similar considerations apply to treatment monitoring. Laboratory testing also plays a crucial role in establishing the most likely cause for a patient's hyperthyroidism. Finally, during pregnancy, when isotopic scanning is relatively contraindicated and ultrasound is more difficult to interpret, laboratory testing becomes even more important.

### Diagnosis and management of the critically ill adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^115Fcj6U]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important for emergency physicians to be aware of this unique diagnosis and treatment considerations.

Objective

This manuscript reviews the emergency department evaluation and management of the adult patient with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

Discussion

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is diagnosed by an elevated glucose, elevated serum osmolality, minimal or absent ketones, and a neurologic abnormality, most commonly altered mental status. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. It is important to monitor these patients closely to avoid overcorrection of osmolality, sodium, and other electrolytes. These patients are critically ill and generally require admission to an intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^117XGdKh]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Steering group

A steering group was set up, comprising people with hyperhidrosis, a representative of the Hyperhidrosis UK support group, HCPs and academics, and chaired by an advisor from the James Lind Alliance. The group set the terms of reference, scope and protocol of the projected, and monitored progress throughout the various stages (Fig. 1). Established methods and best practice from the James Lind Alliance Guidebook were used.

Figure 1
The Hyperhidrosis Priority Setting Partnership prioritization process.

Gathering uncertainties

An initial survey was administered online via SurveyMonkey®, which was open for 14 weeks. Participants aged ≥ 16 years, with hyperhidrosis of any severity, who were self‐diagnosed or diagnosed by an HCP, were sought via the Hyperhidrosis UK website and social media. HCPs were targeted via professional groups and societies. All contacted participants consented to take part in the PSP. The survey asked participants to suggest any questions about the treatment and management of hyperhidrosis that they would like to see answered by research, or where they felt there was uncertainty about the treatment or management of the condition. Demographic data was also collected to ensure a spread of participants from all backgrounds. This was reviewed part way through the open period, so that advertising could be targeted towards any groups that were under‐represented.

Following the initial survey responses, the steering group reviewed all submitted questions and removed any that were out of the scope of the project. Repeated or very similar questions were grouped together, and an indicative question formed to represent them (Table 1). Once the indicative questions were agreed, databases including the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE were searched to look for systematic reviews about hyperhidrosis treatments and management. A question was considered to be an 'uncertainty' if there was no systematic review to answer it, or if a systematic review concluded that an uncertainty existed.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^111VV6u4]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and Initial Evaluation

Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) defined as serum glucose > 600 mg/mL (33 mmol/L), serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/L, and minimal ketonemia/ketonuria, is being seen with increasing frequency as the presenting indication of T2D and may be associated with mild-tomoderate acidosis from severe dehydration, leading to confusion with DKA. Conversely, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may have features of HHS, especially if they have been satisfying their polydipsia with fluids containing a high concentration of glucose.HHS has a substantial mortality rate and requires aggressive reconstitution of the circulatory volume.–

Body weight should be determined for calculation purposes. Dehydration can be estimated as 5% if there is reduced skin elasticity, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and deep breathing, and up to 10% with capillary refill time greater than 3 seconds and sunken eyes (Table 1). Calculations of fluid deficit are commonly based on 10% dehydration, which in most cases is a modest overestimate that does not appear to have clinical significance.–The level of consciousness should be recorded using the Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 2). An initial venous blood sample should be tested for glucose; electrolytes; pH; urea nitrogen; creatinine; osmolality; ketones or beta-hydroxybutyrate; hemoglobin and hematocrit or complete blood count, while keeping in mind that DKA is associated with leukocytosis.

### The impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life: a review of the literature [^114QpaMp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a condition of excessive sweating, which can have profound physical and mental effects. Hyperhidrosis is a significantly impactful and distressing illness that warrants equal attention as other more well-known dermatologic conditions. However, because of a lack of awareness among the public, stigma, and difficulty with access to treatments (due to cost or insurance coverage), patients are less likely to be diagnosed and treated. In hyperhidrosis, quality-of-life surveys can be useful for determining the magnitude of symptoms and to evaluate treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to conduct a narrative literature review to investigate the impact of hyperhidrosis on quality of life. A total of 49 articles investigating the impact of primary hyperhidrosis on quality of life were selected for the review. Hyperhidrosis is a potentially debilitating illness that affects multiple domains of patients' lives including their psychological, physical, and social functioning. Despite the significant impacts, patients with hyperhidrosis are less likely to seek care. Here, we explore these impacts, and disparities in care, in more detail.

### Hyperhidrosis quality of life index (hidroQoL ©): further validation and clinical application in patients with axillary hyperhidrosis using data from a phase III randomized controlled trial [^111GPNYE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index (HidroQoL©) is a validated patient-reported outcome measure capturing the quality of life of people affected by hyperhidrosis.

Objectives

We aimed to extend the validity evidence to physician-confirmed diagnosis of primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

Methods

Data from a phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial were used (n = 171). Confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to confirm the a priori two-factor structure of the HidroQoL. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's α. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to evaluate test-retest reliability after days -7 to -4. Convergent validity was assessed using correlations with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and gravimetric sweat production. Known groups were analysed to evaluate discriminative validity. Responsiveness after 29 days was assessed and minimal important difference (MID) values were calculated using both anchor- and distribution-based approaches. All analyses were carried out for total HidroQoL and its two domains.

Results

The two-factor structure of the HidroQoL was confirmed. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were strong (Cronbach's α 0.81–0.90; ICCs 0.89–0.93). Correlations with other outcome measures were in line with a priori hypotheses. The HidroQoL discriminated between different severity groups (P ≤ 0.001) and showed sensitivity to change towards improvement (P < 0.001). An MID value of 4 is proposed for the total scale.

Conclusions

This study supports excellent measurement properties including clinical applicability of the HidroQoL in primary axillary hyperhidrosis and suggests a MID of 4 be applied to clinical trial data.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperhidrosis: practical guidance and current therapy update [^115Tzit9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a chronic medical condition characterized by excessive sweating beyond that which is necessary for thermoregulatory homeostasis. It is estimated to occur in 4.8% of the U.S. population (~15.3 million people) but is both underreported and underdiagnosed. With the busy practitioner and dermatology resident in mind, we provide here a disease state primer for hyperhidrosis, a top-line review of the breadth of literature underscoring the overall burden of the disease, a practical guide to differential diagnosis, and an update on current treatment approaches, including for the most common form of the condition, primary axillary hyperhidrosis. In addition, a case study is presented to provide a real-life perspective from the clinic on the importance of early and effective management strategies for those suffering with hyperhidrosis.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Relexxii) [^116ipCki]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of RELEXXII for the treatment of ADHD is based on adequate and well-controlled studies of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Below is a display of adverse reactions from those adequate and well-controlled studies in ADHD.

Adults and pediatric patients 6 to 17 years with ADHD were evaluated in six controlled clinical studies and eleven open-label clinical studies (see Table 3). Safety was assessed by collecting adverse reactions, vital signs, weights, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), and by performing physical examinations and laboratory analyses. A total of 3,906 patients participated in the clinical trials.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111mVjnY]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid function testing (1,23) are based on the measurement of thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Patients are therefore classified as having euthyroidism (normal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), overt thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH and thyroid hormone levels), subclinical thyroid dysfunction (abnormal TSH/normal thyroid hormone levels), and isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia (normal TSH/abnormal thyroid hormone levels).

This classification of thyroid function is based on the concept of TSH levels being the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function such that subclinical thyroid dysfunction as currently defined is believed to be more significant than isolated hyper/hypothyroxinemia, as indicated by the alternative term for the latter, "euthyroid hyper/hypothyroidism".

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common and comprises most cases of thyroid dysfunction with a population prevalence of ∼5%, increasing to 15% in older adults. Even though it is generally asymptomatic or associated only with non-specific symptoms, subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been associated with many adverse outcomes across a variety of organ systems. Therefore, despite the lack of convincing evidence of significant benefit, treatment for subclinical thyroid dysfunction has been recommended in certain circumstances.

It has previously been suggested by some authors that the earlier definition of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is overly simple and that its diagnosis should not be based solely on the TSH level being outside of a general population range. Rather, it is claimed that more accuracy may be achieved by defining a normal reference range for the combination of thyroid hormones and TSH.

However, any model whereby judgment of the thyroid status includes consideration of the TSH level is anomalous, in that the levels of other physiological parameters are not judged by the levels of their controlling hormones. For example, whether or not an individual has hypoglycemia or hypercalcemia is not determined by reference to insulin or parathyroid hormone levels, respectively. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, though helpful in diagnosing adrenal autonomy, are not considered diagnostic for Cushing's syndrome. In general, the level of a controlling hormone is used to determine the cause of a disturbance rather than identifying whether or not there is a disturbance.

### Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines for exclusion of pheochromocytoma: can specificity be improved by adjustment for age? [^113bRX7S]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia, which can secrete excessive catecholamines. Signs and symptoms of pheochromocytoma may include hypertension, pain (including headache, flank pain, abdominal pain, or chest pain), hyperhidrosis, anxiety or panic attacks, cardiac arrythmias, or sudden death. A pheochromocytoma may also be detected as an asymptomatic incidental adrenal mass seen on abdominal imaging. Metabolites of norepinephrine and epinephrine, specifically normetanephrine and metanephrine, may be measured in the plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, as described by Lenders et al. Measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrines has been called "the best test for excluding or confirming pheochromocytoma" and some investigators have recommended that such measurements "should be the test of first choice". In a recent systematic review of the world literature, we have observed that measurement of fractionated plasma metanephrine measurements have a high sensitivity ranging of 96 to100% and a variable specificity ranging from 82% to 100%. The specificity of fractionated plasma metanephrines in excluding pheochromocytoma appears lowest in populations without known genetic predisposition to disease (those in whom sporadic disease is sought), with a false positive rate of up to 18% in such patients. We have previously observed that the normetanephrine fraction is elevated in the majority of false positive test results and that false positives are associated with increasing age. Indeed, investigators from the National Institute of Health have agreed that, "measurements of plasma normetanephrine and metanephrine provide a highly sensitive test for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, but false positive results remain a problem". False positive biochemical test results may result in needless imaging procedures and generate excessive healthcare expenditures in detection of sporadic pheochromocytoma.

### Longitudinal validity of the hyperhidrosis quality of life index (hidroQoL ©) in a phase IIIb clinical trial population with hyperhidrosis: responsiveness and meaningful change [^114PjEMY]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Hyperhidrosis Quality of Life Index (HidroQoL©) is a well-developed patient-reported outcome measure assessing the quality of life impacts in hyperhidrosis (HH), which has proven very good measurement properties, such as structural validity and internal consistency.

Objectives

We aimed to investigate responsiveness over time and estimate values for meaningful within-person change (MWPC) towards symptom improvement for different measurement timepoints (4 and 12 weeks), extending the existing validity evidence in patients with primary axillary HH.

Methods

Data (from a phase IIIb clinical trial) were collected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 28, 52 and 72. For the assessment of responsiveness, HidroQoL change scores were correlated with corresponding change scores of the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and gravimetric sweat production based on a priori formulated hypotheses. Furthermore, we tested whether the different HDSS change score groups differed significantly from each other over time and whether the HidroQoL was sensitive towards these group differences over time. This was extended by the calculation of matched-pair tests and effect sizes to test significance for each change group separately. For the estimation of MWPC thresholds towards symptom improvement, different anchor-based and integrated approaches were used.

Results

In total, the sample comprised 357 patients with primary axillary HH. For the assessment of responsiveness, five out of 14 a priori hypotheses regarding the correlation of the change scores could be confirmed, whereas the rejected hypotheses differed only marginally from the expected values. Furthermore, regarding responsiveness, the HidroQoL showed sensitivity towards symptom improvement at each measurement timepoint. Effect sizes were large as expected (d ≥ 0.806). MWPC thresholds towards symptom improvement were proposed for two measurement timepoints: 5 (week 4) and 6 (week 12). Increasing MWPC values over time were observed.

Conclusions

This study extends the evidence for the longitudinal validity of the HidroQoL© up to 72 weeks and proposed MWPC thresholds for different time intervals (4 and 12 weeks) after baseline, aiding interpretability. Results concur with findings from previous validation studies.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114XnGh7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hirsutism — laboratory testing sequence: When testing for elevated androgen levels, we suggest first measuring serum total testosterone levels using a reliable specialty assay. If serum total testosterone levels are normal but sexual hair growth is moderate/severe or is mild with clinical evidence of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder, we suggest measuring an early morning serum total and free testosterone by a reliable specialty assay; features that suggest a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder include menstrual irregularity, infertility, galactorrhea, central obesity, acanthosis nigricans, clitoromegaly, sudden-onset or rapid-progression hirsutism, or hirsutism progression in spite of therapy.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense? [^111sz82J]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs; in other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results; uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1119RUsp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Evaluation of thyroid hormone status: are simultaneous TSH and FT4 tests necessary? Analysis of thyroid function test results taken from the greater manchester care record 2010–2023 [^111gYAAK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge previous work suggesting that combined fT4 and TSH testing is not necessary, with the alternative being a two‐step approach based on first testing TSH. However, in this representative large community sample, we have identified a large number of people treated with levothyroxine who have a fT4 outside the laboratory RR.

There is variability in relation to the way that thyroid hormone status assessment is decided. However, the laboratory can lead on best practice. We here have provided evidence that thyroid function testing for individuals on levothyroxine replacement should include a check of fT4 as well as TSH. Such an approach, if adopted, can be enabled by the simple strategy of requiring the clinician requesting the test to state whether or not the patient is taking thyroid hormone replacement with a mandatory tick box.

Regarding cost estimates, while assay costs will be subject to some variation between laboratories, our estimate is for an additional £0.80 (Euro 0.93) of fT4 estimation to be added to TSH (£1.00) (Euro 1.16) for the cost of TSH alone, giving a total cost of £1.80 (Euro 2.09) for fT4 and TSH to be assayed together.

We accept that we do not have sufficient data to support a universal recommendation. Given the possible risks associated with prolonged exposure to high and low fT4 levels, we suggest that where indicated, fT4 and TSH should both be measured, in particular for those treated with levothyroxine, to enable thyroid hormone replacement dose adjustment as appropriate. In any case, if pituitary/hypothalamic disease is suspected fT4 and TSH should be checked in order not to miss pituitary insufficiency.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy versus modified wittmoser method in surgical management of primary hyperhidrosis [^1133ByQP]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

From January 2010 to November 2017, 238 randomized unpaired PHH patients (106 male and 132 female) with a mean age of 24 ± 2 years (range: 16–40 years) were enrolled. Most of them complained of palmar hyperhidrosis (124 patients, 52.10%) or multifocal forms such as palmar-axillary sweating (50 patients, 21.01%). Facial PHH was slightly rare with an actual incidence of 3.78% (9 patients). Diagnosis of primary hyperhidrosis was made according to Hornberger's criteria. Simultaneously, with the clinical diagnosis, each patient was evaluated about self-perceived disease according to hyperhidrosis disease severity scale (HDSS) questionnaire. A preoperative HDSS score > 3 was mandatory for surgery. All patients underwent preoperative clinical work-up, including blood test evidence, chest X-ray to exclude gross diseases and ECG with cardiological assessment (Table 1) and received informed consent about the above mentioned established surgical technique used according to our Hospital Protocol (00201 Rev.1–2011). The study design was approved by the University of L'Aquila School of Medicine.

2.3.2 Exploratory endpoints

Weekly trends in the HDSS responder rate, 50% or 75% SP responder rate, sweat production, ASDD/ASDD‐C responder rate, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)/Children's DLQI (CDLQI) scores, HDSS, and ASDD/ASDD‐C Item 2 scores were also evaluated from baseline to week 4, as exploratory endpoints. The 0–30 scale DLQI (patients ≥ 16 years of age)/CDLQI (patients 9–15 years of age) was used to assess the impact of dermatology‐related diseases on patient health‐related QOL, with higher scales indicating lower QOL.

2.3.3 Safety endpoints

Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAE), clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs were assessed in the safety evaluation throughout the 4‐week treatment period. TEAE of special interest were defined as symptoms associated with mydriasis/blurry vision and dysuria/urinary retention.

### Cutaneous manifestations of Fabry disease: a systematic review [^117CHd5k]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Search strategy

On January 1, 2024, a final systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases using different MeSH terms to retrieve studies on FD and skin manifestations. To also include literature to which MeSH terms were not attached, words in the text were also used in the literature search. Reference lists were manually searched for additional studies to include. The search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. As skin manifestations in FD patients are wide, various search terms involving different skin manifestations were used to ensure the search was systematic and wide. The following search string was used (("fabry"[All Fields] OR "fabry's"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratoma corporis diffusum"[All Fields]) AND ("skin"[All Fields] OR "lymphedema"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratoma"[All Fields] OR "angiokeratomas"[All Fields] OR "hemangioma"[All Fields] OR "angioma"[All Fields] OR "angiomas"[All Fields] OR "hypohidrosis"[All Fields] OR "hyperhidrosis"[All Fields] OR "anhidrosis"[All Fields] OR "sweat"[All Fields] OR "sweating"[All Fields] OR "hair"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasiae"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasia"[All Fields] OR "telangiectasias"[All Fields])). Figure 2 illustrates the search profile.

2.4 Study selection

The literature search was done by authors R.N. A.C. and M.M. both of whom screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies meeting the described study criteria. Authors were not blinded regarding the authors and affiliation names of these studies. Full‐text articles of potentially relevant studies were obtained and assessed. Any disagreement was solved by consensus.

2.5 Data extraction

The articles were read, and one author (RNAC) extracted the following information from the included studies and registered it in a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2021): first author, year of publication, and study design including age, number, and sex of patients. Furthermore, details about the index test (clinical and/or imaging technique), reference standard, and details about the type of skin change/disease, anatomical localization, severity, symptoms, and histopathological results were also extracted.

FIGURE 1
Timing of evaluation on the confirmatory study and long‐term study. Abbreviations: DLQI, dermatology life quality index; HDSM‐Ax, hyperhidrosis disease severity measure‐axillary; HDSS, hyperhidrosis disease severity score.

The safety end‐points were adverse events (AEs), local tolerability (assessed by the physician and patients), vital signs, and laboratory values (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis). AEs were coded by systemic organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the MedDRA/J version 21.1. An ADR was defined as an AE that was reasonably considered at least possibly related to the study drug and for which a causal relationship with the study drug could not be ruled out. An AE that, in the opinion of the sponsor with reference to that of the investigator, may be attributable to an anticholinergic effect was considered as an anticholinergic AE if the medical expert agreed. Multiple episodes of the same AE in the same patient were counted as one patient in calculation of the incidence. For local tolerability, the physician assessed dryness, erythema, and scaling on a 5‐point score (0: none, 1: minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe) and patients assessed burning sensation and itching on a 5‐point score (0: none, 1: very mild, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe).

2.5 Analysis

For each end‐point, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum to maximum, proportion (%) of patients, and 95% confidence interval (CI) at each assessment time point were calculated for each treatment group. Values at baseline 3 in the confirmatory studywere used as the baseline values in the present study. For the efficacy end‐points (iv), (v), and (vii), that is, changes in mean score, an observed case approach was used in which only observed values were analyzed, without imputation of missing values. For the efficacy end‐points (i), (ii), (iii), and (vi), that is, proportions of patients who met certain criteria, patients for whom data were missing were handled as patients who failed to meet the criteria. SAS ® version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for data analysis.

### Interventional management of hyperhidrosis in secondary care: a systematic review [^111187Bv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperhidrosis is uncontrollable excessive sweating, which occurs at rest, regardless of temperature. The symptoms of hyperhidrosis can significantly affect quality of life.

Objectives

To undertake a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and safety of treatments available in secondary care for the management of primary hyperhidrosis.

Methods

Fifteen databases (including trial registers) were searched to July 2016 to identify studies of secondary-care treatments for primary hyperhidrosis. For each intervention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included where available; where RCT evidence was lacking, nonrandomized trials or large prospective case series were included. Outcomes of interest included disease severity, sweat rate, quality of life, patient satisfaction and adverse events. Trial quality was assessed using a modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results were pooled in pairwise meta-analyses where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was presented.

Results

Fifty studies were included in the review: 32 RCTs, 17 nonrandomized trials and one case series. The studies varied in terms of population, intervention and methods of outcome assessment. Most studies were small, at high risk of bias and poorly reported. The interventions assessed were iontophoresis, botulinum toxin (BTX) injections, anticholinergic medications, curettage and newer energy-based technologies that damage the sweat gland.

Conclusions

The evidence for the effectiveness and safety of treatments for primary hyperhidrosis is limited overall, and few firm conclusions can be drawn. However, there is moderate-quality evidence to support the use of BTX for axillary hyperhidrosis. A trial comparing BTX with iontophoresis for palmar hyperhidrosis is warranted.

### A phase 3, randomized, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neu-BoNT / A in treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^112ft42M]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin type A is widely used to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis and has proven to be an effective and safe approach. Onabotulinumtoxin A was approved by the FDA as a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Neu-BoNT/A in subjects diagnosed with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

Methods

The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, gravimetric measurement of sweat, and Global Assessment Scale were analyzed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 to determine the effect of treatment. Adverse events, physical examination, and vital signs were monitored.

Results

Subjects treated with Neu-BoNT/A showed statistically significant improvement by all 3 methods at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 (P value = 0.00). There were no severe adverse events or significant changes in vital signs, physical examination, or laboratory tests.

Conclusion

Neu-BoNT/A can be effectively and safely used for primary axillary hyperhidrosis.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: the results of the james lind alliance priority setting partnership [^113QDuzD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interim priority setting

A second survey listed all the indicative questions in a random order, and was open for 8 weeks. Participants were asked to select up to 10 uncertainties that they felt were the most important for research to answer. After the survey closed, the uncertainties were ranked in order of the number of times they were each selected. The uncertainties were ranked separately for HCPs and for people with hyperhidrosis and their family and friends to see whether the priorities of the two groups were different. In order to include the Top 10 priorities from each group, a total of 23 uncertainties were taken to the final workshop.

Final workshop

Participants were invited to attend a final workshop event at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK on 30 November 2018. The participants (n = 18) were divided into two groups, each of which included both people with hyperhidrosis and HCPs. Each group had a trained facilitator from the James Lind Alliance who used a nominal group technique. Ground rules were set, including the need to keep discussions confidential and respect the opinions of others. The 23 questions were randomized and allocated a letter of the alphabet. Cards for each question were provided and participants worked together to rank them in order of priority. The rankings from each group were scored from 1 (the top priority) to 23 (the lowest priority), and then combined to give a total score whereby the lowest score represented the highest priority. The groups were then mixed up and given the combined rankings and the process was repeated again. Finally, a plenary session including all participants that agreed the final ranking for all 23 questions, and came up with the final Top 10 list.

### Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^116qrwBw]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is a life-threatening emergency manifested by marked elevation of blood glucose and hyperosmolarity with little or no ketosis. Although there are multiple precipitating causes, underlying infections are the most common. Other causes include certain medications, nonadherence to therapy, undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, substance abuse, and coexisting disease. In children and adolescents, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is often present when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. Physical findings include profound dehydration and neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma. Treatment begins with intensive monitoring of the patient and laboratory values, especially glucose, sodium, and potassium levels. Vigorous correction of dehydration is critical, requiring an average of 9 L of 0.9% saline over 48 hours in adults. After urine output is established, potassium replacement should begin. Once dehydration is partially corrected, adults should receive an initial bolus of 0.1 units of intravenous insulin per kg of body weight, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 units per kg per hour (or a continuous infusion of 0.14 units per kg per hour without an initial bolus) until the blood glucose level decreases below 300 mg per dL. In children and adolescents, dehydration should be corrected at a rate of no more than 3 mOsm per hour to avoid cerebral edema. Identification and treatment of underlying and precipitating causes are necessary.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study [^113S3NTo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Statistical analysis

Randomization of 150 patients in each treatment group was estimated to provide > 90% power at a significance level of 0.05 to detect a difference when comparing the primary efficacy endpoint between GT 3.75% and vehicle and GT 2.5% and vehicle, assuming a vehicle response rate of 20% and a 20% risk difference between GT 3.75% and vehicle and GT 2.5% and vehicle based on previous studies.

Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intention‐to‐treat (mITT) population, which included all patients who were randomized and treated with GT or vehicle.

Primary efficacy endpoint testing among doses was adjusted for multiplicity using a closed testing procedure. A comparison between GT 2.5% and vehicle was tested only when the statistical significance between GT 3.75% and vehicle was confirmed at a two‐sided alpha level of 0.05. No adjustment was made for multiplicity for the secondary endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint and other binary secondary endpoints were analyzed using Pearson's χ²‐test. Log‐transformed gravimetrically‐measured sweat production was calculated for secondary and exploratory endpoints, and conditional longitudinal data analysis was used to compare sweat production between groups. Missing data were imputed as a non‐responder for binary endpoints but were not imputed for continuous endpoints. One pre‐specified sensitivity analysis was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint: Pearson's χ²‐test with last observation carried forward imputation for missing data. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute).

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114Hox5Z]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Definition of terms — local and patient-important hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, idiopathic hirsutism, and hypertrichosis distinction: Local hair growth is unwanted localized hair growth in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score, and patient-important hirsutism is unwanted sexual hair growth of any degree that causes sufficient distress for women to seek additional treatment. For this guideline, hyperandrogenism is defined as clinical features that result from increased androgen production and/or action, and idiopathic hirsutism is hirsutism without hyperandrogenemia or other signs or symptoms indicative of a hyperandrogenic endocrine disorder. Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis — generalized excessive hair growth that may be hereditary or medication related — which is distributed in a generalized, nonsexual pattern and is not caused by excess androgen.

### Resources for hyperhidrosis sufferers, patients, and health care providers [^115FHtFr]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The excessive sweating of hyperhidrosis creates profound psychosocial, professional, and financial burdens on the individual sufferer; it contributes to impaired self-worth and self-efficacy, decreased satisfaction in all relationships, avoidance of specific careers, and increased expenditures on everything from clothing to medical treatment. Despite morbidity equal to other well-known dermatologic conditions, hyperhidrosis has historically been underacknowledged and undertreated because of the lack of accessible, scientifically accurate information and dispersal of that information within patient and medical communities. Thankfully, the development of the Internet and the work of the not-for-profit International Hyperhidrosis Society (IHHS) have increased awareness of hyperhidrosis.

### Hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis: fold (intertriginous) dermatoses [^114ZvJ4M]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Human sweat glands disorders are common and can have a significant impact on the quality of life and on professional, social, and emotional burdens. It is of paramount importance to diagnose and treat them properly to ensure optimal patient care. Hyperhidrosis is characterized by increased sweat secretion, which can be idiopathic or secondary to other systemic conditions. Numerous therapeutic options have been introduced with variable success. Novel methods with microwave-based and ultrasound devices have been developed and are currently tested in comparison to the conventional approaches. All treatment options for hyperhidrosis require frequent monitoring by a dermatologist for evaluation of the therapeutic progress. Bromhidrosis and chromhidrosis are rare disorders but are still equally disabling as hyperhidrosis. Bromhidrosis occurs secondary to excessive secretion from either apocrine or eccrine glands that become malodorous on bacterial breakdown. The condition is further aggravated by poor hygiene or underlying disorders promoting bacterial overgrowth, including diabetes, intertrigo, erythrasma, and obesity. Chromhidrosis is a rare dermatologic disorder characterized by secretion of colored sweat with a predilection for the axillary area and the face. Treatment is challenging in that the condition usually recurs after discontinuation of therapy and persists until the age-related regression of the sweat glands.

### A 44-week open-label study evaluating safety and efficacy of topical glycopyrronium tosylate in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^111PKGif]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term treatment response in patients remaining on GT from the double-blind trials into the open-label extension (GT → GT) and in those patients newly exposed to GT in the open-label extension (VEH → GT) was evaluated. At week 44 of the open-label extension, patients who had been taking VEH in the double-blind trials showed a substantial reduction in sweat production compared with week 4 of the double-blind trials (Fig. 3 b). By week 2 of the open-label extension, the HDSS response rate was 62.8% (223/355) for GT → GT (patients who had been taking GT in the double-blind trials) vs. 55.7% (102/183) for VEH → GT, representing a marked increase in response for those patients who had been taking VEH in the double-blind trials. The HDSS response was maintained and slightly increased over the course of the open-label extension for both groups, with 67.7% (126/186) for GT → GT and 60.4% (64/106) for VEH → GT at week 44/ET (Fig. 4 c). Analyses of the DLQI mean score change showed a similar trend (Fig. 5 c).

Results

Patient Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Disease Characteristics

Of the 651 patients who completed the double-blind lead-in trials, 564 (86.6%) continued into the open-label extension. Of those 564 patients, 369 (65.4%) had received GT and 195 (34.6%) had received VEH during double-blind treatment (Fig. 1). A total of 226 (40.1%) patients completed week 44. The most common reasons for discontinuation were early study termination by the sponsor, per protocol, once study objectives were achieved (106/564 [18.8%]), lost to follow-up (92/564 [16.3%]), withdrawal of consent (82/564 [14.5%]), and TEAEs (44/564 [7.8%]). Only three patients discontinued because of a lack of efficacy (included in the 'withdrawal of consent' category). Of the 564 enrolled patients, 13 had no post-baseline assessment and one did not receive the study drug; therefore, the safety population comprised 550 patients, with 55.3% female, 83.3% white, mean age of 33.0 years, and mean body mass index of 27.3 kg/m² at the start of the double-blind trials (Table 1). At baseline of the open-label extension (week 4 of the double-blind trials), patients entering the open-label extension who had been taking GT during the double-blind trials (GT → GT) had lower sweat production and HDSS and DLQI/CDLQI scores than patients entering the open-label extension who had been treated with VEH for the previous 4 weeks (VEH → GT) [Table 1 of the ESM], consistent with the significant improvement in these efficacy measures observed with GT in the double-blind trial population at week 4.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Study Design

This 52‐week, multicenter, open‐label, nonrandomized, repeated‐treatment study was conducted between August 2005 and June 2007 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The local ethics committee provided approval before study initiation. All patients, parents, and guardians provided written informed assent or consent.

Adolescents with PAH completed baseline assessments at screening 7 to 10 days before onabotulinumtoxinA administration. The hyperhidrotic area of each axilla was identified using Minor's iodine starch test, then onabotulinumtoxinA was injected intradermally (50 U per axilla in a 2‐mL volume using 10–15 injections per axilla; total dose, 100 U). Follow‐up evaluations occurred by telephone 1 week after treatment, at office visits scheduled 4 and 8 weeks after each treatment, and monthly by telephone.

### The etiology, diagnosis, and management of hyperhidrosis: a comprehensive review: etiology and clinical work-up [^115JdZ68]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a dermatologic disorder defined by sweat production exceeding thermoregulatory needs. Clinically, HH is diagnosed when excess sweating creates significant emotional, physical, or social discomfort, causing a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. Existing data imply that this condition may affect at least 4.8% of the US population. The etiology of HH may stem from a complex autonomic nervous system dysfunction, resulting in neurogenic overactivity of otherwise normal eccrine sweat glands. Alternatively, HH may be a result of aberrant central control of emotions. This condition is categorized as primary or secondary HH. Approximately 93% of patients with HH have primary HH, of whom > 90% have a typical focal and bilateral distribution affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas. Secondary HH presents in a more generalized and asymmetric distribution and is generated by various underlying diseases or medications. Secondary causes of HH need to be excluded before diagnosing primary HH.

### Efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A in primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^113qLHE1]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

We conducted statistical analyses using RevMan5.4, a software specifically designed for meta-analyses, which offers robust features for data synthesis and analysis. Additionally, to independently evaluate the quality of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two reviewers utilized the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool, ensuring a systemic and standardized assessment of study quality. The meta-analysis was performed on a dataset derived from a total of 12 including studies. In cases where significant heterogeneity was present among the studies (I² > 50%), we employed random-effects models for the meta-analysis.

Subgroup Analyses

Included studies were divided into 2 subgroups based on the different measurement received by the control group (placebo versus non-placebo). This method provided a more nuanced understanding of the intervention's efficacy and safety in relation to the choice of control group.

Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the meta-analysis results by excluding trials with high or unknown risk of bias. We excluded trials with high risk of bias in one or more domains, unknown risk of bias with an unclear risk of bias in key domains where the information provided was insufficient to make a definitive assessment, as well as quasi randomized or cluster randomized trials.

After excluding the studies based on the aforementioned criteria, we recalculated the pooled effect estimates and confidence intervals for both the primary and secondary outcomes using the random-effects model. This allowed us to compare the results of the sensitivity analyses with those of the main analysis to determine if excluding studies with a high or unknown risk of bias significantly altered the conclusions.

Safety and Efficacy Assessments

The primary objective of the open-label extension was the assessment of long-term safety. Safety was assessed through treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), local skin reactions (LSRs), laboratory testing, vital signs, and physical examination. Patients were asked about adverse events (AEs) in a non-specific manner using open-ended questions; specific inquiry and evaluation regarding reported AEs were to be conducted when applicable. Local skin reaction evaluation was a static assessment of expected events associated with topically applied products and included burning/stinging, pruritus, edema, erythema, dryness, and scaling; LSRs were graded as mild, moderate, or severe at each clinical visit. Treatment-emergent adverse events were evaluated through week 45 and LSRs through week 44 of the open-label extension; events reported are those with an onset after the first application of GT in the open-label extension. Discontinuations because of a lack of efficacy were captured under the category of withdrawn consent. Treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest were defined based on association with anticholinergic compounds and potential for serious medical consequences; the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms that were pre-specified as TEAEs of special interest were vision blurred, mydriasis, pupils unequal, and hypermetropia and the following terms for symptoms of urinary hesitancy/retention: nocturia, pollakiuria, urinary hesitation, urinary retention, urinary obstruction, and urine flow decreased. Patients with symptoms suggestive of urinary retention were to be evaluated for its clinical course, and for symptoms of urinary obstruction, patients were to be referred to a urologist or for emergency care. Patients who complained of blurry vision were to be carefully queried about the onset of symptoms. If there was no history of inadvertent introduction of study drug into the eye, the patient was to be evaluated to rule out any serious acute condition. If blurry vision continued for > 24 h, the patient was to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist or referred to emergency care. Dose interruptions were allowed if a patient experienced intolerable treatment-related AEs and mandated for treatment-related blurry vision and urinary retention/hesitancy-related symptoms.

The HDSS is used to assess the severity of primary focal hyperhidrosis by classifying subjective symptoms as follows: (i) sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities; (ii) sweating is tolerable, but sometimes interferes with daily activities; (iii) sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities; and (iv) sweating is intolerable and always interferes with daily activities.

The HDSM‐Ax is a severity scale for axillary hyperhidrosis, and is a 5‐point (0–4) patient‐reported outcome measure with mean response scores comprised of 11 individual questions. 12 The DLQI, which is designed to evaluate the skin disease‐related QOL, was modified into the DLQI (for axillary hyperhidrosis) to make it more suitable in assessment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Responses to 10 questions were scored and summed to obtain the DLQI (for axillary hyperhidrosis) score.

The gravimetric weight of sweat, HDSS and HDSM‐Ax score were measured at baseline‐1 to ‐3, week 2, week 4 and week 6‐1 to ‐3. The DLQI score was measured at baseline‐3, week 4 and week 6‐3.

The safety end‐points were adverse events, local tolerance (assessed by the physician and patients), vital signs and laboratory values (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis). Adverse events were coded into the systemic organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA/J version 21.1. An adverse event that, in the opinion of the sponsor with reference to that of the investigator, may be attributable to an anticholinergic effect was considered as an anticholinergic adverse event if the medical expert agreed. Multiple episodes of the same adverse event in the same patient were counted as one patient in calculation of the incidence. For local tolerance, the physician assessed dryness, erythema and scaling on a 5‐point sale (0, none; 1, minimal; 2, mild; 3, moderate; and 4, severe), and patients assessed burning sensation and itching on a 5‐point sale (0, none; 1, very mild; 2, mild; 3, moderate; and 4, severe).

### Acromegaly: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112pUTUc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Acromegaly — diagnosis: We recommend measurement of IGF-1 levels in patients with typical clinical manifestations of acromegaly, especially those with acral and facial features. We suggest the measurement of IGF-1 in patients without the typical manifestations of acromegaly, but who have several of these associated conditions: sleep apnea syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, debilitating arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperhidrosis, and hypertension. We recommend measuring serum IGF-1 to rule out acromegaly in a patient with a pituitary mass. We recommend against relying on the use of random GH levels to diagnose acromegaly. In patients with elevated or equivocal serum IGF-1 levels, we recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by finding lack of suppression of GH to < 1 μg/L following documented hyperglycemia during an oral glucose load.

### The hyperhidrosis disease severity measure-axillary: conceptualization and development of item content [^115VVkgm]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis (AHH) suffer from a variety of symptoms. Improved patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are needed to better assess and categorize the severity of AHH symptoms experienced by patients because the widely used Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a single-item measure that cannot capture the broad scope of disease impact.

Methods

The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary (HDSM-Ax) was developed for determining the severity of excessive sweating in patients with primary focal AHH based on face-to-face concept elicitation interviews with 58 AHH patients, a literature review, and expert clinical input. Two waves of face-to-face cognitive interviews (n = 26 and n = 27) were conducted to evaluate HDSM-Ax clarity and relevance. Additional interviews (n = 5) were conducted to confirm content. Adding Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT) analyses allowed for an iterative streamlined approach to documenting content validity and other cross-sectional measurement properties of the new HDSM-Ax measurement.

Results

The 11-item HDSM-Ax PRO scale (0–4 scale per item; 0–44 total scale) represents an AHH symptom range of 0 (no sweating) to 44 (worst possible sweating). Content validity of the HDSM-Ax was documented by showing that chronologically-grouped interviews demonstrated saturation in AHH symptom severity concepts. Cognitive debriefing interviews provided evidence that item content is complete, comprehensible, meaningful, and relevant. RMT-based exploration indicated that targeting of the HDSM-Ax was adequate, suggesting good matching between items and persons; item fit was adequate, suggesting a clinically cohesive scale; and items appeared to be stable between subgroups, thereby supporting a summary score.

Conclusions

The HDSM-Ax is a well-developed measure of AHH severity based on patient-reported signs and symptoms. It is a superior measure to the HDSS and can be used in clinical research and clinical practice to quantify changes in symptom severity in response to treatment.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: a meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^116HaxPr]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study aims at assessing the treatment effect, disease severity and quality-of-life outcomes of botulinum toxin (BTX) injections for focal hyperhidrosis.

Methods

We included randomized controlled trials of BTX injections compared with placebo for patients with primary or secondary focal hyperhidrosis. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched to August 2020. Gravimetric sweat rate reduction, disease severity measured by Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale and quality-of-life assessment measured by Dermatology Life Quality Index were the outcomes of interest. Cochrane risk-of-bias tools were employed for quality assessment of given randomized controlled trials.

Results

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 937). Overall, risk bias was mixed and mostly moderate. BTX injections showed reduced risk in comparison with placebo for the gravimetric quantitative sweat reduction of > 50% from baseline (risk difference: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.74). Additionally, improvements were seen for disease severity and quality-of-life assessments evaluated by Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score reduction of ≥ 2 points (risk difference: 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.69) and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (mean difference: − 5.55, 95% CI − 7.11 to − 3.98). The acquired data were insufficient to assess for long-term outcomes and limited to an eight-week follow-up period.

Conclusions

In focal axillary hyperhidrosis, BTX significantly reduces sweat production and yields superior outcomes in assessments of disease severity and quality-of-life. However, the quality-of-evidence is overall moderate and included studies account for short-term trial periods only. Further studies assessing BTX in comparison with first-line treatments for hyperhidrosis are warranted.

### Current diagnosis and treatment of hyperglycemic emergencies [^111xGoif]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state are the most feared complications of uncontrolled diabetes seen in emergency medicine. The treatment of both conditions must be tailored to individual patients and relies on aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin replacement, and electrolyte management. Emergency medicine providers must address the underlying causes and monitor for complications of therapy. Improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and application of evidence-based guidelines have significantly improved prognosis and decreased mortality. The purpose of this article is to review the diagnosis, presentation, and emergency department management of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state with an emphasis on current management and treatment guidelines.

Data provision

The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in Figshare.

Initial survey

The initial survey was completed by 268 respondents, who suggested 592 questions they would like to see answered by research. The demographic data of the respondents are shown in Table 2. Although there was a spread across all ages, 42% were in the 25–44‐year age group and 37% in the 45–64‐year age group. More women than men (79% vs. 18%) completed the survey. The majority of respondents identified as White (80%), 11% as Asian/British Asian and 4% as Black/African/Caribbean/Black British. Different groups of participants were well represented in the cohort; 58% were people with hyperhidrosis, 29% were HCPs, 11% were friends or family of people with hyperhidrosis and 2% fell into > 1 category.

Table 2
Participant characteristics of the participants of the first survey (n = 242 a).

Out of 592 questions, 160 were deemed to be out of scope (Fig. 2). The main reasons for this were individuals asking for medical advice, questions about the cause of hyperhidrosis or service provision, or questions about raising awareness of hyperhidrosis. Others were precluded because the questions were about different health conditions, or it was unclear what question was being asked. From the remaining 432 questions, 48 indicative questions were formed. Three were questions about adverse effects for which the answer is already known, leaving 45 questions that were the research uncertainties for the interim prioritization (Supplementary Table S1).

Figure 2
Flowchart of participant responses and prioritization.

Interim survey

The interim prioritization survey was completed by 286 participants. The demographic composition of this group was not significantly different to the participants in the first survey (data not shown). Following the interim prioritization, 23 uncertainties were selected for the final workshop. The top 23 uncertainties were ranked according to the total number of respondents who ranked the uncertainty in their Top 10. A further adjusted ranking was calculated, with the groups divided into one group comprising people with hyperhidrosis plus friends and family and a second group comprising HCPs, and given equal weightings. However, this did not change the uncertainties that were included in the top 23; instead, it made only minor changes to the ranking order.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: post hoc pediatric subgroup analysis from a 44-week open-label extension study [^1172RQho]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Safety and efficacy assessments

This post hoc analysis reports safety and descriptive efficacy findings in pediatric (≥ 9 to ≤ 16 years) patients in the OLE. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long‐term safety of GT, which was assessed through treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), local skin reactions (LSRs), laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examinations. Detailed description of safety assessments, including management of adverse events, has been reported. 10 TEAEs were evaluated through Week 45 and were defined as those events having an onset date on/after the first GT application in the OLE. The duration of adverse events could be self‐reported or noted as part of a symptom‐directed physical exam. All patients were assessed at each clinic visit for LSRs, including burning/stinging, pruritus, edema, erythema, dryness, and scaling. Each LSR was scored as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe), and evaluated through Week 44.

Descriptive efficacy assessments included three outcomes that were among those used in the double‐blind trials. 8, 9, 14 Sweat production was gravimetrically measured on Day 1 (double‐blind Week 4) and Week 44 or ET. The HDSS, a hyperhidrosis‐specific, patient‐reported outcome, 13 was used to assess sweating severity by measuring sweat impact on daily activities using a 4‐point scale (1 [never noticeable/never interferes with daily activities] to 4 [intolerable/always interferes with daily activities]). The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI; patients ≥ 4 to ≤ 16 years) was used to assess quality of life; higher scores (0 to 30 numeric rating scale) indicate lower quality of life. 15, 16

### Clinical question: how to approach a patient presenting with sweating and flushing [^117VKxAY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sweating and flushing are normal physiological processes, but may be the presenting feature of endocrine disease and are a frequent reason for referral from primary care. The most common endocrinopathies causing sweating include excursions of blood glucose, hypogonadism and thyroid dysfunction. Rarer pathologies include phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL), neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), and medullary thyroid carcinoma, which present with a constellation of symptoms that require a clinical index of suspicion. The pre-test probability of sweating being caused by rare endocrinopathies is significantly increased in the context of a family history of known tumour-predisposing germline mutations. Primary hyperhidrosis may have a hypothalamic basis and should be referred for consideration of neurological disease. Where no endocrine pathology is found, managing patient expectations, considering potential causes such as medication and non-endocrine diseases, and involving other clinicians with a pragmatic approach to symptom improvement are important aspects of the consultation in patients with sweating and flushing.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### Clinical, metabolic, and organ-specific indices of thyroid function [^116ebcwY]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Presently there are a sufficient number of sensitive and specific tests of thyroid function to establish a diagnosis of thyroid disease with a high degree of precision. A variety of clinical situations, however, including but not limited to thyroid hormone resistance states, alterations in thyroid-binding proteins and nonthyroidal illness, challenge the clinician to evaluate the thyroid status of the patient beyond that which can be done with routine laboratory tests. This article reviews several clinical, cardiac, skeletal muscle, and other laboratory studies that have been suggested to complement the overall assessment of thyroid status.
