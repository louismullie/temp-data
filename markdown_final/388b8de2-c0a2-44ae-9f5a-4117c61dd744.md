## Question

What are the differential diagnoses for acute redness on the dorsum of the foot that is tender to palpation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis of acute redness on the dorsum of the foot that is tender to palpation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediately dangerous diagnoses that can mimic cellulitis. Then, I should evaluate common infectious causes like nonpurulent cellulitis and erysipelas. Next, I will consider noninfectious mimics such as crystal arthropathy, Charcot neuroarthropathy, venous thrombosis, vasculitis, immersion injuries, and complex regional pain syndrome. After that, I need to outline targeted diagnostics that narrow the differential. Finally, I will align initial management and red-flag follow-up with guideline-based recommendations, making sure I verify special exposures and comorbid risks along the way [^1119mx9Q] [^111zAoE9].

> Let me first confirm the clinical anchor: acute erythema and tenderness on the dorsal foot are most commonly due to cellulitis of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, typically caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus, but I should not jump to conclusions before excluding emergencies that look similar but have different management pathways [^1119mx9Q].

> Hold on, I should verify life-threatening mimics up front. Necrotizing soft tissue infection should be suspected if there is pain out of proportion, rapidly progressive erythema, bullae, crepitus, skin anesthesia, or systemic toxicity, warranting immediate surgical evaluation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, since delays increase mortality [^111zAoE9]. Septic arthritis must be considered if erythema and exquisite tenderness are centered over a joint with effusion and restricted range of motion, in which case arthrocentesis is mandatory before antibiotics when feasible to preserve diagnostic yield [^116RqpmU]. I also need to check for deep vein thrombosis as a mimic when there is prominent swelling or calf involvement; pretest probability plus D-dimer and duplex ultrasound guide confirmation or exclusion in a structured fashion [^114NwUKM].

> Next, I will examine the likelihood of classic infectious etiologies. Nonpurulent cellulitis typically presents with diffuse, ill-defined erythema, warmth, edema, and tenderness without a focal fluctuance; it is most often streptococcal, whereas purulent collections imply abscess with S. aureus predominance, and erysipelas shows more sharply demarcated, raised borders, often due to streptococci on the leg and face [^1119mx9Q] [^115bGS1k]. I should double-check MRSA risk factors to decide on initial coverage: penetrating trauma, prior MRSA elsewhere, nasal colonization, injection drug use, or sepsis justify an agent active against MRSA plus streptococci, otherwise beta-lactam coverage of streptococci suffices in typical nonpurulent presentations per IDSA [^111zAoE9].

> But wait, what if there are special exposure clues. If there was coastal or brackish water exposure or a wound acquired in seawater, I need to suspect Vibrio vulnificus and start prompt, appropriate antibiotics because early therapy improves survival; this is particularly critical in patients with chronic liver disease or immunocompromise [^115fsSTS]. I should also re-check for interdigital tinea pedis or toe web maceration as portal of entry predisposing to recurrent cellulitis, along with venous insufficiency and lymphedema, since addressing these reduces recurrence risk [^1114WZ9H].

> I will now consider noninfectious inflammatory mimics that can localize to the foot. Acute gout or calcium pyrophosphate deposition can present with abrupt erythema, warmth, and tenderness and are frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis; a joint-centric process with marked pain and possible tophus favors crystals, and arthrocentesis with crystal analysis — when a joint effusion is present — is decisive, while an elevated delta neutrophil index favors cellulitis over gout in ambiguous presentations within 24 hours of admission [^116RqpmU] [^115k6Nzc] [^111N3yZt]. Wait, I should verify distribution: gout often targets the first MTP but can involve midfoot; if the erythema is periarticular and not diffuse soft tissue, the pretest probability for crystal arthritis rises [^116RqpmU].

> Let me think about neuropathic and diabetes-related conditions. In a person with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, acute Charcot neuroarthropathy can present as a hot, red, swollen foot with relatively mild pain, often mimicking cellulitis early; a notable temperature differential between feet, bounding pulses, and preserved perfusion support this diagnosis, and prompt offloading is critical to prevent collapse and deformity [^114gvAvQ] [^112nbB3N]. I need to ensure I examine for coexisting diabetic foot infection or osteomyelitis when an ulcer is present, using inflammatory biomarkers plus probe-to-bone and plain films to triage further imaging in line with IWGDF/IDSA guidance, and to perform a full foot exam including monofilament and pulse assessment per ADA standards [^11577P97] [^116Yh48k] [^116AvQ5r].

> I should also review vasculitic and panniculitic processes, though these are less likely with focal dorsal foot tenderness. Palpable purpura, livedo, or systemic features would suggest vasculitis and direct laboratory and biopsy evaluation; however, in an immunocompromised host, IDSA reminds me to keep a broad differential including drug eruptions, Sweet syndrome, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis among cellulitis mimics [^1128e1Eo] [^115uKspM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I briefly considered erythema nodosum, but that usually presents as tender, erythematous nodules on the anterior shins rather than a focal dorsal foot plaque, so it is less consistent here unless the distribution is atypical and nodular [^114SFc7U].

> Next, I should review immersion syndromes and other environmental mimics if the history fits. Prolonged wet exposure can cause nonfreezing immersion foot syndromes with erythema, edema, dysesthesia, and gait disturbance; tropical warm water immersion foot can produce predominant dorsal surface burning and redness after several days of exposure, which can resemble infection but improves with drying, gradual rewarming, and supportive care rather than antibiotics [^117X489F] [^113HhFiL] [^111E2Dxf].

> I will now examine whether complex regional pain syndrome could mimic this presentation. CRPS can present with a warm, red, edematous extremity in the acute "warm" subtype, sometimes after a minor injury; however, disproportionate persistent pain with sensory, vasomotor, and sudomotor changes plus motor/trophic findings are typical, and the time course often exceeds a simple acute cellulitis window, so I should consider CRPS if redness persists, becomes chronic, or is accompanied by autonomic and motor signs [^111Lpee9] [^113xKcLq] [^111NsCXg].

> Let me outline a targeted diagnostic approach. I should confirm vitals and systemic toxicity, delineate borders of erythema, and look for fluctuance, lymphangitis, portals of entry, ulcers, or joint effusion; obtain CBC and CRP/ESR when the diagnosis is equivocal or severe, and in diabetic foot scenarios to support decision-making when exam is difficult [^116AvQ5r]. If a joint is involved, I should perform arthrocentesis before antibiotics when feasible to differentiate septic arthritis from crystal disease, as delays can be catastrophic [^116RqpmU]. If DVT is suspected, I should use a clinical prediction rule plus D-dimer and duplex ultrasound to confirm or exclude thrombus rather than relying on exam alone [^114NwUKM]. I should also consider plain radiographs if there was trauma, concern for foreign body, gas, or chronic wound, recognizing that yield is higher with those predictors in lower extremity cellulitis workups [^112AQ958].

> Hold on, I should verify initial empiric treatment alignment with guideline risk stratification. For uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk factors, I would start a beta-lactam active against streptococci and reassess in 48–72 hours; duration is typically 5 days but can be extended to 7–10 days if the clinical response is slow, per contemporary surgical and ID recommendations [^114eeoYo]. If MRSA risk factors or severe systemic features are present, IDSA recommends vancomycin or another agent active against MRSA plus streptococci; if an abscess is present, incision and drainage are essential, with antibiotics guided by severity and risk [^111zAoE9]. If there is seawater exposure with compatible features, I should initiate prompt Vibrio-active therapy and urgent evaluation because early treatment reduces mortality [^115fsSTS].

> I need to ensure supportive and preventive measures are not overlooked. Education on wound hygiene and avoiding sharing of personal items reduces transmission and recurrence risks in skin infections, and addressing portals of entry like interdigital tinea pedis, as well as edema and venous insufficiency, lowers recurrence rates after successful treatment [^1114UPEg] [^1114WZ9H]. In patients with diabetes, routine foot examinations including neurologic and vascular assessments should be reinforced to prevent complications that can mimic or complicate cellulitis [^116Yh48k].

> Let me reconsider red flags and follow-up. Failure to improve within 48–72 hours should prompt reassessment for abscess, resistant organisms, atypical pathogens, alternative diagnoses such as gout or Charcot, or an occult necrotizing infection; obesity and certain comorbidities increase risk of initial treatment failure, and recurrence is common, so clear return precautions and rechecks are prudent [^1119mx9Q]. In immunocompromised patients or those with atypical features, maintaining a broad differential that includes noninfectious dermatoses and vasculitic processes is essential to avoid anchoring bias [^115uKspM].

Sudden redness and tenderness on the dorsum of the foot most commonly indicate **cellulitis** [^1119mx9Q] or **gout** [^116RqpmU], but may also signal DVT [^114NwUKM], trauma [^116RqpmU], or early Charcot neuroarthropathy [^114gvAvQ]. Rapidly progressive erythema with severe pain or systemic signs warrants **urgent evaluation** for necrotizing fasciitis or septic arthritis [^116RqpmU]. Key distinguishing features include fever and lymphangitis (cellulitis) [^1119mx9Q], acute monoarthritis with tophi or hyperuricemia (gout) [^111N3yZt], and neuropathy with foot deformity (Charcot) [^114gvAvQ]. Initial workup should include CBC, ESR/CRP, blood cultures, and imaging (ultrasound for DVT [^114NwUKM], X-ray for Charcot [^114gvAvQ], and MRI for deep infection [^111BGF2y]) to guide **timely management**.

---

### Acute arterial occlusion

Sudden pain with pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia ("six Ps") suggests **acute limb ischemia**. Risk factors include atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, and embolic events; complications include limb ischemia and gangrene.

---

## Traumatic and orthopedic conditions

### Fracture or soft tissue injury

Erythema, swelling, tenderness, bruising, and deformity occur in the context of a **trauma history**. Risk factors include recent trauma, osteoporosis, and high-impact activities; complications include nonunion, chronic pain, and deformity [^116RqpmU].

---

### Erythema nodosum

On the lower extremities, **tender erythematous nodules** are associated with systemic diseases or medications. Risk factors include streptococcal infections, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and medications; potential complications include chronic inflammation and recurrence [^114SFc7U].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic approach is essential to differentiate these conditions:

- **History**: Onset, duration, trauma, systemic symptoms, medical history, medications [^116RqpmU].

- **Physical examination**: Erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, systemic signs [^1119mx9Q].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, uric acid, synovial fluid analysis [^116AvQ5r] [^116RqpmU].

- **Imaging**: X-ray, ultrasound, MRI, CT angiography [^114NwUKM] [^111BGF2y].

---

Sudden redness and tenderness on the dorsum of the foot can result from infectious, inflammatory, vascular, traumatic, or dermatological conditions. A **structured clinical evaluation** with targeted labs and imaging is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^114kM2k4].

### Acute monoarthritis: Diagnosis in adults [^116RqpmU]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute monoarthritis can be the initial manifestation of many joint disorders. The most common diagnoses in the primary care setting are osteoarthritis, gout, and trauma. It is important to understand the prevalence of specific etiologies and to use the appropriate diagnostic modalities. A delay in diagnosis and treatment, particularly in septic arthritis, can have catastrophic results, including sepsis, bacteremia, joint destruction, or death. The history and physical examination can guide the use of laboratory and imaging studies.

- **Focal bone pain or recent trauma**: The presence of focal bone pain or recent trauma requires radiography of the affected joint to rule out metabolic bone disease, tumor, or fracture.

- **Joint effusion without trauma or recent surgery**: If there is a joint effusion in the absence of trauma or recent surgery, and signs of infection (e.g. fever, erythema, warmth) are present, subsequent arthrocentesis should be performed. Inflammatory synovial fluid containing monosodium urate crystals indicates a high probability of gout. Noninflammatory synovial fluid suggests osteoarthritis or internal derangement.

Pitfalls in the diagnosis and early treatment of acute monoarthritis include failure to perform arthrocentesis, administering antibiotics before aspirating the joint when septic arthritis is suspected (or failing to start antibiotics after aspiration), and starting treatment based solely on laboratory data, such as an elevated uric acid level.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.

- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation, and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% of cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### The Charcot foot in diabetes [^114gvAvQ]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The initial manifestations of the Charcot foot are frequently mild in nature but can become much more pronounced with unperceived repetitive trauma. Diagnostic clinical findings include neurological, vascular, musculoskeletal, and radiographic abnormalities. There have been no reported cases of Charcot neuropathy developing in the absence of neuropathy. Accordingly, peripheral sensory neuropathy associated with reduced sensation of pain is the essential predisposing condition that permits the development of the arthropathy.

Because of the very presence of insensitivity, a personal history concerning antecedent trauma is often unreliable. Typical clinical findings include a markedly swollen, warm, and often erythematous foot with only mild to modest pain or discomfort. Acute local inflammation is often the earliest sign of underlying bone and joint injury. This initial clinical picture resembles cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, or acute gout and can be misdiagnosed as such. There is most often a temperature differential between the two feet of several degrees.

The affected population typically has well-preserved or even exaggerated arterial blood flow in the foot. Pedal pulses are characteristically bounding unless obscured by edema. Patients with chronic deformities, however, can develop subsequent limb-threatening ischemia. Musculoskeletal deformity can be very slight or grossly evident, most often due to the chronicity of the problem and the anatomical site of involvement. The classic rocker-bottom foot, with or without plantar ulceration, is a characteristic finding in these cases.

### How we diagnose and treat deep vein thrombosis [^114NwUKM]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Making a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) requires both clinical assessment and objective testing because the clinical features are nonspecific, and investigations can be either falsely positive or negative. The initial step in the diagnostic process is to stratify patients into high-, intermediate-, or low-risk categories using a validated clinical model. When the clinical probability is intermediate or high, and the venous ultrasound result is positive, acute symptomatic DVT is confirmed. Similarly, when the probability is low and the ultrasound result is normal, DVT is ruled out. A low clinical probability combined with a negative D-dimer result can also be used to rule out DVT, thereby obviating the need for ultrasonography.

In contrast, when the clinical assessment is discordant with the results of objective testing, serial venous ultrasonography or venography is required to confirm or refute a diagnosis of DVT. Once a patient is diagnosed with an acute DVT, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the agent of choice for initial therapy, and oral anticoagulant therapy is the standard for long-term secondary prophylaxis. Therapy should continue for at least 3 months. The decision to continue treatment beyond 3 months is made by weighing the risks of re-thrombosis and anticoagulant-related bleeding, and is influenced by patient preference. Screening for associated thrombophilia is not indicated routinely, but should be performed in selected patients whose clinical features suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state.

### Erythema nodosum: A practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^114SFc7U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly on the lower limbs, specifically the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown; however, it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to various antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, it is imperative to rule out an underlying disease before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease triggered by a large range of processes, such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, or drugs. The most common identifiable causes include streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, thereby initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported. Nevertheless, these options address the symptoms but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis will allow the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

### Can complex regional pain syndrome be painless [^113LeSz5]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

While spontaneous and stimulus-evoked pain are the hallmarks of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, autonomic abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes in the affected limb are additional clinical characteristics distinguishing this syndrome. Even though the exact underlying mechanisms of the syndrome remain obscure, a recent hypothesis suggests that the abnormal response of neural nociceptive tissue plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CRPS via the mechanism known as 'neurogenic inflammation'. The group of patients presented here exhibited all the clinical characteristics of CRPS but had no pain, thereby indicating that ongoing or evoked pain is not a necessary condition for CRPS to be maintained. We suggest the term complex regional painless syndrome to describe this syndrome.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: A narrative review for the practising clinician [^113G4YeL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a life-altering condition that usually affects the extremities after trauma or nerve injury. The physiological changes that occur due to the inciting injury are complex, as the name of the syndrome implies. The pain and disability associated with CRPS often lead to psychological co-morbidities, creating a vicious cycle of pain, isolation, and depression. We review recent developments in the understanding of CRPS and advancements in its management. Further research targeting specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of CRPS should lead to the prevention of this condition.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: The role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest in the setting of low clinical suspicion and, due to their similarities with other inflammatory conditions in both clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. This can lead to an elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, as well as higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging topic of imaging characteristics of atypical infections and various inflammatory conditions of the hand. It emphasizes the key points that assist in differentiating between the two broad clinical categories of infections versus inflammatory causes.

### An unusual cause of limp [^111zHyEW]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Limp is a common clinical presentation in children, observed both in acute and community practice. The incidence is thought to vary between countries, with suggested figures between 1.5 and 3.6 cases of non-traumatic limp per 1,000 children. The authors present a case of a 6-year-old girl who attended their accident and emergency department with a limp. It has been suggested that the most common diagnoses in this patient's age group are transient synovitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Perthes disease, and fractures or soft tissue injuries. Surprisingly, the patient was diagnosed with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, for which limp is not a recognized presenting feature.

### Recognition and management of a malignant hyperthermia crisis: Updated 2024 guideline from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group [^115GMSXi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for malignant hyperthermia, specifically in the context of differential diagnosis, the EMHG 2025 guidelines recommend including the following conditions in the differential diagnosis of suspected MH:

- **Insufficient anesthesia, analgesia, or both**: Failure to achieve adequate anesthesia or pain relief.

- **Infection or sepsis**: Consider these as potential underlying causes.

- **Insufficient ventilation or fresh gas flow**: Problems with respiratory support or the anesthesia delivery system.

- **Anesthetic machine malfunction**: Ensure equipment is functioning properly to rule out this possibility.

- **Anaphylactic reaction**: Assess for severe allergic responses that could mimic MH symptoms.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: Consider this rare tumor that can cause similar symptoms.

- **Thyroid crisis**: Thyroid storm may present with hyperthermia and other overlapping symptoms.

- **Cerebral ischemia**: Reduced blood flow to the brain can be a differential diagnosis.

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Evaluate for underlying neuromuscular pathologies.

- **Elevated ETCO2 due to laparoscopic surgery**: Consider surgical factors that may affect CO2 levels.

- **Ecstasy or other recreational drugs**: Substance use should be part of the differential diagnosis.

- **Malignant neuroleptic syndrome**: This condition shares features with MH.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Evaluate for this syndrome caused by excess serotonin activity.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic foot, more specifically with respect to physical examination, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend including the following in the foot examination:

- **Inspection of skin**: This involves a thorough examination to identify any lesions, wounds, or abnormalities in skin texture or color.

- **Assessment of foot deformities**: It is crucial to identify structural changes or abnormalities that may affect foot function.

- **Neurological assessment**: Use a 10-g monofilament test or the Ipswich touch test with at least one additional assessment, such as pinprick, temperature, or vibration.

- **Vascular assessment**: This includes checking pulses in the legs and feet to ensure proper circulation.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: manifestations and the role of neurostimulation in its management [^114mftjV]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

The hallmark of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is excruciating pain, which may manifest as aching, burning, pricking, or shooting sensations. Diagnosis should be established as soon as possible, as response to treatment is adversely affected by any delay. The treatment of CRPS aims at improving function using an interdisciplinary, time-dependent, patient-dependent approach that encompasses rehabilitation, psychological therapy, and pain management.

If there is no response to conventional treatment, such as pharmacotherapy, within 12–16 weeks, a more interventional technique like spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be used. SCS has been shown to be highly effective in treating CRPS type I, resulting in a significant, long-term reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life. It is particularly effective at helping to restore function in affected extremities, especially if applied early in the course of the disease. Additionally, SCS is cost-effective and improves health-related quality of life.

### Clinical features and pathophysiology of complex regional pain syndrome [^1156nUnX]. The Lancet Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

A complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) — characterized by multiple system dysfunction, severe and often chronic pain, and disability — can be triggered by a minor injury, a fact that has fascinated scientists and perplexed clinicians for decades. However, substantial advances across several medical disciplines have recently improved our understanding of CRPS. Compelling evidence implicates biological pathways that underlie aberrant inflammation, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity in the clinical features of CRPS. Collectively, the evidence points to CRPS being a multifactorial disorder that is associated with an aberrant host response to tissue injury. Variation in susceptibility to perturbed regulation of any of the underlying biological pathways probably accounts for the clinical heterogeneity of CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Mystery explained [^113xn5Xj]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is the result of changes to the somatosensory systems that process noxious, tactile, and thermal information; to the sympathetic systems that innervate skin, such as blood vessels and sweat glands; and to the somatomotor systems. The changes suggest that the CNS representations of the systems have been altered. Patients with CRPS also have peripheral changes, including oedema, signs of inflammation, sympathetic-afferent coupling (the basis for sympathetically maintained pain), and trophic changes, which cannot be explained by central changes. Based on clinical observation and research in humans and animals, we hypothesize that CRPS is a systemic disease involving both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system.

The most important question for future research is what causes CRPS? In this article, we suggest a change in the focus of research efforts and treatment. We also propose there be a diagnostic reclassification and redefinition of CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Evidence for warm and cold subtypes in a large prospective clinical sample [^111Lpee9]. Pain (2016). High credibility.

Limited research suggests that there may be warm complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and cold CRPS subtypes, with inflammatory mechanisms contributing most strongly to the former. This study, for the first time, used an unbiased statistical pattern recognition technique to evaluate whether distinct warm vs. cold CRPS subtypes can be discerned in the clinical population. An international, multisite study was conducted using standardized procedures to evaluate signs and symptoms in 152 patients with clinical CRPS at baseline, with 3-month follow-up evaluations in 112 of these patients.

Two-step cluster analysis using automated cluster selection identified a 2-cluster solution as optimal. Results revealed a warm CRPS patient cluster characterized by a warm, red, edematous, and sweaty extremity and a cold CRPS patient cluster characterized by a cold, blue, and less edematous extremity. Median pain duration was significantly (P < 0.001) shorter in the warm CRPS (4.7 months) than in the cold CRPS subtype (20 months), with pain intensity comparable. A derived total inflammatory score was significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in the warm CRPS group (compared with cold CRPS) at baseline but diminished significantly (P < 0.001) over the follow-up period, whereas this score did not diminish in the cold CRPS group (time × subtype interaction: P < 0.001).

Results support the existence of a warm CRPS subtype common in patients with acute (< 6 months) CRPS and a relatively distinct cold CRPS subtype most common in chronic CRPS. The pattern of clinical features suggests that inflammatory mechanisms play a significant role.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic foot infection, specifically in terms of physical examination, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend assessing for classic signs of inflammation, such as redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, or pain, as well as purulent secretions. Additional or secondary signs include nonpurulent secretions, friable or discolored granulation tissue, undermining of wound edges, and foul odor for the evaluation of DFI.

### Acute tear of the fascia cruris at the attachment to the Achilles tendon: A new diagnosis [^116D6fKY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The literature describing the fascia cruris is limited to its functional anatomy and its surgical release in the treatment of chronic paratenonitis. Injury to this structure has not been considered previously. Tears of the fascia cruris have been observed on ultrasound and are clinically relevant to diagnosing Achilles pain accurately. Whether it has implications for the development of other Achilles tendon pathology is unknown but warrants further investigation, as do prospective studies to clarify the incidence, confirm the etiology, and identify the optimum treatment regime. Acute tears of the fascia cruris need to be considered as a cause of Achillodynia with a sudden onset of pain in active individuals. The condition provides a differential diagnosis to paratenonitis.

- **What are the new findings**:
	- Tears of the fascia cruris can occur at the attachment to the Achilles tendon and the paratenon.
	- The history is usually of acute onset Achillodynia with pain, swelling, and tenderness along the medial or lateral border of the tendon in the mid-portion.
	- Diagnosis is made using diagnostic ultrasound. Tilting the probe may be required to visualize the fascia cruris attachment to the paratenon.

- **How might it impact clinical practice in the near future**:
	- Recognition of a new pathological diagnosis in acute onset Achillodynia.
	- Differential diagnosis to paratenonitis but with different mechanisms and imaging appearances.

### Purpuric eruption in a child [^115SZFvg]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Question 1: Diagnosis options**:
	- What is the diagnosis?
	- A. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)
	- B. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)
	- C. Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD)
	- D. Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS)
	- E. Exanthematous drug eruption

- **Answers**:
	- A. HSP – Incorrect. HSP is a type of small-vessel vasculitis seen mostly in children, commonly after an upper respiratory tract infection. It presents with palpable purpura and is often associated with extracutaneous manifestations such as arthralgias, abdominal pain, and nephritis. Pathology in HSP shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels.

	- B. RMSF – Incorrect. The patient had no relevant travel history to endemic regions. Additionally, RMSF is commonly preceded by systemic symptoms such as fever, severe headache, and myalgias. Pathology in RMSF shows early perivascular edema, erythrocyte extravasation, thrombosis, and vasculitis in later lesions.

	- C. HFMD – Incorrect. HFMD presents with oval-shaped vesicles on the hands and feet and oral lesions, which were not present in this patient.

	- D. PPGSS – Correct. The clinical presentation of erythematous and purpuric patches on the hands and feet were consistent with this condition. Serum testing showed Coxsackie B6 as the culprit, a previously reported cause of PPGSS. Pathology showed a superficial perivascular mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and dermal hemorrhage. Because histopathologic findings in PPGSS are nonspecific and common to viral exanthems, biopsy is not needed as part of the evaluation. In this case, it was performed to exclude vasculitis.

	- E. Exanthematous drug eruption

### Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis: Clinical features, differential diagnosis, and management [^1125XcYS]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare, acute, severe cutaneous adverse reaction mainly attributed to drugs, although other triggers, including infections, vaccinations, ingestion of various substances, and spider bites, have also been described. AGEP is characterized by the development of edema and erythema, followed by the eruption of multiple punctate, non-follicular, sterile pustules and subsequent desquamation. AGEP typically has a rapid onset and prompt resolution within a few weeks.

The differential diagnoses for AGEP are broad and include infectious, inflammatory, and drug-induced etiologies. Diagnosis of AGEP depends on both clinical and histologic criteria, as cases of overlap with other disease processes have been reported. Management includes removal of the offending drug or treatment of the underlying cause, if necessary, and supportive care, as AGEP is a self-limited disease.

This review aims to provide an overview and update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, differentials, diagnosis, and management of AGEP.

### Delta neutrophil index contributes to the differential diagnosis between acute gout attack and cellulitis within 24 hours after hospitalization [^115k6Nzc]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

An acute gout attack is often misdiagnosed as cellulitis. Differentiating these two diseases is crucial when deciding treatment strategies. The delta neutrophil index (DNI) represents the difference between leucocyte subfractions that correspond to the fraction of immature granulocytes and can predict the bacterial infection burden. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of DNI as a predictive marker for differentiating an acute gout attack and cellulitis.

The medical records of 184 patients with an acute gout attack and 183 patients with lower limb cellulitis were reviewed. The DNI was automatically determined by the ADVIA 2120 electronic cell analyser. Logistic regression was used to determine independent variables for predicting cellulitis among clinical and laboratory markers. Subgroup analyses were performed among patients without MSU crystal confirmation and patients with normouricaemia.

Patients with an acute gout attack had lower values of DNI than those with cellulitis (0.6% vs. 2.8%; P < 0.001). These results were consistent in patients without MSU confirmation and in patients with normouricaemia (0.5% vs. 2.8% and 0.7% vs. 2.6%, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). A cut-off value of 1.7% was determined to predict cellulitis. Multivariate analysis showed that DNI was the only independent predictive value for cellulitis (odds ratio 9.699). Similar results were found in patients without MSU confirmation and in patients with normouricaemia (odds ratio 18.763 and 5.215, respectively).

This study showed that DNI was an effective marker for distinguishing between an acute gout attack and cellulitis.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of painful swollen legs in the emergency department: a pictorial essay [^111BGF2y]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with a painful swollen leg are not infrequently encountered at the emergency department and can pose a diagnostic dilemma for attending physicians. The potential causes of leg pain and swelling include trauma, infection, inflammation, and neurogenic, vascular, and iatrogenic conditions, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) being an important tool in evaluation. We describe the MRI features of various conditions causing painful swollen legs. We also discuss the differential diagnosis and the useful clinical and laboratory findings that radiologists should be aware of in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113xKcLq]. Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Is complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) a uniform phenomenon across individuals, or are there distinct subtypes and/or stages of the syndrome? This issue of diagnostic heterogeneity, addressing whether or not patient presentations (i.e. the overall pattern of CRPS signs and symptoms) tend to be similar across individuals, may have significant implications for both prognosis and treatment. Historically, three progressive stages of CRPS have been cited as important in identifying and treating the syndrome, but empirical studies indicate that the existence of such sequential stages is clinical lore. It is an unsubstantiated theory based on certain authors' clinical experience rather than an outcome of specific scientific study.

- **Statistical analysis**: Statistical analyses, including cluster analysis, to identify CRPS patient subgroups based on the presence of similar patterns of clinical features have failed to support the traditional sequential staging of CRPS. When patients are assigned into three subgroups based on similarity of CRPS features, pain duration is similar across the groups, unlike what would be expected if the traditional sequential stages of CRPS were valid.

- **Study results**: Results of the first such study identified distinct patient subgroups characterized by:
	1. A relatively limited syndrome with vasomotor signs predominating.
	2. A relatively limited syndrome with neuropathic pain/sensory abnormalities predominating.
	3. A florid CRPS syndrome with a wide array of CRPS features similar to "classic RSD" descriptions. Both studies addressing this issue found statistical evidence for these subgroup distinctions.

### Clinical interventions for tungiasis (sand flea disease): A systematic review [^1161cfiR]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on tungiasis:

- **Definition**: Tungiasis is a cutaneous parasitic infection caused by the female sand flea Tunga penetrans, which embeds into the skin, most commonly in the feet, leading to a localized inflammatory response. It is considered a neglected tropical disease, primarily affecting impoverished populations in endemic regions and receiving limited attention in public health initiatives despite its significant morbidity.

- **Pathophysiology**: The gravid female flea, approximately 1 mm in size, penetrates the skin, most often in areas that come into direct contact with the ground, such as the periungual and interdigital regions of the feet. The primary site of transmission is the unsealed floor of sleeping areas, where off-host stages of the flea develop. Once embedded, the flea burrows into the epidermis with only the posterior tip of its abdomen exposed, which allows for respiration, excretion, and egg-laying. Within the skin, the flea feeds on blood and undergoes marked hypertrophy, increasing nearly 2000-fold in size as it matures and its eggs develop. Over the course of about 7 days, it forms a painful, raised, circular lesion approximately 1 cm in diameter. A free-living male copulates with the embedded female during this period. The female releases hundreds of eggs through her exposed abdominal tip, which fall to the ground and hatch into larvae, continuing the off-host stages of the life cycle. The presence of the flea induces local tissue disruption, inflammation, and often secondary bacterial infection.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^117VgrTT]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In conclusion, these findings argue against the historical three sequential stages of CRPS. Nonetheless, the lack of support for traditional sequential stages does not invalidate the concept of other CRPS subtypes that may evolve over time. One promising candidate, consistent with clinical observations, is the distinction between "warm CRPS" and "cold CRPS".

A large, international, prospective multi-site study tested whether distinct warm and cold CRPS subtypes could be identified solely using unbiased statistical pattern recognition (i.e. no a priori assumptions). Results of cluster analysis using automated cluster selection revealed a warm CRPS patient cluster characterized by a warm, red, dry, and edematous extremity, and a distinct cold CRPS patient cluster characterized by a cold, blue, sweaty, and less edematous extremity. Consistent with clinical observations, median CRPS duration was much shorter in the warm CRPS subtype (4.7 months) than in the cold CRPS subtype (20 months), with comparable pain intensity across these subtypes.

Although a warm presentation is by far the most common in early CRPS, a small subgroup of patients was noted who had CRPS of brief duration yet displayed a cold CRPS pattern, a group provisionally labelled "primary cold CRPS". Further bearing on the issue of temporal sequencing of these subtypes, a score reflecting the total number of inflammatory features was found to be significantly elevated at baseline in the warm subtype relative to the cold subtype, with these elevations significantly diminishing only in the warm CRPS subtype over a 3-month period.

### Clinical mimics: An emergency medicine-focused review of cellulitis mimics [^114kM2k4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical condition with low rates of morbidity and mortality if treated appropriately. Mimics of cellulitis presenting with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain can be associated with grave morbidity and mortality if misdiagnosed.

- **Objective**: This review investigates the signs and symptoms of cellulitis, mimics of cellulitis, and an approach to the management of both cellulitis and its mimics.

- **Discussion**: The emergency medicine definition of cellulitis includes erythema, induration, warmth, and swelling. Given the common pathophysiologic pathways, cellulitis mimics often present in an analogous manner. These conditions include septic bursitis, septic joint, deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, flexor tenosynovitis, fight bite (closed fist injury), orbital cellulitis, toxic shock syndrome, erysipelas, abscess, felon, paronychia, and gouty arthritis. Many of these diseases have high morbidity and mortality if missed by the emergency physician. Differentiating these mimics from cellulitis can be difficult in the fast-paced emergency setting. A combination of history, physical examination, and focused diagnostic assessment may assist in correctly identifying the underlying etiology. For many of the high mortality cellulitis mimics, surgical intervention is necessary.

- **Conclusion**: Cellulitis and its mimics present similarly due to the same physiologic responses to skin and soft tissue infections. A combination of history, physical examination, and diagnostic assessment will help the emergency physician.

### An uncommon presentation of cutaneous dissemination of gout [^115LgBAQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Gout is a common inflammatory disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. Classically, gout manifests as joint pain or collections of urate crystals called tophi. Rarely, it may present as disseminated cutaneous papulonodules and/or ulcerations. Here, we present a case of disseminated gout with unique cutaneous morphologies and hyperuricemia, which may have been contributing to systemic comorbidities.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and, depending on the disorder, can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians, including interventional radiologists, often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis, as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis, as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders, and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

### Erysipelas: recognition and management [^115bGS1k]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Erysipelas is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis associated with clinical inflammation. It is a specific clinical type of cellulitis and should be studied as a distinct entity. This condition is generally caused by group A streptococci; there is a high probability that streptococcal toxins also contribute, which may partly explain the clinical inflammation. Erysipelas of the leg is the most frequently encountered clinical type. Other common sites include the face, arm, and upper thigh. After a sudden onset, areas of erythema and edema characteristically enlarge with well-defined margins. Athlete's foot is the most common portal of entry for the disease. Erysipelas is generally associated with high fever; adenopathy and lymphangitis are sometimes present.

At the time of diagnosis, it is crucial to look for clinical markers of severity, such as local signs and symptoms, general signs and symptoms, comorbidity, and social context, which may necessitate hospitalization. There are many differential diagnoses, particularly in the case of atypical dermo-hypodermitis. Some bacterial infections may have specific clinical aspects leading to a diagnosis of cellulitis. Necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis are life-threatening diseases, and a rapid diagnosis is important. Other noninfectious types of cellulitis have been reported in various diseases, both localized and generalized. The biology of typical erysipelas is of little diagnostic value, and a laboratory workup is usually not required.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Are there distinct subtypes and sequential stages of the syndrome [^111tsd9W]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

This study tested for evidence supporting the clinical lore of three sequential stages of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and examined the characteristics of possible CRPS subtypes. A series of 113 patients meeting IASP criteria for CRPS underwent standardized history and physical examinations to assess CRPS signs and symptoms in four domains identified in previous research: pain/sensory abnormalities, vasomotor dysfunction, edema/sudomotor dysfunction, and motor/trophic changes. K-Means cluster analysis was used to derive three relatively homogeneous CRPS patient subgroups based on the similarity of sign/symptom patterns in these domains.

The resulting CRPS subgroups did not differ significantly regarding pain duration as might be expected in a sequential staging model. However, the derived subgroups were statistically distinct and suggested three possible CRPS subtypes:

- **Subtype 1**: A relatively limited syndrome with vasomotor signs predominating.
- **Subtype 2**: A relatively limited syndrome with neuropathic pain/sensory abnormalities predominating.
- **Subtype 3**: A florid CRPS syndrome similar to "classic RSD" descriptions.
	- Subtype 3 showed the highest levels of motor/trophic signs and possible disuse-related changes (osteopenia) on bone scan, despite having directionally the briefest pain duration of the three groups.

EMG/NCV testing suggests that Subtype 2 may reflect CRPS-Type 2 (causalgia). Overall, these results are consistent with limited previous work that argues against three sequential stages of CRPS. However, several distinct CRPS subtypes are suggested, which could ultimately have significant clinical implications.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-e/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^114eeoYo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection primarily of the dermal lymphatics and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently, systemic upset with fever and a raised white blood cell count. Outpatient therapy should be recommended for patients with adherence to therapy who do not have general signs of inflammation or hemodynamic instability.

Patients with a previous attack of cellulitis, especially involving the legs, can present recurrences. The infection usually occurs in the same area as the previous episode. Edema, especially lymphedema, venous insufficiency, prior trauma (including surgery) to the area, and tinea pedis can increase the frequency of recurrences. Addressing these factors may decrease the frequency of recurrences.

The pathogens involved are streptococci and S. aureus. Cellulitis associated with abscesses is usually caused by S. aureus. In contrast, typical (non-purulent) cellulitis is most commonly caused by both streptococcal species and S. aureus. MRSA is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

In neutropenic and immunocompromised patients, Gram-negative bacteria should be considered.

- **Treatment**: Antibiotic therapy for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if there is a lack of symptom resolution at 5 days. Incision and drainage are recommended in purulent cellulitis.

### The Charcot foot: a pictorial review [^112nbB3N]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Charcot foot is characterized by four different disease stages resembling active and inactive disease phases: inflammation, fragmentation, coalescence, and consolidation. The disease typically follows a single progression through these stages. The active phase is marked by a hot, red, and swollen foot (inflammation), often without pain due to polyneuropathy. During this phase, the bone becomes fragile due to temporary osteopenia, leading to fractures, joint destructions (often Lisfranc's joint), and collapse of the longitudinal arch of the foot. In the less active or inactive phase, the foot is no longer red, but some soft tissue and bone marrow edema may persist. Prominent osteophytes and palpable loose bodies result from substantial joint and bone destruction followed by bony proliferations. The typical end-stage appearance of a Charcot foot is the so-called rocker-bottom deformity.

A recent study showed a risk of re-activation of a "formerly inactive" Charcot foot in about 23% of cases within a mean interval of 27 months.

- **Clinical stages and differential diagnoses**: The (modified) Eichenholtz classification, which relies on clinical and x-ray findings, is frequently used for classification purposes.

### Kohler's disease presenting as acute foot injury [^115i317p]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Kohler's disease is a rare cause of foot pain and limping in the pediatric population. The exact etiology of Kohler's disease is unknown. It usually presents as sudden and unexplained foot pain and limping. We report a case of a 5-year-old male who presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department with foot pain and an inability to bear weight for two days after overactivity and an acute foot injury. The patient was eventually diagnosed with Kohler's disease, which is avascular necrosis of the navicular bone. Although Kohler's disease is not very common, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of foot pain in the pediatric population, as it may prevent unnecessary tests and treatments.

### Clostridium septicum myonecrosis presenting as an acute painful foot [^114dawYm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Spontaneous clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene) is an uncommonly encountered presentation of skin and soft-tissue infections with high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis has been associated with colorectal carcinoma, hematologic malignancies, and diabetes. We report the case of an 81-year-old man who experienced a sudden onset of left ankle and foot pain in association with nonpalpable purpura and hemorrhagic bulla. The diagnosis was initially suspected based on the clinical presentation, gas in tissue on plain-film radiography, and Gram staining of aspirated bulla contents. Cultures grew Clostridium septicum, and a large cecum mass was found by computed tomography of the abdomen. A subsequent right hemicolectomy confirmed a well to moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. We emphasize that the early recognition of necrotizing skin and soft-tissue infections warrants further evaluation and appropriate management.

### Is there an association between serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels and syndrome severity in persistent complex regional pain syndrome [^114UQHtJ]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Biomarkers hold the potential to monitor syndrome severity in patients with CRPS and may thereby assist in the diagnosis and management of these patients. The T-cell activation marker sIL-2R is a biomarker with potential application in the management of CRPS by monitoring syndrome severity. Our research group hypothesized that there is an association between the level of serum sIL-2R and CRPS severity. In this cross-sectional study, the majority of patients (98%) had persistent CRPS. In this group of patients, no statistically significant correlation was found between the level of serum sIL-2R and the syndrome severity of CRPS. Therefore, serum sIL-2R levels cannot be used as a biomarker for syndrome severity in persistent CRPS. However, in line with diseases such as sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and IgG4-related disease, serum sIL-2R might be useful as a biomarker for T-cell mediated inflammatory disease activity.

Our research group found no significant correlation between the serum sIL-2R levels and the severity of CRPS. This might be explained by the fact that the majority of the included CRPS patients had persistent CRPS (98%). Therefore, conclusions on the association of serum sIL-2R levels and syndrome severity can only be made for persistent CRPS. However, our research group cannot rule out that serum sIL-2R levels do correlate with CRPS severity in early CRPS. In persistent CRPS, inflammation is often diminished, and this may explain the relatively low serum sIL-2R levels measured in this study.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 8
Epidemiology, diagnosis and optimal management of gout.

Second is the challenge of correctly diagnosing gout. Gout manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis in the early years/phase of the disease and as chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in the later years. Tophi and renal stones may accompany arthritis. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis of gout are low. Given the common involvement of great toe and other lower extremity joints in two other common conditions, osteoarthritis and pseudogout, a presumptive diagnosis of gout based on a history of big toe pain and a borderline high or higher than normal range serum urate level is problematic (Figure 8). Documentation of additional clinical features of acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margin and punched-out erosions typical of gout, and close attention to looking for features of other differential diagnoses (osteoarthritis, pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis), will often help in a correct diagnosis of gout. The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for classification of acute gouty arthritis are also commonly used for a clinical diagnosis of gout, but are inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. Attempts should always be made to aspirate joint/bursa/tophus and confirm the diagnosis, since documentation of urate crystals in synovial fluid confirms gout as a single test and the treatment for gout is often life-long.

### The immersion foot syndrome [^1164CKBb]. Wilderness & environmental medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Prolonged exposure of the extremities to cold, insufficient to cause tissue freezing, produces a well-defined syndrome. 'Immersion foot' is one of the descriptive but inaccurate terms applied to this syndrome. The clinical features, aetiology, pathology, prevention, and treatment of immersion foot are considered in detail, along with a discussion on pathogenesis.

- **Stages of immersion foot**: In the natural history of a typical case of immersion foot, there are four stages: the period of exposure and the pre-hyperaemic, hyperaemic, and post-hyperaemic stages.

During exposure and immediately after rescue, the feet are cold, numb, swollen, and pulseless. Intense vasoconstriction, sufficient to arrest blood flow, is believed to be the predominant factor during this phase.

- **Period of intense hyperaemia**: This is followed by a period of intense hyperaemia, increased swelling, and severe pain. Hyperaemia is due to the release in chilled and ischaemic tissues of relatively stable vasodilator metabolites. Pain may result from relative anoxia of sensory nerve endings.

- **Subside of symptoms**: Within 7–10 days of rescue, the intense hyperaemia and swelling subside, and pain diminishes in intensity. A lesser degree of hyperaemia may persist for several weeks. Objective disturbances of sensation and sweating, along with muscular atrophy and paralysis, now become apparent. These findings are correlated with damage to the peripheral nerves.

After several weeks, the feet become cold-sensitive; when exposed to low temperatures, they cool abnormally and may remain cold for several hours. Hyperhidrosis frequently accompanies this cold sensitivity. The factors responsible for these symptoms are correlated with peripheral nerve damage.

### Gout in extremis: Massive soft tissue tophaceous deposits [^111LXSUp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old Latino man with poorly controlled gout presented with severe, diffuse, bilateral hand pain and increasing drainage of white material from his hands. Physical examination revealed disfigured hands and feet with many tophi and areas of open skin draining a thick, white material. Bilateral anterior shins showed gouty tophi as well. Laboratory studies revealed a uric acid level of 9.5 mg/dL.

- **Figure 1**: Tophaceous gout disfiguring the digits of the hand with tophi (arrows).

- **Figure 2**: Tophaceous gout involving the bilateral anterior shins.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis. The first phase of gout is characterized by intermittent acute attacks with asymptomatic periods in between. If the gouty attacks and hyperuricemia are not properly treated over many years, the second phase of the disease, chronic tophaceous gout, develops. This phase manifests as polyarticular attacks, deposition of tophi in soft tissues and joints, and gout symptoms between attacks. Tophaceous gout can form soft tissue calcifications anywhere in the musculoskeletal system, including within tendons and extremities. The diagnosis of tophaceous gout is usually made by visual recognition of characteristic tophi, but when the diagnosis is uncertain, synovial fluid or tophus aspiration, looking for negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals, can be performed. Plain radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging can identify structural changes related to this chronic inflammatory condition.

### Cellulitis: Diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in primary care settings. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases that can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis.

To confirm the correct diagnosis, consider history, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy. Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### Cellulitis: A review [^1114WZ9H]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Cellulitis is a disease that can be associated with various conditions and risk factors. These include recent surgery, venous leg ulcers, exposure to insect bites, increased blood neutrophil count, and chills. Additionally, there can be an increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP), diabetes mellitus, skin induration, positive blood bacterial culture, tinea pedis, skin injury, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), increased white blood cell (WBC) count, intertrigo, pain, and malaise.

Exposure to spider bites, lymphadenopathy, bites from animals or humans, liver cirrhosis, skin abscess, tachycardia, and skin erythema are also associated with cellulitis. Other factors include chronic venous insufficiency, hypotension, skin discharge, tenderness, warmth, impetigo, fever, skin edema, pressure ulcers, tachypnea, peripheral artery disease (PAD), injection drug use, lymphedema, peau d'orange, and immunocompromising conditions.

### Violaceous papules and nodules overlying bilateral dorsal hands [^111mdE8z]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is not associated with the diagnosis?

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus
B. Wegener granulomatosis
C. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
D. Fungal infection
E. Malignancy

- **Answer**:

	- A. Systemic lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. PNGD can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, a systemic autoimmune condition that has varying presentations, from a cutaneous lesion to renal failure. PNGD has been shown to be associated with autoimmune conditions such as lupus, likely because PNGD develops due to perivascular immune-complex deposition triggered by systemic inflammatory pathologies.

	- B. Wegener granulomatosis – Incorrect. PNGD can be associated with Wegener granulomatosis, a disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tracts, necrotizing small vessel vasculitis, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. The systemic inflammatory response can trigger the development of PNGD lesions.

	- C. RA – Incorrect. PNGD can be associated with RA, as RA is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune condition that can cause complex deposition necessary to initiate PNGD pathology.

	- D. Fungal infection – Correct. PNGD is not associated with fungal infections. Infections such as chronic hepatitis C and Lyme disease have been reported in association with PNGD; however, fungal infections specifically have not. Other infections that have been associated with PNGD include Streptococcus, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus.

	- E. Malignancy – Incorrect. PNGD has been associated with lymphoproliferative malignancies such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

### Kawasaki disease [^117X8v6a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Kawasaki disease can be associated with a wide range of symptoms, including jaundice, meningismus, and desquamation in the groin. Other symptoms may include peribronchial infiltrates, desquamation of the toes, anemia, hand erythema, facial nerve palsy, foot swelling, increased serum total bilirubin (TBIL), vomiting, and an erythema multiforme-like rash. Patients may fulfill the clinical criteria for Kawasaki disease and present with onychomadesis, cervical lymphadenopathy, interstitial infiltrates, pulmonary nodules, and tachycardia, alongside increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and a mitral regurgitation (MR) murmur.

Hand and foot swelling, urethritis, and abdominal pain are also common manifestations. Additionally, patients may experience Raynaud's phenomenon, increased serum aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, pericarditis, myocarditis, fever, hyponatremia, Beau's lines, and cardiogenic shock. Sensorineural hearing loss, diarrhea, finger gangrene, hepatomegaly, and foot erythema can also occur. The erythema of the perineal region, desquamation in the perineal region, arthralgia, and conjunctival injection are significant symptoms as well.

Patients often present with cracked lips, increased serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, a maculopapular rash, irritability, pharyngeal and lip erythema, increased urine white blood cells (WBCs), acute pancreatitis findings, toe gangrene, desquamation of fingers, and retropharyngeal edema. A flow murmur, decreased platelet count, anterior uveitis, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels may also be observed. Erythroderma, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anemia, and elevated serum WBC counts are noted, along with decreased serum albumin, strawberry tongue, and an aortic regurgitation murmur.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113G3CNF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID Symptom Study app recruited users through social media outreach, targeting individuals who could download the app themselves or by proxy. Upon sign-up, the app collected data on the following:

- **Demographics**: Gender, age, and ethnicity (Asian, Black, Chinese, Middle Eastern, mixed, or white)
- **Core health risk factors**: Height, weight, common disease status (such as cancer, diabetes, and heart, kidney, and lung disease)
- **Medications**: Use of medications like corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and blood pressure medications
- **Occupation**: Whether the user is a healthcare worker

From 7 May 2020, users were prompted to self-report if they had ever had a SARS-CoV-2 test, specifying the method (e.g. nose or throat swab, antibody testing) and the result (positive, negative, failed, or waiting). Users could provide daily updates on their health status and the presence of up to 14 COVID-19-related symptoms:

- **General symptoms**: Abdominal pain, chest pain, fatigue, fever, headache, anosmia, persistent cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, unusual muscle pains
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, skipped meals
- **Other symptoms**: Delirium, hoarse voice

From 29 April 2020, two cutaneous manifestations were also added:

- **Body rash**: Raised, red, itchy weals on the face or body, or sudden swelling of the face or lips
- **Acral rash**: Red/purple sores or blisters on the feet or toes

Distinguishing between a transient urticarial rash and a fixed erythematopapular or vesicular rash proved difficult, so the body rashes were grouped together, as per common practice.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111NsCXg]. The Lancet Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare pain disorder that typically occurs in a limb following trauma. The key features of this disorder include severe pain, along with sensory, autonomic, motor, and trophic abnormalities. Research over the past decade has provided new insights into CRPS epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

Early identification of individuals at high risk for CRPS is improving, with several risk factors established and additional ones identified in prospective studies during the past five years. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS has led to its classification as a chronic primary pain disorder, with updates to its subtypes. Procedures for diagnosis have also been clarified. Although effective treatment of CRPS remains challenging, evidence-based integrated management approaches offer new opportunities to enhance patient care. Further advances in the diagnosis and treatment of CRPS will require coordinated, international multicentre initiatives.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^112e8fP9]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To help avoid unrealistic expectations, patients should be informed that while there is no treatment proven to cure CRPS or reduce symptoms in all patients, the drugs provided during their treatment have been shown to help some patients. It is important to recognize that CRPS may be more than just a single unitary condition.

Early CRPS (up to 6–18 months duration) can respond differently to interventions than persistent CRPS. Importantly, patients diagnosed with early CRPS are likely to naturally improve, and drugs or nerve blocks that are effective for only a few months may bridge the time to natural recovery. Approximately 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, and an early cold limb may be a poor prognostic sign.

Understand that most patients will, over time, develop analgesic tolerance to available drugs, whereas side effects often continue. Available drugs are not thought to "cure" the condition. Monotherapy is best to minimize adverse effects, cost, and patient non-compliance, but rational polypharmacy is often needed, particularly to address the various CRPS symptoms and disease subtypes. This, of course, should comprise rational combinations of different classes of medications rather than multiple medications from the same class.

The choice of medications should include cost considerations and other patient needs. Drugs that simultaneously treat multiple symptoms are desirable. For example, tricyclic antidepressants are relatively effective in RCTs for relieving neuralgic pain and also effective for anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

### Serpiginous purpuric eruption of the leg [^114b8bDh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 68-year-old male presented with a rash on his right lower leg. The lesions had spread along the leg since onset 9 days prior, and the patient reported localized soreness and pruritus. He denied systemic symptoms, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, joint pain, and recent illness. Physical examination revealed a serpiginous, purpuric eruption on the anterior and posterior right thigh and lower leg. A 4mm punch biopsy from the right lower leg revealed a Th2 dominant process reflective of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Superficial and deep angiocentric and eccrinotropic lymphocytic infiltrate and tissue eosinophilia were noted. Degranulated eosinophils forming 'flame figures' were also identified, with accompanying mural edema and red blood cell extravasation.

Further evaluation revealed an elevated antistreptolysin O antibody, though the remainder of the work-up was unremarkable. Clinicohistopathologic correlation supported the diagnosis of Blaschkolinear purpuric Wells' Syndrome. This case highlights a unique presentation of a rare inflammatory dermatosis and serves as a reminder that, given Wells' Syndrome can be associated with underlying malignancy, an age-appropriate work-up, based on patient history and presentation, may be warranted.

### Indications for plain radiographs in uncomplicated lower extremity cellulitis [^112AQ958]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common cause for emergency department (ED) presentation and subsequent hospital admission. An underlying fracture, osteomyelitis, or foreign body is often considered in the clinical evaluation of these patients. Accordingly, plain radiographs (XRs) of the affected extremity are often ordered during the initial work-up. The utility of these imaging studies in the treatment of uncomplicated lower-extremity cellulitis, however, remains unclear. In an effort to treat this common problem more efficiently, we evaluated our imaging practices and results in a cohort of consecutive patients admitted to a large public city hospital for treatment of uncomplicated lower-extremity cellulitis.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study of 288 consecutive ED admissions for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis, of which 214 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Patient demographics, history, vitals, laboratory values, and test results were evaluated with univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.

- **Results**: XRs of the affected lower extremity were obtained in 158 patients (73.8%). Positive XR findings were present in 19 patients (12.0%) and positively correlated with a history of acute trauma to the extremity (P < .001) or the presence of a chronic wound (P < .01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a history of trauma (P < .001) or the presence of a chronic wound (P < .05) to be independent predictors of positive XR findings with relative risks of 6.24 and 2.98, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The establishment of efficient imaging practices in emergency settings can aid in the treatment of uncomplicated lower-extremity cellulitis.

- **Evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere**: Indications of MRSA at another site in the body.
- **Nasal colonization with MRSA**: Presence of MRSA bacteria in the nasal passages.
- **Injection drug use**: Patients who use injectable drugs.
- **Sepsis syndrome**: Presence of clinical symptoms that suggest a systemic inflammatory response.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116BE912]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome biomedically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features, and thus, critical treatment targets. The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment.

To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known. Evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly, due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis. Moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition?

The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined here as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, and specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable, but more accessible, is multidisciplinary treatment, where a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties.

### Mechanism-based treatment in complex regional pain syndromes [^112dKriF]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) are multifactorial disorders with a complex etiology and pathogenesis. Management of CRPS is challenging due to a lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of various therapies and because successful treatment requires a multidisciplinary, patient-tailored approach. The pain in CRPS is often described as typical 'burning' neuropathic pain and is accompanied by a variety of sensory, motor, and autonomic signs and symptoms.

Research into therapies specifically for CRPS has been scarce. Treatment for these syndromes has largely been based on therapeutic strategies adapted from neuropathic pain states. However, increased understanding of CRPS pathogenesis has provided the opportunity to develop mechanism-based treatments. The interactions between the multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development, progression, and maintenance of CRPS remain poorly understood.

This review describes the challenges in linking theories and knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms to the mode of action of different treatment approaches. We discuss the treatment strategies for CRPS, including pharmacotherapy, sympathetic ganglion block interventions, psychological support, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy, and establish the concept of mechanism-based treatment for CRPS.

### Cellulitis: A review of current practice guidelines and differentiation from pseudocellulitis [^112hv8YA]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Cellulitis, an infection involving the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, is the most common reason for skin-related hospitalization and is encountered by clinicians across various disciplines in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room settings. However, it can present as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of present illness and physical examination, lacking a gold standard for diagnosis. The typical clinical presentation includes acute onset of redness, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and pain.

Despite this, diagnosing cellulitis can be challenging due to numerous infectious and non-infectious clinical mimickers such as venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, lymphedema, and erythema migrans. Microbiological diagnosis is often unattainable due to the poor sensitivity of culture specimens.

The majority of non-purulent, uncomplicated cases of cellulitis are caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Appropriate targeted coverage of these pathogens with oral antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin is typically sufficient. Even with rising rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coverage for non-purulent cellulitis is generally not recommended.

### Fever with persistent flagellate erythema in a primigravida: a rare presentation of adult-onset Still's disease [^114sjaG2]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a 25-year-old primigravida who presented to the emergency department with fever, arthralgia, and an erythematous maculopapular eruption. There was confluent violaceous macular erythema on the arms, the v-area of the neck, and the upper back, along with periorbital edema, mimicking dermatomyositis. Flagellate erythema was observed on the back. Skin biopsy and systemic investigations helped to rule out dermatomyositis. A final diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease with atypical cutaneous manifestations was made. This atypical variant is associated with a worse prognosis. Early recognition of this clinical variant can be life-saving for the patient.
