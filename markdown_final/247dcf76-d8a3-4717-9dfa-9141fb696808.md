## Question

Acute tendinitis management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute tendinitis management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying definitions and distinguishing true inflammatory tendinitis from tendinopathy. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and when imaging is warranted. Next, I will review first-line conservative management, including load management, analgesia, and early rehabilitation. After that, I need to examine adjunctive therapies and their evidence strength. Then, I should consider special scenarios like calcific tendinitis and partial tendon tears. Finally, I will outline escalation pathways, surgical indications, and a practical timeline, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and correcting any overstatements I might make along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because precision matters here; most patients labeled with "tendinitis" actually have tendinopathy, a degenerative failed-healing process rather than primary inflammation, though acute inflammatory flares can occur, so I should not overgeneralize and must tailor treatment to the underlying pathology and stage of disease [^114V2WZX] [^113xbNgB] [^114iSLWe].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next; diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history of load-related pain, focal tenderness, and pain reproduced with tendon loading, and I should avoid unnecessary imaging early on unless the diagnosis is uncertain or I need to exclude alternative pathology, in which case ultrasound can be a useful point-of-care adjunct and MRI reserved for refractory or complex cases [^114V2WZX] [^112Z1gDt] [^116h2epe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about acute management; I initially thought to apply PRICE universally, but wait, let me verify whether MEAT might be better for isolated tendon injuries once fracture is excluded, as emerging evidence suggests early protected movement and exercise can expedite functional recovery compared with strict immobilization, so I should individualize between PRICE and MEAT based on injury pattern and confidence in excluding fracture [^114DJefW].

> Next, I should review load management and activity modification; relative rest means reducing aggravating loads while maintaining pain-free cross-training to preserve conditioning, and I need to ensure the patient understands that complete rest can be counterproductive for tendon homeostasis, so I will set a plan to progressively reload as pain settles [^114V2WZX] [^113xbNgB].

> I will now examine pharmacologic pain control; topical NSAIDs are my first-line choice for acute musculoskeletal pain because they improve pain and function with minimal systemic adverse effects, while oral NSAIDs are reasonable second-line options when topical therapy is insufficient, and I should confirm dosing such as naproxen sodium 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg every 6–8 hours, not exceeding 1,375 mg on day one and 1,100 mg thereafter, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^1167Ku9z] [^111zwG6x].

> Let me consider acetaminophen as an alternative or adjunct; guidelines support acetaminophen as a first-line analgesic for mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain, particularly when NSAIDs are contraindicated, though I should set expectations that it may not improve function as much as topical NSAIDs in acute soft-tissue pain [^117HaVKh] [^1167Ku9z].

> I should double-check the role of corticosteroids; locally injected corticosteroids can provide short-term pain relief in some tendinopathies, but I must avoid injecting major load-bearing tendons like the Achilles due to rupture risk and should not use corticosteroids as initial therapy for rotator cuff tendinopathy, reserving injections for carefully selected refractory cases after shared decision-making [^114V2WZX] [^11136hMc].

> Next, I should review early rehabilitation; I need to ensure an active, progressive loading program starts once pain allows, emphasizing isometrics initially for analgesia and then advancing to eccentric or heavy-slow resistance based on tolerance and tendon location, while reminding myself that isometrics are not necessarily superior to cryotherapy in acute rotator cuff tendinopathy and that concentric versus eccentric loading may yield similar outcomes across tendons, so I should individualize based on irritability and functional goals [^115URABz] [^114euA2P] [^115NATuD] [^113nta4u].

> Let me verify adjunctive modalities; cryotherapy can reduce pain and facilitate participation in loading programs, extracorporeal shockwave therapy has supportive evidence in some lower-extremity tendinopathies and can be considered after 3 months of failed conservative care, and platelet-rich plasma shows mixed results and should not be first-line, though it may help selected refractory cases, so I should align these options with patient preferences and evidence strength [^114V2WZX] [^114VoknL] [^116RGBwr].

> But wait, what if this is calcific tendinitis; I should confirm that most calcific tendinopathies are self-limited and respond to conservative care, with calcific lavage or needling reserved for persistent symptoms, and I must remember rare sites like the longus colli where CT findings of calcification with prevertebral edema distinguish a benign, self-limited process from retropharyngeal abscess, enabling nonoperative management with NSAIDs and sometimes short-course corticosteroids [^117PjgbK] [^112WtkSN] [^115WW1Zs] [^11288wk4].

> I need to ensure I address partial tendon tears; for acute partial Achilles ruptures, nonoperative management with brief immobilization followed by early protected weight bearing and rehabilitation is appropriate, and I should counsel that most patients improve without surgery if managed correctly, aligning with consensus statements and contemporary functional protocols [^111r7g7H] [^1122fkLP].

> Next, I should review escalation and surgical thresholds; if there is no meaningful improvement after about 3 to 6 months of high-quality conservative care, I should reassess the diagnosis, consider imaging, and discuss surgical options, recognizing that surgery rates after failed conservative care vary by tendon and cohort, and that surgical referral is also indicated for full-thickness tears, persistent instability, or high-demand athletes with refractory symptoms [^111PxWkS] [^112g3ddJ].

> Let me reconsider the overall timeline to ensure it is realistic; in the acute phase over 0 to 2 weeks I prioritize protection, analgesia, and early isometrics, from 2 to 6 weeks I progress to eccentric or heavy-slow loading with gradual return to functional tasks, by 3 months I expect most patients to have substantial improvement, and by 6 months I should confirm resolution or escalate care if limitations persist, adjusting expectations to tendon-specific recovery trajectories [^111PxWkS] [^113nta4u].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with evidence strength and patient values; exercise-based rehabilitation remains the cornerstone with the most consistent support, topical NSAIDs are preferred over oral agents for acute pain, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly and not as initial therapy, and shared decision-making is essential when considering PRP or surgery, with explicit documentation of rationale if I deviate from guideline-concordant care [^112Dz7Gm] [^1167Ku9z] [^11136hMc] [^115WqxY7].

---

Acute tendinitis management centers on **relative rest** and **early progressive loading** to restore tendon function while avoiding aggravation [^114DJefW]. NSAIDs provide short-term pain relief [^1167Ku9z] but are not first-line for long-term healing; **eccentric strengthening** is the cornerstone of rehabilitation [^1171Lr2p]. Imaging is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or failure of conservative care [^1171Lr2p]. Most cases resolve within 6–12 weeks [^notfound]; surgery is rare and reserved for refractory cases or rupture [^1171Lr2p].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **History and physical examination**: Localized pain, tenderness, and pain with tendon loading are typical [^1171Lr2p]; assess for redness, swelling, and crepitus [^1171Lr2p].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI if diagnosis is unclear or to exclude rupture [^112Z1gDt]; plain radiographs are rarely indicated [^notfound].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Include partial tears, bursitis, infection, and referred pain [^112PVkqZ].

---

## Conservative management

### Relative rest and activity modification

Relative rest avoids aggravating activities while maintaining **general activity** to preserve function and prevent deconditioning [^114V2WZX]. Load management uses a **progressive loading** program tailored to pain and function, avoiding complete rest or aggressive early loading [^112Dz7Gm].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

- **NSAIDs**: Short-term use for pain relief; limited evidence for long-term benefit [^1167Ku9z] [^116W956i].

- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or NSAID intolerance [^117HaVKh].

- **Corticosteroid injections**: Short-term relief only; avoid in weight-bearing tendons due to rupture risk [^114V2WZX] [^116RGBwr].

---

### Physical therapy and rehabilitation

- **Eccentric strengthening**: Cornerstone for Achilles, patellar, and rotator cuff tendinopathies [^1171Lr2p] [^116RGBwr].

- **Isometric exercises**: Useful early for pain control and maintaining load without aggravation [^113xbNgB].

- **Progressive loading**: Gradual increase in load to restore tendon capacity and function [^113xbNgB].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options include **extracorporeal shockwave therapy** for refractory cases, particularly in Achilles and patellar tendinopathy [^116z4W8Z], and **platelet-rich plasma (PRP)**, which has mixed evidence and is not first-line [^114VoknL] [^114rJUKJ].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** that persist beyond 3–6 months despite conservative care or for **tendon rupture**, where repair is indicated for complete tears or significant partial tears [^114Nxov4] [^112PVkqZ].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most patients recover within **6–12 weeks** with conservative care, though recurrence is common without ongoing load management and maintenance exercises [^111PxWkS] [^113xbNgB].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Education should cover the condition, load management, and the importance of adherence to **rehabilitation** [^115URABz]. Prevention focuses on **gradual load progression**, adequate warm-up, and addressing biomechanical risk factors [^notfound].

---

Acute tendinitis is best managed with **relative rest**, **early progressive loading**, and targeted rehabilitation; most cases resolve within weeks, and surgery is reserved for refractory or ruptured tendons.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^111PxWkS]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — prognosis and management indicates that the long-term prognosis for acute-to-subchronic cases is favorable with nonoperative treatment, with significant decreases in pain and improved function after 6 to 12 weeks of intervention, and long-term follow-up ranging between 2 and 8 years suggesting that between 71% to 100% of patients can return to prior activity levels with minimal or no complaints. Conservative therapy is initially recommended, and when conservative treatment fails, surgery is recommended to remove fibrotic adhesions and degenerative nodules to restore vascularity. In an 8-year follow-up study, 29% of those with acute to subacute Achilles tendinopathy required surgical intervention, and retrospective studies report surgical rates for those failing conservative treatment ranging from 24% to 49%. Those who responded to nonoperative therapy tended to be younger (average age, 33 years) than those requiring surgery (average age, 48 years), and Four to 6 months of conservative intervention is recommended for those with Achilles tendinopathy.

### What is the best evidence to guide management of acute achilles tendon ruptures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113emCKZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery?

Methods

This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35 ± 16, mean age was 41 ± 5 years, mean sex composition was 80% ± 10% males, and mean follow-up was 22 ± 12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar.

Results

We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes.

Conclusion

Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.

### An algorithmic approach to the management of shoulder instability [^111WTFaX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Evaluation

A full history and physical examination are essential components in the evaluation of a shoulder dislocation. With the former, it is important to gather how the injury occurred, how the shoulder was reduced, how many times the shoulder has dislocated in the past, the patient's goals, and the patient's age at first dislocation. Understanding this information sets the stage for the remainder of the clinical, radiographic, and surgical course of the patient. Provencher et allisted the following characteristics as risk factors for glenoid bone loss: high-energy mechanism of injury, arm abduction and extension at the time of initial dislocation, most instability occurring at midrange of motion (20° to 60° of abduction), instability during normal activities of daily living, and a long history of instability. In addition, care should be taken to rule out other shoulder pathology, such as fracture, rotator cuff tendinopathy, glenohumeral arthritis, and biceps tendinitis, particularly in patients older than 40 years. Finally, it is important to consider the timing of a physical examination relative to the time of injury. An examination in the acute setting can be confused by global pain and inflammation, and thus, allowing a patient to recover for a few days before examination may enhance its accuracy.

### Tendon injury and tendinopathy: healing and repair [^117B2L4K]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2005). Low credibility.

Tendon disorders are frequent and are responsible for substantial morbidity both in sports and in the workplace. Tendinopathy, as opposed to tendinitis or tendinosis, is the best generic descriptive term for the clinical conditions in and around tendons arising from overuse. Tendinopathy is a difficult problem requiring lengthy management, and patients often respond poorly to treatment. Preexisting degeneration has been implicated as a risk factor for acute tendon rupture. Several physical modalities have been developed to treat tendinopathy. There is limited and mixed high-level evidence to support the, albeit common, clinical use of these modalities. Further research and scientific evaluation are required before biological solutions become realistic options.

### The ESSKA-AFAS international consensus statement on peroneal tendon pathologies [^112g3ddJ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

What conservative therapies may be considered and in case of which pathology?

4.1 Conservative management should be considered in all patients with a peroneal tendon pathology.
4.2 In the acute situation, conservative treatment should concentrate on additional pathology such as a lateral ligament rupture. Treatment includes ice, compression, and elevation. Range of motion and exercises should be started when clinically relevant.
4.3 Shockwave therapy should be considered when initial measures fail.
4.4 The use of platelet-rich plasma is not supported by the literature to approve its use. Figure 2 presents a schematic algorithm on conservative treatment of acute peroneal tendon pathologies.

Fig. 2
Conservative treatment

Rationale

There is broad agreement among the panel and in the literature that under the vast majority of circumstances, conservative management of acute peroneal tendon pathology is treatment of choice. Nonetheless, there is limited and varied evidence on the outcomes of conservative treatment in acute peroneal tendinopathy. Initial treatment is directed towards additional pathology and consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation. When painless, the patient may start weight bearing followed by range of motion and tendon-loading exercises. The panel agreed that immobilization should be avoided.

When symptoms persist beyond three months, there is some suggestion for the use of shockwave therapy in tendinopathy of the lower extremity. The panel supported this application under those circumstances. With regard to the use of platelet-rich plasma, the panel agreed that at this time, there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the treatment of peroneal tendinopathy.

### Interventions for treating acute and chronic achilles tendinitis [^116W956i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendinitis is one of the most common of all sports injuries. There is no consensus on treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of various treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (December 2000), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2000), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2001 wk 04), CINAHL (1982 to December 2000), and reference lists of identified trials were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of treatment interventions for acute and chronic Achilles tendinitis in adults. Studies focusing on pathological tendinitis were excluded. Excluded were those trials that compared different dosages of the same drug or drugs within the same class of drugs, for example different non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers independently assessed trial quality, by use of a ten item check list, and extracted data. Requests were sent for separate data for Achilles tendinitis patients in studies within trials of mixed patient populations. Where possible, quantitative analysis and limited pooling of data were undertaken.

Main Results

Nine trials, involving 697 patients, met the inclusion criteria of the review. Methodological quality was adequate in most of the trials with regards to blinding but the assessment of outcome was incomplete and short-term. There was weak but not robust evidence from three trials of a modest benefit of NSAIDs for the alleviation of acute symptoms. There was some weak evidence of no difference compared with no treatment of low dose heparin, heel pads, topical laser therapy and peritendonous steroid injection, but this could not be fully evaluated from the reports of four trials. The results of an experimental preparation of a calf-derived deproteinized haemodialysate, Actovegin, were promising but the severity of patient symptoms was questionable in the single small trial testing this comparison. The results of a comparison of glycosaminoglycan sulfate with a NSAID were inconclusive.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine which method of treatment is the most appropriate for the treatment of acute or chronic Achilles tendinitis. Further research is warranted.

### Acute calcific tendinitis of the index finger in a child [^112AJzLV]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Calcific tendinitis is characterized by calcium hydroxyapatite crystal deposition within tendons and is a common cause of musculoskeletal pain in adults. Its clinical manifestations may be acute, chronic, or asymptomatic. Acute calcific tendinitis is self-resolving condition that is rarely reported in the pediatric population and may be overlooked for more common processes, leading to unnecessary treatment.

Methods

A chart reivew was performed of a single case of acute calcific tendonitis of the index finger in a child.

Results

We describe a case of calcific tendinitis of the index finger in a 9-year-old boy who was referred to us for a second opinion after surgical exploration of an acutely inflamed digit was recommended based on his initial presentation. The calcifications and symptoms resolved over time without operative management.

Conclusions

Although rare in children, acute calcific tendinitis can present similar to an infection. However, appropriate managment is non-operative as the symptoms and radiographic findings resolve over time.

### ACFAS clinical consensus statement: acute achilles tendon pathology [^112ZDPva]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). High credibility.

ACFAS Clinical Consensus Statement — acute Achilles tendon rupture timing and care specifies that surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture should occur within 10 days of the injury, that advanced imaging should be obtained for suspected Achilles tendon rupture, and that early weightbearing and progressive physical therapy should be used after repair or at initiation of nonoperative management.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^115WqxY7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Statement of intent — this guideline is not intended to be a standard of clinical care and parameters should be considered guidelines only; ultimate judgment must be based on the patient's data, available options, and the patient's values, expectations, and preferences, and we suggest the rationale for significant departures from accepted guidelines be documented in the patient's medical records at the time the relevant clinical decision is made.

### Management of chronic tendon injuries [^114V2WZX]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic tendon injuries are common athletic and occupational injuries that account for many physician visits. Tendons have a complex biology that provides a unique combination of strength, flexibility, and elasticity but also predisposes them to injury. The term tendinopathy is preferred to tendinitis because of the presence of a disordered and degenerative healing process-not inflammation-in the pathologic tendon. Insidious onset of pain and dysfunction is a common presentation for most tendinopathies, and patients typically report that a change in activity affected the use of the tendon. Diagnosis is typically based on history and physical examination findings, but radiography is an acceptable initial imaging modality. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging may be useful when the diagnosis is unclear. The mainstays of treatment are activity modification, relative rest, pain control, and protection. Early initiation of rehabilitative exercises that emphasize eccentric loading is also beneficial. Despite a lack of high-quality evidence, cryotherapy has a role in controlling pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs and corticosteroids have a role in treatment despite the lack of histologic evidence of inflammation. Short-term use of these drugs reduces pain and increases range of motion, which can assist patients in completing rehabilitative exercises. Care should be taken when injecting corticosteroids into and near major load-bearing tendons because of the risk of rupture. Topical nitroglycerin, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and platelet-rich plasma injections have varying levels of evidence in certain tendinopathies and are additional nonsurgical treatment options.

### Acute achilles tendon ruptures: an update on current management strategies [^1164w7NL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute rupture of the Achilles tendon is a frequently encountered injury that occurs most commonly in people who participate in recreational athletics into their thirties and forties. For many years, the injury has been treated either nonsurgically or surgically using a standard open approach. More recently, a variety of new surgical techniques have emerged in the literature aiming to improve surgical outcomes while decreasing the potential complications associated with standard open repair. Nonsurgical treatment plans using early weight bearing and accelerated functional rehabilitation have also proven to be excellent management options. Achilles rupture treatment plans can include the use of orthobiologics, such as platelet-rich plasma, with mixed results. Accelerated functional rehabilitation protocols have shown to improve patient outcomes, whether used in conjunction with surgery or nonsurgical management modalities, and reduce the disparity between the injured tendon and the native Achilles.

### The heel complex: anatomy, imaging, pathologic conditions, and treatment [^112PVkqZ]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad but primarily involves abnormalities of the Achilles tendon, calcaneus, and plantar fascia. Achilles tendon disorders include tendinosis, tendinitis, and partial or complete tears. Tendinosis refers to tendon degeneration, while tendinitis is inflammation after acute overload. Untreated tendinosis can progress to partial or complete tears. Tendon disorders can be accompanied by paratenonitis or inflammation of the loose sheath enclosing the tendon. Initial management involves rehabilitation and image-guided procedures. Operative management is reserved for tendon tears and includes direct repair, tendon transfer, and graft reconstruction. The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. The majority of fractures are intra-articular; extra-articular fractures, stress or insufficiency fractures, medial process avulsion, and neuropathic avulsion can also occur. Posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis or Haglund deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and insertional Achilles tendinosis form the characteristic triad of Haglund syndrome. It is initially managed with orthotics and physiotherapy. Operative management aims to correct osseous or soft-tissue derangements. The plantar fascia is a strong fibrous tissue that invests the sole of the foot and contributes to midfoot stability. Inflammation or plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and can be related to overuse or mechanical causes. Acute rupture is less common but can occur in preexisting plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatment includes footwear modification, calf stretches, and percutaneous procedures. The main operative treatment is plantar fasciotomy. Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation within the fascia that can be locally aggressive and is prone to recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of various shoulder disorders [^111gH1tX]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) covering the management of common shoulder disorders.

Data Sources

A systematic search of CPGs on specific shoulder disorders was conducted up to August 2022 in relevant databases.

Study Selection

Twenty-six CPGs on rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, RC tear, calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, glenohumeral (GH) instability, GH osteoarthritis, or acromioclavicular disorders published from January 2008 onward were screened and included.

Data Extraction

CPGs methodological quality was assessed with the AGREE II checklist. All recommendations from CPGs were extracted and categorized by shoulder disorder and care components (evaluation, diagnostic imaging, medical, rehabilitation, and surgical treatments). After semantic analysis of the terminology, recommendations for each shoulder disorders were classified by 2 reviewers into "recommended", "may be recommended", or "not recommended". Disagreements were resolved by discussion until reviewers reached consensus.

Data Synthesis

Only 12 CPGs (46%) were of high quality with major limitations related to the applicability and editorial independence of the guidelines. The initial evaluation of shoulder pain should include patient's history, subjective evaluation focused on red flags, and clinical examination. Magnetic resonance imaging is usually not recommended to manage early shoulder pain, and recommendations for X-rays are conflicting. Acetaminophen, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and rehabilitation including exercises were recommended or may be recommended to treat all shoulder pain disorders. Guidelines on surgical management recommendations differed; for example, 6 CPGs reported that acromioplasty was recommended or may be recommended in chronic RC tendinopathy, whereas 4 CPGs did not recommend it.

Conclusions

Recommendations vary for diagnostic imaging, conservative vs surgical treatment to manage shoulder pain, although several care components are consensual. The development of evidence-based, rigorous CPGs with a valid methodology and transparent reporting is warranted to improve overall shoulder pain care.

### A treatment algorithm for managing achilles tendinopathy: new treatment options [^114Nxov4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy affects athletes, recreational exercisers and even inactive people. The pathology is not inflammatory; it is a failed healing response. The source of pain in tendinopathy could be related to the neurovascular ingrowth seen in the tendon's response to injury. The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative with an array of effective treatment options now available to the primary care practitioner. If conservative treatment is not successful, then surgery relieves pain in the majority of cases. Directing a patient through the algorithm presented here will maximise positive treatment outcomes.

### Acute prevertebral calcific tendinitis [^117NKurU]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

We present a case of neck pain in a middle-aged woman, initially attributed to a retropharyngeal infection and treated with urgent intubation. With the help of computed tomography, the diagnosis was later revised to acute prevertebral calcific tendinitis, a self-limiting condition caused by abnormal calcium hydroxyapatite deposition in the longus colli muscles. It is critical to differentiate between these two disease entities due to dramatic differences in management. A discussion of acute prevertebral calcific tendinitis and its imaging findings is provided below.

### ACFAS clinical consensus statement: acute achilles tendon pathology [^111r7g7H]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). High credibility.

ACFAS — Statement 3 (acute partial Achilles tendon ruptures) states "Acute partial Achilles tendon ruptures should be treated nonoperatively", and "The panel came to a consensus that this statement is appropriate". Supporting details include that "the authors recommended that acute partial Achilles tendon ruptures be treated with casting for 2 to 3 weeks" and that in subsequent studies of Achilles tendon ruptures, "partial tears are excluded and all treated nonoperatively".

### Guidelines and pathways for clinical practice in tendinopathy: their role and development [^111eMBUF]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Tendinopathy has significant consequences for both the athletic population and, more importantly, those who exercise for health or engage in physical activity as part of their occupation. That we are now able to perform high-quality evidence syntheses based on robust primary evidence for a wide range of conditions and therapeutic approaches is a credit to the pioneers who have driven the evidence explosion, and an inspiration for those striving to emulate and build on their achievements. How do we take that evidence and apply it in the clinical setting to individual patients? How do we adjust our decision-making schema in response to the presented information and challenges?

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^114dsBcJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The ever-expanding arsenal of treatment regimes for tendinopathy can be overwhelming to the treating healthcare professional. New treatments continuously emerge and so do research studies that aim to assess their effectiveness. The most powerful tool that evidence-based medicine has to offer remains systematic reviews (SRs) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which constitute the highest level of evidence and are therefore often used to inform guidelines and guide clinical practice.

Unlike a narrative review, which is purely a summary of a proportion of (or all) the available studies on a given topic without assessing the quality of the included evidence, an SR is expected to include all the relevant evidence which is comprehensively and thoroughly appraised and presented with qualitative or quantitative syntheses and accompanying strengths of evidence. For reliable, clinically relevant conclusions to be reached, the potential limitations of the included studies need to be considered. What determines the 'quality' of a study remains poorly defined but should relate to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis and presentation are appropriate to answer its research question. Generally, study quality assessment includes a combined assessment of its internal validity (freedom from bias), external validity (generalisability/applicability) and precision (freedom from random error)(online supplemental figure 1). The Cochrane group, which produce some of the highest quality SRs, recommend emphasising the internal validity when assessing the quality of a study, reflected by the risk-of-bias assessment (RoB) tool they have produced. However, external validity and precision should not be overlooked.

Assessing the strength of evidence (also known as 'certainty', 'quality', 'level' or 'grade' of evidence) is closely interlinked with RoB assessment and is a process which is commonly overlooked by many SRs. Together with a meticulous methodology and comprehensive RoB assessment, this is what distinguishes a SR from other types of review articles. Assigning a strength of evidence to a finding is as important as the finding itself. Strength of evidence should accompany every assessed outcome measure within an SR for every assessed follow-up time period. A result with a low strength of evidence differs substantially from that with a high level of evidence in terms of its applicability to clinical practice; further research is likely to change the former but not the latter. Equally, the strength of evidence can be high in an outcome measure and low in another, and high for a certain follow-up but period and low for another.

### Implementation of a shoulder soft tissue injury triage service in a UK NHS teaching hospital improves time to surgery for acute rotator cuff tears [^111mTu6a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our new service resulted in surgical repair of traumatic rotator cuff tears 29 days faster than the traditional system with an extra 38% of patients having surgery within 90 days of injury – a benchmark thought to improve outcome. Our service design also allowed for spare capacity to be utilised for the management of patients with shoulder instability to alleviate some of the outpatient fracture clinic demand. Patients with other soft tissue pathology such as calcific tendinitis or acute frozen shoulder gained access to specialist conservative treatment. Additionally a number of missed fractures were identified early and managed appropriately. Future study will involve on-going monitoring of the service and evaluation of long term patient follow up of outcome measures after surgery to assess whether faster access to surgery does indeed result in better outcomes for our patients as the literature would suggest. It is hoped that a similar pathway model might be adopted by other NHS Trusts to improve access to specialist management of shoulder soft tissue injuries.

### Naproxen sodium [^111zwG6x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis

The recommended starting dose of naproxen sodium tablets is 550 mg followed by 550 mg every 12 hours or 275 mg (one half of a 550 mg tablet) every 6 to 8 hours as required. The initial total daily dose should not exceed 1,375 mg (two and one-half tablets) of naproxen sodium. Thereafter, the total daily dose should not exceed 1,100 mg of naproxen sodium. Because the sodium salt of naproxen is more rapidly absorbed, naproxen sodium tablets are recommended for the management of acute painful conditions when prompt onset of pain relief is desired.

2.5 Acute Gout

The recommended starting dose is 825 mg of naproxen sodium tablets followed by 275 mg every 8 hours.

2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen

Different dose strengths and formulations (e.g., tablets, suspension) of naproxen are not interchangeable. This difference should be taken into consideration when changing strengths or formulations.

### An unusual cause of fever, neck pain, and neck stiffness: acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscle [^115WW1Zs]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute calcific tendinitis (ACT) of the longus colli muscle (LCM) is an inflammatory response due to deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals. It is typically correlated with whiplash and overuse injuries. A common presentation of this inflammatory response is acute but progressive neck pain. It is a rare but important cause of neck pain that should be considered on a differential diagnosis when distinguishing between life-threatening conditions and non-life-threatening causes of neck pain.

Case Report

A 51-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) reporting a mild sore throat that progressed to acute neck pain and stiffness. She also reported fatigue, fever, myalgias, and nausea. In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, hypertensive, and mildly febrile with normal oxygen saturation. Examination revealed meningismus and was negative for lymphadenopathy, oropharyngeal findings, and neurologic deficits. Laboratory studies were significant for leukocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) neck was obtained and was notable for calcification of the superior left longus colli muscle with prevertebral and retropharyngeal space edema along the muscle body. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? ACT of the LCM is a benign, self-limited condition that can present with features overlapping emergent causes of acute neck pain. Correct diagnosis relies on characteristic radiographic findings on CT. Fortunately, patients may be discharged home with a short course of anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids with near-complete resolution of symptoms. Emergency physicians, therefore, can rule out life-threatening causes of neck pain, while also making a definitive diagnosis and initiating effective management for this pathology.

Future directions

Moving forward, several avenues of research are needed to finally gain consensus on the role of PRP in tendinopathy treatment. Future studies should aim to standardize PRP preparation protocols, including platelet concentration and leukocyte content, which will reduce variability and allow for more meaningful comparisons across studies. Additionally, research should focus on identifying specific patient populations or tendinopathy types most likely to benefit from PRP treatment. This could include examining the role of PRP concerning the chronicity of tendinopathy, as patients with chronic, degenerative tendinopathies may respond differently than those with acute or subacute lesions. Importantly, future research should focus on patients who have gone through first-line treatments without clinical improvement because they may represent the population that could benefit the most from PRP. Longer follow-up periods in future RCTs are also crucial to assess the sustained efficacy of PRP, as well as potential long-term side effects or complications. Also, improving the methodological quality of studies will help clarify the role of PRP by removing confounders. For instance, in our systematic review, 3 out of 9 studies had a high risk of bias.

Finally, given the increased focus on personalized medicine, future studies could explore the potential for tailoring PRP treatments based on individual patient characteristics, such as age, activity level, and the specific pathology of their tendinopathy. This personalized approach may help optimize outcomes and provide clearer guidance for clinicians regarding the appropriate use of PRP in clinical practice.

### Everything achilles: knowledge update and current concepts in management: AAOS exhibit selection [^114wKuZL]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon pathology is common and affects athletes and nonathletes alike. The cause is multifactorial and controversial, involving biological, anatomical, and mechanical factors. A variety of conditions characterized by Achilles tendon inflammation and/or degeneration can be clinically and histologically differentiated. These include insertional Achilles tendinopathy, retrocalcaneal bursitis, Achilles paratenonitis, Achilles tendinosis, and Achilles paratenonitis with tendinosis. The mainstay of treatment for all of these diagnoses is nonoperative. There is a large body of evidence addressing treatment of acute and chronic Achilles tendon ruptures; however, controversy remains.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute elbow and forearm pain [^117KmBAm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute elbow pain can be the result of traumatic and atraumatic processes. Pathologic processes include osseous, ligamentous, and tendinous etiologies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder [^117PjgbK]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcific tendinitis of the shoulder is a process involving calcium deposition commonly in the rotator cuff tendons. It is a cell-mediated process that is often chronic in nature, but it is usually self-limiting with regard to its acute pain states. Nonoperative management is still the treatment of choice and is successful in up to 90% of patients. When conservative measures fail, a needling technique or surgical removal may be indicated; the trend is toward arthroscopic management. Acromioplasty should not be performed without radiographic signs of impingement. If a resulting large rotator cuff defect is found after removal of the calcific deposit, it may be worthwhile to close the defect arthroscopically with suture to prevent cuff tear progression and to promote healing.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^112t6q7B]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Pooling of results

All SRs should include pooling of results to make conclusions about an overall treatment effect where clinical heterogeneity allows.

In the absence of significant clinical heterogeneity, results should be pooled quantitatively where there are two or more studies assessing the same interventions, ideally with pairwise meta-analyses that improve precision. In the context of tendinopathy interventions, unless the settings, participants and interventions are almost identical (clinical homogeneity), we suggest the use of a random-effects and not a fixed-effects model for meta-analyses. Alternatively, if the authors of the review believe that the included studies are largely homogenous clinically, the choice of the model should be made on the basis of statistical heterogeneity, which needs to be quantified with a statistical test (eg, fixed-effects for I² < 50%, random-effects for I² > 50%). Forest plots should be presented for each comparison with their accompanying MD/SMD (continuous outcomes) or OR/RR (dichotomous outcomes) and 95% CI, p value and heterogeneity test (eg, I² statistic). In the presence of significant statistical heterogeneity (eg, > 50%), attempts should be made through sensitivity analyses for a single study that may be responsible for the high heterogeneity to be identified and removed from the comparison before the analysis is rerun. No more than one study should be removed. Where the I² test is substantial (> 75%) despite sensitivity analyses, the meta-analysis should be abandoned.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^115PHERg]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Tendinopathy

Background: Tendinopathy is characterized by pain and dysfunction in a tendon, commonly due to excessive load or strain. In active patients and athletes, overuse can lead to chronicity. The most common tendinopathy in the knee is of the patellar tendon, is colloquially known as "jumper's knee" since it is commonly seen in jumping athletes, and can lead to microtears at the tendon insertion at the distal pole.
Diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis is based on history and physical exam. Patients with patellar tendinopathy present with anterior knee pain that is worse with activity, tenderness to palpation at the inferior pole of the patella. Other tendinopathies present with tenderness to palpation and pain at the tendon insertion site with activation of the muscle. Radiologic imaging will be normal. Ultrasound can assist in confirming diagnosis and will show loss of the normal fibrillar pattern, increased spacing between fibrillar lines, and generally reduced echogenicity.MRI will show increased signal at the tendon insertion.
Treatment: Pain secondary to tendinopathy is treated symptomatically in the acute phase – this includes NSAIDs and physical therapy with a progressive loading program. Additional adjuncts for pain control such as cryotherapy, peritendinous injection with corticosteroids or platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered if the pain fails to respond to NSAIDs and PT and/or the pain persists beyond the acute phase. Ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy, percutaneous needle scraping, and high volume injection, and stem cells are at the forefront of regenerative medicine for tendinopathy and are currently being evaluated. If non-invasive management fails, surgical intervention would be the next step.

### ACFAS clinical consensus statement: acute achilles tendon pathology [^116ZmaWW]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). High credibility.

ACFAS — Statement 4 (timing of surgical repair) reads "Surgical repair of the acute Achilles tendon rupture should occur within 10 days of the injury", but "The Panel came to a consensus that this statement was neither appropriate nor inappropriate". The text notes that clinical–surgical data suggest "there is no difference compared with delayed surgical treatment of acute Achilles tendon rupture", and that outcomes within a week "are comparable to those treated as far as ≥ 4 weeks", concluding that "it is difficult to formally determine the optimal time frame for surgical repair", and stating, "We recommend the treating physician take into account patient comorbidities, activity levels, and the surgeon's clinical experience and comfort level when determining optimal timing of surgical repair for each patient".

### Management of chronic tendon injuries [^116g6go7]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic tendon injuries present unique management challenges. The assumption that these injuries result from ongoing inflammation has caused physicians to rely on treatments demonstrated to be ineffective in the long term. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be limited in the treatment of these injuries. Corticosteroid injections should be considered for temporizing pain relief only for rotator cuff tendinopathy. For chronic Achilles tendinopathy (symptoms lasting longer than six weeks), an intense eccentric strengthening program of the gastrocnemius/ soleus complex improved pain and function between 60 and 90 percent in randomized trials. Evidence also supports eccentric exercise as a first-line option for chronic patellar tendon injuries. Other modalities such as prolotherapy, topical nitroglycerin, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, therapeutic ultrasound, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and low-level laser therapy have less evidence of effectiveness but are reasonable second-line alternatives to surgery for patients who have persistent pain despite appropriate rehabilitative exercise.

### Sulindac [^1127z7JH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of sulindac tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use sulindac tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

After observing the response to initial therapy with sulindac tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

Sulindac tablets should be administered orally twice a day with food. The maximum dosage is 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day are not recommended.

In osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, the recommended starting dosage is 150 mg twice a day. The dosage may be lowered or raised depending on the response.

A prompt response (within one week) can be expected in about one-half of patients with osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Others may require longer to respond.

In acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg twice a day. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the dosage may be reduced according to the response. In acute painful shoulder, therapy for 7–14 days is usually adequate. In acute gouty arthritis, therapy for 7 days is usually adequate.

Incidence between 3% and 9%. Those reactions occurring in 1% to 3% of patients are not marked with an asterisk.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^117XCLig]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In the present review, we have demonstrated that the majority of SRs of RCTs in tendinopathy do not assess the strength of evidence of their results and this can substantially influence their application to clinical practice. In the future, authors implicated in producing and publishing SRs on the management of tendinopathy should become familiar with strength of evidence assessment tools and apply them appropriately in their data synthesis and presentation. Finally, relevant guidance documents should emphasise the importance of strength of evidence assessment and provide more detailed instructions for its conduct to increase consistency and transparency.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^115sgMuJ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Certainty of evidence

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for NMAs to appraise the certainty of evidence. Evidence from each comparison was appraised for direct and indirect comparisons, and for the combined evidence, where applicable. Evidence could be of 'high certainty', 'moderate certainty', 'low certainty' or 'very low certainty'. All ratings started at the level of 'high certainty'. Two authors (ACV and MW) independently rated the evidence down on the basis of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Inconsistency in GRADE involves heterogeneity across trials and is not related to inconsistency in the network. We rated the overall body of evidence in the network to indicate the strength of the NMA recommendations.

2.4 Management of Pain, Primary Dysmenorrhea, and Acute Tendonitis and Bursitis

Naproxen delayed-release tablets are not recommended for initial treatment of acute pain because absorption of naproxen is delayed compared to other naproxen-containing products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

2.5 Acute Gout

Naproxen delayed-release tablets are not recommended because of the delay in absorption.

2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Naproxen

### Acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli: not all retropharyngeal fluid is an abscess [^11288wk4]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This report aimed to present a case of acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscle as an uncommon cause of neck pain and dysphagia and is often misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess.

Methods

Case report and literature review.

Results

Acute calcific tendinitis is often misdiagnosed as a retropharyngeal abscess; however, it is distinguished from the latter based on patient history and unique radiologic findings. History, examination, and laboratory findings do not suggest an infectious etiology, and radiographic findings include a non-rim-enhancing fluid collection with or without calcifications anterior to the upper cervical spine.

Conclusion

Unlike retropharyngeal abscess, acute calcific tendinitis is managed conservatively. When consulted for a possible retropharyngeal abscess, the otolaryngologist should avoid anchoring bias by independently obtaining a detailed history and examination and personally reviewing radiologic images to avoid unnecessary intervention.

### Tendons – time to revisit inflammation [^112hpRzM]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

It is currently widely accepted among clinicians that chronic tendinopathy is caused by a degenerative process devoid of inflammation. Current treatment strategies are focused on physical treatments, peritendinous or intratendinous injections of blood or blood products and interruption of painful stimuli. Results have been at best, moderately good and at worst a failure. The evidence for non-infammatory degenerative processes alone as the cause of tendinopathy is surprisingly weak. There is convincing evidence that the inflammatory response is a key component of chronic tendinopathy. Newer anti-inflammatory modalities may provide alternative potential opportunities in treating chronic tendinopathies and should be explored further.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^112Aw9xt]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

For qualitative reviews, where numerical values of treatment effects cannot be obtained and pooled quantitatively, pooling should be performed based on direction of effect for studies assessing the same interventions, even in the presence of some clinical heterogeneity, which should be recognised and accounted for in the strength of evidence assessment. The statistical significance test result reported by the authors of the RCT for intergroup differences should be accounted for when pooling results (ie, a statistically insignificant difference between the two groups will count as 'no difference'). A table with pooled results and accompanying strengths of evidence should be used to make the pooling clearer to the reader (eg, table 1).

Data should only be combined for similar, predefined follow-up time periods, that is, short term, mid term and long-term. These periods should ideally be subdivided especially when their range is large and when there are sufficient data for pooling. For instance, for a predefined 'short-term follow-up' at 0–12 weeks, this can be subdivided into early short term (eg, 2–6 weeks) and late short term (7–12 weeks).

Strength of evidence assessment

The two tools most frequently used in our included SRs (Cochrane Back Review Group and GRADE) differ substantially and we advocate the preferential use of one over the other in specific situations. Unlike the Cochrane Back Review Group tool, the intention of which is to allocate a 'level' (strength) of evidence to data pooled qualitatively, the GRADE tool is very comprehensive, it considers limitations across studies, not only within studies and is very transparent. The main difference of the two tools lies within the fact that the Cochrane Back Review Group tool relies on quality assessment of each study; the GRADE tool advocates assessing the quality of the body of the pooled evidence, not individual studies. The former is primarily based on direction of effect (ie, qualitative synthesis of results) and the latter on quantitative analyses.

### Achilles tendinopathy: some aspects of basic science and clinical management [^114RpHDC]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy is prevalent and potentially incapacitating in athletes involved in running sports. It is a degenerative, not an inflammatory, condition. Most patients respond to conservative measures if the condition is recognised early. Surgery usually involves removal of adhesions and degenerated areas and decompression of the tendon by tenotomy or measures that influence the local circulation.

### Effect of resistance exercise dose components for tendinopathy management: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111mZibu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was part of a project funded by the National Institute for Health Research (Health Technology Assessment 129388 Exercise therapy for the treatment of tendinopathies) and adhered to an a priori protocol (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020168187).

Inclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria and methods were influenced by the project aims, the results of an initial scoping reviewand two subsequent stakeholder workshops (n = 13). The first included nine individuals who delivered exercise therapy for tendinopathy and had an academic interest. The second included four women with lived experience. Finally, an online survey (n = 26) was conducted to gather the views of a more diverse international sample of purposefully selected clinicians and academics. A completed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis checklist for reporting of systematic reviews can be found in online supplemental file 1. The inclusion criteria were framed according to a modified PICOS (participant, intervention, comparator, outcomes, study type) approach which also included context.

Participants

This meta-analysis included people of any age or gender with a diagnosis of RCRSP, lateral elbow, patellar, Achilles or gluteal tendinopathy of any severity or duration. Due to difficulty in diagnosing the patho-anatomical cause of shoulder painthe term RCRSP is defined here as pain, impaired movement and function of the shoulder from one or more structures (encompassing subacromial pain/impingement syndrome (SIS), rotator cuff tendinopathy and subacromial bursitis). We included studies that described participants as having tendinopathy, SIS or RCRSP, thereby acknowledging that participants may have tendinopathy+/−involvement of other structures. Full thickness or large tears were excluded, for all tendinopathies. Trial authors' diagnoses were accepted where a clearly verifiable group of clinical features was reported including: pathognomonic location of pain; a symptom altering response to applied load and/or stretch, with there being a specific test for most tendinopathies; strategies to rule out differential diagnoses; ultrasound or MRI confirmation of structural change. Typically, a minimum of two clinical features were acceptable, however often more were reported. Data from studies with mixed groups were included where there was clear reporting of the tendinopathic group, or they comprised > 90% of the investigated cohort.

### What are small, medium and large effect sizes for exercise treatments of tendinopathy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nta4u]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition associated with degenerative changes and characterised by a combination of pain impaired movement and reduced function that typically requires extended periods for recovery. Tendinopathy can affect any muscle-tendon unit in the body, however, it is most frequently reported in the Achilles, patellar, lateral elbow, rotator cuff and hip tendons. Surveys of prevalence of lower extremity tendinopathy in the general population have reported rates of 11.8 and 10.5 per 1000 person-years, while prevalence for upper limb tendinopathies have been estimated between 1.3% and 21.0%. Costs to the individual, the health service and economy (due to absenteeism and loss of productivity) are substantial such that identifying effective interventions is a priority.

Exercise therapy is the mainstay of conservative management of tendinopathy and has focused largely on resistance training, and in many instances eccentric strengthening techniques. The rationale of exercise therapy is to improve load tolerance and possibly structural adaptation of the musculotendinous unit to restore function. In the early phase of rehabilitation, flexibility exercises are often initiated and incorporated into strengthening regimes to facilitate improvements in mobility. Effective exercise therapy may also require targeting a range of contributing factors, which not only include muscle weakness and decreased flexibility, but also corticospinal and neuromuscular adaptations resulting from persistent pain. As such, proprioceptive exercise interventions have been used to retrain normal patterns of muscle recruitment in the rehabilitation of shoulder-related tendinopathies including impingement. The time course of tendinopathy recovery is usually slow, the degree of recovery may be incomplete and there may be differences between tendinopathies and across outcome domains. For example, quality of life may improve less quickly for people with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared with those with Achilles tendinopathy, whereas recovery may be faster for pain and the relative magnitudes of these improvements may not be equivalent. Quantifying any tendinopathy or domain-specific differences in expected improvements would help guide efforts to develop consensus concerning optimal management by enabling better intervention comparisons.

### Revisiting the continuum model of tendon pathology: what is its merit in clinical practice and research? [^113xbNgB]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

How would the practitioner choose a treatment based on the continuum?

The continuum model suggested that management may be optimised by tailoring interventions to the stage of pathology and targeting the primary driver (cell activation) and inter-related alterations in matrix integrity. While exercise and load management are fundamental to management, a plethora of intratendinous and peritendinous interventions exist to 'treat' tendinopathy — this increases the complexity of the clinical decision-making process.

Tendinopathy is a heterogeneous clinical presentation due to the variable change in matrix structure, pain and dysfunction. Phenotyping of patients based on structure, pain, dysfunction and load capacity may allow the clinician to direct appropriate treatments at the critical limiting factors (figure 4).

Interventions targeting pain

Patients with tendinopathy present clinically primarily due to pain, with available interventions directed at the painful tendon including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid injections, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, extratendinous high volume injectionand surgical scraping. While the majority of these treatments reduce pain in the short to medium term, the longer term efficacy of some has been questioned. Addressing pain is critical; however, interventions directed solely at pain have a minimal effect on the associated kinetic chain deficits or tissue capacity and may result in the recurrence of pain (figure 4).

Interestingly, isometric quadriceps muscle contractions in patellar tendinopathy induce immediate analgesia and reduce cortical inhibition of the muscle, which in turn improves strength. Intervening with a loading programme also has the advantage of benefiting the tendon, the muscle, as well as the cortical control of that muscle, which may lead to improvements in function and a positive clinical outcome. An incremental load-based rehabilitation programme is capable of modifying the balance of excitability and inhibition in muscle control, thus altering the loads transmitted by the tendon.

### Tendons – time to revisit inflammation [^112GFEZE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Potential therapeutic agents in chronic and progressive tendinopathy

This paper has explored pathological mechanisms that are implicated in tendinopathy. By understanding better the pathology responsible for chronic progressive tendinopathy, this gives us the potential to rationally assess therapies that may be of benefit.

Chronic tendinopathy should be regarded as a process of degradation which appears to involve many aspects of the chronic injury–repair response, in common with other musculoskeletal rheumatological disorders. This degradation process, with characteristic features of neovessel formation, neoinnervation and synovitis, provides us with potential targets to modify the degradation process in a positive way.

This section of the paper describes the potential for 'anti-inflammatory' and other strategies to beneficially modulate both the chronic tendinopathy degradation and progressive tendinopathy process.

Anti-inflammatory strategies and chronic tendinopathy

Over the last 15 years the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids has become less fashionable and more controversial in the management of chronic tendinopathy. But what does the evidence tell us? If inflammatory mediators are part of ongoing tendinopathy we should expect anti-inflammatory strategies to be at least partially effective in reducing tendon pain.

Pooling of results

Item 3: The principal summary measures for each included outcome measure need to be stated in the methods. For quantitative analyses, where outcome measures are continuous, a justification needs to be provided for the use of (raw) mean differences (MD) and not standardised MD (SMD) and vice versa (ie, identical or different outcome measure tools used across studies, respectively). Similarly, for dichotomous outcomes, the authors should state in the methods whether OR or relative risks (RR) were used.

Item 4: An SR without a meta-analysis should ideally have some quantitative summary measures (ie, MD, SMD, OR or RR with accompanying CI) to demonstrate the treatment effect of the assessed intervention over the comparator. Where results are pooled only based on direction of effect (ie, increased, decreased or unchanged), this needs to be stated in the methods with a justification. If pooling is not possible and results are only described narratively, the reason should be stated (usually substantial clinical heterogeneity); in such cases, we question whether the article should be identified as an SR.

Item 5: When meta-analyses are performed, the model used needs to be stated (ie, fixed effects or random effects) with a justification and the statistical heterogeneity assessment (usually χ² and/or I² test) and how it was used in data syntheses. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses should also be pre-defined in the methods.

Items 6 and 7: Results should only be pooled for similar follow-up time periods which should be prespecified in the methods. Traditionally these are short term, mid term and long term. The range of these should be defined by the authors in the methods based on the population, outcome measures and interventions. Equally, assessed outcome measures should be predefined (usually as part of PICOS).

Item 8: A statement needs to be included in the section explaining how the authors dealt with missing data, which are usually methodological details of the included studies needed for the RoB assessment and descriptive statistics for quantitative analyses. For both, ideally attempts should be made to contact the authors of the RCTs for retrieval of the missing data and this should be stated. If significant statistical data of included studies cannot be retrieved (ie, sample sizes and means) these studies should be excluded from quantitative analyses; if variability statistics (SD) are missing, the authors have the option to impute these using data from other RCTs and the imputation method used should be described.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^116oVLdD]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tendinopathy clinical practice guideline — scope and definitions: The guideline targets adults with shoulder pain with suspected rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy and provides recommendations covering the assessment and prognosis, nonsurgical medical care and rehabilitation, and return to function and sport for elite and recreational athletes; it also addresses cases with RC tendinopathy with or without calcifications and partial-thickness RC tears. Background notes that RC disorders account for more than half of shoulder conditions, the RC comprises the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor, and the term RC calcific tendinopathy is used when a calcific deposit within the tendon is confirmed. The document highlights gaps in usual care, stating that initial diagnosis and treatment of RC disorders often do not follow evidence-based recommendations and that diagnoses of shoulder disorders commonly rely on the unnecessary use of diagnostic imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), driving additional costs, treatment delays, and potential overmedicalization.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^116h2epe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging is frequently used in patients with Achilles tendon complaints. X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans have prominent roles in imaging. In clinical practice, prognostic value is often attributed to the findings on imaging. On the other hand, imaging can have negative effects through radiation risks, misinterpretation by healthcare providers (leading to unnecessary additional imaging and interventions) and patients (leading to confusion, catastrophising, fear and avoidance of movement, and low expectations of recovery). It is important that the additional value and potential negative consequences of using imaging for healthcare providers and patients is clear.

Treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is initially non-surgical. If non-surgical treatment fails, surgical interventions may be considered. In current clinical practice, the use of treatment options is often variable and suboptimal. There are also no clear guidelines on load management during sports.

Achilles tendinopathy seems to have an unfavourable long-term prognosis. In clinical practice, it is desirable to be able to predict which patients recover and who will continue to experience chronic symptoms. Knowledge of prognostic factors is important to be able to do this. Finally, preventiing recurrent symptoms is important. A practical, step-by-step treatment strategy for Achilles tendinopathy is necessary based on existing guidelines and evidence. The complete guideline process is described in online supplemental file 'Guideline process'.

Aim of the guideline

The aim was to develop a multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline on the risk factors, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, prognosis and prevention of Achilles tendinopathy. The guideline provides guidance on how to manage the challenges for patients with Achilles tendinopathy in the primary and secondary healthcare settings.

A multidisciplinary working group was set up to develop this guideline. The working group consisted of representatives of relevant specialties involved in the care of Achilles tendinopathy. The online supplemental file 'Guideline process' shows the composition of the working group.

The conclusions in this guideline indicate the level of evidence. The recommendations are aimed at optimal care and are based on the results of both scientific research and the considerations of the working group, in which the patient perspective has an important role. Ultimately, this should lead to the overall aim, which is to reduce pain and improve the function and activity level in patients with Achilles tendinopathy by optimising care.

### Celecoxib effectively treats patients with acute shoulder tendinitis / bursitis [^1121qah5]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Shoulder tendinitis and subacromial bursitis are acute, painful inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions that may recur as a result of overuse. We investigated the efficacy of celecoxib in managing patients with acute shoulder tendinitis/bursitis.

Methods

In this double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, patients with acute onset shoulder tendinitis and/or subacromial bursitis were randomized to receive one of: celecoxib 400 mg followed by 200 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid, or placebo bid for 14 days. The primary measure of efficacy was the mean reduction in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest, measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale, from baseline to Days 7 and 14.

Results

Of the 306 patients randomized to treatment, 254 completed the study. On Day 7, the mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was significantly greater in the celecoxib group compared with the placebo group (-27.7 ± 2.75 mm vs -18.4 ± 2.63 mm, respectively; p < 0.05). Similarly, on Day 14, the mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was greater in the celecoxib group compared with placebo (-35.0 ± 3.06 mm vs -25.0 ± 3.05 mm; p < 0.05). The mean reduction from baseline in Maximum Pain Intensity at Rest was also greater in the naproxen group compared with the placebo group at Day 7 (-26.4 ± 2.70 mm vs -18.4 ± 2.63 mm; p < 0.05), but not on Day 14. Secondary measures of efficacy also showed treatment with celecoxib to be significantly better than placebo treatment and similar to treatment with naproxen. In addition, celecoxib was well tolerated in these patients.

Conclusion

Celecoxib showed comparable efficacy to naproxen in relieving the pain of patients with acute shoulder tendinitis and/or subacromial bursitis.

### Novel approaches for the management of tendinopathy [^116gPVgh]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2010). Low credibility.

Tendinopathy is a failed healing response of the tendon. Despite an abundance of therapeutic options, very few randomized prospective, placebo-controlled trials have been carried out to assist physicians in choosing the best evidence-based management. Eccentric exercises have been proposed to promote collagen fiber cross-link formation within the tendon, thereby facilitating tendon remodeling. Overall results suggest a trend for a positive effect of eccentric exercises, with no reported adverse effects. Combining eccentric training and shock wave therapy produces higher success rates compared with eccentric loading alone or shock wave therapy alone. The use of injectable substances such as platelet-rich plasma, autologous blood, polidocanol, corticosteroids, and aprotinin in and around tendons is popular, but there is minimal clinical evidence to support their use. The aim of operative treatment is to excise fibrotic adhesions, remove areas of failed healing, and make multiple longitudinal incisions in the tendon to detect intratendinous lesions and to restore vascularity and possibly stimulate the remaining viable cells to initiate cell matrix response and healing. New operative procedures include endoscopy, electrocoagulation, and minimally invasive stripping. The aim of these techniques is to disrupt the abnormal neoinnervation to interfere with the pain sensation caused by tendinopathy. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to better clarify the best therapeutic options for the management of tendinopathy.

What is already known?

Chronic tendinopathy presents a therapeutic challenge to clinicians and there is no consensus on preferred treatment regimens.
While platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections have shown generally positive results in tendinopathy, study designs and PRP preparation methods vary widely which complicates interpretation of efficacy.

What are the new findings?

Injection of PRP is more efficacious than control injections in patients with symptomatic tendinopathy.
PRP injections for symptomatic tendinopathy may be more efficacious in women than men.
The sample sizes of most PRP studies for symptomatic tendinopathy are too small to statistically detect clinically meaningful treatment effects.

### An evidence-based approach to orthobiologics for tendon disorders [^114rJUKJ]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Tendinopathy is a chronic injury that affects both the athletic and general population. Recalcitrant tendinopathy is both frustrating for patients and providers once typical conservative treatments have been exhausted. Current research in orthobiologics shows that they are safe and could improve pain and function in recalcitrant cases. Unfortunately, many studies show inconsistency in the content of the orthobiologic injectate and approach in treatment protocols. There are robust data to support the use of platelet-rich plasma for the treatment of recalcitrant common extensor tendinopathy and plantar fasciopathy, but high-quality random control trials are needed before drawing definitive conclusions for other tendinopathies.

### Intersection syndrome: an acute surgical disease in elite rowers [^113iUWLe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Objective

Intersection syndrome is a relatively common condition in elite rowers and continuing conjecture over its pathology and best management often includes prolonged withdrawal from training and changes to the technique that may affect rowing outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed a case series in a national rowing squad and the effect on time loss produced by the condition. We reviewed the pathophysiology. We revisited the aggressive operative management put forward in the 1960s and applied it to modern rowing workload by reviewing a retrospective case series of six international rowers who had early surgical intervention.

Results

Approximately 5% of the squad suffered intersection syndrome during a 3-year period. The effect on training time was between 20% and 40% of their training time in the period. Using our understanding of the pathology as a true tendinitis of the second wrist compartment caused by fascial compression from hypertrophied first compartment muscles, we advocated earlier surgery and almost immediate return to training, which occurred at a median of 7 days postsurgery. We had successful return in five of six rowers in an accelerated programme to minimise muscle wasting and technique modification caused by the condition, achieving career goals in a matter of weeks after surgical intervention.

Conclusions

We encourage early surgical management of intersection syndrome of the wrist to allow almost immediate return to training, and therefore interfere less with technique modification and time out of the water. This minimises career disruption in the elite rowing community.

### Effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115mv7Zy]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Objective

To systematically review and critically appraise the literature on the effectiveness of isometric exercise in comparison with other treatment strategies or no treatment in tendinopathy.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE and Cochrane were undertaken from inception to May 2020.

Methods

Overall quality of each study was determined based on a combined assessment of internal validity, external validity and precision. For each outcome measure, level of evidence was rated based on the system by van Tulder et al.

Results

Ten studies were identified and included in the review, including participants with patellar (n = 4), rotator cuff (n = 2), lateral elbow (n = 2), Achilles (n = 1) and gluteal (n = 1) tendinopathies. Three were of good and seven were of poor overall quality. Based on limited evidence (level 3), isometric exercise was not superior to isotonic exercise for chronic tendinopathy either immediately following treatment or in the short term (≤ 12 weeks) for any of the investigated outcome measures. Additionally, for acute rotator cuff tendinopathy, isometric exercise appears to be no more effective than ice therapy in the short term (limited evidence; level 3).

Summary

Isometric exercise does not appear to be superior to isotonic exercise in the management of chronic tendinopathy. The response to isometric exercise is variable both within and across tendinopathy populations. Isometric exercise can be used as part of a progressive loading programme as it may be beneficial for selected individuals.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^11262Ch3]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

Our living systematic review with NMA was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and published in an open repository. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline, and the PRISMA-NMA extension for reporting NMA.

Administration and update of the living systematic review

This systematic review with NMA is part of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for Achilles tendinopathy. As we (1) plan to update the search and review process every 5 years as part of the guideline revision process, and (2) perform annual screening to identify new data that may alter the conclusions and recommendations, we defined this as a 'living' systematic review with NMA. A living systematic review's main advantage is that it assumes that new knowledge will appear and allow improvements in clinical decision-making. As we already have a structured protocol and database for this systematic review, we will be able to answer future research questions quickly and promote faster translation of new scientific evidence into clinical practice.

Patient involvement

To determine clinically relevant outcomes, we performed a pilot round of focus interviews with consecutive patients suffering from chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy (n = 9) who were participating in a randomised clinical trial (NCT02996409), and administered a survey to patients identified through the Dutch national patient federation (n = 97). The results are presented in online supplementary web appendix 1. We also considered recently defined core domains for tendinopathies from an international consensus involving patients and healthcare providers. Based on these data, we decided to evaluate clinical outcome with the validated and disease-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score as the primary outcome.

Outcome measures

The VISA-A score quantifies pain and activity level and can range from 0 to 100; a score of 100 indicates no pain with full activity level, while a score of 0 indicates severely limited activity levels and severe levels of pain. The minimal important difference (MID) for the VISA-A score is 15 points. Return to sports activities was the secondary outcome. We assessed outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^111yVwkQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Trials were eligible if they investigated the effectiveness of any treatment in adults (≥ 18 years) with Achilles tendinopathy, using the outcome measures VISA-A questionnaire and/or return to sports activities. Populations with midportion tendinopathy, insertional tendinopathy or a combination of both were included. Achilles tendinopathy must have been diagnosed based on clinical findings (eg, local pain reproduced on clinical examination). Imaging to confirm the diagnosis was not an inclusion criterion. Trials including athletes and/or inactive patients were eligible. There were no language restrictions.

Any treatment, control treatment, placebo, wait-and-see or no treatment group studied in a trial was eligible for inclusion. We predefined a number of treatment classes, based on the assumption that some treatments have a similar effect due to a comparable working mechanism. Table 1 shows the treatments that are subdivided into treatment classes.

Table 1
Assignment of treatments to classes

We excluded trials with (1) 10 or fewer participants per study arm, (2) an inadequate control group (eg, the use of the contralateral Achilles tendon), (3) a population with full-thickness ruptures of the Achilles tendon, and (4) animal or in vitro studies.

Literature search strategy and information source

We developed a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (online supplementary web appendix 2). The following databases were searched for published and unpublished trials up to 21 February 2019: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL EBSCOhost, SPORTDiscus EBSCOhost, AMED EBSCOhost, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, WorldCat.org, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. We used the validated Cochrane search filter 'Embase search strategy for finding randomised clinical trials in Embase', and modified this for all conventional databases. We screened the reference lists of all included publications for potentially eligible trials.

### Treatment algorithms for continuous low-level heat wrap therapy for the management of musculoskeletal pain: an Italian position paper [^116sgG41]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Knee Pain and/or Involvement of the Flexor and Extensor Muscles

In the last two decades, the incidence of knee pain has increased by approximately 65%. At the present time, affects around 25% of the adult population and warrants nearly 4 million visits to primary care physicians each year. The assessment of knee pain requires careful consideration of the patient's medical history and physical examination. The medical history can provide vital insights into the site and duration of the discomfort, recent traumatic events, and prior medical and/or surgical procedures. The physical examination can identify potential lymphovascular involvement, deformities, asymmetry, signs of acute inflammation, and limitation of Range Of Motion (R.O.M). Laboratory tests may be utilized to confirm a specific diagnosis when the initial medical history and physical examination provide clues but fail to establish a definitive diagnosis. In contrast, radiographic imaging is most appropriate in cases of acute traumatic pain or chronic knee pain.

Symptoms and Signs

Knee pain can arise in various ways, including acute or chronic forms, occuring only during motion or even at rest, and with or without functional impairments such as weakness, instability, stiffness, inability to fully extend the knee, or difficulty walking. Manifestations of acute inflammation include warmth to the touch, redness, and swelling. Additionally, popping or creaking sounds may be audible.

Possible Differential Diagnoses

Acute trauma or its consequences, acute sprains, direct or indirect muscle injury, pes anserine tendinopathy, Baker's cyst, overuse/overload pathology (including degenerative meniscopathy, early OA, and DOMS in athletes) and phlebo-lymphological pathology can all contribute to knee pain.

Conditions That Warrant Consideration

Beyond the aforementioned factors, body weight, posture modifications, axis deviations, and biomechanical changes are additional conditions worth considering when addressing knee pain.

### UK defence rehabilitation review of achilles and patellar tendinopathy conservative management: a systematic review [^112Dz7Gm]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy is a common condition affecting physically active populations, such as the military. Diagnosis is clinical, with no gold-standard tests. The role of imaging and functional assessment in subdiagnosis is an active area of research with the hope of delivering more nuanced and clinically effective management. A vast array of injectable and adjunctive therapies have been proposed with varying, and at times, conflicting evidence. Multiple methods for exercise therapy exist, but increasingly tendinopathy is recognised as a heterogeneous condition not suited to a one-size-fits-all approach. The aim was to complete a systematic review, to appraise the recent evidence for conservative management of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary team from across defence rehabilitation searched PubMed for literature dating from May 2017 to July 2023. Four key areas were searched: diagnosis and outcome measures, medical, exercise and adjuncts.

Results

A total of 840 articles were identified. Articles were screened using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Following screening and abstract review, a total of 143 were included for full review. Due to the breadth of literature and large heterogeneity of studies, meta-analysis of results was not feasible. Articles were assessed against the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine criteria.

Conclusions

The literature review found the strongest evidence for exercise-based rehabilitation as first-line treatment, with limited evidence for medical interventions and adjuncts. The primacy of stand-alone loading modalities is challenged by developing literature supporting a progressive tendon loading exercise protocol (PTLE). PTLE represents a framework where various exercise modalities are prescribed based on the individual's capacity and function. Novel interventions should be practised with caution and not conducted as monotherapy.

### Non-traumatic causes of fluid in the retropharyngeal space [^115pgDMB]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

There are multiple reasons for imaging the soft tissues of the neck in the emergency setting, in particular when symptoms are vague or if there is worry for complications from a certain clinical diagnosis. When fluid is seen in the retropharyngeal space, it is important to pay attention to history and look at key structures in the neck. This article will discuss anatomy of the retropharyngeal space, followed by four causes of fluid within the space that the radiologist is likely to encounter in the emergency setting: tonsillitis/pharyngitis, acute calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscles, internal jugular vein thrombosis, and post-radiation changes. It is important to recognize these entities because each has different clinical implications and management.

### Common overuse tendon problems: a review and recommendations for treatment [^1171Lr2p]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There is a common misconception that symptomatic tendon injuries are inflammatory; because of this, these injuries often are mislabeled as "tendonitis"'. Acute inflammatory tendinopathies exist, but most patients seen in primary care will have chronic symptoms suggesting a degenerative condition that should be labeled as "tendinosus" or "tendinopathy". Accurate diagnosis requires physicians to recognize the historical features, anatomy, and useful physical examination maneuvers for these common tendon problems. The natural history is gradually increasing load-related localized pain coinciding with increased activity. The most common overuse tendinopathies involve the rotator cuff, medial and lateral elbow epicondyles, patellar tendon, and Achilles tendon. Examination should include thorough inspection to assess for swelling, asymmetry, and erythema of involved tendons; range-of-motion testing; palpation for tenderness; and examination maneuvers that simulate tendon loading and reproduce pain. Plain radiography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful if the diagnosis remains unclear. Most patients with overuse tendinopathies (about 80 percent) fully recover within three to six months, and outpatient treatment should consist of relative rest of the affected area, icing, and eccentric strengthening exercises. Although topical and systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for acute pain relief, these cannot be recommended in favor of other analgesics. Injected corticosteroids also can relieve pain, but these drugs should be used with caution. Ultrasonography, shock wave therapy, orthotics, massage, and technique modification are treatment options, but few data exist to support their use at this time. Surgery is an effective treatment that should be reserved for patients who have failed conservative therapy.

### Effectiveness of isometric exercise in the management of tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113U6hPR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Results

Overall 10 eligible studies were identified with a total of n = 294 participants. The following interventions were used: n = 8 studies isolated isometric exercise, n = 8 studies isolated isotonic exercise, n = 2 studies combined isotonic/isometric exercise, n = 2 studies ice therapy, n = 1 study combined isometric exercise/ice therapy, and n = 1 study no treatment ('wait and see'). In one study where the treatment groups had either isometric exercise or ice therapy for 2 weeks, both groups subsequently had isotonic exercise for 4 weeks. Otherwise there was no overlap of treatment modalities except for the aforementioned combined groups. The mean age was 39.2 years (range 16–86).

Affected tendons by anatomical area were rotator cuff(n = 2 studies, 63 participants), lateral elbow(n = 2 studies, 74 participants), patellar(n = 4 studies, 76 participants), Achilles(n = 1 study, 44 participants) and gluteal(n = 1 study, 30 participants). All 10 studies had a randomised design with a control group (isotonic exercise n = 7 studies, ice therapy n = 2 studies, no treatment n = 1 study). Two studies had a cross-over design.

Two studies included patients with acute tendinopathy (duration of symptoms ≤ 12 weeks), seven with chronic tendinopathy (duration of symptoms > 12 weeks) and one with tendinopathy of unspecified chronicity. Treatment duration varied from a single session to 3 months and length of follow-up from 45 min to 3 months. Results were divided into (1) immediate post-treatment (three studies) and (2) short-term (≤ 12 weeks; seven studies). Publication years ranged from 2015 to 2020, with no RCTs published prior to 2015.

Table 1 shows the methodological characteristics, and table 2 presents a summary of samples, interventions and outcome measures of the included studies.

### Betamethasone sodium phosphate, betamethasone acetate (beta 1 kit) [^117VY2Gz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of betamethasone for a week followed by 12 mg every other day for 1 month are recommended (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuro-psychiatric section).

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of betamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m²bsa/day).

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

If coadministration of a local anesthetic is desired, Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension may be mixed with 1% or 2% lidocaine hydrochloride, using the formulations which do not contain parabens. Similar local anesthetics may also be used. Diluents containing methylparaben, propylparaben, phenol, etc., should be avoided, since these compounds may cause flocculation of the steroid. The required dose of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension is first withdrawn from the vial into the syringe. The local anesthetic is then drawn in, and the syringe shaken briefly. Do not inject local anesthetics into the vial of Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension.

Bursitis, Tenosynovitis, Peritendinitis

In acute subdeltoid, subacromial, olecranon, and prepatellar bursitis, one intrabursal injection of 1.0 mL Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension can relieve pain and restore full range of movement. Several intrabursal injections of corticosteroids are usually required in recurrent acute bursitis and in acute exacerbations of chronic bursitis. Partial relief of pain and some increase in mobility can be expected in both conditions after one or two injections. Chronic bursitis may be treated with reduced dosage once the acute condition is controlled. In tenosynovitis and tendinitis, three or four local injections at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks between injections are given in most cases. Injections should be made into the affected tendon sheaths rather than into the tendons themselves. In ganglions of joint capsules and tendon sheaths, injection of 0.5 mL directly into the ganglion cysts has produced marked reduction in the size of the lesions.

### Do we need to improve the reporting of evidence in tendinopathy management? A critical appraisal of systematic reviews with recommendations on strength of evidence assessment [^112oYQvV]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

An SR is no small undertaking and should not make for an easy publication. Future authors who only intend to summarise the available evidence without a comprehensive quality assessment and strength of evidence assessment should strongly consider identifying their reviews as narrative, not systematic. Admittedly, strict word counts and other restrictions from journals undoubtedly have a negative influence on the quality of the published SRs; we, therefore, invite the editors of publishing journals to either loosen restrictions for submitted articles or discuss word counts and accompanying material (tables/figures) with authors on a case-by-case basis. Publication of narrative reviews should also become an option in all publishing journals.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^114DJefW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management — splinting, bandaging, immobilization, cryotherapy (PRICE) and MEAT: Currently, the protection, relative rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE) protocol is considered the best initial treatment regimen for suspected soft-tissue injury and fractures. Limited evidence supports this practice. However, PRICE remains in widespread use based on moderate-quality evidence and expert opinion. An alternative strategy called the movement, exercise, analgesics, and treatment/therapy (MEAT) protocol has been proposed for managing isolated ligament and tendon injury when fractures have been excluded, and one randomized trial showed that early therapeutic exercise resulted in a quicker return to normal function versus PRICE therapy. If an isolated ligament or tendon injury is highly suspected and fracture is unlikely, MEAT therapy can be substituted, but in an austere environment providers may be unable to differentiate an acute fracture from isolated soft tissue injury; thus, PRICE remains the recommended therapy for most acute musculoskeletal injuries.

### Diagnostic imaging for achilles tendinopathy: unnecessary scans? Valuable insights? Multidisciplinary clinician-scientists present a nuanced view [^112Z1gDt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Clinical practice guidelines for Achilles tendinopathy do not recommend imaging to inform diagnosis. However, there is considerable variation in how imaging is used, particularly in research and sports. Early imaging risks that people who see the images presume that what they "see" as pathology is the primary cause of pain; patients might end up receiving invasive treatments on the basis of the image when rehabilitation may suffice. On the other hand, imaging can help rule out Achilles tendinopathy and identify differential diagnoses. As more rehabilitation clinicians are direct access practitioners and take on expanded roles as primary health practitioners, ultrasound imaging might serve as a valuable point-of-care tool for diagnosis, identifying conditions that warrant referral and managing conditions like Achilles tendinopathy. We argue that the value of ultrasound imaging to diagnose tendinopathy outweighs the potential limitations. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–4.

### Management of tendinopathy [^114iSLWe]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Overuse disorders of tendons, or tendinopathies, present a challenge to sports physicians, surgeons, and other health care professionals dealing with athletes. The Achilles, patellar, and supraspinatus tendons are particularly vulnerable to injury and often difficult to manage successfully. Inflammation was believed central to the pathologic process, but histopathologic evidence has confirmed the failed healing response nature of these conditions. Excessive or inappropriate loading of the musculotendinous unit is believed to be central to the disease process, although the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains uncertain. Additionally, the location of the lesion (for example, the midtendon or osteotendinous junction) has become increasingly recognized as influencing both the pathologic process and subsequent management. The mechanical, vascular, neural, and other theories that seek to explain the pathologic process are explored in this article. Recent developments in the nonoperative management of chronic tendon disorders are reviewed, as is the rationale for surgical intervention. Recent surgical advances, including minimally invasive tendon surgery, are reviewed. Potential future management strategies, such as stem cell therapy, growth factor treatment, and gene transfer, are also discussed.

### The challenge of managing tendinopathy in competing athletes [^111D7vmQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Managing tendinopathy in season is a challenge for all sports medicine practitioners. Many of the strategies employed to treat tendinopathy in a rehabilitation setting are not suitable because of the time taken to recover. Management strategies that control pain and maintain performance are required. These include load management, both reducing aggravating loads and introducing pain-relieving loads, medications and adequate monitoring to detect a deteriorating tendon. Other interventions such as intratendinous injection therapies and other direct tendon modalities can be provocative at worst and without effect at best. Research to improve the understanding of management in athletes in season is compromised by ethical considerations and access to willing participants. It is likely to remain an area where clinical advances guide future treatments.

### Management of chronic tendon injuries… [^116RGBwr]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy typically report weakness, stiffness, constant pain that is exacerbated with certain movements, and pain that makes it difficult to sleep on the affected side. The mainstay of treatment is rehabilitative exercise focusing on scapular stabilization and biomechanics to decrease subacromial impingement. 59 Eccentric exercise has not been proven superior to conventional exercise in treating rotator cuff tendinopathy, and home-based programs are as effective as clinic-based programs. 55, 60 Subacromial corticosteroid injections are commonly used to provide short-term pain relief, which can be useful when initiating physical therapy. 61 If the patient remains symptomatic after six months of therapy, other treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave therapy, platelet-rich plasma injections, or dextrose prolotherapy can be considered. If these treatments are ineffective, surgery may be a consideration. 33, 62.

There is no universally accepted physical therapy program for GTPS. Therapy should focus on patient-specific deficits in combination with stretching of the piriformis and iliotibial band and strengthening of the gluteal and core muscle groups. In addition to therapy, corticosteroid injections provide short- and medium-term pain control, and extracorporeal shock wave therapy provides medium- to long-term pain control. Initial management of patellar tendinopathy includes relative rest and pain control with NSAIDs or cryotherapy. A patellar counterforce brace, which works by positively altering tendon biomechanics, helps decrease pain and increase function. 14, 29, 77, 78. Eccentric exercise is another proven treatment modality and should be part of any physical therapy program for patellar tendinopathy.

14 Up to 45% of patients will not respond to eccentric exercise alone; in these cases, treatments such as corticosteroid injections, topical nitroglycerin, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and other therapeutic injections are options before surgery. 14, 29. 79 Insertional tendinopathy does not respond as well to eccentric exercise, so rehabilitation focuses on concentric exercise. 14, 15, 79 Orthotics to correct foot malalignment are another noninvasive and inexpensive modality that can be used for initial treatment. 1 As with other tendinopathies, corticosteroid injections, topical nitroglycerin, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and platelet-rich plasma injections are options if initial conservative treatments are not successful.

### Management of acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries… [^1167Ku9z]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Topical NSAIDs are the most effective intervention for acute musculoskeletal pain other than low back pain.
- Although oral NSAIDs and acetaminophen are effective for acute pain relief, combining them does not improve effectiveness.
- Although moderately effective for pain relief, opioids increase gastrointestinal and neurologic adverse effects and lead to long-term use in 6% of people treated.
- Acupressure and TENS techniques are effective nonpharmacologic options for acute pain. From the AFP Editors. Medication Therapy Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the primary recommended treatment, being among the most effective medications and the only to improve all measured outcomes. Topical NSAIDs improve pain within two hours, provide sustained relief over one week, and are the most effective intervention for improving physical function. They also lead to symptom relief and patient satisfaction more than oral NSAIDs.

No adverse effects are more common with topical NSAIDs than with placebo. The effectiveness of topical NSAIDs with menthol gel is similar to that of topical NSAIDs alone. Oral NSAIDs are recommended as a secondary medical intervention. Oral NSAIDs also reduce pain at two hours and over one week and increase physical function and symptom relief, although to a lesser extent than topical NSAIDs. Oral NSAIDs do not increase patient satisfaction and lead to more gastrointestinal adverse events. Acetaminophen reduces pain at two hours and over one week, similar to oral NSAIDs, but without increasing physical function, symptom relief, or patient satisfaction. Combining acetaminophen with oral NSAIDs does not appear to be better than either treatment alone. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is also a recommended nonpharmacologic option. TENS appears to produce short-term pain relief and pain relief for up to one week, but it does not improve physical function or symptom relief.

Other nonpharmacologic options have more limited evidence. Massage therapy produces short-term pain relief but has no other evidence of benefit. Joint manipulation may reduce short-term pain and improve symptom relief without improving physical function or treatment satisfaction. Supervised rehabilitation reduces pain over one week without improving physical function. Neither ultrasound therapy nor laser therapy reduces pain over one week, but laser therapy improves symptom relief.
