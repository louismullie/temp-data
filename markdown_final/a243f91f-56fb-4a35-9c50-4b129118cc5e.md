## Question

Pelvic congestion syndrome treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PCS and clarifying the pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and how to exclude mimics. Next, I will review conservative options, followed by endovascular therapies, including embolization and stenting for outflow obstruction. After that, I should consider surgical alternatives and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a stepwise algorithm and highlight evidence gaps and controversies, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its mechanisms. PCS is best understood as a pelvic venous disorder characterized by chronic pelvic pain with venous reflux and/or outflow obstruction, often in multiparous women, with symptoms worsened by upright posture, menstruation, and intercourse; I should double-check that the modern nomenclature emphasizes "pelvic venous disorders (PeVD)" to encompass reflux, compression (nutcracker, May-Thurner), and mixed etiologies, which helps align treatment to mechanism [^112TwXQm] [^114Sxx1V] [^1168FxXD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before excluding other causes of chronic pelvic pain. I need to ensure a thorough differential is pursued because PCS is a diagnosis of exclusion; endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, PID, IBS, interstitial cystitis, musculoskeletal pain, and psychological contributors should be considered, and guidelines explicitly recommend excluding other etiologies before attributing pain to PCS, which I should verify in ESVS statements [^112ysSgr].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup. Noninvasive imaging with transabdominal/transvaginal ultrasound, CT venography, or MR venography can identify dilated ovarian/pelvic veins and reflux; I should confirm that an ovarian vein diameter greater than about 6–8 mm supports the diagnosis, while remembering that reflux can be seen in asymptomatic women, so clinical correlation is essential; venography remains the gold standard when intervention is planned, and I need to check that guidelines align with this staged approach [^115UtFpM] [^116UyQhV] [^114Sxx1V] [^116UCenC].

> Wait, let me verify the role of laparoscopy. Laparoscopy can miss PCS because insufflation and supine positioning compress varices, so a negative laparoscopy does not rule out PCS; I should confirm that imaging is prioritized and that laparoscopy is reserved for excluding other pathology rather than diagnosing PCS itself [^111GsA6r].

> I will now examine conservative management. I need to ensure we offer lifestyle measures such as weight optimization, leg elevation, graded compression, and avoidance of prolonged standing, along with NSAIDs for analgesia; hormonal suppression with progestins or GnRH analogs may provide short-term relief but long-term efficacy is limited and adverse effects are common, so I should frame these as temporizing or adjunctive rather than definitive therapy [^1168FxXD] [^113aC5UT] [^111LcZam].

> Let me consider endovascular embolization as the first-line definitive therapy for reflux-dominant PCS. I should confirm that multiple series show high technical success (about 96–100%) and meaningful clinical improvement in roughly 70–90% of patients, with low major complication rates; techniques include coils, plugs, sclerosants, or combinations, and a randomized comparison suggests plugs can reduce device count, fluoroscopy time, and radiation without compromising 1-year outcomes, which is useful for procedural planning [^111bS8Gz] [^1176C6Kz] [^114VDQRy].

> But wait, what if the pain is driven by outflow obstruction rather than primary reflux? I should double-check that iliac vein stenting for May-Thurner physiology and left renal vein stenting for nutcracker can dramatically improve symptoms when obstruction is the driver; contemporary series and AVLS guidance support stenting as a key modality in obstructive PeVD, and I need to ensure we image for compression before defaulting to embolization alone [^114EJpf3] [^115CSo5G] [^112z3HJa].

> Hold on, I should verify sequencing when both obstruction and reflux coexist. The prevailing approach is to treat the outflow obstruction first, then reassess symptoms; if pelvic pain persists, proceed with ovarian/internal iliac vein embolization, because relieving upstream blockage can reduce reflux and may lessen the burden needed for embolization; case-based algorithms illustrate this staged strategy and I should confirm that our plan aligns with this logic [^112z3HJa] [^112isgn8].

> I need to check surgical alternatives for refractory cases or when endovascular therapy is unavailable. Laparoscopic ovarian vein ligation or transposition, and in select cases hysterectomy with oophorectomy, have been reported, but endovascular embolization generally achieves comparable or better symptom relief with less invasiveness; guidelines suggest surgery only when less invasive options are not available or have failed, which I should emphasize during shared decision-making [^113Nznvi] [^113GtYkH] [^116DmpDf].

> Let me think about special populations. In adolescents and nulliparous patients, PCS does occur, albeit less commonly; I should confirm that the diagnostic and treatment principles are similar, with careful attention to radiation dose and fertility considerations, and note that small series suggest embolization remains safe and effective in this group, though evidence is limited and shared decision-making is crucial [^1156RbJA] [^116ASnfF].

> I should confirm fertility implications. Available data suggest embolization does not impair ovarian reserve or fertility, and small series report pregnancies and live births after ovarian vein embolization; however, I need to ensure patients understand that high-quality prospective data are sparse and that we monitor for potential impacts on menstrual function and conception plans post-procedure [^113A3n99] [^114iT9dJ].

> Next, I should review recurrence and retreatment. Recurrence after embolization ranges roughly 10–40% and is more likely when pelvic escape points or lower-extremity varicosities are not addressed; if symptoms recur, I should verify that repeat venography can identify untreated tributaries or new reflux pathways, and consider adjunctive sclerotherapy or embolization of additional feeders such as the median sacral vein in select cases [^115dpux8] [^1136oDBV] [^113gkSvF].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it against guidelines. First, confirm chronic pelvic pain and exclude other etiologies; second, use ultrasound, CT/MR venography to identify reflux and/or obstruction; third, if obstruction is present, prioritize stenting before embolization; fourth, if reflux predominates without significant outflow blockage, proceed to ovarian/internal iliac vein embolization with coils, plugs, and/or sclerosant; fifth, address pelvic escape points and concomitant leg varicosities to reduce recurrence; sixth, reserve surgery for failures of or lack of access to endovascular therapy; throughout, embed conservative measures and multidisciplinary care, and counsel regarding evidence quality and uncertainties [^114Z1fAU] [^112TwXQm] [^114EJpf3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also flag the evidence gaps and controversies so expectations are realistic. High-quality randomized trials are limited, nomenclature has been inconsistent, and outcome reporting is heterogeneous; emerging efforts like the SVP classification and core outcome sets aim to standardize research, but until then, I need to ensure shared decision-making emphasizes the strength and limits of current evidence and the need for prospective multicenter studies [^112TwXQm] [^112PSHX9] [^117C35GT].

> Finally, I should double-check safety and follow-up. Major complications from embolization are uncommon, with coil migration, access-site hematoma, and transient post-embolization pain being the most frequently reported; most series report low major adverse event rates, and patient satisfaction is generally high when appropriately selected, which supports the centrality of careful patient selection and structured follow-up with symptom scales and, when indicated, repeat imaging [^114VDQRy] [^115ypPxL] [^115dpux8].

---

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is best managed with a **stepwise approach**: start with conservative measures (NSAIDs, hormonal therapy, compression, lifestyle changes) [^1168FxXD], and if symptoms persist, proceed to **ovarian/internal iliac vein embolization** [^114Z1fAU], which offers high technical success and durable symptom relief [^111bS8Gz] [^114VDQRy]. Reserve surgery for refractory cases or when embolization is not feasible [^113Nznvi] [^113GtYkH]. Address **venous outflow obstruction** (e.g. May-Thurner, Nutcracker) with stenting when present [^115CSo5G] [^114EJpf3]. Multidisciplinary care and standardized outcomes are essential to optimize results [^114h685Q] [^112PSHX9].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative therapy is appropriate for **mild symptoms** or as a bridge to definitive care:

- **NSAIDs and analgesics**: Short-term relief of pelvic pain [^notfound].

- **Hormonal therapy**: Medroxyprogesterone acetate or GnRH analogs can reduce pain, but long-term use is limited by side effects and recurrence after cessation [^notfound].

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated stockings or pelvic support garments may alleviate discomfort [^1168FxXD].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, regular exercise, and avoiding prolonged standing can reduce symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Endovascular embolization

Endovascular embolization is the **first-line definitive therapy** for PCS:

- **Technique**: Coil embolization, vascular plugs, or sclerotherapy (alone or combined) of refluxing ovarian and internal iliac veins [^112t9NKJ] [^115xHSxr].

- **Outcomes**: High technical success (96–100%) and clinical improvement in 70–90% of patients; durable relief in 75–85% at 1–5 years [^111bS8Gz] [^114VDQRy] [^115ypPxL].

- **Complications**: Low (2–3%); coil migration, non-target embolization, and transient pain are most common [^115dpux8].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** or when embolization is not feasible:

- **Ovarian vein ligation**: Laparoscopic ligation offers symptom relief in ~75% but is more invasive than embolization [^116DmpDf].

- **Hysterectomy with oophorectomy**: Considered only when other treatments fail; not curative in all cases [^113aC5UT].

---

## Management of venous outflow obstruction

Venous outflow obstruction (e.g. May-Thurner, Nutcracker) should be addressed to **improve symptoms** and reduce recurrence:

- **Iliac vein stenting**: Effective for May-Thurner–related PCS; consider simultaneous or staged embolization [^115CSo5G] [^114EJpf3].

- **Nutcracker syndrome**: Treat renal vein compression (stenting or transposition) when symptomatic, with embolization as adjunctive therapy [^112z3HJa] [^116nWG9Y].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and follow-up

A **multidisciplinary approach** involving gynecology, vascular surgery, interventional radiology, and pain management improves outcomes. Standardized outcome measures (e.g. VAS, SVP classification) facilitate consistent reporting and care [^113tEvZd] [^112PSHX9].

---

## Summary of treatment options and outcomes

| **Treatment modality** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** | **Complications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Conservative therapy | Mild symptoms or bridge to definitive therapy | Short-term relief | Minimal |
| Endovascular embolization | First-line definitive therapy | 70–90% symptom relief | Low (2–3%) |
| Surgical ligation | Refractory cases or embolization not feasible | ~75% relief | Higher invasiveness |
| Venous stenting | Venous outflow obstruction | 68–100% relief | Stent-related complications |

---

Pelvic congestion syndrome treatment spans conservative measures and definitive endovascular embolization, with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Addressing **venous obstruction** and using a **multidisciplinary approach** with standardized outcomes optimize care.

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is an important cause of chronic pelvic pain in female patients. Chronic pelvic pain, defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain for a duration of 6 months or more, causes significant morbidity and results in a large number of diagnostic laparoscopies. It is of utmost importance to identify treatable causes of chronic pelvic pain, one of which is PCS. The etiology, clinical features, investigations, and treatment options in PCS have been discussed in this paper.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain is not a rare health problem among women. One of the most common causes of chronic pelvic pain is pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). We have reviewed all medical literature on the endovascular treatment of PCS and hereby provide a brief overview of the anatomy, pathophysiology, and clinical aspects of ovarian and pelvic varices. We describe the technique of transcatheter embolization, the complications thereof and the clinical results of the treatment.

Methods

A literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Scopus to identify case series on the endovascular treatment of PCS up until the end of November 2014.

Results

Twenty studies with a total of 1081 patients were included in the review. There were no randomized trials, and only one study included a control group. The immediate technical success rate in the occlusion of the affected veins was 99%. Seventeen studies reported the 1- to 3-month clinical success of 641 patients. Of these, 88.1% reported moderate to significant relief in the symptoms and 11.9% reported little or no relief. In 17 studies, long-term results were reported, and the follow-up varied between 7.3 months and 5 years. In late follow-up, 86.6% reported relief of the symptoms and 13.6% experienced little or no relief.

Conclusions

The immediate success rate for the endovascular treatment of PCS is good and the complication rate low. Most patients report relief in the symptoms for up to 5 years after the procedure. However, there are no randomized or high-quality controlled trials, and the level of evidence therefore remains at C.

### Diagnosis and management of pelvic venous disorders: expert panel narrative review [^112TwXQm]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVD), previously known by various imprecise terms including pelvic congestion syndrome, have historically been underdiagnosed as a cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP), a significant health problem associated with reduced quality of life. However, progress in the field has helped to provide heightened clarity with respect to definitions relating to PeVD, and evolution in algorithms for PeVD workup and treatment has been accompanied by new insights into the causes of a pelvic venous reservoir and associated symptoms. Ovarian and pelvic vein embolization, as well as endovascular stenting of common iliac vein compression, should be considered as management options for PeVD. Both treatments have been shown to be safe and effective for patients with CPP of venous origin, regardless of age. Current therapeutic protocols for PeVD exhibit significant heterogeneity owing to limited prospective randomized data and evolving understanding of the factors driving successful outcomes; forthcoming clinical trials are anticipated to improve understanding of CPP of venous origin as well as algorithms for PeVD management. This Expert Panel Narrative Review provides a contemporary update relating to PeVD, summarizing the entity's current classification, diagnostic workup, endovascular treatments, management of persistent or recurrent symptoms, and future research directions.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^112Q9gmb]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

CPP is a widespread, common and debilitating condition affecting millions of women worldwide. The aetiology is complex and multifactorial. PVCS is a common cause of CPP but is underdiagnosed. Confusion regarding the terminology used to describe the condition has added to this controversy as has the early unwarranted emphasis that is was psychosomatic in nature. The recognition that many of these women demonstrate abnormal pelvic venous vasculature was initially made either at surgery or by venography. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of all causes of CPP including PVCS.

OVE has superseded surgical and medical management of PVCS however the lack of robust multicentre RCTs regarding diagnosis, treatment and outcomes has hindered the complete acceptance by relevant specialists of the existence and significance of this condition. The adoption of the SVP grading system will encourage consistency of terminology, the documentation of all relevant clinical data and the standardization of reporting of outcomes. It is incumbent on all specialists undertaking OVE to engage in collaborative prospective research to enable this group of women to receive the best possible care for their condition.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome: etiology of pain, diagnosis, and clinical management [^113Kchxk]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pelvic congestion syndrome is associated with pelvic varicosities that result in chronic pelvic pain, especially in the setting of prolonged standing, coitus, menstruation, and pregnancy. Although the underlying pathophysiology of pelvic congestion syndrome is unclear, it probably results from a combination of dysfunctional venous valves, retrograde blood flow, venous hypertension, and dilatation. Asymptomatic women may also have pelvic varicosities, making pelvic congestion syndrome difficult to diagnose. This article explores the etiologies of pain, use of imaging techniques, and clinical management of pelvic congestion syndrome. Possible explanations for the spectrum of pain among women with pelvic varicosities are also discussed.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^114h685Q]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS) is a common, but underdiagnosed, cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women.

PVCS occurs usually, but not exclusively, in multiparous women. It is characterized by chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease.

The patients present to general practitioners, gynaecologists, vascular specialists, pain specialists, gastroenterologists and psychiatrists. Pain of variable intensity occurs at any time but is worse in the pre-menstrual period, and is exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue. Post coital ache, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, bladder irritability and rectal discomfort are also common. Under-diagnosis of this condition can lead to anxiety and depression.

A multidisciplinary approach in the investigation and management of these women is vital.

Non-invasive imaging (US, CT, MRI) are essential in the diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions that cause CPP as well in the definitive diagnosis of PVCS. Trans-catheter venography remains the gold standard modality for the definitive diagnosis and is undertaken as an immediate precursor to ovarian vein embolization (OVE). Conservative, medical and surgical management strategies have been reported but have been superseded by OVE, which has a reported technical success rates of 96–100%, low complication rates and long-term symptomatic relief in between 70–90% of cases.

The condition, described in this paper as PVCS, is referred to by a wide variety of other terms in the literature, a cause of confusion.

There is a significant body of literature describing the syndrome and the excellent outcomes following OVE however the lack of prospective, multicentre randomized controlled trials for both investigation and management of PVCS is a significant barrier to the complete acceptance of both the existence, investigation and management of the condition.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^117Srzfx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum guideline — treatment of pelvic varicose veins states: We recommend noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or transvaginal ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance venography in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome or symptomatic varices in the distribution of the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks (1 C). We recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in patients with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by noninvasive imaging studies, in whom intervention is planned (1 C). We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (2 B). If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest surgical ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux (2 B). The grading defines 1. Strong and 2. Weak recommendations, and evidence levels A. High quality, B. Moderate quality, and C. Low or very low quality.

### Symptomatic pelvic venous insufficiency: a review of the current controversies in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management [^111vjJSs]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI) is defined as chronic pelvic pain resulting from dilated pelvic veins. It is a controversial area, with ongoing debate surrounding the underlying aetiology of pain, as well as how best to investigate and manage these patients. Multiple distinct underlying pathophysiological processes have been implicated and can broadly be classified as primary venous reflux, normally involving the ovarian veins, and secondary venous obstruction, which may involve either the ovarian or internal iliac veins. Multiple terms have been used to describe this spectrum of conditions including pelvic congestion, May-Thurner and nutcracker syndromes; however, this terminology is imprecise and fails to define the underlying pathological process. A recent consensus classification of pelvic venous disorders aims to improve this nomenclature to aid clinical communication, decision-making, and future research. This is important as the treatment options differ according to the underlying cause. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnostic process, both to define the underlying pathophysiology and to help plan treatments. Minimally invasive radiologically guided embolisation and/or venous stenting now form the mainstay of management with good reported outcomes. The present article discusses the proposed pathophysiology and aetiology of pain in PVI, reviews the role of imaging in the diagnosis, and considers the role of catheter-directed treatments.

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS) is a common, but underdiagnosed, cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women.PVCS occurs usually, but not exclusively, in multiparous women. It is characterized by chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease. The patients present to general practitioners, gynaecologists, vascular specialists, pain specialists, gastroenterologists and psychiatrists. Pain of variable intensity occurs at any time but is worse in the pre-menstrual period, and is exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue. Post coital ache, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, bladder irritability and rectal discomfort are also common. Under-diagnosis of this condition can lead to anxiety and depression. A multidisciplinary approach in the investigation and management of these women is vital. Non-invasive imaging (US, CT, MRI) are essential in the diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions that cause CPP as well in the definitive diagnosis of PVCS. Trans-catheter venography remains the gold standard modality for the definitive diagnosis and is undertaken as an immediate precursor to ovarian vein embolization (OVE). Conservative, medical and surgical management strategies have been reported but have been superseded by OVE, which has a reported technical success rates of 96–100%, low complication rates and long-term symptomatic relief in between 70–90% of cases. The condition, described in this paper as PVCS, is referred to by a wide variety of other terms in the literature, a cause of confusion. There is a significant body of literature describing the syndrome and the excellent outcomes following OVE however the lack of prospective, multicentre randomized controlled trials for both investigation and management of PVCS is a significant barrier to the complete acceptance of both the existence, investigation and management of the condition.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^111LcZam]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Pelvic congestion syndrome treatment options and outcomes — various nonsurgical and surgical approaches are available; pharmacologic agents to suppress ovarian function, such as medroxyprogesterone- or gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may offer short-term pain relief, but their long-term effectiveness has not been proven. Surgical approaches, including hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy and ovarian vein ligation and excision, with interruption of as many collateral veins as possible, have been suggested for patients unresponsive to medical therapy. Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of refluxing ovarian and internal iliac vein tributaries with coils, plugs, or sclerotherapy, usually as combination treatment, has become the standard approach for management of both pelvic congestion syndrome and varices arising from a pelvic source. Transcatheter therapy has been reported to improve symptoms in 50% to 80% of patients. In one randomized study, Chung and Huh randomized 106 premenopausal women with chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to medical treatment to three regimens — ovarian vein embolization; laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and hormone replacement; or laparoscopic hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy — and mean pain scores on a 10-point visual analog scale improved among those undergoing ovarian vein embolization or bilateral oophorectomy but not unilateral oophorectomy, with pain reduction at 12 months greatest after embolotherapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the pelvic congestion syndrome [^115j21hJ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain accounts for up to 30% of outpatient gynecologic visits in the United States, potentially affecting up to 40% of the female population during their lifetime. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is defined as chronic pelvic pain resulting from reflux or obstruction of the gonadal, gluteal, or periuterine veins, sometimes associated with perineal or vulvar varices. It can also be caused by compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, also known as the nutcracker syndrome. Whereas PCS accounts for up to 30% of patients presenting with chronic pelvic pain, it is frequently underdiagnosed. We reviewed the literature to investigate the current state of the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.

Methods

An online database search was performed with MEDLINE. MeSH headings included PCS, chronic pelvic pain, ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, renal vein obstruction, pelvic varicosities, labial varicosities, embolization, treatment, and therapies.

Results

Our MEDLINE search revealed more than 3756 references to chronic pelvic pain. Specific references to PCS, pelvic chronic pain, ovarian vein reflux, nutcracker syndrome, renal vein obstruction, pelvic varicosities, labial varicosities, embolization, treatment, and therapies, however, included only 260 references. Thirty-seven references were small series including fewer than 50 patients or individual case reports documenting medical, surgical, or endovascular treatment of PCS. The majority of these papers demonstrated successful treatment of symptoms from PCS with embolization of one or both ovarian veins in addition to treatment of refluxing internal iliac vein branches. In addition, open surgery and, more recently, endovascular stenting of LRV obstruction have shown some promise in alleviating symptoms attributed to nutcracker syndrome.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of PCS requires a careful history, physical examination, and noninvasive imaging. Several large case series have demonstrated the efficacy of embolotherapy in the reduction of pelvic pain; thus, it is the most favored treatment option for patients with PCS. For patients with outflow obstruction due to nutcracker syndrome, a limited number of studies have demonstrated remission of symptoms with stenting of the LRV as an alternative to open surgery.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^116DmpDf]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic trans peritoneal ovarian vein ligation is reported to be associated with symptom improvement in 75% of women. More radical surgery is only indicated in cases of unavailability or failure of less invasive techniques. OVE has reported clinical success in 70–85%, a complication rate of between 3.4–9%, however 6–31.8% of women do not get substantial or long term relief. OVE is currently believed to be the best available treatment but this is based empirical evidence rather than trials.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varicosities [^113JY5LV]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI), defined as retrograde flow in the gonadal and internal iliac veins, is the underlying cause of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), a common cause of disabling chronic pelvic pain in women of child-bearing age. PCS is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by positional pelvic pain that is worse in the upright position and is associated with pelvic and vulvar varicosities as well as symptoms of dyspareunia and postcoital pain. Through collaterals to the lower extremity venous system, PVI may also contribute to varicose vein formation and recurrence in the lower extremities. Endovascular embolization of the ovarian and internal iliac veins has become the treatment of choice for PVI and PCS. This article reviews the pelvic retroperitoneal venous anatomy, pathophysiology of PCS, treatment options and techniques, and clinical outcomes of embolotherapy for PCS.

Clinical outcomes

Pelvic venous embolization is currently widely believed to be the best available treatment for PCS, however this is based on empirical data rather than detailed evidence from clinical trials (Borghi and Dell'Atti).

In an early series, 88.9% of women reported 80% immediate relief of symptoms overall following coil embolization of the ovarian veins and contributing internal iliac tributaries. Individual symptom relief varied from 40–100% at mean follow up of 13.4 months. There were no major complications and by year 2005 centres were reporting technical success rates of 96–99% with few complications and reported rates of symptomatic relief in 75% of patients, with up to 60% experiencing complete resolution of symptoms (Drife; Kuligowska et al.).

A decade after the first report of OVE it was observed that it had become the mainstay of treatment, with technical success reported as 98%-100%. 70–85% patients reported immediate symptom improvement within two weeks with recurrence rates of 8% (Freedman et al; Kim et al.).

In a comprehensive review of the literature in 2018, Champaniera et al. reached the following conclusion: 'The data supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PVI in the presence of CPP are limited and of variable quality, and considerable further high-quality research is required to thoroughly address the research question' (Champaneria et al.). The group also stated 'embolization appears to provide good to complete symptomatic relief in the majority of women'. Regarding outcomes of the 1308 patients included in the analysis 75% reported an early symptom benefit from embolization. In nine studies where pain was measured on follow up using a visual analogue scale (VAS), a statistically significant reduction was seen in all cases (Chung and Huh; Venbrux; Meneses et al; Kim et al; Creton et al; Richardson and Driver; Gandini et al; Tropeano et al; Asciutto et al; Brown).

### Female pelvic vein embolization: indications, techniques, and outcomes [^1145yuoe]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Until recently, the main indication for pelvic vein embolization (PVE) in women was to treat pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVC) but increasingly, patients with refluxing pelvic veins associated with leg varicosities are also being treated. A more unusual reason for PVE is to treat pelvic venous malformations, although such lesions may be treated with sclerotherapy alone. Embolotherapy for treating PVC has been performed for many years with several published studies included in this review, whilst an emerging indication for PVE is to treat lower limb varicosities associated with pelvic vein reflux. Neither group, however, has been subjected to an adequate randomized, controlled trial. Consequently, some of the information presented in this review should be considered anecdotal (level III evidence) at this stage, and a satisfactory 'proof' of clinical efficacy remains deficient until higher-level evidence is presented. Furthermore, a wide range of techniques not accepted by all are used, and some standardization will be required based on future mandatory prospective studies. Large studies have also clearly shown an unacceptably high recurrence rate of leg varicose veins following venous surgery. Furthermore, minimally or non-invasive imaging is now revealing that there is a refluxing pelvic venous source in a significant percentage of women with de novo leg varicose veins, and many more with recurrent varicosities. Considering that just over half the world's population is female and a significant number of women not only have pelvic venous reflux, but also have associated leg varicosities, minimally invasive treatment of pelvic venous incompetence will become a common procedure.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^112z3HJa]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal management strategy of nutcracker syndrome is debated, especially in the setting of concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome. In this article, we describe our treatment algorithm as illustrated by four different case scenarios. In our experience, renocaval pressure gradients are often inconclusive, but evaluation of the left renal vein waveform as well as a "test PTA" with evidence of a waist in the balloon can be helpful in unmasking a relevant stenosis. We consider nutcracker syndrome not to be a contraindication for ovarian vein embolization. Decision for simultaneous or sequential stenting should be based on angiographic findings and clinical course.

Current evidence and trends

A large body of literature exists related to PVCS as a cause of CPP and that the initial treatment of choice is OVE. The overwhelming consensus from the systematic reviews that have been undertaken is the need for robust multicentre randomized controlled trails (RCTs).

In 2010, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Technology Assessment Committee urged the adoption of common definitions, approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes to optimize the care of patients with CPP resulting from pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI) (Black et al.). They noted that although trans-catheter embolization had become an established treatment for PVCS, published outcomes were limited by non-standardized reporting, incomplete follow-up and the use of variable outcome measures.

Campbell et al. examined the opinions of vascular surgeons in the UK regarding the treatment of pelvic vein reflux (PVR) associated with varicose veins, 9% of respondents to a questionnaire did not recognize PVR as an entity and 11% do not investigate or treat it (Campbell et al.). The lack of agreement on consistent terminology and the lack of prospective RCTs are cited as two reasons for these opinions.

A multidisciplinary research consensus panel identified certain areas requiring urgent research priorities in pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) in women (Khilnani). They conclude that multiple evidence gaps exist related to PeVDs with the consequence that nonvascular specialists rarely consider the diagnosis. The areas they identified are:
Consensus on the clinical and imaging criteria for PeVD.
A discriminative tool to categorize patients with PeVD.
QOL tools to measure the health burden in women affected by PeVD and its change after treatment.

In the United States, obtaining re-imbursement from insurance companies is challenging some considering OVE for PVI an investigative treatment, this may in part be because original studies over-emphasized the psychological component of the condition (Khilnani; Bookwalter et al.). They conclude that although the evidence for OVE for CPP/PVCS is strong more research is needed especially when PVCS is combined with lower extremity varicosities. Large multicentre prospective RCTs looking at pre and post embolization hormone levels, conception and pregnancy outcomes are required.

### Imaging appearance and nonsurgical management of pelvic venous congestion syndrome [^114Sxx1V]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS) is a challenging and complex cause of chronic pelvic pain in female patients. PVCS due to incompetent vein valves is the combination of gonadal vein reflux and pelvic venous engorgement in patients with chronic pelvic pain without other causes. However, pelvic venous engorgement and gonadal vein reflux can be seen in patients without pelvic pain, which makes obtaining a detailed history and physical examination important for workup and diagnosis. The underlying cause of PVCS may be incompetent gonadal vein valves or structural causes such as left renal vein compression with an incompetent gonadal vein valve (nutcracker syndrome) or iliac vein compression (May-Thurner configuration) with reflux into the ipsilateral internal iliac vein. Venography is considered the criterion standard for imaging diagnosis; however, more recently, US and MRI have been shown to provide adequate accuracy for diagnosis. Noninvasive imaging studies aid in the diagnosis of PVCS and also aid in pretreatment planning. When PVCS is caused by incompetent gonadal vein valves, treatment typically is performed by means of embolization via a minimally invasive catheter with excellent technical and clinical success rates. When PVCS is caused by venous obstruction, the obstruction must be treated first before gonadal vein embolization and sclerotherapy are considered. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### Pelvic vein embolization: an assessment of the readability and quality of online information for patients [^116fnLTZ]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Undoubtedly, Pelvic Congestion syndrome is a controversial topic in medicine. Within IR, there is no consensus on treatment approach as most of the literature is a collection of techniques and targetable therapeutic sites. Procedures are often not covered by insurance companies due to a lack of high quality literature. It is clear from review of these websites that there is a mix of information for patients to decipher. While some websites do note other treatment options for PCS including analgesia and surgical options, for profit standalone clinics and private surgical centers often only describe Pelvic Vein Embolization as the only effective curative approach with high success rates. The technique of embolization was also variably covered.

There was a diverse difference in web page quality as interpreted by JAMA and DISCERN scores. Professional Societies and Scientific journals showed the highest average scores. Of note scientific journals also scored the lowest FRES result, which signifies a more difficult text for the public to read. The more numerous, understandable web pages in the healthcare provider category, could easily tempt the general public to engage with the lower-quality information of these website providers.

Pages assessing JAMA benchmarks showed that most lacked authorship, references and disclosure. Doctors represented the largest group of authors (46%), however a further 48% of web pages did not report authors which questions the legitimacy of those web pages. The average DISCERN score was 40.8, meaning a "fair" quality which is below what many patients would expect to find when looking for information. As expected, scientific journals showed the highest average DISCERN score, and were the only category to fulfill all JAMA benchmark criteria. However, the target audience for scientific journals is not patients. The medical terminology and "jargon" used may actually make the information inaccessible to patients. Healthcare providers and for-profit organizations had the lowest JAMA and DISCERN scores, which suggests the provision of limited amounts of information to emphasize their own particular interests. An area all web pages could improve upon is HONcode certification.

### Safety, efficacy, and prognostic factors in endovascular treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome [^1156STUy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter embolization using coils for treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) and to elucidate prognostic factors for clinical success.

Methods

Data were retrospectively analyzed from 113 women with PCS who underwent endovascular embolization of ovarian and pelvic varicose veins at Hospital Clínico Universitario, Zaragoza, Spain between January 2001 and January 2011. Pain score was evaluated before and after the procedure via a visual analog scale (VAS). Associated symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, and lower limb symptoms) were also evaluated. Patients were followed up for 12 months.

Results

The technical and clinical success was 100%. At 12 months, 53% of patients had no pelvic pain and 47% reported a reduction in pelvic pain. The average VAS was 7.34 before the procedure and 0.47 at 12 months. Complete relief of pain and associated symptoms was achieved for 37% of patients. Urinary urgency, lower limb symptoms, and vulvar and lower limbs varicosities were prognostic factors related to incomplete treatment success. The global complication rate was low (5/113, 4.4%).

Conclusion

Transcatheter embolization was a safe and effective treatment for PCS. Lower limb symptoms, urinary urgency, and varicosities were associated with incomplete clinical success.

### Embolization to treat pelvic congestion syndrome and vulval varicose veins [^113KoApF]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of embolization for treating the symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Methods

Twenty-one women with PCS who were treated with embolization at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre between 2003 and 2008 were sent a questionnaire about their symptoms before embolization, 2 months after the first embolization, and at the time the survey was conducted.

Results

All patients completed the questionnaire. Two months after the first embolization, 14 (66.7%) women had some degree of improvement of symptoms. Nine (42.9%) patients underwent a second embolization. At the time the survey was conducted, 16 (76.2%) patients had some degree of improvement of symptoms. In addition to improvements in varicose veins and pelvic pain, there was improvement of hemorrhoids.

Conclusion

Embolization of pelvic varicosities may be an effective treatment in a well-selected group of patients with PCS. If there is no improvement of symptoms after initial embolization, a second procedure is unlikely to be effective.

### Radiological evaluation of pelvic venous disorders: a comprehensive review [^114LtBmA]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorder (PVD) is a common gynecological disorder caused by chronic pelvic venous congestion. Clinically, it primarily manifests as lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, dyspareunia, increased menstrual flow, and increased vaginal discharge, though positive physical signs are few. The gynecological examination may reveal bilateral ovarian tenderness. The clinical symptoms of PVD are nonspecific and overlap with those of other gynecological conditions, leading to a high rate of missed diagnoses and making accurate diagnoses challenging. The exact etiology of PVD is not fully understood, and there is currently no comprehensive diagnostic standard. Radiology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of PVD. Through invasive or non-invasive imaging techniques, pelvic lesions can be assessed, providing precise guidance for clinical treatment and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. This review introduces the causes of PVD, the advantages and disadvantages of various non-invasive and invasive imaging examinations, and the key diagnostic points. The aim of this review is to help clinicians and radiologists better understand the disease and improve the accuracy of imaging diagnosis.

### Effectiveness of embolization or sclerotherapy of pelvic veins for reducing chronic pelvic pain: a systematic review [^114VDQRy]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in the presence of dilated and refluxing pelvic veins is often described as pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), although the causal relationship between pelvic vein incompetence and CPP has not been established. Percutaneous embolization is the principal treatment for PCS, with high success rates cited. This study was undertaken to systematically and critically review the effectiveness of embolization of incompetent pelvic veins.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive search strategy encompassing various terms for pelvic congestion, pelvic pain, and embolization was deployed in 17 bibliographic databases, with no restriction on study design. Methodologic quality was assessed. The quality and heterogeneity generally precluded meta-analysis. Results were tabulated and described narratively.

Results

Twenty-one prospective case series and one poor-quality randomized trial of embolization (involving a total of 1,308 women) were identified. Early substantial relief from pain was observed in approximately 75% of women undergoing embolization, and generally increased over time and was sustained. Significant pain reductions following treatment were observed in all studies that measured pain on a visual analog scale. Repeat intervention rates were generally low. There were few data on the impact on menstruation, ovarian reserve, or fertility, but no concerns were noted. Transient pain was common following foam embolization, and there was a < 2% risk of coil migration.

Conclusions

Embolization appears to provide symptomatic relief of CPP in the majority of women and is safe, although the quality of the evidence is low.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^115vvTVg]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Different terms have been used interchangeably to describe the entity which these authors refer to as the Pelvic Venous Congestion Syndrome (PVCS). Characterized by chronic pelvic pain and para-metrial tenderness caused by dilatation of the ovarian and/or pelvic veins, PVCS has been described as the chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), female varicocele and pelvic venous congestion (PVC). Pelvic vascular insufficiency (PVI) is used to describe patients where the aetiology of PVCS is incompetent or absent gonadal vein valves.

The varied terminology and continued dispute regarding the existence of pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) has consequences for methods of diagnosis and treatment (Khilnani; Campbell et al.). In an attempt to resolve this controversy, Meissner et al. published The Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology (SVP) classification of pelvic venous disorders (Meissner et al.). This classification, defines three domains Symptoms (S), Varices (V) and Pathophysiology (P). This latter domain encompasses anatomy (A), hemodynamic (H) and aetiologic (E) features, so that an individual's classification is designated SVP AHE. In this classification PeVDs occur in four anatomic zones. The 4 th zone is classified within the internationally recognised CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic physiologic) system which exists for classifying lower extremity venous disorders. This system improves communication diagnosis, management and research (Lurie et al.)although it's utility in the clinical setting and in determining treatment has yet to be determined. The reader is referred to the excellent graphical abstracts for both systems (Meissner et al; Lurie et al.) Fig. 1.

Constitutional, mechanical, inflammatory, hormonal, neural, psychosomatic and vascular aetiologies have all been postulated for PVCS (Hobbs). Anxiety and depression in this group of women has long been recognized with much debate as to whether this cause or effect (Beard et al.). PVCS occurs as a result of primary intrinsic venous abnormalities such as absence of valves and venous incompetence, and secondary to mechanical factors causing venous obstruction including Nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes.

### A randomized trial of endovascular embolization treatment in pelvic congestion syndrome: fibered platinum coils versus vascular plugs with 1-year clinical outcomes [^1176C6Kz]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare safety and efficacy of vascular plugs (VPs) and fibered platinum coils (FPCs) for embolization in pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Materials and Methods

A randomized, prospective, single-center study enrolled 100 women with PCS from January 2014 to January 2015. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, and embolization was performed with FPCs (n = 50) or VPs (n = 50). Mean age of patients was 42.7 years ± 7.60, and mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for pelvic pain before treatment was 7.4 ± 7.60. Primary outcome (clinical success at 1 y using a VAS), number of devices, procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses, costs, and complications were compared, and participants were followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

Clinical success and subjective improvement were not significantly different at 1-year follow-up (89.7% for FPCs vs 90.6% for VPs; p = 0.760). Mean number of devices per case was 18.2 ± 1.33 for FPCs and 4.1 ± 0.31 for VPs (P < .001). Three FPCs and 1 VP migrated to pulmonary vasculature approximately 3–6 months after the embolization procedure; all were retrieved without complications. The FPC group had a significantly longer fluoroscopy time (33.4 min ± 4.68 vs 19.5 min ± 6.14) and larger radiation dose (air kerma 948.0 mGy ± 248.45 vs 320.7 mGy ± 134.33) (all P < .001).

Conclusions

Embolization for PCS resulted in pain relief in 90% of patients; clinical success was not affected by embolic device. VPs were associated with decreased fluoroscopy time and radiation dose.

### Endovascular intervention for pelvic congestion syndrome is justified for chronic pelvic pain relief and patient satisfaction [^116FSkEp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is difficult to diagnose, poorly understood, and often confused with other causes of chronic pelvic pain. Thus, gonadal vein reflux, its relation to lower extremity venous insufficiency (LEVI), and treatment remains controversial to physicians and payors. We present our experience with endovascular PCS treatment and hypothesize that properly selected patients can realize significant improvement.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients treated for PCS at our institution from 2008 to 2012 was performed. Diagnosis was made clinically by the presence of pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and/or perineal varicosities. Clinical parameters, procedural details, and follow-up were reviewed. A questionnaire including a visual analog scale was sent to patients.

Results

Diagnosis was made in 15 women (mean age, 36 years; mean parity, two). All had pelvic pain, 6 had dyspareunia, 14 had perineal varicosities, and 10 had concomitant LEVI. Fourteen had gonadal vein reflux (mean diameter, 7.4 mm) and pelvic varicosities at angiography and had coiling (n = 12) and/or Amplatzer plug (St. Jude Medical, Inc, St. Paul, Minn) (n = 4). One patient had stenting of a stenotic left common iliac vein. All patients with concomitant LEVI had successful appropriate treatment. Eight patients completed the questionnaire at a mean follow-up of 4 years. The mean pelvic pain score went from 9.375 to 1.875 post-procedure (P < .0001; Student t-test). Mean dyspareunia score went from 8.875 to 1.5 (P < .0001). Mean perineal varicosity pain score went from 9.285 to 1.285 (P < .0001). Two patients had recurrence with a mean pelvic pain score of 4.5 at a mean 21 months. On a five-point Likert scale, all patients were satisfied (one) or extremely satisfied (seven) with treatment.

Conclusions

Endovascular PCS treatment offers excellent pelvic pain relief and patient satisfaction. Women with pelvic pain, dyspareunia, or perineal varicosities with gonadal vein reflux and pelvic varicosities or iliac vein stenosis should not be denied treatment. A significant number may have concomitant LEVI and should be screened accordingly.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^115FbvmH]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as 'pain symptoms perceived to originate from the pelvic organs typically lasting more than 6 months. It is often associated with negative cognitive, behavioural, sexual and emotional consequences as well as with symptoms suggestive of lower urinary tract, sexual, bowel, pelvic floor, myofascial or gynaecological dysfunction' (Pain).

CPP is estimated to affect 10 million women worldwide, up to 7 million of whom do not seek medical assistance (Perry). It is thought to account for up to 10–20% of all gynaecology outpatient appointments, and is an indication for 20–33% of all diagnostic laparoscopies. CPP has a population prevalence of 15% in women aged 18–50 years, in 61% of cases the aetiology of the pain is unexplained (Perry; Ignacio; Phillips et al; Gynaecological; Mathias et al.).

Causes of CPP include endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, musculoskeletal disorders, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, pelvic venous congestion syndrome and psychological factors.

In 1857 French anatomist and surgeon, Louis Alfred Richet was the first to observe an association between chronic pelvic pain and the presence of varicose veins in the utero-ovarian plexus (Richet). The important association of CPP, broad ligament varicocele and multiparity was made by Lefevre (Lefevre). The demonstration of retrograde filling of the left ovarian vein during renal venography led specialists to consider pelvic varicosities to be analogous to scrotal varicoceles in men (Chidekel).

The presence of lower extremity and vulval varices associated with varices in the pudendal, peri-labial, gluteal and posterolateral thigh regions in women referred with CPP/PVCS is recognised to be important for diagnosis and to determine the most appropriate management strategy (Hobbs).

Treatment options

Multiple treatment approaches have been studied and used for the treatment of PVCS and include conservative, psychological, medical, surgical and endovascular options either in isolation or combination.

Chronic debilitating pelvic pain is often accompanied by depression and anxiety. An RCT comparing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and psychotherapy found that 9 months after treatment was ended 72% of women treated with both showed a ≥ 50% reduction in pain score, superior to either treatment being used in isolation (Farquhar).

Medical therapy includes analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), dihydroergotamine, progestins, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and Goserelin acetate (Ignacio; Venbrux). Long term pharmacological therapy is not recommended for treatment of PVCS because of adverse symptoms and limited efficacy (Knuttinen et al.).

Surgical treatment options include laparoscopic ovarian vein ligation, abdominal hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Gargiulo et al. reported 100% symptom remission in 23 women 12 months following laparoscopic trans-peritoneal ovarian vein ligation (Gargiulo et al.).

In a study in which women with PVCS who had not responded to medication were randomised to either embolization, or hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy with HRT or hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy embolization was found to be significantly more effective (p < 0.05) at reducing pain than the other two methods (Chung and Huh).

Hysterectomy may be offered when all other treatments have failed but may not be curative, 22–33% of women may continue to suffer pain (Drife; Stovall et al; Beard).

For over 20 years, pelvic vein embolization (PVE) and most commonly ovarian vein embolization, has been performed principally for pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVC). Evidence remains poor for its efficacy, and although initially anecdotal by way of case reports and small series, data is accumulating in larger series. There remains, however, a lack of robust evidence of its effectiveness, and this partly reflects the challenges of actually making the diagnosis clinically and radiologically, as well as the difficulty in assessing outcome. For PVC, symptomatic response is usually subjective but visual analogue scales (or variations thereof) have most often been used to attempt to identify a more objective outcome.

It may be argued that PVE is an established procedure that has been awaiting a significant clinical problem, and most interventional radiology suites do not perform the procedure in significant numbers. Increasingly, however, and over the last 10 years, more and more patients are being referred for the PVE, by vascular surgeons and other phlebologists, with pelvic venous reflux communicating with lower limb varicosities, and felt to be a significant or indeed the only cause of these veins.

Lower limb varicosities are typically associated with variable incompetence of the greater and lesser saphenous veins occasionally with perforating vein dysfunction.

Although surgery is effective in eliminating or reducing lower limb varicose veins, recurrent varices after surgery (REVAS) ranges between 20% and 80% of patients between 5 and 20 years after initial surgery, depending on the definition of recurrence.

The commonest explanation of varicose vein recurrence in the lower limbs is neovascularization. However, a more likely explanation is the development of collateral veins between the pelvis and lower limbs. Indeed, this is supported by growing evidence that primary or adjunctive treatment by PVE allows for the successful treatment of symptomatic lower limb venous recurrences. Such a collateral network of veins has previously been described and may be demonstrated by catheter venography with incompetence confirmed by 'functional' duplex sonography. It has also been reported that no more than 45% of these recurrences occur in the region of the greater saphenous vein suggesting reflux from pelvic veins as the cause.

### Endovascular treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome: visual analog scale (VAS) long-term follow-up clinical evaluation in 202 patients [^115ypPxL]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical outcome and patients' satisfaction after a 5 year follow-up period for pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) coil embolization in patients who suffered from chronic pelvic pain that initially consulted for lower limb venous insufficiency.

Methods

A total of 202 patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain were recruited prospectively in a single center (mean age 43.5 years; range 27–57) where they were being treated for lower limb varices. Inclusion criteria were: lower limb varices and chronic pelvic pain (> 6 months), > 6 mm pelvic venous caliber in ultrasonography, and venous reflux or presence of communicating veins. Both ovarian and hypogastric veins were targeted for embolization. Pain level was assessed before and after embolotherapy and during follow-up using a visual analog scale (VAS). Technical and clinical success and recurrence of leg varices were studied. Patients completed a quality questionnaire. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months and every year for 5 years.

Results

Technical success was 100%. Clinical success was achieved in 168 patients (93.85%), with complete disappearance of symptoms in 60 patients (33.52%). Pain score (VAS) was 7.34 ± 0.7 preprocedural versus 0.78 ± 1.2 at the end of follow-up (P < 0.0001). Complications were: groin hematoma (n = 6), coil migration (n = 4), and reaction to contrast media (n = 1). Twenty-three cases presented abdominal pain after procedure. In 24 patients (12.5%), there was recurrence of their leg varices within the follow-up. The mean degree of patients' satisfaction was 7.4/9.

Conclusions

Coil embolization of PCS is an effective and safe procedure, with high clinical success rate and degree of satisfaction.

A further systematic review of 14 studies which examined outcomes of 994 interventions in 828 patients, 979 initial ovarian and iliac interventions (some as staged procedures) were followed by 14 repeat interventions for recurrence failure. Average follow up was 36.1 (1–288) months, clinical improvement was recorded in 68.3–100% of patients (Brown).

A concern with any intervention involving the reproductive system in women is the potential impact on future fertility. A small study of 12 women reported that 66.7% (8 women) became pregnant following the procedure, 6 progressing to a live birth. They also noted that there were no differences in pre-and three months post-embolization of LH and FSH levels (p < 0.05) (Liu et al.). Other small case series have reported pregnancies and live births following OVE (Perry; Xu et al; and Yang et al.). OVE has not demonstrated any hindrance or reduction in female reproductive ability.

Specific Considerations Managing Pelvic Venous Congestion Compared to Leg Varicosities of Pelvic Venous Origin

Clinically, it is clear that the spectrum of symptoms and physical signs in the two main patient groups with pelvic venous incompetence, i.e. PVC syndrome and lower limb varicose veins a priori or presenting as REVAS, is wide with considerable overlap. Radiologically, they are difficult to separate.

Empirically, investigators may think that PVC would be most often associated with incompetent ovarian, pudendal and other parametrial branches, whilst pelvic varices would be likely associated with refluxing obturator, circumflex and round ligament branches. However, the body of evidence suggests that it is not as simple as that. Scultetus described three clinical presentations in an overview of 'female pelvic venous syndrome' — vulval varices without PVC symptoms, medial and posterior thigh varicosities associated with ovarian venous incompetence, and gluteal varicosities with vulval varices usually caused by internal iliac vein incompetence. Experienced operators agree that the anatomy is so variable and pelvic venous incompetence so complex, and therefore, recommendations for treatment cannot be given.

### Endovascular treatment of pelvic venous congestion syndrome in nulliparous patients-preliminary results of 10 Years of experience [^1156RbJA]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP), defined as pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease, affects over 10 million women worldwide and accounts for up to 20% of all gynecological appointments. Pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of venous disorders, including nutcracker syndrome, May-Thurner syndrome, and pelvic venous congestion syndrome (PVCS), which may result in CPP. PVCS is characterized by the dilation and dysfunction of the ovarian veins or intrapelvic venous plexuses, resulting in slow flow and reflux. Although it can occur at any time in a woman's life, PVCS is diagnosed most frequently in multiparous women as a result of increased vascular volume and vessel dilatation during pregnancy. Other risk factors, including genetic predispositions, anatomical abnormalities, and hormonal factors, are hypothesized to take part in the pathophysiology of PVCS in nulliparous patients.

This article aimed to present a decade of experience with minimally-invasive treatment of nulliparous patients with PVCS and to review the currently available literature.

### Transcatheter ovarian vein embolization using coils for the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome [^111iaHba]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of ovarian vein embolization using coils for pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), a common cause of chronic pelvic pain in multiparous women.

Methods

Between November 1998 and June 2005, 67 patients were diagnosed with PCS and underwent ovarian vein coil embolization. Through medical records and telephone interviews, the pre-embolization pain level and post-embolization pain control were assessed. In addition, in those cases where pain persisted after embolization or where patients were dissatisfied with the procedure, additional treatments and subsequent changes in pain scores were also analyzed. Evaluation after coil embolization was performed within 3–6 months (n = 3), 6 months to 1 year (n = 7), 1–2 years (n = 13), 2–3 years (n = 7), 3–4 years (n = 7), 4–5 years (n = 13), or 5–6 years (n = 17).

Results

Among a total of 67 patients, 82% (55/67) experienced pain reduction after coil embolization, were satisfied with the procedure, and did not pursue any further treatment. Twelve patients (18%, 12/67) responded that their pain level had not changed, or had become more severe. Among them, 9 patients were treated surgically and the remaining 3 patients remained under continuous drug therapy.

Conclusion

Ovarian vein embolization using coils is a safe and effective therapeutic method for treatment of PCS. It is thought that surgical treatment should be considered in cases where embolization proves ineffective.

Endovascular management

OVE is recommended by the Society of Vascular Surgery with a 2B level of evidence: 'We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with coil embolization, plugs, or trans-catheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together' (Gloviczki).

Transcatheter embolization

Following the initial report in 1993 of ovarian vein embolization (OVE) for the treatment of a patient with CPP/PPS secondary to PVCS the technique has evolved to become the mainstay of treatment for this condition (Edwards et al.). Embolization is preceded by selective ovarian and iliac venography to delineate the anatomy and identify all relevant vessels and collateral pathways (Kennedy and Hemingway; Jacobs). Contraindications include active pelvic infection, severe contrast medium allergy, coagulopathy and pregnancy.

Patients assessed as suitable for consideration for OVE by the MDT must undergo pre-procedure consultation. At our institute, this occurs alongside the TV ultrasound assessment. A patient information leaflet is provided and procedural risks together with the rate of recurrence, failure to improve symptoms and coil migration are explained. A second consultation is arranged to ensure the patient has considered the options and wishes to proceed.

Patients are required to be nil by mouth. It is a requirement that someone to accompany them home and stays with them for 24 h following sedation (sedo-analgesia). A proposed patient pathway is described in Table 1.

Table 1
Provides a suggested patient pathway for the management of patients with PVCS

Technique (Venbrux; Lopez)

The patient is admitted to the IR Day-case facility and informed consent obtained. Pregnancy should be excluded in women of childbearing age.

The WHO safety checklist is utilized and IV conscious sedation (e.g. fentanyl and midazolam) is readily available. The patient's vital signs are monitored.

The procedure is undertaken under sterile conditions employing local anaesthesia for venous access, under ultrasound guidance. Right internal jugular vein (IJV) or the common femoral vein (CFV) are both suitable access options. There is a preference for the RIJV approach as this offers a 'downhill' approach to the ovarian and pelvic veins. Other access points such as brachial and subclavian veins have also been used but have not shown to be superior to the IJV or CFV approach (Lopez).

### Comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of endovascular and endoscopic interventions on the gonadal veins in the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome [^1128WjFf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Comparison of the efficacy and safety of endovascular and endoscopic interventions on the gonadal vein in the treatment of patients with pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Methods

We evaluated the treatment outcomes in 95 patients with PCS who underwent endovascular embolization of gonadal veins (EEGV) (group 1, n = 67) or endoscopic resection of the gonadal veins (ERGV) (group 2; n = 28). A comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of EEGV and ERGV in the treatment of PCS included assessments of their effects on pelvic venous pain, pelvic venous reflux, diameter of the pelvic veins, and restoration of daily activity, as well as treatment safety assessment. Clinical examinations and ultrasound studies of the pelvic veins were repeated at 1, 10, and 30 days, and 36 months after EEGV and ERGV. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale and the Von Korff questionnaire.

Results

A decrease in pelvic venous pain intensity was observed at 3.6 ± 1.4 days after EEGV and 2.5 ± 0.8 days after ERGV (P = 0.49 between the groups). At 1 month after the intervention, a complete relief of pelvic pain was reported by 52 and 25 patients in the EEGV and ERGV groups, respectively. The rates of valvular incompetence of the uterine veins were decreased from 85% in both groups at baseline to 3% in group 1 and 0% in group 2 at 36 months after the intervention, respectively. In the early postprocedural period, pain in the femoral or jugular vein puncture site was reported by eight patients (12%) who underwent EEGV (2.2 ± 0.7 scores). Postembolization syndrome was diagnosed in 13 patients (19.4%). After ERGV, all patients experienced pain in the area of the surgical wound, with a severity of 3.9 ± 0.5 scores. Hematoma at the puncture site of the main vein was observed in 6% of patients after EEGV. Protrusion of coils was identified in three patients (4.5%). The VTE incidence was four times greater in group 1 vs group 2 (14 vs 3 patients; P < .05). The relative risk of this complication after EEGV was 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.146–1.732). In two patients (7.1%) after the bilateral laparoscopic resection of the gonadal veins, an ileus developed. No complications of anesthesia were observed in either group.

Conclusions

Endovascular and endoscopic techniques for decreasing blood flow through the gonadal veins are effective and safe in treating the PCS. The obvious advantages of EEGV are minimal injury and possibility to perform procedure under local anesthesia. The ERGV is associated with at least similar and, in some cases, even superior outcomes, in the terms of significantly (P < .05) shorter time to the postprocedural pain relief and avoiding postembolization syndrome.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^113zj7CA]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) refers to a symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV) as it passes either between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta ("classic" or "anterior nutcracker") or posteriorly between the aorta and the spine as an anatomical variant ("posterior nutcracker"). Patients typically exhibit left flank pain, hematuria and proteinuria and may develop secondary gonadal vein insufficiency as a result of collateral formation. The term "nutcracker syndrome" should be limited to symptomatic patients since a physiological tapering of the left renal vein in its aortomesenteric portion can be frequently observed in asymptomatic and, in particular, slender patients. This imaging finding is commonly referred to as "nutcracker phenomenon". NCS poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and uncertainties regarding optimal treatment. In this article, we describe our therapeutic approach for patients with suspected NCS exemplified by four illustrative cases, with a focus on concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

### Diagnosis and management of pelvic venous disorders in women [^113mb2Db]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous reflux and obstruction can lead to chronic pelvic pain and extra-pelvic varicosities. This paper will discuss the contemporary understanding of this pathophysiology and its clinical manifestations. It will review evidence-based clinical and imaging criteria of pelvic venous disorders, data supporting benefit from venous interventions, criticisms of the available data and highlight evidence research gaps that exist. Finally, it will argue that comparative outcomes research utilizing standardized patient selection for embolization and stenting, embolization treatment strategies that eliminate the pelvic varices (at least to start), and clinically relevant outcome measures are necessary to establish the benefit of vascular treatments.

### Embolization of incompetent pelvic veins for the treatment of recurrent varicose veins in lower limbs and pelvic congestion syndrome [^111QsNDY]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We present our experience with embolization of incompetent pelvic veins (IPV) in women with recurrence of varicose veins (VV) in lower limbs, as well as symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), after first surgery. In addition, we evaluated the effects of embolization in decreasing the symptoms of VV before surgery as well as its effects on PCS symptoms.

Materials and Methods

We included 10 women who had consulted a vascular surgeon because of recurrent VV in lower limbs after surgery. All of these patients were included in the study because they also had symptoms of PCS, probably due to IPV. In patients who had confirmed IPV, we performed embolization before a second surgery. VV and PCS were assessed before and at 3 months after embolization (before the second surgery) using a venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and a visual analog pain scale (VAS), respectively. Patients were controlled between 3 and 6 months after embolization. Paired Student t test analysis was used for comparing data before and after embolization.

Results

Fifteen vein segments in 10 women were suitable for embolization. There was a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of VCSS after embolization, and recurrence of VV was not detected within a period of 6 months. There was also significant (p < 0.01) relief of chronic pelvic pain related to PCS evaluated using VAS at 3 months after embolization.

Conclusion

Embolization decreases the risk of VV recurrence after surgery and also improves PCS symptoms in women with VV in lower limbs and IPV.

Pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) (i.e., pelvic congestion syndrome) — definition, diagnosis, and treatment: PeVD is a venous insufficiency disorder that primarily affects women, with dilation and dysfunction of ovarian or internal iliac veins resulting in slow blood flow and reflux, and PeVD can be described by the Symptoms‑Varices‑Pathophysiology (SVP) classification. PeVD is often misdiagnosed due to nonspecific symptoms of pelvic pain after prolonged periods of sitting/standing, after intercourse, and after the first days of menstruation, and diagnosing PeVD can be challenging due to symptom overlap with other conditions. Diagnostic procedures include pelvic ultrasound, CT, MRI, or venography, while imaging procedures can present challenges among patients with obesity. Treatment options may include hormonal therapy, nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs, and micronized flavonoid fraction; elevation of the legs, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged sitting or standing may help, and other treatments include endovascular embolization to block or close off the affected veins.

### Pelvic congestion syndrome due to central venous outflow obstruction: a single-center experience with May-Thurner and nutcracker syndromes [^113TVEs8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) due to central venous outflow obstruction (CVOO) such as May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) and nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a significant cause of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women. This study aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, and outcomes of interventional treatments in patients with PCS with MTS and/or NCS.

Methods

This retrospective study included the data of consecutive female patients diagnosed with PCS from 2019 to 2024 in our institution. The collected patient data included age, CPP duration, imaging-diagnosed causes (MTS, NCS, or both), procedure type performed (bilateral iliac vein balloon angioplasty, stent placement, left renal vein balloon angioplasty, left ovarian vein embolization), and use of intraoperative ultrasound. Outcomes assessed included changes in pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]), analgesic use, and quality of life (QOL). Included patients' preoperative and postoperative outcomes were compared statistically using nonparametric tests.

Results

Data of 45 women were included (mean age, 40.9years; median duration of CPP, 3years), with 37.8% diagnosed with MTS alone and 53.3% with both MTS and NCS. Among these, 22 had undergone bilateral iliac vein balloon angioplasty, nine (40.9%) had received stent placement, and nine (40.9%) had received embolization of left ovarian vein additionally. NRS pain scores and postoperative analgesic use were significantly reduced and QOL improvement increased (all P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Interventions for PCS due to CVOO yield significant symptom relief and QOL improvements. Embolization may offer additional benefits in enhancing QoL in this patient population.

### Beyond hemostasis: spectrum of gynecologic and obstetric indications for transcatheter embolization [^111jAX9c]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous vascular embolization is a useful therapeutic option for a wide range of gynecologic and obstetric abnormalities. Transcatheter embolization procedures performed with the use of radiologic imaging for guidance are minimally invasive and may obviate surgery, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality and safeguarding the patient's future fertility potential. To integrate this treatment method optimally into patient care, knowledge is needed about the clinical indications for therapeutic embolization, the relevant vascular anatomy, technical considerations of the procedure, and the potential risks and benefits of embolization. The most well-known and well-studied transcatheter embolization technique for treating a gynecologic-obstetric condition is uterine fibroid embolization. However, the clinical indications for transcatheter embolization are much broader and include many benign gynecologic conditions, such as adenomyosis and arteriovenous malformations, as well as intractable bleeding due to inoperable advanced-stage malignancies. Uterine artery embolization may be performed to prevent or treat bleeding associated with various obstetric conditions, including postpartum hemorrhage, placental implantation abnormality, and ectopic pregnancy. Embolization of the uterine artery or the internal iliac artery also may be performed to control pelvic bleeding due to coagulopathy or iatrogenic injury, and ovarian vein embolization has been shown to be effective for the management of pelvic congestion syndrome. The article discusses these and other gynecologic and obstetric indications for transcatheter embolization, provides detailed descriptions of imaging findings before and after embolization, and reviews procedural techniques and outcomes.

### The transbrachial venous approach for pelvic congestion syndrome embolization: an easy way to outpatient procedure [^111e8KGx]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a frequent finding in adult women and transcatheter embolization of dilated and refluxing veins is the treatment of choice. The procedure can be performed through different venous accesses such as the transfemoral, transjugular, and the transbrachial access. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the transbrachial approach for transcatheter embolization in this pathology in 201 women. Advantages and disadvantages of this access were discussed.

Methods

Between January 2007 and October 2020, female patients who underwent transcatheter embolization for PCS were selected. Embolization procedural details such as venous access sites and embolized veins were collected.

Results

Two hundred and one patients were selected for pelvic vein embolization due to PCS. The basilic vein was punctured in 103 patients (51.2%), the cephalic vein was chosen in 76 patients (37.8%) and deep brachial veins in 19 (9.6%). Technical success was observed in 198 (98.5%) cases. Only one major adverse effect was registered; one patient presented with hematoma of the arm that could be managed conservatively.

Conclusion

The transbrachial venous approach for PCS embolization is safe, effective and minimal invasive. It provides a significant patient comfort, has a low complication rate and can be performed on an outpatient basis.

### Controversies in treating nutcracker syndrome [^116nWG9Y]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment modalities

Several modalities are available for treating NCS, including conservative and invasive procedures (Table 1). Conservative management is frequently recommended for pediatric patients or those exhibiting mild symptoms, as it is believed that with growth and weight gain over time, the compression of the veins may be alleviated — approximately 75% of mild to moderate cases resolved symptoms after conservative therapy. However, in symptomatic or severe cases, invasive intervention might be indicated.

LRV Left renal vein

Surgical interventions: open and laparoscopic approaches

LRV transposition, the repositioning of the LRV to relieve pressure, is considered the standard of care and provides immediate and long-term relief. Multiple case series indicate that LRV transposition alleviates symptoms in roughly 80% of affected individuals. In persistent symptoms, renal autotransplantation is the subsequent therapy option. Philip et al. conducted a study on renal autotransplantation as a conclusive treatment in 105 patients, reinforcing its efficacy in refractory cases. Transposition of gonadal veins is performed in selected cases to reduce symptoms of pelvic congestion (Fig. 3). Furthermore, new methods are being developed. A recent study from 2020 by a group of authors from China described the successful use of a 3D-printed polyether ether ketone (PEEK) extravascular stent in 28 adolescent patients, illustrating the possibility of personalized solutions for specific cases. More recently, this type of extravascular stent was implanted in an adolescent from Europe, which was published in 2022. This development highlights the need for a stent design methodology tailored to particular anatomical and pathological conditions.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^111GsA6r]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Management

Management of PVCS including diagnosis, investigation and treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach involving gynaecologists, vascular surgeons, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, urologists, neurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists (Ignacio; Cordts et al; Osman et al; Drife).

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of PVSC /PVI is based on the clinical history, presentation, and physical examination and imaging investigations. Patients are usually, although not exclusively, pre-menopausal and multiparous. PVCS is characterized by chronic pelvic pain of more than six months duration with no evidence of inflammatory disease. Pain of variable intensity may be uni- or bilateral but is usually asymmetric, is worse premenstrually, exacerbated by walking, standing, and fatigue. Post coital ache (65%), dysmenorrhea (66%) and dyspareunia (71%), bladder irritability and rectal discomfort are common (Taylor; Beard; Kuligowska et al.). Under-diagnosis can lead to anxiety and depression (Hobbs). Beard et al. observed that post-coital ache and/or ovarian point tenderness, occurring in 86% of their series, were strong discriminators in favour of PVCS demonstrating 94% sensitivity and 77% specificity (Beard et al; Beard).

Not all women with PVCS have typical pelvic pain, they may present with recurrent lower extremity varicose veins or hip pain (Phillips et al.). A case of persistent genital arousal, an under-recognised and distressing condition, was found to have PVCS which was successfully treated with OVE (Thorne and Stuckey).

Investigations

Investigations include laparoscopy, non-invasive and invasive imaging techniques.

Laparoscopy

Laparoscopy is commonly undertaken in the investigation of women presenting with CPP. Beard et al. found dilated veins and vascular congestion in the broad ligament and ovarian plexus in 91% of women examined laparoscopically for CPP with no other pelvic pathology (Beard et al.). Whilst laparoscopy is excellent for identifying other pelvic pathology that may cause CPP, because the patient is supine and CO₂ is insufflated, varices may be compressed and the diagnosis of PVCS masked in as many as 86–90% of cases (Ignacio).

### Pelvic vein embolization: an assessment of the readability and quality of online information for patients [^115c5syk]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In an ever-expanding technological age, there is a tendency for people to turn to the internet for information and advice on facets of everyday life including healthcare information (Marton and Wei). Poor quality information can negatively influence patient decision making outside of the doctor-patient consultation as there is a broad range of health information ranging from patient experience discussed in online forums to more esoteric scientific journals (Papen).

Interventional Radiology (IR) has revolutionized treatment for a wide range of conditions, including pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) by offering pelvic vein embolization as a treatment. While pelvic vein embolization can offer a high success rate of symptom relief (Brown et al.) it should be noted that treatment of PCS is a controversial area.

The primary purpose of this study was to assess the readability and quality of online information for patients with regard to pelvic vein embolization using a variety of online instruments and quality measures. Pelvic congestion syndrome was chosen because it is controversial and quality information would help patients navigate the problem and inform themselves. A secondary aim was to assess the information provided by large English-speaking IR societies such as the Cardiovascular and Interventional Society of Europe (CIRSE), the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) and the British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR).

### Venous angioplasty and stenting improve pelvic congestion syndrome caused by venous outflow obstruction [^115CSo5G]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is widely thought to be due to ovarian or internal iliac vein reflux. This report of a retrospective review of treatment of nonthrombotic common iliac vein (CIV) or inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction with relief of symptoms demonstrates an often overlooked pathologic process. Stent placement is evaluated as an effective treatment of PCS due to venous obstruction even if observed left ovarian vein (OV) reflux is left untreated.

Methods

Records from two institutions were reviewed for patients with nonthrombotic venous outflow obstruction and symptoms of PCS severely affecting quality of life. The patients were evaluated with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and intravascular ultrasound before stent placement. From January 2008 through May 2013, 19 patients were treated with stents for severe venous outflow obstruction. Although seven patients also were found to have OV reflux, only one of these was treated with left OV coil occlusion.

Results

Whereas 10 of the 19 patients presented with a chief complaint of lower extremity pain, edema, or varicose veins, all patients described their pelvic symptoms as their dominant complaint. Ultrasound and CT suggested moderate to severe compression of the left CIV in 18 patients and a high-grade stenosis of the suprarenal IVC in one patient. Venography showed outflow obstruction with pelvic collaterals, and intravascular ultrasound confirmed focal severe stenosis of the involved vein. Follow-up of 1 to 59 months (median, 11 months) revealed complete resolution of pelvic pain in 15 of 19 patients and of dyspareunia in 14 of 17 sexually active patients. Of the 15 patients who experienced left lower extremity pain or edema before treatment, 13 experienced complete resolution after treatment. Imaging follow-up by ultrasound or CT showed 16 of the stents to be widely patent, with 3 minor asymptomatic stenoses.

Conclusions

Nonthrombotic obstruction of the left CIV or IVC is an underappreciated cause of PCS. Venous angioplasty and stenting provide excellent short-term results for such patients, with resolution of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia. Venous obstruction should be considered and carefully evaluated in patients presenting with pelvic congestion, and treatment of obstruction alone may solve the patient's symptoms.

Computed tomography

Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) is commonly undertaken in the evaluation of women with CPP. A study of the CT and MR appearances of pelvic varices, characterized their appearances as dilated tortuous para uterine tubular structures extending laterally in the broad ligament and reaching the pelvic side wall or extending inferiorly to communicate with the paravaginal venous plexus (Coakley et al.).

The following criteria were suggested for diagnosis of pelvic varices: at least 4 ipsilateral tortuous para-uterine veins of varying calibre at least one with a diameter of > 4 mm or an ovarian vein diameter of > 8 mm (Coakley et al.). CT may be of specific value in identifying the Nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes (Osman et al; Szaflarski et al.) but MR should remain the first line of investigation in this cohort due the patient young age and radiation dose.

### Radiologic findings of pelvic venous congestion in an adolescent girl with angiographic confirmation and interventional treatment [^116ASnfF]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

We present a case of pelvic venous congestion in a 13-year-old girl who complained of pelvic pain for 9 months. The diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome was suggested by imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, with classically described imaging findings. The girl underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, where visual inspection demonstrated congested pelvic veins and endometriosis. After removal of endometrial implants, the child's pain persisted and she subsequently underwent venography and embolization of the ovarian veins. We found no literature describing pelvic venous congestion (PVC) in children. Knowledge that PVC exists in children is important, particularly for pediatric radiologists who are imaging patients with complaints of pelvic pain.

Complications

Procedural complications are unusual with overall rates reported as between 2%-3% (Venbrux; Freedman et al; Venbrux). Infection risk is thought to be approximately 1%. Coil migration is reported especially when the internal iliac vein branches are embolized. Coils may migrate to the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation with the potential to cause acute or chronic complications such as arrhythmias and thrombosis (Scott and Cullen). Coils should be snared and retrieved at the time of the procedure. Contrast allergy is rare (< 1%). Puncture related hematoma, thrombophlebitis, vessel perforation, non-target embolization and pneumothorax have been reported.

Post procedural discomfort and pain are managed with appropriate analgesia. Use of NSAIDs may alleviate some of the local discomfort which arises from phlebitis.

Delayed complications include recurrence in 10–40% of cases (Meneses et al.). Recurrence is higher in patient with untreated lower extremity varicosities.

Many of the women undergoing OVE are of childbearing age. Machine parameter should be optimized, tight collimation and experienced operators help to keep the radiation dose low. Lopez (Lopez) reported an effective dose in a large series of cases of 6 mSv.

### Unique case of recurrent pelvic congestion syndrome treated with median sacral vein embolization [^113gkSvF]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is defined as noncyclical pelvic pain or discomfort caused by dilated parauterine, paraovarian, and vaginal veins. PCS is typically characterized by ovarian venous incompetence that may be due to pelvic venous valvular insufficiency, hormonal factors, or mechanical venous obstruction.

Methods

We describe a case of a 38-year-old multiparous female with a history of pelvic pressure, vulvar varices, and dyspareunia. She underwent left gonadal vein coil embolization in 2014 for PCS that lead to symptomatic relief of her pain. Four years later, the patient returned for recurrent symptoms. Magnetic resonance venogram demonstrated dilated pelvic varices. The previously embolized left gonadal vein remained thrombosed, and there was no evidence of right gonadal vein insufficiency. However, catheter-based venography revealed a large, dilated, and incompetent median sacral vein.

Results

Pelvic venography demonstrated left gonadal vein embolization without any evidence of reflux. The right gonadal vein was also nondilated without reflux. Internal iliac venography showed large cross-pelvic collaterals and retrograde flow via a large, dilated median sacral vein. Coil embolization of the median sacral vein resulted in a dramatic reduction of pelvic venous reflux and resolution of symptoms.

Conclusions

Recurrence of PCS can occur after ovarian vein embolization through other tributaries in the venous network. The median sacral vein is a rare cause of PCS. We present an interesting case of a successfully treated recurrent PCS with coil embolization of an incompetent median sacral vein.

### Evaluation of effectiveness of embolization in pelvic congestion syndrome with the new vascular occlusion device (artVentive EOS ™): preliminary results [^114w1wNG]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of PCS depends mainly on the severity of the pain. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are often used, and contraceptives have a role in cases of pain associated predominantly with menstruation. Available studies also describe the use of medroxyprogesterone which alleviates the symptoms in about 40% of patients. Before the advent of interventional radiology techniques (prior to the 1980s), women suffering from PCS were treated surgically with ovarian vein ligation or even subjected to total hysterectomy.

The first ovarian vein embolization was performed by Edwards in 1993. Since then, embolization has become the first-line treatment of PCS due to its low invasiveness and high efficacy. The findings of many prospective studies have demonstrated the efficacy up to 83% of the procedure to be over 48 months without adverse effects, such as returned pain, menstrual disorders, disruption of the hormonal metabolism or reduced fertility. Various embolization techniques have been described to occlude ovarian veins. The most often reported is the use of pushable fibered 0.035″ coils advanced through normal diagnostic catheters. The main drawback of this technique is the need to use many coils, frequently along the whole course of the vein. This is because one coil (or even few) may not give immediate, complete occlusion, especially when ovarian vein is dilated over 10 mm. Thus, authors emphasize the need for additional administration of obliteration agents (i.e. 3% polidocanol). There are also some reports on using microcatheters and platinum microcoils. Such procedures generally are considered more advanced techniques and are more expensive, thus used in more complex anatomy, when conventional techniques have failed.

What interested us in this study was the evaluatation of the possible advantage of immediate ovarian vein occlusion using the new occlusion device (ArtVentive EOS™).

### Evaluation of effectiveness of embolization in pelvic congestion syndrome with the new vascular occlusion device (artVentive EOS ™): preliminary results [^117EjxwT]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to collect confirmatory data in support of the safety and efficiency of the ArtVentive EOS™ for the treatment of the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). This study was based on the OCCLUDE 1 Study Protocol approved by the Local Ethics Committee.

Materials and Methods

A prospective study carried out in June and July 2014 included 12 women aged 21–48 years (mean 31 years) scheduled for PCS embolization using the ArtVentive EOS™. The inclusion criteria were clinical symptoms of PCS documented by transvaginal Doppler ultrasound and pelvic MRI. The pelvic pain was assessed by VAS score from 0 to 10 (0 represents lack of pain and 10 unbearable pain). A decrease in pelvic pain intensity based on the VAS was considered a clinical success.

Results

Successful embolization procedures with ArtVentive EOS™ were performed in 11 out of 12 patients. Nine patients underwent unilateral embolization of the left ovarian vein, and two had bilateral embolization of the ovarian veins. Complete ovarian vein occlusion confirmed by post deployment venography was achieved in all 11 patients. Procedures lasted from 19 to 45 min (average 28 min). Pain intensity decrease was observed in all 11 patients — a decrease of 5.6 points — from 7.3 pre-procedure to 1.6 post-embolization (standard deviation: 0.67). In one case, the left ovarian vein was injured by guide wire manipulation with contrast extravasation — not clinically significant.

Conclusions

The use of ArtVentive EOS™ for occlusion of the ovarian veins in PCS patients is safe and effective.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^112isgn8]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

On angiography, reduced opacification of the central portion of the LRV and presence of collaterals are the main visual indicators for nutcracker phenomenon. Sometimes, resistance can be felt upon catheterization of the LRV, indicative of a stenosis. We found that test inflation of an appropriately sized PTA balloon (8–12 mm) with evidence of a waist may also be helpful in unmasking a structural LRV stenosis and differentiating this from a dynamic vascular compression (Figs. 1 and 4).

The therapeutic approach used in our institution for patients with suspicion of NCS or PCS, which is based on the above rationale and builds on previously published algorithms, is presented in Fig. 6. In patients with typical PCS, we do not routinely perform venography of the LRV prior to and after embolization of the left ovarian vein to rule out concurrent NCS. However, as exemplified by the cases presented in this article, suspicion of NCS should be raised if the patient exhibits symptoms not explained by PCS alone (i.e. renal congestion symptoms), if their symptoms change or deteriorate after gonadal vein embolization or if the patient does not match the typical patient population for PCS (e.g. a nulligravidous female). At first, we were hesitant to embolize the left gonadal vein in PCS patients with suspected concurrent NCS, as closing off one of the main collaterals may aggravate congestion in the LRV, exemplified by case 2. However, even in this patient, there was no increase in the renocaval pressure gradient immediately after left ovarian vein embolization. Therefore, gonadal vein embolization is unlikely to cause acute organ-threatening congestion. In borderline cases, it may be prudent to wait and see whether symptoms are spontaneously resolved, since two-staged embolization and stenting can still be done if necessary.

### Endovascular interventions in the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome caused by May-Thurner syndrome [^115sFqSd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of various endovascular interventions on the clinical manifestations of the pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) caused by May-Thurner syndrome (MTS).

Methods

The study included 12 female patients with PCS caused by MTS. Patients were examined by duplex ultrasound, computed tomography of the pelvic veins, and ovarian and pelvic venography. All 12 patients underwent endovascular stenting of the left common iliac vein (CIV), and 10 of them underwent subsequent endovascular embolization of the left gonadal vein. The indication for stenting was the presence of stenosis (> 50%) of the CIV with clinical symptoms and signs of PCS. Self-expanding stents (Wallstent, 14–16 mm × 60–90 mm; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Mass) were used. Patients with persistent symptoms of PCS after stenting underwent gonadal vein embolization with MReye metal coils (diameter, 10–15 mm; length, 10–20 cm; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind).

Results

Technical success of stenting, namely, the restoration of normal patency of the left CIV, was achieved in 12 patients. In two patients, a stent was displaced toward the inferior vena cava, which required implantation of a second stent. In another patient, the stent was displaced into the inferior vena cava at 6 months after the intervention, which was not associated with any complication during the follow-up period. The mean venous pelvic pain severity score decreased from 7.7 ± 0.8 at baseline to 4.8 ± 0.3 after 1 month and stayed at this level during the 6-month follow-up period. Complete elimination of PCS symptoms at 6 months after stenting was achieved in 2 patients, and 10 patients underwent embolization of the left gonadal vein 6 months after stenting because of persistent pelvic pain.

Conclusions

Endovascular stenting of the left CIV is an effective technique for relieving symptoms of PCS due to MTS in only 16.6% of patients. Stenting of the left CIV in combination with embolization of gonadal veins results in elimination of the signs of PCS in 83.4% of patients. Probably only gonadal vein embolization can be used in the treatment of MTS-related PCS. To confirm this hypothesis, further comparative studies are warranted.

Intercommunicating plexuses from visceral branches of the internal iliac vein include:
Vaginal plexus and uterine plexus draining via the uterine veins, usually three on each side running laterally to drain into the internal iliac vein (IIV). The fundal uterine plexus drains into both the uterine veins and ovarian venous plexus
Vesical plexus
Deep clitoral, labial and inferior rectal veins drain into the internal pudendal and inferior gluteal veins
Rectal branches communicate with the utero-vaginal plexus

The parietal branches of the IIV include the superior and inferior gluteal veins, iliolumbar veins, and the sacral venous plexus and obturator veins which may drain into the external iliac venous system. The pelvic venous system has numerous potential collateral pathways, the reader is referred to a comprehensive pictorial review of these by Zurcher et al. (Zurcher).

The Nutcracker or left renal vein entrapment syndrome refers to compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery. This can result in increased pressure in the left renal vein with reflux into the ovarian vein possibly leading to pelvic varices (Coakley et al.).

May-Thurner syndrome refers to chronic compression of the left iliac vein against the lumbar spine by the overlying right common iliac artery. It can result in chronic deep venous thrombosis which can ultimately divert blood to the left internal lilac vein and give rise to pelvic varices.

### The care of patients with varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^111KAhdJ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum varicose veins guideline — key recommendations include that patients with varicose veins or more severe CVD have history and physical examination complemented by duplex ultrasound scanning of the deep and superficial veins (GRADE 1A), that CEAP classification be used for patients with CVD (GRADE 1A), and that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score be used to assess treatment outcome (GRADE 1B). For symptomatic varicose veins, the guideline suggests compression therapy (GRADE 2C) but recommends against compression therapy as the primary treatment if the patient is a candidate for saphenous ablation (GRADE 1B); it recommends compression therapy as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration (GRADE 1B) and, to decrease recurrence, recommends ablation of incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy (GRADE 1A). For the incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV), it recommends endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) rather than high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee (GRADE 1B), recommends phlebectomy or sclerotherapy to treat varicose tributaries (GRADE 1B), and suggests foam sclerotherapy as an option for the incompetent saphenous vein (GRADE 2C). For perforating vein incompetence, it recommends against selective treatment in simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2; GRADE 1B) but suggests treating pathologic perforating veins — defined as outward flow duration ≥ 500 ms and vein diameter ≥ 3.5 mm — located underneath healed or active ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6; GRADE 2B). For pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices, it suggests treatment with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (GRADE 2B).

### PRACTICE GUIDELINES chronic deep venous obstruction [^114EJpf3]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Pelvic congestion syndrome — iliac vein stenting outcomes: In Hartung's 2012 series, iliac vein stents were placed for arterial compression in 59 patients and for post-thrombotic obstruction in 10 patients, with primary and assisted patency rates at 5 and 10 years of 95% and 100%, respectively. Daugherty and Gillespie reviewed 19 patients with non-thrombotic iliocaval obstruction treated with BA/stenting for pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), in whom 15 of 19 had complete resolution of pelvic pain and 14 of the 17 sexually active patients had complete resolution of dyspareunia; of the 15 with lower extremity pain or edema, 13 reported complete resolution at last follow-up. An expanded 2015 retrospective review of 33 patients treated with iliac vein stenting for severe PCS due to arterial compression reported follow-up for 26 patients was 1 to 83 months, mean 18, and on an analog scale of 0–10, median pain scores improved for pelvic pain from 8 to 2, dyspareunia from 8 to 0, low back pain from 5 to 2, left lower extremity pain from 5 to 2, and right lower extremity pain from 4 to 2; none of the patients reported recurring pelvic symptoms during follow-up and primary patency was 100%.

### The effect of a subsequent pregnancy after ovarian vein embolization in patients with infertility caused by pelvic congestion syndrome [^114iT9dJ]. Academic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

To report the effect of pregnancy on patients who have undergone pelvic vein embolization with pelvic congestion syndrome, which was suspected to be the only cause of infertility.

Material and Methods

Data from a total of 12 women (mean age: 36.5 ± 4.3 years, range: 29–45 years) were collected between May 2013 and June 2016. Transvenous embolization with fibre platinum coils combined with anhydrous alcohol was performed in unilateral or bilateral ovarian veins after the diagnosis of venous varices confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound or pelvic venography. The follow-up time was 2–3 years. The primary outcomes of this study were the technical procedure and clinical effect, especially the pregnancy rate and complications.

Results

The successful embolization rate was 100% with no significant complications during or after embolization. Ovarian vein embolization was performed unilaterally (7/12, 58.3%) or bilaterally (5/12, 41.7%). A total of 66.7% (8/12) of women had a subsequent pregnancy and complete pelvic pain relief, and 33.3% (4/12) of patients had partial pain relief. The numeric pain perception scores improved from 6.7 ± 1.1 to 2.7 ± 1.2 (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Ovarian varices may be associated with infertility in some patients, and embolization of ovarian varices is a safe and effective method for those trying to become pregnant.

### Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: female venous congestive syndromes and endovascular treatment options [^1154JQvv]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective catheterization of the left and right ovarian veins is undertaken with and without provocation such as Valsalva manoeuvre. Ovarian vein cannulation can be achieved with a 5F Multipurpose or a shaped tip catheter such as a Bernstein (Merit Medical, Utah, US) with an 0.035″or 0.038″ lumen based on the type of the coil to be utilised. Some detachable coils will require use of a microcatheter on a 0.018″ platform.

Distal vessel embolization with a sclerosant such as 3% sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STS) can be prepared as a foam using the Tessari method (± balloon occlusion to aid stagnation) or injected as part of the sandwich technique where coil and foam are used in combination (Tessari et al; Xu et al.).

The maximum dose of 3% STS recommended per procedure is 10 ml. STS is often injected in foam state mixed with room air, O₂ or CO₂. The higher concentration of nitrogen in room air poses a potential risk of air embolus and stroke when in Trendelenburg position (Tessari et al.).

The radiolucent property of STS foam can be overcome by filling the dead space of the catheter with contrast and pulsed controlled injection under fluoroscopic guidance. Injecting foam distally can ensure smaller pelvic branches are effectively embolized. This technique followed by coil embolization has offered the best outcomes for patients.

The entire length of the refluxing, incompetent vessel is embolized with MR compatible platinum coils to prevent collateralisation. It is not necessary to tightly pack the coils within the ovarian vein, but sufficient should be deployed to slow the flow, induce thrombosis and block any tributaries. Under-coiling of the ovarian veins can increase probability of recurrence. Oversizing of coils is important to prevent migration. Coil size depends on ovarian vein diameter. Common sizes range 8 mm-20 mm with longer lengths used to cover the entire vein. Distal embolization is with push-able coils however for the more proximal deployment, detachable coils allow for more accurate placement as well as "test" deployment to ensure no migration risk.

If vulvar varices do not resolve or improve consideration can be given to direct percutaneous STS foam sclerotherapy; this should be used as an adjunct to the treatment of reflux not as a stand-alone treatment in isolation (Bookwalter et al.).

Nasser reported a marked association between lower extremity varicose veins (VVs) and PVCS of 92.9% in his series and lower rates of VV recurrence in patients who underwent VV treatment after OVE for PVCS (Nasser et al; Laborda et al; Meneses et al.).

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS), is an uncommon condition that may be found in association with PVCS. Stenting of the common iliac vein (CIV) can provide significant amelioration of symptoms. Ahmed reported a technical success rate of 100% (34 of 34) (Ahmed et al.). No major complications occurred, and 68% of patients (23 of 34) had clinical success with relief of presenting symptoms on follow-up visits. Gavrilov et al. looked at endovascular interventions in the treatment of PVCS caused by MTS (Gavrilov et al.). In a small series stenting CIV was effective in only 16.6% of patients but when combined with embolization of the ovarian veins 83.4% of patients experienced symptom elimination.

The role of embolization of left ovarian vein in presence of Nutcracker syndrome remains controversial with no definite consensus and is beyond the scope of this paper.

### Proximal coil occlusion preceding distal sclerotherapy in patients with pelvic congestion syndrome: a multicenter, retrospective study [^116mFWk3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We investigated the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of proximal coil occlusion preceding distal sclerotherapy (PCODS) for patients with pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

Methods

We performed a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 94 patients with PCS who had undergone PCODS and 53 patients who had undergone standard endovascular embolization (control group) between June 2014 and April 2020. The primary end point was the clinical remission rate and the secondary end points were the operative time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation dose, overall length of coils used per case, and adverse events. The patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

PCODS was successfully performed in 94 patients (100%). The clinical remission rates were significantly higher in the PCODS group than in the control group at 1, 6, and 12 months (P = 0.036, P = 0.032, and P = 0.032). The operative time and total fluoroscopy time were shorter for the PCODS group than for the control group (48.3 ± 5.2 minutes and 37.7 ± 4.4 minutes vs 53.9 ± 4.8 minutes and 42.6 ± 4.1 minutes, respectively; P < .001 for both). The radiation dose was significantly lower in the PCODS group than in the control group (362,634.69 ± 41,533.13 mGy·cm² vs 421,578.30 ± 49,517.93 mGy·cm²; P < .001). The overall length of coils used per case was 19.8 ± 6.0 cm in the PCODS group and 31.7 ± 8.5 cm in the control group (P < .001). Migration of n-butyl cyanoacrylate to the renal vein occurred in two patients in the control group.

Conclusions

We found PCODS was feasible with a higher clinical remission rate and mild adverse effects in patients with PCS.

### Paradigm shift and long-term results in the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic venous disorder [^111nnG22]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recognition of PeVD has increased, yet the use of outdated terms — such as nutcracker syndrome and pelvic congestion syndrome — can oversimplify the condition and complicate our understanding and management. PeVD can present with symptoms like left flank pain, hematuria, CPP, and signs of CVD, including lower limb edema, aching, venous claudication, and vulvar or pelvic varicose veins. These symptoms often overlap with conditions such as recurrent varicose veins, hemorrhoids, benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder and bowel syndromes, endometriosis, and chronic low back pain, potentially leading to underdiagnosis and ineffective treatments.

CPP affects approximately 24% of premenopausal women and is a common reason for gynecological consultations. A case-control study found a strong association between CPP and PeVD, with pelvic vein incompetence in 62% of women with CPP vs 19% of controls (odds ratio, 6.79; 95% confidence interval, 4.11–11.47). Another study reported that women with PeVD experienced higher rates of CPP and reduced health status compared to controls. The prevalence of dilated pelvic veins — a hallmark of PeVD — was 12% among women undergoing imaging, higher in premenopausal (21%) than postmenopausal women (10%), with 18% of those having dilated veins also presenting CPP. In our study, CPP was a key inclusion criterion, with all patients presenting signs or symptoms of CPP or symptomatic varicocele. Notably, 35 women (44.9%) with CVD undergoing iliac vein stenting did not spontaneously report CPP during history taking, despite prior treatments for endometriosis or hysterectomy. Establishing a link between pelvic symptoms and vascular causes remains challenging for both patients and clinicians.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) are rarely considered as a cause of chronic pelvic pain in women being evaluated by nonvascular specialists. A Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation-sponsored Research Consensus Panel addressing this issue identified multiple gaps in the literature and made recommendations to enhance the evidence. Since publication of these recommendations in 2019, significant progress has been made in developing the necessary tools to improve the ability to conduct rigorous clinical studies and advance the evidence supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PeVD. This report summarizes the 5-year impact of the panel's recommendations. The investment made by SIR Foundation to host a Research Consensus Panel on PeVD has facilitated enduring academic productivity related to this clinical issue.

### Identification of outcomes in clinical studies for pelvic venous disorders [^112PSHX9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

A limitation of this scoping review is the inclusion of low numbers of studies looking at less commonly performed treatment modalities. The strategy used to identify unique outcomes meant that unique outcome saturation, which occurred when looking at studies published in 2013, may have missed unique outcomes reported in the earlier literature or those specific to studies of less commonly used treatment modalities. This is especially true, considering that some of the largest PeVD series date back to the 1990s; however, recent papers likely reflect contemporary reporting measures and advances in the understanding and management of pelvic venous disease, making this a more practical approach. Additionally, there is lack of international consensus as per the precise definition, and classification, of PeVD. The review was scoping in nature, and thus imposed no restrictions on the definitions and methods of diagnostic confirmation of PeVD in different studies. Therefore, there inevitably was variability in said definitions. However, this concern in PeVD research is common, the solution to which may be the newly developed Symptoms-Varices-Pathophysiology (SVP) classification, which will potentially allow for homogeneity in the reporting of PeVD research. Only one of the 51 included studies used the SVP classification.

### Identification of outcomes in clinical studies for pelvic venous disorders [^117C35GT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is increasing recognition that health systems need to measure and improve the value of patient care by measuring outcomes. Chronic pelvic pain secondary to pelvic venous insufficiency can have a significant impact on the quality of life (QOL) of women affected. Despite growing recognition, pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs), an important cause of chronic pelvic pain, remain underdiagnosed. Developing a core outcome set (COS) for benchmarking care delivery enhances the standardization of care. However, there is no consensus regarding a standardized minimum set of outcomes for PeVD. We aimed to generate a list of outcomes reported in previous PeVD treatment studies to lay the foundation for developing a COS for PeVD.

Methods

This scoping review was undertaken according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Initially, screening, full-text review and extraction was conducted on studies published between 2018 and 2023. Subsequently, the search was expanded using 1-year intervals, until, over a 1-year interval, no new outcomes were recorded. Closely related outcomes were classified into domains, and domains into three core areas: disease-specific, treatment-related, and QOL-related outcomes.

Results

Of the 1579 records identified, 51 publications were included. From these studies, 108 different outcomes were identified. The median number of outcomes per study was 8 (interquartile range, 6–13). Closely related outcomes were organized into 42 outcome domains, which were then categorized into 3 core outcome areas; 47.6% (20/42) were disease specific, 35.7% (15/42) treatment related, and 16.7% (7/42) were QOL related. Of the 51 included studies, disease-specific outcomes were identified in 96.1% of the studies (49/51), treatment-related outcomes in 94.1% (48/51), and QOL outcomes in only 13.7% (7/51).

Conclusions

There was significant heterogeneity in outcomes reported in PeVD studies. Most PeVD treatment studies evaluated disease-specific and treatment-related outcomes of PeVD, but few reported outcomes that measured the impact on QOL. These findings will inform the next steps in developing a COS for PeVD.

### Role of interventional procedures in obstetrics / gynecology [^113khgks]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

In uterine fibroid embolization (UFE), knowledge of the potential ovarian-uterine anastomoses is important because they provide collateral blood flow that may result in the failure of the UFE or ovarian nontarget embolization. Uterine artery embolization is an alternative treatment of postpartum hemorrhage with 80% to 90% bleeding control and in which fertility can be preserved. Diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome on routine sonographic or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging is often missed. Fallopian tube recanalization allows couples to have unlimited attempts to conceive naturally and avoids the risks (multiple pregnancies, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), and high cost of in vitro fertilization.

### Identification of outcomes in clinical studies for pelvic venous disorders [^113tEvZd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) can have a significant impact on the quality of life (QOL) of women affected and, despite growing recognition, remain underdiagnosed. Although pelvic pain related to pelvic venous insufficiency was first described in the late 19th century, it was not until 1948 that a connection between pelvic varicosities and pelvic pain was formally proposed. The progress in diagnosing and managing the disorder has been impeded, in part owing to the use of historical nomenclature and a lack of diagnostic criteria. Symptoms and signs of PeVD are variable and arise from reflux and/or obstruction within the pelvic venous system. This results in a variety of symptoms, including chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, lower limb venous incompetence, and pelvic origin extrapelvic varices.

Several treatment options based on the underlying venous pathology have been reported, including medical, open surgical, endovascular stenting, and percutaneous embolization therapy. However, owing to variability in the reporting of treatment outcomes between studies, comparing the relative success of these interventions is difficult. This inconsistency creates challenges in making treatment recommendations.

Standardization of a core selection of outcomes and measurement properties in studies is required to overcome this heterogeneity. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement has developed > 40 standard sets of outcomes. These sets aim to enhance individualized care, foster uniformity in reporting clinical studies, enabling comparisons across diverse international settings. Moreover, they empower patients with the ability to make better-informed health care decisions. The first step in developing a core outcome set (COS) is conducting a review of the literature to identify previously reported outcomes. To date, there is no consensus regarding core outcomes and the relevant measurement tools for use in PeVD. This study aimed to generate a list of outcomes reported in all primary research on PeVD, to identify and describe all reported outcomes.

### A review of chronic pelvic pain in women… [^116MMfT9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor A recent Review1 provided a comprehensive summary for the evaluation and management of CPP in women. However, pelvic congestion syndrome, an important cause of CPP, was omitted from the discussion. Pelvic congestion syndrome, an underdiagnosed and underreported cause of CPP, 2 is due to gonadal vein reflux and venous engorgement from either incompetent venous valves or a structural abnormality caused by an obstruction. Rare structural causes of PCS include May-Thurner syndrome, nutcracker syndrome, inferior vena cava thrombus or atresia, and arteriovenous malformation. Garg T, Shrigiriwar A.
