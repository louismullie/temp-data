## Question

Why does abacavir cause lactic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why abacavir can cause lactic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and whether the risk is class-wide or specific to abacavir. Then, I should verify the proposed mitochondrial mechanism and how abacavir fits into that model. Next, I will review clinical risk factors and epidemiology to gauge relative risk. After that, I need to check the clinical presentation and diagnostic thresholds. Finally, I should confirm management principles and reconcile any conflicting data about abacavir's risk profile compared with other NRTIs.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and labeling signal. Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and the FDA labeling for abacavir and its fixed-dose combinations repeatedly warns about lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis as a class toxicity of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir, so the risk is recognized at the class level rather than unique to abacavir per se [^115komXg] [^1128y1BN] [^117WPAEe].

> Now, I need to verify the mechanistic basis. The leading explanation is mitochondrial toxicity from off-target inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma by NRTIs, which impairs mitochondrial DNA replication, reduces oxidative phosphorylation, and forces cells toward anaerobic glycolysis with lactate accumulation; abacavir, like other NRTIs, has been shown to have the potential to incorporate into nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and inhibit host DNA polymerases, supporting this mechanism [^112fNcc9] [^111mFrUT] [^116MqL3C].

> Wait, let me verify abacavir's relative mitochondrial toxicity compared with other NRTIs. Although the class mechanism applies, abacavir is generally considered to have lower mitochondrial toxicity than older thymidine analogs such as stavudine and zidovudine, and contemporary guidelines list abacavir among NRTIs less likely to induce clinically significant mitochondrial dysfunction, which aligns with its continued use in many settings despite the class warning [^114dDjkk] [^115x5fkm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk. I should confirm epidemiology and risk modifiers. Lactic acidosis is rare but can be fatal, with female sex and obesity repeatedly identified as risk factors across NRTI class labeling, and case series and reviews emphasize that most severe cases historically involved stavudine and didanosine rather than abacavir monotherapy, reinforcing that abacavir's relative risk is lower even though the class risk remains nonzero [^115komXg] [^115QBLR1] [^1173KeWR].

> Next, I should review the clinical phenotype to ensure I'm describing the syndrome correctly. The presentation spans from asymptomatic hyperlactatemia to symptomatic lactic acidosis with metabolic acidosis, hepatomegaly with steatosis, myopathy, and multiorgan failure; symptoms are often nonspecific — fatigue, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss — and the syndrome can evolve insidiously, which is why recognition and early intervention are critical [^116MqL3C] [^115x5fkm] [^115komXg].

> I need to check diagnostic thresholds and immediate actions. Severe hyperlactatemia is typically defined as lactate greater than 5 mmol/L, and lactic acidosis requires lactate elevation with low bicarbonate and low pH. Guidelines advise confirming elevated lactate, assessing acid-base status, and discontinuing all NRTIs promptly when severe hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis is suspected, while avoiding routine screening in asymptomatic patients given low positive predictive value and high false-positive rates [^113wCuWW] [^1173KeWR] [^115dnHof].

> Let me consider management principles and make sure I'm aligned with best practice. Core management is immediate cessation of the offending NRTI(s), supportive care with fluids and correction of acid-base disturbances as indicated, and consideration of metabolic cofactors such as thiamine, riboflavin, and L-carnitine, although evidence is largely anecdotal. After recovery, many patients can be safely rechallenged with NRTIs that have lower mitochondrial toxicity, such as abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with close monitoring of lactate if symptoms recur [^115x5fkm] [^111jnyPu] [^112hz3TN].

> But wait, what if the patient is on abacavir and nothing else with high mitochondrial toxicity — does abacavir alone still pose a meaningful risk? I should double-check comparative data. Observational cohorts and case series consistently show that regimens containing stavudine and didanosine carry the highest risk, whereas abacavir-containing regimens have been associated with lower hazard of hyperlactatemia in some analyses, supporting the notion that abacavir's intrinsic mitochondrial toxicity is modest but not zero, hence the persistent class warning despite favorable relative safety [^115dnHof] [^113c7Kbe] [^114dDjkk].

> In summary, abacavir can cause lactic acidosis via the same NRTI class mechanism of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma inhibition leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and anaerobic lactate overproduction. However, abacavir's relative risk is lower than older thymidine analogs, with female sex and obesity as key risk factors, and management hinges on early recognition, confirmation of lactate and acid-base derangement, immediate discontinuation of NRTIs, supportive care, and cautious reintroduction of lower-toxicity NRTIs after recovery [^115komXg] [^112fNcc9] [^115x5fkm].

---

Abacavir can cause lactic acidosis by **mitochondrial toxicity** [^112fNcc9] from inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ [^111mFrUT], leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, and lactate accumulation [^116MqL3C]. Risk is higher with **female sex, obesity, prolonged use, and combination with other NRTIs** (especially stavudine or didanosine) [^115komXg] [^1128y1BN] [^1173KeWR]. Clinical features include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and hepatomegaly with steatosis [^116FLWhD]; management is immediate discontinuation and supportive care [^113wCuWW].

---

## Mechanism of abacavir-induced lactic acidosis

Abacavir-induced lactic acidosis is primarily due to **mitochondrial toxicity** [^notfound]:

- **Mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ inhibition**: Abacavir, like other NRTIs, inhibits mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ, disrupting mitochondrial DNA replication and causing mitochondrial dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Impaired oxidative phosphorylation**: Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces ATP production, forcing cells to rely on anaerobic glycolysis, which increases lactate production [^116MqL3C].

- **Lactate accumulation**: Persistent anaerobic metabolism leads to lactic acidosis, especially in tissues with high energy demands (liver, muscle, brain) [^111PBC3o].

---

## Risk factors for abacavir-induced lactic acidosis

Several factors increase the risk of lactic acidosis with abacavir:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Female sex | Higher incidence reported in women [^115komXg] [^1173KeWR] |
| Obesity | Increased risk with higher BMI [^115komXg] [^1128y1BN] |
| Prolonged therapy | Longer duration increases risk [^115ARcia] |
| Combination with other NRTIs | Especially stavudine or didanosine [^1173KeWR] [^113c7Kbe] |
| Pre-existing liver disease | Hepatic impairment increases risk [^114dDjkk] [^113JRNQD] |

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Lactic acidosis presents with **nonspecific symptoms**, making diagnosis challenging:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and weight loss [^116FLWhD] [^116MqL3C].

- **Signs**: Hepatomegaly, steatosis, elevated lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes [^115komXg] [^111ri7NU].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT may show hepatomegaly and steatosis [^notfound].

---

## Management and prevention

Management of abacavir-induced lactic acidosis includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop abacavir and other NRTIs immediately [^113wCuWW].

- **Supportive care**: Intravenous fluids, bicarbonate therapy, and correction of electrolyte imbalances [^115x5fkm].

- **Monitoring**: Regular clinical and laboratory monitoring for recurrence if NRTIs are reintroduced [^115x5fkm].

Prevention involves **careful patient selection**, avoiding high-risk combinations, and monitoring for early signs of lactic acidosis [^114dDjkk].

---

## Comparison with other NRTIs

Abacavir has a **lower risk of lactic acidosis** than older NRTIs (e.g. stavudine, didanosine) but a higher risk than newer agents (e.g. tenofovir, emtricitabine) [^115dnHof] [^113c7Kbe]. The risk is **class-wide**, reflecting mitochondrial toxicity [^112fNcc9].

---

Abacavir can cause lactic acidosis through **mitochondrial toxicity**, with risk modulated by patient and treatment factors. Recognition and prompt discontinuation are critical to management [^115komXg].

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimes based on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have revolutionized the treatment of AIDS in recent years. Although HAART can successfully suppress viral replication in the long term, it is not without significant toxicity, which can seriously compromise treatment effectiveness. A major toxicity that has been recognized for more than a decade is NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity, which manifests as serious side effects such as hepatic failure and lactic acidosis. However, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial toxicity has hampered efforts to develop novel drugs with better side-effect profiles. This review characterizes the pharmacological mechanisms and pathways that are involved in mitochondrial dysfunction caused by NRTIs, and suggests opportunities for future pharmacological research.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Immune reconstitution syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.

Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

6.3	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.

Body as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.

Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction.

Hepatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.

There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

4. Oral Anti Diabetic Drugs (OADs)

OADs are frequently used in patients with T2DM. The patient with coexistent HIV infection, however, poses a special challenge.

This patient is at greater risk of comorbidity such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis or other opportunistic infections. He or she may have severe insulin resistance. The number of concomitant medications is greater, leading to an increased chance of drug interactions. Because of impaired renal and hepatic function, the risk of adverse events and drug toxicity may be higher. Cachexia and impaired appetite may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal infections and dysfunction may worsen tolerability of various oral drugs, and alter their absorption.

One should therefore choose an OAD regime in patients with diabetes and HIV with great care (Additional file 1).

Metformin is the first line drug of choice in most persons with T2DM, but should be used with caution in HIV.

Though it improves insulin sensitivity, it may not be well tolerated by cachexic patients. Metformin is more likely to cause diarrhea than other drugs

It is contraindicated in renal or hepatic dysfunction, and may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). It should be avoided in combination with drugs such as stavudine, which also increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Abacavir, lamivudine and tenofovir are the least likely drugs to cause elevation of lactate levels.

HIV patients on metformin should be educated about the symptoms of lactic acidosis, including fatigue, weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and arrhythmia. Liver-related symptoms such as tender hepatomegaly, edema, ascites and encephalopathy may occur, but jaundice is uncommon.

Metformin should be avoided in patients with comorbid infection such as tuberculosis, weight loss, cachexia, ketonuria and lipoatrophy. Further reductions in subcutaneous fat can occur with this drug. This in turn, may worsen lipodystrophy seen with HIV, and lead to a deterioration in various metabolic parameters.

### Treatment of lactic acidosis: appropriate confusion [^112hz3TN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis (LA) is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. There have been major recent advances in our understanding of lactate generation and physiology. However, treatment of LA is an area of controversy and uncertainty, and the use of agents to raise pH is not clearly beneficial.

Aim and Methods

We reviewed animal and human studies on the pathogenesis, impact, and treatment of LA, published in the English language and available through the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Our aim was to clarify the physiology of the generation of LA, its impact on outcomes, and the different treatment modalities available. We also examined relevant data regarding LA induced by medications commonly prescribed by hospitalists: biguanides, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), linezolid, and lorazepam.

Results/Conclusions

Lactic acid is a marker of tissue ischemia but it also may accumulate without tissue hypoperfusion. In the latter circumstance, lactic acid accumulation may be an adaptive mechanism-a novel possibility quite in contrast to the traditional view of lactic acid as only a marker of tissue ischemia. Studies on the treatment of LA with sodium bicarbonate or other buffers fail to show consistent clinical benefit. Severe acidemia in the setting of LA is a particularly poorly studied area. In the settings of medication-induced LA, optimal treatment, apart from prompt cessation of the offending agent, is still unclear.

### Abacavir sulfate (Ziagen) [^117SexbY]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including ZIAGEN. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with ZIAGEN should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including ZIAGEN. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

5.4 Myocardial Infarction

Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.

As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).

### Entecavir (Baraclude) [^114agu31]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Unknown frequency adverse reactions associated with the use of entecavir PO (also known as Baraclude) include: alopecia, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly and lactic acidosis.

### Abacavir sulfate, lamivudine, and zidovudine (Trizivir) [^116EXbRh]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Regardless of HLA-B✱5701 status, permanently discontinue TRIZIVIR if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible.

Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, NEVER restart TRIZIVIR or any other abacavir-containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life-threatening hypotension and death.

Reintroduction of TRIZIVIR or any other abacavir-containing product, even in patients who have no identified history or unrecognized symptoms of hypersensitivity to abacavir therapy, can result in serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Such reactions can occur within hours [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Hematologic Toxicity: Zidovudine, a component of TRIZIVIR, has been associated with hematologic toxicity, including neutropenia and severe anemia, particularly in patients with advanced Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Myopathy: Prolonged use of zidovudine has been associated with symptomatic myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including abacavir, lamivudine, zidovudine, and other antiretrovirals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Risk factors for lactic acidosis in HIV-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors: a case-control study [^114w9dSL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A case-control study was undertaken to determine risk factors for lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of > 5 mM and plasma pH of < 7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of < 70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0–86.5], P < 10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P = .03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis.

### Lactic acidosis in HIV infected patients: a systematic review of published cases [^115QBLR1]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical characteristics of published cases of lactic acidosis (LA) and to generate hypotheses concerning risk factors associated with this complication.

Methods

Systematic review of cases reported in the medical literature.

Results

217 published cases were identified, 90 of which fulfilled the study definition and had sufficient individual data on potential risk factors to be included. The 90 patients had a mean age of 40.1 years (range 16–69) and 53% were female. All 90 patients were taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) at the time of the episode. Among the 83 patients with details of their antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen 51 patients were taking stavudine, 29 zidovudine, 27 didanosine, and 25 lamivudine. Around 50% of the patients had abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Hepatic steatosis was consistently reported (53/90) and in 36 (68%) there was histological evidence. The case fatality rate was 48%. Six cases were rechallenged with NRTI and three developed a further LA episode. Using data on the numbers of HIV infected individuals receiving care in the United States, we estimate that the risk of LA could be 2.5 times higher for women than men.

Conclusions

NRTI use and female sex appear to be risk factors for the development of LA. What other factors are involved is still not clear but might include duration of NRTI therapy, specific drug use, and genetic predisposition. A case-control study is needed to better define risk factors for severe LA.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113atTw1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) — nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimens — has class toxicity in which a hallmark toxicity of the NRTI class is mitochondrial toxicity, and tenofovir can lead to kidney and bone toxicities, especially when used with a pharmacokinetic (PK) booster; however, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is associated with less renal and bone toxicity compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) because it achieves lower plasma tenofovir concentrations, though TAF might be associated with higher blood lipid levels than TDF. In published nPEP cohorts, five studies had TAF-containing regimens (n = 479), and among four studies reporting completion, completion rates ranged from 82% to 96% without any HIV seroconversions. Rarely, lamivudine (3TC) has been associated with pancreatitis and this risk might be higher in children. Less commonly used NRTIs include abacavir (ABC) and zidovudine (AZT); ABC is generally avoided due to concerns for developing an ABC hypersensitivity reaction and the need for HLA-B5701 testing, and ABC generally is avoided in persons with coronary artery disease due to the possible risk for myocardial infarction. Adverse reactions reported with AZT include headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lactic acidosis, and loss of limb fat, and in nPEP longitudinal trends TDF-containing regimens were associated with significantly higher completion rates than AZT-containing regimens (adjusted OR = 2.80 [95% CI = 1.69–4.63; p < 0.001]).

### Point of care testing for antiretroviral therapy-related lactic acidosis in resource-poor settings [^115jwFFG]. AIDS (2006). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of patients on ART. In the developing world, definitive diagnosis by laboratory measurement of lactate may be impossible. Point-of-care devices are available that provide simple, accurate measurements of lactic acid levels at relatively low cost. Their use in an HIV treatment programme in rural Haiti has greatly assisted clinical decision-making in patients with symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling:

Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Immune reconstitution syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.

Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

### Risk factors for and outcome of hyperlactatemia in HIV-infected persons: is there a need for routine lactate monitoring? [^113c7Kbe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic episodes of hyperlactatemia are more frequent, but their clinical relevance is unknown.

Methods

The incidences of, risk factors for, and courses of hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis were prospectively assessed in the following 3 groups at the Zurich center of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: persons already receiving CART at baseline, treatment-naive persons who initiated CART during the observation period, and persons who received no CART before or during the observation period.

Results

During 4788 person-years of follow-up, a total of 22,678 lactate assessments were performed for 1566 persons; 662 (42.3%) had at least 1 lactate level measurement of > 2.4 mmol/L, and 49 (3.1%) had severe hyperlactatemia (lactate level of > 5.0 mmol/L). The incidence of hyperlactatemia was 227 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 210–245) and 59 cases (95% CI, 38–93) per 1000 person-years of follow-up among persons with and persons without CART, respectively. During the observation period, the incidence decreased from 459 cases (95% CI, 415–508) to 85 cases (95% CI, 76–107) per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively, because of changing CART prescription patterns. Severe hyperlactatemia occurred in treated persons only. In multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, significant risk factors for severe hyperlactatemia were regimens containing stavudine and didanosine (hazard ratio [HR], 6.65; 95% CI, 2.70–16.3) and regimens containing efavirenz (HR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.31–6.21). Lactic acidosis was diagnosed in 4 of 1566 persons, all of whom were receiving stavudine and didanosine.

Conclusions

Hyperlactatemia was frequently observed in all 3 groups, but severe hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis were rarely observed among persons who received CART. Lactate monitoring appears to be indicated primarily for persons receiving stavudine and didanosine and for persons who are symptomatic. Long-term follow-up is needed to investigate the risk of novel treatment regimens for hyperlactatemia.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir and lamivudine. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. See full prescribing information for ZIAGEN (abacavir) and EPIVIR (lamivudine). Treatment with abacavir and lamivudine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

5.4 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir and lamivudine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

5.5 Myocardial Infarction

Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain the potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.

As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Abacavir

Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction.

Skin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects

Inform patients that decreases in bone mineral density have been observed with the use of TDF or emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Consider bone monitoring in patients and uninfected individuals who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or at risk for osteopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly

Inform HIV-1 infected patients and uninfected individuals that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Treatment with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be suspended in any person who develops clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Drug Interactions

Advise individuals that emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise individuals to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication, including other HIV drugs and drugs for treatment of hepatitis C virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Dosage Recommendations for Treatment of HIV-1 Infection

Inform HIV-1 infected patients that it is important to take emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 on a regular dosing schedule with or without food and to avoid missing doses as it can result in development of resistance.

### Clinical syndromes and consequences of antiretroviral-related hepatotoxicity [^115y6hJC]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-related hepatotoxicity complicates the management of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), increases medical costs, alters the prescription patterns, and affects the guideline recommendations. Among the clinical consequences derived from HAART-related liver toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions and lactic acidosis are recognized as acute events with potential to evolve into fatal cases, whereas there seems to be other syndromes not as well characterized but of equal concern as possible long-term liver complications. Belonging to the latter category of syndrome, HAART-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia are discussed in this review. Updated information on liver toxicity of current antiretroviral drugs, including the most recently licensed, is provided. Management and prevention of liver toxicity among HIV-infected patients treated with HAART are reviewed as well.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1)
Co-infection with HIV: BARACLUDE is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2)
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3)

5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV

BARACLUDE has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if BARACLUDE is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with BARACLUDE is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating BARACLUDE therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. BARACLUDE has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including BARACLUDE, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Lactic acidosis with BARACLUDE use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with BARACLUDE should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

Advise patients to stop taking abacavir if they develop clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any signs and symptoms of infection as inflammation from previous infection may occur soon after combination antiretroviral therapy, including when abacavir is started [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pregnancy Registry

Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to abacavir during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Lactation

Instruct women with HIV-1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV-1 can be passed to the baby in the breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Missed Dose

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of abacavir, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Availability of Medication Guide

Instruct patients to read the Medication Guide before starting abacavir and to re-read it each time the prescription is renewed. Instruct patients to inform their physician or pharmacist if they develop any unusual symptom, or if any known symptom persists or worsens.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^114R3cDN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Abacavir (ABC) major toxicities — More common: Nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, diarrhea, rash, anorexia. Less common (more severe): Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) have been observed in approximately 5% of adults and children (rate varies by race/ethnicity) receiving ABC, and HSRs generally occur during the first 6 weeks of therapy but have also been reported after a single dose of ABC. The risk of an ABC HSR is associated with the presence of the HLA-B✱5701 allele, and the risk is greatly reduced by not using ABC in those who test positive for the HLA-B✱5701 allele. The HSR to ABC is a multiorgan clinical syndrome usually characterized by rash, or signs or symptoms in two or more of the following groups: fever; constitutional symptoms, including malaise, fatigue, or achiness; gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain; respiratory signs and symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis; and laboratory and radiologic abnormalities, including elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia, and pulmonary infiltrates. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis — including fatal cases — also have been reported, and pancreatitis with laboratory abnormalities can occur. If an HSR is suspected, ABC should be stopped immediately and not restarted because hypotension and death may occur upon rechallenge. Rare: Increased levels of liver enzymes, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated triglycerides have been reported, and pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis — including fatal cases — have been reported.

### Severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and cobicistat combination for HIV patient [^114c7puz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect in individuals receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. An underweight woman with HIV was admitted to our hospital because of nausea and diffuse myalgia. Her antiretroviral regimen had been changed to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine and darunavir/cobicistat 3months prior, after which her renal function had gradually declined. After admission, she was diagnosed with lactic acidosis, and a liver biopsy suggested mitochondrial damage. Her plasma tenofovir levels were elevated at the onset of lactic acidosis. We hypothesise that the patient's low body weight, combined with the addition of cobicistat, induced renal dysfunction and led to elevated plasma tenofovir concentrations, resulting in mitochondrial damage and lactic acidosis. Careful monitoring of renal function and lactic acidosis is required during use of TDF-containing regimens for underweight HIV patients, particularly when combined with cobicistat.

### Fatal lactic acidosis during antiretroviral therapy [^1166bDqs]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the first pediatric case of fatal lactic acidosis in an antiretroviral-treated child with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit.

Patients

A patient with fatal antiretroviral therapy-associated type B lactic acidosis.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We report the case of a 5-yr-old girl with HIV infection, receiving ritonavir, stavudine, and didanosine, who presented with a 10-day history of nausea and vomiting. Severe lactic acidosis was found. Her clinical condition worsened, with progressive increase in serum lactate, despite aggressive supportive therapy, including intravenous alkali and continuous arteriovenous hemodiafiltration.

Conclusions

Fatal lactic acidosis is a complication of antiretroviral therapy in pediatric HIV patients, which has not been previously reported in children. Early recognition of mitochondrial dysfunction in these patients could prevent the development of fatal lactic acidosis.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^114dDjkk]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — agents, onset, presentation, and adult risk factors are summarized as follows: Associated antiretrovirals include NRTIs with ZDV, and lactic acidosis is less likely with 3TC, FTC, ABC, TAF, and TDF, and 3TC, FTC, ABC, TAF, and TDF are less likely to induce clinically significant mitochondrial dysfunction than ZDV. Onset is generally after years of exposure, with a few cases reported shortly after initiation in people with underlying liver disease. Presentation ranges from clinically asymptomatic to insidious combinations of generalized fatigue, weakness, myalgias, and vague abdominal pain, weight loss, unexplained nausea, or vomiting. Adult risk factors include female sex, high BMI, chronic HCV infection, African American race, coadministration of TDF with metformin, overdose of propylene glycol, CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3, acquired riboflavin or thiamine deficiency, possible pregnancy, and overdose in setting of renal insufficiency including a case of ARV-associated new-onset renal insufficiency (TDF/FTC plus DRV/c).

### A review of the toxicity of HIV medications [^112qqXuS]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy has changed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection from a near-certainly fatal illness to one that can be managed chronically. More patients are taking antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for longer periods of time, which naturally results in more observed toxicity. Overdose with ARVs is not commonly reported. The most serious overdose outcomes have been reported in neonates who were inadvertently administered supratherapeutic doses of HIV prophylaxis medications. Typical ARV regimens include a "backbone" of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and a "base" of either a protease inhibitor (PI) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. New classes of drugs called entry inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have also emerged. Older NRTIs were associated with mitochondrial toxicity, but this is less common in the newer drugs, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir. Mitochondrial toxicity results from NRTI inhibition of a mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Mitochondrial toxicity manifests as myopathy, neuropathy, hepatic failure, and lactic acidosis. Routine lactate assessment in asymptomatic patients is not indicated. Lactate concentration should be obtained in patients taking NRTIs who have fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or vague abdominal pain. Mitochondrial toxicity can be fatal and is treated by supportive care and discontinuing NRTIs. Metabolic cofactors like thiamine, carnitine, and riboflavin may be helpful in managing mitochondrial toxicity. Lipodystrophy describes changes in fat distribution and lipid metabolism that have been attributed to both PIs and NRTIs. Lipodystrophy consists of loss of fat around the face (lipoatrophy), increase in truncal fat, and hypertriglyceridemia. There is no specific treatment of lipodystrophy. Clinicians should be able to recognize effects of chronic toxicity of ARVs, especially mitochondrial toxicity.

### Lactic acidemia in infection with human immunodeficiency virus [^113A4jnZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus was initially identified as a rare complication of therapy with nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The only patient group that appears to be at greater risk is pregnant women. More recently, milder elevations in lactate (i.e., lactic acidemia or hyperlactatemia) have been found to be more common and to be associated with numerous illnesses. Mild asymptomatic lactic acidemia is common, but it appears to lead to more severe illness only rarely. This suggests that routine measurement of plasma lactate should be limited to patients with previous acidemia who reinitiate NRTI therapy and to pregnant women. For symptomatic lactic acidemia (generally > 5 mmol/L), NRTIs and other antiretroviral therapy should be ceased. Currently, asymptomatic lactic acidemia should not be treated and should not lead to a change in antiretroviral therapy.

### Hyperlactatemia syndromes in people with HIV infection [^111ri7NU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperlactatemia associated with use of nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is not a single entity but a spectrum of abnormalities. The spectrum reflects varying degrees of derangement in systemic homeostasis in the face of primary drug effects on lactate load. Lactic acidosis, characterized by metabolic acidosis, blood lactate above 5 mmol/l, hepatic steatosis and high mortality, represents the extreme end of this spectrum where there is complete decompensation. Partially compensated states of lactate excess have now been described, ranging from less fulminant symptomatic hyperlactatemia with hepatic steatosis to chronic or intermittent low-grade hyperlactatemia without acidosis, steatosis or any symptoms. At a population level, average venous lactate concentrations do rise following treatment with NRTIs but stabilize long term in the majority of cases. The average increase in systemic lactate turnover that is required to maintain such compensated blood levels is not known and research into this may provide insights into the extent of incipient mitochondrial toxicity associated with chronic NRTI use. At a tissue-specific level, it is not known which tissues or organs (liver, fat, other) are the predominant contributors to an increase in systemic lactate load, nor whether the primary defect is one of increased production, decreased elimination or both.

### Severe myositis on commencement of efavirenz, abacavir and lamivudine, in the absence of lactic acidosis or classical abacavir hypersensitivity [^117UQyo3]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Myositis in HIV may be due to HIV itself, or to opportunistic infection, malignancy or drug treatment. Severe myositis or rhabdomyolysis have never been reported with the commonly used nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor abacavir, although creatine phosphokinase may rise modestly, particularly if abacavir hypersensitivity occurs. We report an unusual case of abacavir use associated with a thousand-fold rise in creatine phosphokinase in the absence of features of hypersensitivity. The case was also notable firstly in that there was an absence of the HLA-B5701 allele, the most common human leucocyte antigen (HLA) allele associated with hypersensitivity, and, secondly, as the case occurred in an African patient, African people not being prone to abacavir hypersensitivity.

New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Inform HIV-1 infected patients and uninfected individuals that renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in association with the use of TDF, a component of TRUVADA. Advise patients to avoid TRUVADA with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The dosing interval of TRUVADA may need adjustment in HIV-1 infected patients with renal impairment. TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP should not be used in HIV-1 uninfected individuals if estimated creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Inform HIV-1 infected patients that in some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects

Inform patients that decreases in bone mineral density have been observed with the use of TDF or TRUVADA. Consider bone monitoring in patients and uninfected individuals who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or at risk for osteopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly

Inform HIV-1 infected patients and uninfected individuals that lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported. Treatment with TRUVADA should be suspended in any person who develops clinical symptoms suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Drug Interactions

Advise individuals that TRUVADA may interact with many drugs; therefore, advise individuals to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication, including other HIV drugs and drugs for treatment of hepatitis C virus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7)].

### Selected metabolic and morphologic complications associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy [^1112GK8p]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Metabolic and morphologic changes have been described in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In the short term, these disorders can be debilitating and may require medical intervention, including alterations in antiretroviral therapy regimens. The long-term consequences have not been fully realized, but are important, particularly in the era of durable HIV disease management with highly active antiretroviral therapy. This review focuses on 3 of the important morphologic or metabolic changes, namely alterations in body fat distribution, dyslipidemia, and lactic acidosis. The prevalence of each of these disorders remains unknown due to varied definitions and difficulty in recognition of the conditions for both the patient and the clinician. Treatment regimens directed at these abnormalities are being developed, but clinical trials are needed to fully ascertain the efficacy and safety of such interventions.

5.2	Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

5.3	Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

5.4	Myocardial Infarction

Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.

As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).

### Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) [^114r9Jg3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in HIV-1-infected pregnant women to determine the utility of zidovudine for the prevention of maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission. Zidovudine treatment during pregnancy reduced the rate of maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission from 24.9% for infants born to placebo-treated mothers to 7.8% for infants born to mothers treated with zidovudine. There were no differences in pregnancy-related adverse events between the treatment groups. Of the 363 neonates that were evaluated, congenital abnormalities occurred with similar frequency between neonates born to mothers who received zidovudine and neonates born to mothers who received placebo. The observed abnormalities included problems in embryogenesis (prior to 14 weeks) or were recognized on ultrasound before or immediately after initiation of trial drug. See full prescribing information for RETROVIR®(zidovudine) and COMBIVIR®(lamivudine and zidovudine).

Zidovudine has been shown to cross the placenta and concentrations in neonatal plasma at birth were essentially equal to those in maternal plasma at delivery [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].

There have been reports of mild, transient elevations in serum lactate levels, which may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction, in neonates and infants exposed in utero or peri-partum to zidovudine-containing products. There have been few reports of developmental delay, seizures, and other neurological disease. However, a causal relationship between these events and exposure to zidovudine-containing products in utero or peri-partum has not been established. The clinical relevance of transient elevations in serum lactate is unknown.

### Abacavir-induced fulminant hepatic failure in a HIV / HCV co-infected patient [^115RjhFS]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Abacavir hypersensitivity is a rare, yet significant adverse reaction that results in a spectrum of physical and laboratory abnormalities, and has been postulated to stem from a variety of aetiological factors. The major histocompatibility complex haplotype human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B5701 is a significant risk factor in development of hypersensitivity reactions, yet only 55% of HLA-B5701+ individuals develop such reactions, suggesting a multifactorial aetiology. Nevertheless, prospective screening and avoidance of abacavir in these patients has limited adverse events. Within this spectrum of adverse events, abacavir-induced liver toxicity is exceedingly rare and reported events have ranged from mild elevations of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure. We report the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian woman with a history significant for HIV, hepatitis C virus and a HLA-B5701+ status, transferred to our emergency department in a hypotensive state and found to have acute liver failure, acute renal failure and significant rhabdomyolysis following a change of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen.

### The nephrotoxic effects of HAART [^111mKRBY]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

With significant reductions in mortality and risk of progression to AIDS in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), complications of long-standing HIV infection and treatment have become increasingly important. Such complications include the nephrotoxic effects of HAART, which are the subject of this Review. The most common nephrotoxic effects associated with HAART include crystal-induced obstruction secondary to use of protease inhibitors (mainly indinavir and atazanavir), and proximal tubule damage related to the nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir. Acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur following tenofovir-induced tubule dysfunction or as a result of severe mitochondrial dysfunction and lactic acidosis induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The potential insidious long-term renal toxicity of antiretroviral treatment is probably underappreciated in patients with HIV: a proportion of patients with treatment-related AKI did not recover their baseline renal function at 2-year follow-up, suggesting the possibility of permanent renal damage. Finally, nonspecific metabolic complications might increase the risk of vascular chronic kidney disease in patients on HAART. However, given the benefits of HAART, fear of nephrotoxic effects is never a valid reason to withhold antiretroviral therapy. Identification of patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease, who are at increased risk of renal damage, enables appropriate dose modification, close monitoring, and avoidance or cautious use of potentially nephrotoxic medications.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^115x5fkm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated lactic acidosis — clinical features, risk factors, monitoring, and management are outlined as follows: Dyspnea and peripheral neuropathy are listed manifestations, and patients may present with acute multiorgan failure (e.g., fulminant hepatic failure, pancreatic failure, respiratory failure). Risk factors include Preterm Infants or Any Neonates Who Have Not Attained a Postmenstrual Age of 42 Weeks and a Postnatal Age of ≥ 14 Days and exposure to propylene glycol used as a diluent in LPV/r oral solution. For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

What are the possible side effects of abacavir tablets?

Abacavir tablets can cause serious side effects including:
See "What is the most important information I should know about abacavir tablets?"
Build-up of acid in your blood (lactic acidosis). Lactic acidosis can happen in some people who take abacavir tablets. Lactic acidosis is a serious medical emergency that can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms that could be signs of lactic acidosis:
feel very weak or tired
unusual (not normal) muscle pain
trouble breathing
stomach pain with nausea and vomiting
feel cold, especially in your arms and legs
feel dizzy or light-headed
have a fast or irregular heartbeat
Serious liver problems can happen in people who take abacavir tablets. In some cases, these serious liver problems can lead to death. Your liver may become large (hepatomegaly) and you may develop fat in your liver (steatosis) when you take abacavir tablets. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following signs of liver problems:

You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or serious liver problems if you are female or very overweight (obese).
your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice)
dark or "tea-colored" urine
light-colored stools (bowel movements)
loss of appetite for several days or longer
nausea
pain, aching, or tenderness on the right side of your stomach area
Changes in your immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome) can happen when you start taking HIV-1 medicines. Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you start having new symptoms after you start taking abacavir tablets.
Heart attack (myocardial infarction). Some HIV-1 medicines including abacavir tablets may increase your risk of heart attack.

### Managing issues related to antiretroviral therapy [^112wTTQ3]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral regimens are complicated and difficult for patients to follow, and they can have serious side effects, such as osteonecrosis and bone demineralization. Protease inhibitor therapy has been associated with hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and body-fat distribution abnormalities. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can cause rashes and hepatotoxicity, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can cause lactic acidosis, hypersensitivity reactions, neuropathies, pancreatitis, anemia, and neutropenia. Malabsorption can occur if antiretroviral agents are taken improperly with regard to meals or if they are taken with certain other drugs or herbal remedies. Some commonly prescribed drugs can cause dangerous drug toxicities if they are taken by patients who are also taking certain antiretroviral medications. Suboptimal exposure to antiretrovirals because of noncompliance or malabsorption can result in viral resistance and loss of future treatment options.

5.2 Hematologic Toxicity/Bone Marrow Suppression

Zidovudine, a component of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablet, has been associated with hematologic toxicity including neutropenia and anemia, particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease. Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets should be used with caution in patients who have bone marrow compromise evidenced by granulocyte count less than 1,000 cells per mm3or hemoglobin less than 9.5 grams per dL [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

Frequent blood counts are strongly recommended in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease who are treated with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets. Periodic blood counts are recommended for other HIV-1-infected patients. If anemia or neutropenia develops, dosage interruption may be needed.

5.3 Myopathy

Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and therefore may occur with therapy with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets.

5.4 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine (components of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine tablets). A majority of these cases have been in women.

### Association of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor use with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease risk [^1122LRJY]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

As the prevalence of AD rises, so does the demand for quality, disease‐modifying therapies. The repurposing of existing, approved therapies could accelerate drug development. Prospective randomized controlled trials in humans are warranted to gain better insight into the effects of NRTIs or suitable derivatives on clinical outcomes in AD. Indeed, two NRTIs have been recently tested in AD clinical trials: lamivudine (NCT04552795; recently completed) and emtricitabine (NCT04500847; ongoing). The 24‐week pilot clinical study of lamivudine in AD reported a reduction in some neurodegeneration‐ and neuroinflammation‐related biomarkers, supporting the concept that NRTIs could be beneficial in AD. Although lamivudine was well tolerated in this small 12‐patient 6‐month trial, NRTIs can induce mitochondrial toxicity via off‐target inhibition of mammalian DNA polymerases. As a result, they can induce serious adverse effects including lactic acidosis, which can be fatal. However, lamivudine is considered a new‐generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and is associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of lactic acidosis when compared with other medications in the same class. Serious adverse events such as lactic acidosis are rare and managed with biannual laboratory tests in patients who take lamivudine for hepatitis B or HIV. Apart from such toxicity, isolated administration of NRTIs can potentially induce retroviral resistance. Thus, NRTI derivatives such as K‐9, which inhibits inflammasome activation without inducing the aforementioned toxicity of NRTIs, might be more suitable for chronic administration, where patient tolerance is critical.

The key considerations for translating the results of our study into clinical trials, particularly for prevention, include identifying patients who would have a sufficiently high risk of developing during the course of the trial and identifying a dosage regimen that exhibits target knockdown yet minimizes adverse events.

### Entecavir anhydrous (Entecavir) [^114vrcBw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1)
Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2)

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3)

5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti- hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV

Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Inform HIV-1 infected patients and uninfected individuals that renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in association with the use of TDF, a component of TRUVADA. Advise patients to avoid TRUVADA with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple NSAIDs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The dosing interval of TRUVADA may need adjustment in HIV-1 infected patients with renal impairment. TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP should not be used in HIV-1 uninfected individuals if estimated creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. If a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance is observed in uninfected individuals while using TRUVADA for HIV-1 PrEP, evaluate potential causes and re-assess potential risks and benefits of continued use [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Safety and Tolerability of Entecavir in Real-Life Settings

Assessing how the safety and tolerability data from Phase III trials translate to those seen in general populations is obviously important as most patients will experience long-term or definitive therapies. Safety profiles in real-life studies of ETV in more than 1000 patients have been largely consistent with those of Phase III studies, in that no major safety issues or serious side effects have been reported to date. Mitochondrial toxicity has been raised as a potential concern with NUCs as they can inhibit mitochondrial polymerase gamma, causing mitochondrial DNA depletion and subsequent mitochondrial toxicity. However, ETV has a low potential for interfering with polymerase gamma and causing mitochondrial toxicity. This is consistent with a low incidence of adverse events attributable to mitochondrial toxicity reported in Phase III trials.

A consequence of mitochondrial toxicity can be lactic acidosis. One retrospective study identified five cases of lactic acidosis among 16 ETV-treated patients with decompensated liver disease. The five patients in question all had highly impaired liver function, with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores of 22 or higher. In a prospective follow-up study in 37 patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving LVD, ADV, ETV or TDF, four cases of lactic acidosis were reported, two in patients receiving TDF and two in untreated patients. Furthermore, no cases of lactic acidosis were reported in the long-term rollover study ETV-901. Data from patients with hepatic decompensation also report few cases of lactic acidosis, with no cases recorded during 1 year of ETV therapy, none in the ETV/TDF/emtricitabine study and one case in study ETV-048 (comparing ETV with ADV), which required no treatment and resolved despite continued ETV therapy. As lactic acidosis appears to be observed more frequently in patients with decompensated disease, consideration should be given to monitoring these patients for this adverse effect regardless of the drug they are receiving. Carcinogenesis has been reported in animal models exposed to very high doses of ETV. However, to date, there is no evidence for the occurrence of cancers as a result of ETV treatment in patients. A global Phase IV study (the REALM study) is continuing to address this safety concern in patients treated with ETV during a 10-year follow-up period.

These agents suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA effectively so that significantly decreasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. NAs have relatively fewer side effects than interferon alpha, and generally well tolerated. Infrequent but serious adverse events have been reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance in individual cases. Previously 12.9% of patients on telbivudine treatment developing severe elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, but lactic acidosis (LA) and rhabdomyolysis (RM) were rare. These two diseases may due to the same pathophysiology: mitochondrial toxicity. The NAs inhibit HBV polymerase and also have a low level of activity against the host mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ, leading to impaired replication with mitochondrial loss or dysfunction. As mitochondria are the main sites of oxidative phosphorylation, there will be an increase of pyruvate reduction to lactic acid and insufficient ATP. The accumulation of lactic acid causes LA, while lack of energy leads to cell dysfunction and mitochondria-associated disease, including RM. Here we report the first case of CHB patients developing fatal LA and RM during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment.

### Fatal portal hypertension, liver failure, and mitochondrial dysfunction after HIV-1 nucleoside analogue-induced hepatitis And lactic acidaemia [^1122crxT]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Acute hepatitis with lactic acidosis is a life-threatening but reversible toxic effect on mitochondria of HIV-1 nucleoside-analogue treatment. We report fatal portal hypertension, liver failure, and persistent mitochondrial dysfunction in a man aged 65 years with HIV-1 infection who had recovered from nucleoside-analogue-induced acute hepatitis and lactic acidaemia more than 18 months previously. We believe that symptom free patients who receive nucleoside-analogue therapy should have hepatic function constantly monitored, especially those with past or present lactic acidaemia.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir, a component of abacavir and lamivudine [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.

Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

### Genotoxic consequences of viral infections [^111mFrUT]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Genotoxicity of antiretroviral therapy

Over 30 antiretroviral drugs belonging to eight distinct mechanistic classes have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of HIV infection. cART generally consists of a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs from distinct classes, typically two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) combined with a third drug from one of three classes: HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with a pharmacokinetic enhancer. This synergistic combination effectively suppresses HIV replication, thereby reducing viral load and preventing the progression of HIV infection to AIDS.

Once they enter host cells, NRTIs undergo a series of phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by cellular kinases. These phosphorylated NRTIs then compete with cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) for incorporation into the nascent viral DNA by reverse transcriptase. Upon incorporation, NRTIs act as chain terminators, preventing further DNA synthesis and effectively halting viral replication. In vitro studies have demonstrated that NRTIs also have the potential to incorporate into nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and inhibit host DNA polymerases and induce DNA damage –. The potential of certain NRTIs to be incorporated by the mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ correlates with their mitochondrial toxicity. NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity is a major adverse effect characterized by severe complications such as myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, hepatic failure, and lactic acidosis. The incorporation of NRTIs into nuclear DNA was proposed to result in genotoxic and mutagenic effects: induction of genomic instability, increased mutation rates, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei formation, and telomere shortening. Zidovudine and stavudine were shown to be genotoxic in vivo. Abacavir and emtricitabine increase the frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma-associated translocation t(8;14) in CRISPR/Cas9-based cellular screening model. Owing to their toxicity, older NRTIs, such as zidovudine (also known as azidothymidine), stavudine, and didanosine, are no longer recommended for clinical use. Despite initial concerns about the genotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic potential of NRTIs, the evidence to date does not support their involvement in oncogenesis in people living with HIV.

### Case report: lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment for chronic hepatitis B [^111PBC3o]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and Conclusions

In basic terms, lactic acid is the product of anaerobic metabolism. The normal blood lactate concentration is 0.5–1 mmol/L. LA is defined as a constant increase in blood lactate levels (usually > 5 mmol/L) in association with metabolic acidosis (usually present as pH < 7.3 and serum bicarbonate < 10 mmol/L). The LA syndrome presents as steatosis, abnormal mitochondrial appearance and function, pancreatitis, neuropathy, and myopathy. The onset may be abrupt or insidious, which generally begins with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It will progress to tachypnea, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. Patients with severe LA may subsequently develop renal failure, liver failure, coagulopathy, seizures, arrhythmias, and even death. The patient reported here was a severe LA case with a constant higher lactate level (more than 12 mmol/L) and pH value (about 7.2).

On the other hand, RM is a syndrome characterized by damage of striated muscle cells, which release a large amount of intracellular substance, including myoglobin, potassium ion, CPK, etc. The prognosis of RM is poor, and fatality rate reaches 3%~ 27%. Early symptoms are mild and non-specific, like malaise, muscular weakness and tenderness. The most important clinical manifestations are myoglobinuria and higher specific gravity of urine (> 1.025). The color of urine can change from pale red to deep red, even black. CPK rises rapidly, up to 10,000–20,000 U/L. Blood gas analysis can reveal hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis. The diagnosis criteria are as follows: 1. Serum CPK significantly rise; 2. Blood and urine myoglobulin positive, with myalgia and muscle swollen; 3. Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia. About 20%~ 33% RM patients will develop acute renal failure. RM is usually caused by trauma or non-trauma factors (like drugs, toxics, ischemia, and infection). Drugs that can induce RM contain statins, theophylline, anti-H1, benzodiazepines, amphotericin B and antidepressants.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B in children — monitoring and toxicities with IFN-α and nucleotide analogues are outlined as follows: Elevation of serum transaminase levels has been reported during IFN-α therapy in children and adults but usually is not an indication to stop therapy; these flares may herald impending HBeAg seroconversion. Children receiving IFN-α therapy should be monitored with frequent complete blood count and liver function tests, and serum level of thyroid-stimulating hormone should be determined at baseline and periodically (e.g., at least every 3 months) for the duration of treatment. Lamivudine usually is well-tolerated in children; rare cases of lactic acidosis and pancreatitis have been reported in HIV/HBV-coinfected adults. Tenofovir and adefovir can cause renal tubular disease, and patients receiving either drug should have baseline urinalysis and periodic urinalysis, serum creatinine and phosphate monitoring; administration of other nephrotoxic agents increases the risk of renal toxicity, and tenofovir can lead to reduced bone density.

### Hyperlactataemia and lactic acidosis during antiretroviral therapy: relevance, reproducibility and possible risk factors [^115dnHof]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence, outcome and possible risk factors for hyperlactataemia and lactic acidosis in HIV-positive persons receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Methods

Cross-sectional and longitudinal data from a prospectively collected clinical database. Associations with antiretroviral regimen, clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model.

Results

Patients naive to therapy and patients on current therapy for a minimum of 4 months were assessed. Median lactate was 1.1 mol/l in 253 untreated individuals and 1.4 mmol/l in 1239 patients stable on therapy for at least 4 months. At least two on-therapy samples were available for 750 of the 1239 individuals, taken a median 92 days apart. Lactate measurement showed a low positive predictive value of 38.9% but a high negative predictive value (98%) for normal values. Lactate was elevated ≥ 2.4 mmol/l in 102 individuals on at least one occasion. In the multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model, no demographic characteristics were associated with hyperlactataemia. Didanosine-containing regimens doubled the relative hazard of hyperlactataemia compared with those sparing didanosine. Abacavir-containing regimens reduced the hazard of hyperlactataemia. Choice of thymidine analogue did not influence risk. Hyperlactataemia was associated with acid-base disturbance. Use of didanosine and female sex were over-represented amongst nine patients with severe hyperlactataemia (> 5 mmol/l) or lactic acidosis.

Conclusions

Screening of lactate is of limited use in asymptomatic individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Raised lactate represents part of a spectrum of lactate and acid-base disturbance that infrequently includes lactic acidosis. Didanosine appears associated with an increased risk of hyperlactataemia.

### Nucleoside analogues and mitochondrial toxicity [^115cryKV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

An evaluation of the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System identified that patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and chronic hepatitis C virus who were treated with a regimen of ribavirin and didanosine, with or without stavudine, were at increased risk for events associated with mitochondrial toxicity, including fatal hepatic failure, peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. In response, the US product labels for didanosine and ribavirin have been revised to caution clinicians against coadministration of these drugs.

### Symptomatic hyperlactataemia: an emerging complication of antiretroviral therapy [^115sjgfG]. AIDS (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Fatal lactic acidosis is a serious complication of therapy with nucleoside analogues.

Objective

To examine symptomatic hyperlactataemia in HIV-infected adults treated with antiretroviral drugs.

Methods

In this prospective study, arterial blood lactate levels were measured in patients presenting with unexplained clinical symptoms. When these levels were high, functional respiratory tests (FRT) were carried out. Liver or muscle biopsies were further proposed. Incidences were calculated by comparison with the entire cohort of patients treated in the department.

Results

Fourteen HIV-infected adults treated with antiretroviral drugs were identified with symptomatic hyperlactataemia during a 2-year period follow-up study. The incidence of hyperlactataemia was 0.8% per year but reached 1.2% if only patients treated with a regimen including stavudine were considered. Clinical symptoms included abnormal fatigue, tachycardia, abdominal pain, weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, and more specifically exercise-induced dyspnoea occurring despite effective antiretroviral treatment. FRT showed a metabolic deviation towards anaerobiosis with a high lactate/pyruvate ratio. Ultrastructural mitochondrial abnormalities were seen in all four patients for whom this was examined. There was a marked decrease in complex IV activity in muscle biopsies from four of five patients, consistent with a mitochondrial dysfunction. Evolution was favourable in 13 patients, probably because of an early diagnosis.

Conclusions

Potentially fatal adverse events occurring during antiretroviral treatment may be avoided by close monitoring of clinical signs and blood lactate levels. If other studies confirm that the cumulative long-term toxicity of antiretroviral drugs results from mitochondrial dysfunction, the incidence of hyperlactataemia and its clinical consequences may become more important.

### Management of antiretroviral treatment-related complications [^117NuD7V]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy for HIV restores immune function, controls viral replication, decreases opportunistic infections, and extends lifespan to near-normal for infected individuals. However, successful HIV therapy has been accompanied by the emergence of treatment-related complications, with an impact not yet fully understood. This article reviews six common complications of antiretroviral therapy, including hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, hypersensitivity reactions, abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, body composition changes, and cardiovascular disease. A comprehensive approach to management of antiretroviral-related complications includes awareness of (1) risk factors for adverse reactions, (2) clinical syndromes suggestive of an evolving complication, and (3) evidence-based monitoring and treatment strategies. Fluency in options for preventing and managing complications can provide maximal opportunity to balance treatment effects with quality of life.

WARNING: RISK OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, MYOPATHY, LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY, EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B

Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir sulfate, a component of TRIZIVIR. Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi-organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in 2 or more of the following groups: (1) fever, (2) rash, (3) gastrointestinal (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain), (4) constitutional (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness), and (5) respiratory (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Discontinue TRIZIVIR as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected.

Patients who carry the HLA-B✱5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir, screening for the HLA-B✱5701 allele is recommended; this approach has been found to decrease the risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA-B✱5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. HLA-B✱5701-negative patients may develop a suspected hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir; however, this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLA-B✱5701-positive patients.

### Severe nucleoside-associated lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients: report of 12 cases and review of the literature [^115Xbyys]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a rare but often fatal complication reported in some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients treated with nucleoside-analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. We report a series of 12 patients with HIV infection treated with nucleoside analogues who developed unexplained metabolic acidosis. We have also reviewed 60 additional published cases. The aim of the present study is to describe the clinical picture, prognostic factors, and final outcome for nucleoside-associated lactic acidosis. The mortality rate is high: 33% for our patients, and 57% for the patients described in the literature. In the multivariate analysis, a lactate serum level of > 10 mM (odds ratio [OR], 13.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.96–59.25) was the only factor associated with higher mortality. The administration of specific therapy with cofactors against acidosis was associated with a lower mortality (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04–0.73). We conclude that specific therapy with cofactors may improve the outcome for patients with this syndrome.

### Antiretroviral therapy-associated toxicities in the resource-poor world: the challenge of a limited formulary [^111zTiDQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Toxicities related to antiretroviral therapy make long-term adherence to therapy difficult for patients and present challenges to providers, especially those in the resource-poor world who work with a limited formulary. In resource-poor settings, where limited drug options are the rule, when and how to change therapy are especially difficult problems. Drugs such as stavudine and didanosine are associated with serious metabolic complications, such as lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Antiretroviral agents associated with fewer metabolic effects, such as tenofovir and abacavir, remain widely unavailable. Because the current formulary restrictions appear to be unlikely to change quickly, providers in resource-poor countries must be familiar with the common adverse events-including metabolic complications, hypersensitivity reactions, anemia, and liver enzyme abnormalities-and must understand how to manage them with what is locally available. Most importantly, to avoid drug toxicities, a larger formulary is needed in resource-poor settings, and this must be a high priority for policy makers and health care professionals involved in treating human immunodeficiency virus infection globally.

### Abacavir substitution for nucleoside analogs in patients with HIV lipoatrophy: a randomized trial [^113XmPtp]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Peripheral lipoatrophy may complicate antiretroviral therapy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, often related to duration and type of nucleoside analog therapy, and may have a mitochondrial pathogenesis. No proven therapy exists for lipoatrophy, but abacavir is a nucleoside analog that may be less toxic to mitochondria.

Objective

To determine if substitution of stavudine or zidovudine with abacavir improves HIV lipoatrophy without affecting control of HIV replication.

Design

Randomized, open-label 24-week study.

Setting

Seventeen hospital HIV outpatient clinics and primary care centers in Australia and England, with randomization from June 2000 through January 2001.

Participants

A total of 111 adults (109 men) with moderate or severe lipoatrophy who were receiving stavudine (n = 85) or zidovudine (n = 26) and had stable plasma HIV RNA levels below 400 copies/mL and no prior abacavir therapy.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to switch from stavudine or zidovudine to abacavir, 300 mg twice per day, while continuing all other antiretroviral therapy (n = 54) or to continue all antiretroviral therapy (n = 57).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was limb fat mass, measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; key secondary end points were plasma HIV RNA levels, adverse events, physician-assessed (via subjective measures) lipodystrophy severity, total and central fat mass, and fasting metabolic (lipid, glycemic, and lactate) levels.

Results

There was a significant increase in limb fat in the abacavir group relative to the stavudine/zidovudine group (0.39 vs 0.08 kg; mean difference, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.57 kg), as well as significant relative increases in subcutaneous thigh (P = .01), arm (P < .001), and abdominal (P = .001) fat areas on computed tomography. Switching had no significant effect on secondary end points, including plasma HIV RNA (for unadjusted comparison between groups at week 24, odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.48–3.96). Change in limb fat mass at week 24 did not correlate with change in subjectively determined perceived lipoatrophy severity (r = -0.06; p = 0.53 by Spearman correlation). Hypersensitivity to abacavir was seen in 5 patients (10%).

Conclusions

In this sample of lipoatrophic HIV-infected adults, switching from stavudine or zidovudine to abacavir for 24 weeks led to significant, albeit modest, objectively measured increases in limb fat. Clinical lipoatrophy, as assessed subjectively, did not resolve, however, and at the rate of increase observed may take years to resolve with use of this strategy. Longer-term follow-up is needed.

### Fatal lactic acidosis associated with the use of combination oral medications to treat reactivation of hepatitis B [^116Z1ePQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Oral nucleos(t)ide analogs for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are well tolerated with minimal side effects. These agents do carry a Food and Drug Administration "black box" warning about the development of fatal lactic acidosis on the basis of data from the human immunodeficiency virus literature. However, no previously published cases of this lethal side effect have been reported in patients undergoing HBV treatment using the current Food and Drug Administration-approved HBV medications. We report a case of HBV reactivation after chemotherapy for leukemia, and the development of fatal lactic acidosis attributed to the use of combination oral HBV medications.

### Case report: lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis during telbivudine and tenofovir treatment for chronic hepatitis B [^115Q8Nhv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of NAs associated LA and RM is likely to be the malfunction of mitochondria. For according to muscle biopsy, the mitochondrial damage is identified in both patients. All five of the approved oral antiviral agents for HBV treatment can inhibit the polymerase activity of HBV. At the same time, they also have a low level of activity against the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma and can lead to impaired mitochondrial replication with mitochondrial loss or dysfunction. Mitochondria are the main sites for oxidative phosphorylation and producing adenosine transferase (ATP). There are approximately 300–400 mitochondria in each cell. When mitochondria function is impaired or the number of mitochondria is decreased, there will be an impact on the aerobic metabolism and production of ATP. Lack of aerobic metabolism resulted in the increase of pyruvate reduction to lactic acid. Then the accumulation of lactic acid causes LA. On the other side, the insufficient ATP means lack of energy for cell activities, leading to dysfunction of cells and mitochondria-associated disease. Mitochondria are mainly distributed over organs and tissues which are metabolically active. Thus, the clinical manifestations of mitochondria toxicity vary based on the affected tissues, which may include myopathy, neuropathy, hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, and nephrotoxicity. All NAs have a "black box" warning regarding potential mitochondrial toxicity in their product labeling.

For all five NAs approved of treatment for hepatitis B, the strength of inhibition of mtDNA polymerase gamma in an in vitro test system is substantially lower than antiretroviral agents like zalcitabine. In particular, entecavir has demonstrated little evidence of mitochondrial toxicity compared to the other available agents at concentrations exceeding 100 times the maximum concentration seen in humans. The impact of drug combinations in causing additive or synergistic mitochondrial toxicity in vitro has not been well studied.

Except drug withdrawal immediately, other management options for this kind of serious adverse reaction may include renal replacement therapy, bicarbonate alkalization and supplementation with L-acetylcarnitine, thiamine, as well as Coenzyme Q 10 to improve mitochondrial function. Most of the LA cases can resolve rapidly after discontinuation of the causative drug. For telbivudine associated myopathy, CPK decrease after 2–4 weeks as the symptoms are improved.

This case shows that tenofovir may trigger rhabdomyolysis in combination with telbivudine treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Thus, patients receiving tenofovir and telbivudine should be closely monitored for muscular abnormalities, blood lactate level and other mitochondrial toxicity associated side effects.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B antiviral adverse events and renal monitoring — Renal toxicity with TDF, including increased serum creatinine or renal tubular dysfunction, has been observed and is more frequent with underlying renal insufficiency, older age, or prolonged TDF exposure; these biochemical changes are usually reversible when TDF is discontinued or changed to TAF. Electrolytes and serum creatinine levels should be evaluated at baseline and every 3 to 6 months, and urinalysis every 6 months; because renal toxicity may be reversible, alternative anti-HBV therapy should be used if renal toxicity occurs (AI). If TDF is used in baseline renal insufficiency, either a dose adjustment per package insert or a change to TAF with appropriate dose adjustment is required; all nucleos(t)ides must be dose adjusted for renal dysfunction, and TAF is not recommended in patients with CrCl < 30 mL/min (AI). Entecavir-associated lactic acidosis is uncommon but has been reported in advanced cirrhosis, and major toxicities of IFN-alfa include flu-like and psychiatric symptoms as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus.

Symptomatic lactic acidemia was seen in 5 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients receiving combination therapy that included stavudine and ≥ 1 other nucleoside. Peak venous lactic acid levels of 3.1–7.4 mmol/L (normal range, 0.5–2.1 mmol/L) were associated with fatigue and rapid weight loss, whereas withdrawal of antiretrovirals led to normalization of venous lactic acid levels, symptomatic improvement, and weight gain. Resumption of an altered therapeutic regimen, which did not include stavudine but did include other nucleosides in 4 of 5 cases, did not result in recurrence of the syndrome after up to 126 days.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Serious and Fatal Abacavir-Associated Hypersensitivity Reactions

In clinical trials, serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with abacavir [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. These reactions have been characterized by 2 or more of the following signs or symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, or achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, or pharyngitis). Almost all abacavir hypersensitivity reactions include fever and/or rash as part of the syndrome.

Other signs and symptoms have included lethargy, headache, myalgia, edema, arthralgia, and paresthesia. Anaphylaxis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, myolysis, and death have occurred in association with these hypersensitivity reactions. Physical findings have included lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations), and maculopapular or urticarial rash (although some patients had other types of rashes and others did not have a rash). There were reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated liver chemistries, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, and lymphopenia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings (predominantly infiltrates, which were localized).

### Bench-to-bedside review: severe lactic acidosis in HIV patients treated with nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors [^11589148]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are effective antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. NRTIs can induce mitochondrial impairment that leads to a number of adverse events, including symptomatic lactic acidosis. In the present review, we describe the underlying mechanism of NRTI-induced toxicity and the main clinical features of this infrequent, but severe, emerging complication. We also summarise experimental data and clinical observations that support the use of L-carnitine supplementation to reverse NRTI-induced mitochondrial impairment.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues, including abacavir. A majority of these cases have been in women. Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues. Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations.

5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome

Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including abacavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

5.4 Myocardial Infarction

Several prospective, observational, epidemiological studies have reported an association with the use of abacavir and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Meta-analyses of randomized, controlled, clinical trials have observed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated subjects as compared with control subjects. To date, there is no established biological mechanism to explain a potential increase in risk. In totality, the available data from the observational studies and from controlled clinical trials show inconsistency; therefore, evidence for a causal relationship between abacavir treatment and the risk of MI is inconclusive.

As a precaution, the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies, including abacavir, and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking).

### Risk factors for lactic acidosis and severe hyperlactataemia in HIV-1-infected adults exposed to antiretroviral therapy [^1173KeWR]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Severe hyperlactataemia and lactic acidosis are rare serious complications of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Methods

Lactic acidosis was defined as pH < 7.35, bicarbonate < 20 mmol/l and raised lactate; hyperlactataemia as two consecutive lactates > 5 mmol/l. The case-control study of 110 cases and 220 controls(two randomly selected from treated patients by centre and calendar year) from centres in 10 countries included 40 (36.4%) female cases and 40 female controls (18.2%) (P < 0.001). Median age was 42.4 years [interquartile range (IQR, 36.0–52.5] for cases and 40 (IQR, 35.0–47.1) for controls (P = 0.013). More cases were nonwhite (41.9%) than controls (31.2%) (P = 0.032). Cases had a shorter duration of exposure to dideoxynucleosides.

Results

After adjusting for age, gender and current CD4 cell count, hyperlactataemia/lactic acidosis remained associated with exposure to didanosine in every category of exposure duration but was most strongly associated with exposure < 12 months. In a separate multivariable model, apart from exposure to stavudine, didanosine, or even more strongly both, age above 40 years [odds ratio (OR), 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08–6.29], female gender (OR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.92–18.5) and advanced immunosuppression were independent associations (CD4 cell count 200–349, 100–199 and < 100 cells/mul: OR, 3.89, 7.58 and 8.11, respectively).

Interpretation

Hyperlactataemia/lactic acidosis was associated with exposure to dideoxynucleosides, female gender, advanced immunosuppression and possibly ethnicity. This has important consequences for choice of ART in resource-limited settings. The association with shorter duration of exposure may support the hypothesis of susceptibility in a small proportion of patients.

### Entecavir [^111w2bNe]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation: Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months. (5.1, 6.1)
Co-infection with HIV: Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART. (5.2)
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: If suspected, treatment should be suspended. (5.3)

5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B

Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including entecavir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

5.2 Patients Co-infected with HIV and HBV

Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment. Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Therefore, therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV/HBV co-infected patients who are not also receiving HAART. Before initiating entecavir therapy, HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients. Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use.

5.3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis

Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors, including entecavir, alone or in combination with antiretrovirals. A majority of these cases have been in women. Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors. Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease; however, cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors.

Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported, often in association with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures. Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis. Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations).

### Safety and efficacy of switching to alternative nucleoside analogues following symptomatic hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis [^111jnyPu]. AIDS (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rechallenging patients who have recovered from nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-induced symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis with alternative NRTI-containing regimens.

Methods

Data in this case series was collected from patients followed at the UCSD Owen Clinic from July 1998 through September 2002. Cases of symptomatic hyperlactatemia were HIV-infected adults receiving NRTI who had symptoms compatible with hyperlactatemia and two lactates > 2 times the upper normal limit. Lactic acidosis was defined as lactate > 5 mmol/l with bicarbonate < 20 mmol/l. The suspected offending NRTI in the prior regimen were replaced with other NRTI thought to have equivalent antiviral potency but less mitochondrial toxicity.

Results

Ten patients diagnosed with symptomatic hyperlactatemia and two with lactic acidosis were later restarted on antiretrovirals that included new NRTI. The NRTI that patients were receiving when symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis was diagnosed included stavudine and lamivudine (n = 6), stavudine and didanosine (n = 4), and stavudine and abacavir (n = 2). The median (range) peak lactate was 5.4 (4.7–19.1) mmol/l. Five patients were rechallenged with abacavir and lamivudine, five with zidovudine, abacavir and lamivudine, and two with zidovudine and lamivudine. Among the 12 patients contributing over 22 years of cumulative reexposure to NRTI-containing therapy, one developed symptomatic hyperlactatemia again yielding a recurrence rate of 45.5 cases/1000 patient-years. Virologic control was maintained in all patients.

Conclusions

This data supports the strategy that in cases of symptomatic hyperlactatemia or lactic acidosis in which the toxicity is associated with stavudine, didanosine or both, it is safe and efficacious to reintroduce NRTI that are less potent inhibitors of mitochondria.

### Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir (viekira pak)-induced lactic acidosis [^112pu7e3]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case series of three patients with hepatitis C virus infection who all presented with severe type B lactic acidosis shortly after starting treatment with ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir.

Design

Case series.

Setting

ICU.

Patients

Three patients, all who had HCV cirrhosis with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) and had started taking ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir within the preceding 2 weeks, presented with similar nonspecific symptoms of lethargy, fatigue, and nausea. All had elevated lactate levels at admission without evidence of hypovolemia, cardiogenic failure, or vasodilatory shock.

Interventions

All patients were given appropriate supportive intensive care for what was initially suspected to be sepsis, including a minimum of 30mL/kg of IV fluids, infectious workup including blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and mechanical ventilatory support. The first patient received continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. The second patient received hemodialysis. The third patient was initially started on hemodialysis despite high norepinephrine requirements and ultimately transitioned to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.

Measurements and Main Results

The first patient died despite maximal intensive care. The second patient improved immediately upon starting hemodialysis and was extubated within 48 hours and discharged home. The third patient eventually became hypotensive and was treated with repeated sessions of renal replacement therapy. He ultimately was extubated and discharged home. The infectious workup was negative for all three patients, and antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days in the second and third patients.

Conclusions

Ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir-dasabuvir may cause type B lactic acidosis. Further study is warranted to identify risk factors and elucidate the mechanisms of excessive lactate production.

### Hyperlactataemia syndromes associated with HIV therapy [^116MqL3C]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2003). Medium credibility.

Hyperlactataemia is seen in 8–18.3% of HIV-infected patients taking nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Recent epidemiological studies suggest that most episodes are transient and subclinical. However, symptomatic and occasionally life-threatening cases accompanied by metabolic acidosis and hepatic steatosis (ie, lactic acidosis syndrome) have also been described. Though yet to be fully elucidated, the proposed mechanism is NRTI-induced inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase culminating in derangements in oxidative phosphorylation and lactate homeostasis. Signs and symptoms range from mild hyperlactataemia accompanied by nausea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss to severe, intractable lactic acidosis complicated by coma and multi-organ failure. Significant progress has recently been made with regard to the natural history of NRTI-related hyperlactataemia. However, other important aspects of the disorder, such as its pathogenesis, predisposing conditions, and management, remain poorly understood. This article reviews the current published work on these issues, identifies areas of controversy, and addresses directions for future research.
