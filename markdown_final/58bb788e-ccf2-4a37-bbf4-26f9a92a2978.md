## Question

Dry eye disease treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dry eye disease treatment options organized into a practical, severity-based management approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the overarching treatment principles and whether a strict stepwise algorithm is appropriate. Then, I should verify how to stratify disease severity and classify etiologies. Next, I will review foundational nonpharmacologic and lubricant strategies, followed by targeted anti-inflammatory therapies and procedure-based options. After that, I should consider special populations such as Sjögren's syndrome, perioperative patients, and those with severe disease. Finally, I need to check the evidence quality, set realistic expectations, and outline follow-up and adjustment strategies to close the loop on care.

> Let me first confirm the general principles before proposing any algorithm. Management should be individualized to etiology and severity, address modifiable causative factors, and avoid rigid stepwise progression; therapies from any "step" can be used concurrently based on clinician judgment and patient preference, which is emphasized in AAO 2024 guidance and reinforced by TFOS DEWS II's caution that a one-size-fits-all stepladder fails to capture disease heterogeneity [^116RkKQp] [^112QSkKH] [^115jmPN2].

> Wait, let me verify the severity and etiologic classification so I don't anchor on symptoms alone. Several frameworks grade severity by symptoms, signs, and tear parameters, and many emphasize distinguishing aqueous-deficient, evaporative (often meibomian gland dysfunction), and mixed phenotypes; I initially thought there were five levels, but hold on, the commonly used DEWS scheme and the Latin American LUBOS consensus use four practical grades, and recognizing discordance between signs and symptoms is essential for tailoring therapy and selecting appropriate outcome measures at follow-up [^115egzf9] [^112tiZea].

> I need to ensure the foundational nonpharmacologic and lubricant strategies are in place before escalating. Patient education about chronicity, prognosis, and adherence; environmental and lifestyle modifications (humidification, blink training, screen-use optimization, sleep and exercise); lid hygiene and warm compresses for blepharitis/MGD; and frequent preservative-free lubricants with nighttime ointments are first-line, with EULAR and BSR specifically recommending preservative-free drops every 2–3 hours for Sjögren's and daytime tears with or without bedtime ointment in general practice, while recognizing that liposomal sprays may help in evaporative DED [^111g9q9v] [^112MxuF9] [^112MrxHZ] [^114uwhxB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diet. I initially considered omega-3s broadly, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. Cochrane 2019 found low-to-moderate certainty evidence with inconsistent symptom benefit and only small, possibly not clinically meaningful changes in tear metrics, and AAO 2024 judges the evidence insufficient for moderate-to-severe DED; I need to counsel that fish oil may be tried with caution and not expected to replace pharmacotherapy, whereas EULAR supports structured education and tear-conserving strategies more reliably than systemic supplements for ocular dryness in Sjögren's [^112pro5x] [^111nAX7u] [^113qyDu8] [^111g9q9v].

> Next, I should review anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapies and their positioning. Topical corticosteroids provide short-term symptom and staining improvements but carry risks of IOP elevation; Cochrane suggests small-to-moderate benefit over lubricants for symptoms and corneal staining over 1–8 weeks, so a pulsed, closely monitored course (e.g., loteprednol 0.25% for 2–4 weeks) is reasonable for flares while planning maintenance therapy [^113QrcEb] [^116ezGLq] [^112uuWhS].

> Let me consider T-cell immunomodulators next. Cyclosporine 0.05% or 0.09% is FDA-approved and supported by multiple RCTs and guidelines; it improves symptoms and tear function in many patients, though onset can be slow and tolerability can limit adherence, which I should discuss upfront to set expectations and consider concurrent short-term steroids to bridge symptoms [^112sBKi7] [^115qgGc9] [^1137BzF9].

> I should confirm where lifitegrast fits. Lifitegrast 0.5% is FDA-approved and, in post hoc analyses of moderate-to-severe DED, showed higher odds of simultaneous improvement in signs and symptoms versus placebo; tolerability issues such as burning/dysgeusia occur and may influence persistence, so shared decision-making and counseling on taste disturbance are important [^112sBKi7] [^115y3qJM] [^115qgGc9].

> But wait, what if we need faster symptomatic relief without the steroid risks? Varenicline nasal spray 0.03 mg twice daily activates the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway and increases tear production with a rapid onset; it is FDA-approved for DED and can be layered with other therapies, though I should screen for nasal irritation or sneezing and coordinate with other nasal medications [^112sBKi7] [^115qgGc9].

> I will now examine procedure-based options for persistent disease. Punctal plugs reduce tear drainage and can improve comfort; however, I need to ensure ocular surface inflammation is controlled first because plugs may worsen inflammation in select cases, and BSR advises careful selection in Sjögren's, which I should document in the consent discussion [^114GUcGi] [^111omY1M].

> Let me review in-office meibomian gland procedures. Thermal pulsation (e.g. LipiFlow) and intense pulsed light can improve meibomian gland function and symptoms in evaporative DED, but evidence quality varies and BSR notes insufficient evidence for routine use in Sjögren's despite acceptable safety; I should frame these as adjuncts after optimizing home therapies and consider cost and access [^111EYbQK] [^113QoL6A].

> For refractory or severe disease, I should confirm advanced options. Autologous serum or allogeneic serum/platelet-rich plasma drops can be considered when conventional therapy fails, with AAO and BSR supporting their use in Sjögren's and severe inflammatory DED; I need to ensure appropriate sourcing, storage, and infection risk mitigation, and discuss realistic timelines for benefit [^114e9SDe] [^112sJrq2] [^1163JABU].

> Next, I should review systemic considerations, especially in aqueous-deficient phenotypes. Oral secretagogues such as cevimeline or pilocarpine can increase tear production when residual gland function exists; dosing should be titrated to salivary and ocular response and gastrointestinal effects, and BSR supports a trial of pilocarpine in appropriately selected Sjögren's patients with residual function [^112B6vy7] [^116L6KLz].

> Hold on, I should verify surgical and procedural reserves for end-stage or anatomically driven disease. Surgical punctal occlusion (cautery), amniotic membrane grafting, tarsorrhaphy, and even salivary gland transplantation are options in Step 4 algorithms for refractory cases; these require subspecialty referral and careful case selection given invasiveness and variable evidence [^116DGn4J] [^115STSRG].

> Let me consider Sjögren's syndrome specifically, since the pathophysiology and refractoriness differ. First-line remains frequent preservative-free lubricants, with escalation to topical ciclosporin under ophthalmic supervision, short pulsed corticosteroids for flares, and consideration of autologous serum or PRP if conventional therapy is insufficient; systemic secretagogues can be added for combined sicca, and punctal plugs should be used cautiously due to potential to worsen inflammation, with shared decision-making emphasized [^111g9q9v] [^116hEhfK] [^112sJrq2] [^111omY1M].

> I should double-check perioperative management implications. Untreated DED can degrade refractive measurements and postoperative satisfaction; a multimodal preoperative regimen that includes optimized lubrication, anti-inflammatory control, and meibomian gland therapies can stabilize the ocular surface and improve outcomes, which I should coordinate with the surgical team early [^113yy39U] [^113B3xbp].

> Next, I should review evidence quality so I don't overstate benefits. An overview of reliable systematic reviews found no conclusive high-certainty evidence for any single DED intervention, though several modalities show probable benefit; heterogeneity in outcomes and risk of bias are common, and there is a recognized need for core outcome sets and better-designed trials, which I should communicate when setting expectations [^113QoL6A] [^115MYjB3].

> I need to ensure patient expectations are realistic and adherence is supported. Many pharmacologic anti-inflammatories have delayed onset (weeks to months), tolerability issues can drive discontinuation, and costs can be substantial; counseling on these realities, providing written plans, and scheduling timely follow-up to titrate therapy are essential to persistence and outcomes [^111g1FCa] [^112ELDvy] [^117ATu2e].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and adjustment strategy. Early follow-up (2–4 weeks) after initiating or changing therapy allows assessment of symptoms, signs, and adherence, with subsequent visits tailored to severity and response; I should be prepared to layer therapies, switch classes for tolerability, and escalate to procedural or advanced options if goals are unmet, documenting objective measures where feasible to guide decisions [^113qDw2Y] [^112Fq36L].

Dry eye treatment is **stepwise and individualized**, starting with **preservative-free artificial tears** and **lid hygiene**, then adding anti-inflammatories (cyclosporine, lifitegrast, short-course corticosteroids) [^113QrcEb] [^112sBKi7], punctal plugs [^114GUcGi], and in-office MGD therapies (thermal pulsation, IPL) [^114g5CgZ] for persistent symptoms. For refractory cases, consider **autologous serum tears** [^114e9SDe], **scleral lenses** [^114e9SDe], or **surgical options** (punctal occlusion, tarsorrhaphy) [^116DGn4J]. Address **modifiable factors** (environment, medications, screen time) [^111iph5G] [^112QSkKH] and tailor therapy to severity and etiology; **omega-3 supplements have limited evidence** [^112pro5x] and should not replace standard care [^111nAX7u].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological measures are foundational and should be initiated early, with **patient education** on the chronic nature of DED and the need for ongoing management [^111ev2eA] [^111g1FCa].

- **Environmental modifications**: Humidifiers, avoiding dry/windy conditions, and reducing screen time [^111iph5G] [^112QSkKH].
- **Lid hygiene**: Daily warm compresses and lid scrubs for blepharitis/MGD [^114g5CgZ] [^113Eoo6A].
- **Dietary supplements**: Omega-3s may help some, but evidence is mixed; not a substitute for standard care [^112pro5x] [^113qyDu8].

---

## Artificial tears and lubricants

Artificial tears are **first-line** and should be **preservative-free** to avoid toxicity with frequent use [^112MxuF9] [^114g5CgZ].

| **Type** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Carboxymethylcellulose | Refresh Tears | Mild to moderate DED |
| Hyaluronic acid | Blink Tears | Moderate to severe DED |
| Lipid-containing drops | Systane Balance | Evaporative DED |
| Ointments | Refresh PM | Nighttime use |

---

## Anti-inflammatory therapies

Inflammation is a **key driver**; **anti-inflammatory therapy** is indicated for moderate to severe DED or when symptoms persist despite lubricants [^116cMn6Q] [^115cyQrz] [^111PX6kK].

- **Cyclosporine 0.05% or 0.09%**: Reduces inflammation and increases tear production; onset over weeks to months [^112sBKi7] [^1137BzF9] [^115qoCPY].
- **Lifitegrast 5%**: LFA-1 antagonist; improves signs and symptoms in moderate to severe DED [^115y3qJM] [^114jSte4].
- **Short-course corticosteroids**: Loteprednol 0.25% for rapid relief in flares; monitor for IOP rise and cataract [^113QrcEb] [^116ezGLq].

---

## Procedures and devices

Procedural options are for **refractory cases** or when **conservative measures fail** [^114e9SDe].

- **Punctal plugs**: Reduce tear drainage; effective in aqueous-deficient DED [^114GUcGi] [^112QSkKH].
- **Thermal pulsation (LipiFlow)**: Meibomian gland clearance for evaporative DED [^114g5CgZ].
- **Intense pulsed light (IPL)**: Reduces inflammation and improves meibomian gland function [^114g5CgZ] [^112QSkKH].
- **Autologous serum tears**: For severe refractory DED, especially in Sjögren's [^112sJrq2] [^1163JABU].
- **Scleral contact lenses**: Protect the ocular surface and retain moisture [^115jtRtc] [^115mQ36z].
- **Surgical options**: Punctal cautery or tarsorrhaphy for severe refractory cases [^116DGn4J] [^115STSRG].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies show promise but require **further study** [^113QoL6A].

- **Neuromodulation**: Nasal neurostimulation (e.g. varenicline nasal spray) to stimulate tear production [^112QSkKH] [^114g5CgZ].
- **Regenerative medicine**: Stem cell and bioengineered approaches under investigation [^1177QCgc].
- **Novel delivery systems**: Nanotechnology and drug-eluting contact lenses [^1177QCgc].

---

## Personalized and stepwise care

Management should be **tailored to severity**, etiology, and patient preferences, with escalation as needed [^116RkKQp] [^114g5CgZ].

| **Severity** | **Treatment approach** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Preservative-free artificial tears <br/> - Lid hygiene <br/> - Environmental modifications [^112MxuF9] [^111iph5G] |
| Moderate | - Add anti-inflammatory therapy (cyclosporine, lifitegrast) <br/> - Consider punctal plugs [^112sBKi7] [^114GUcGi] |
| Severe | - Autologous serum tears <br/> - Scleral lenses <br/> - Surgical options <br/> - Intensive anti-inflammatory therapy [^112sJrq2] [^116DGn4J] |

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Adherence**: Chronic therapy and side effects reduce persistence [^111g1FCa] [^115qoCPY].
- **Cost**: Long-term therapy, especially anti-inflammatories, can be expensive [^117ATu2e] [^114jSte4].
- **Evidence gaps**: Many interventions lack high-quality, conclusive evidence [^113QoL6A] [^116GWBN9].

---

Dry eye management is **multimodal and individualized**, starting with lubricants and hygiene, then adding anti-inflammatories and procedures for refractory disease, with emerging therapies on the horizon.

### Gaps in current knowledge and priorities for future research in dry eye [^116GWBN9]. Cornea (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dry eye, a common yet underrecognized and evolving field, has few recommended treatment algorithms, mostly based on expert consensus rather than robust research evidence. There are high costs associated with managing dry eye and conducting research to identify effective and safe long-term treatments. To support evidence-based management of dry eye, our purpose was to identify and prioritize important clinical research questions for future clinical research.

Methods

We translated recommendations from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's 2013 Preferred Practice Patterns for dry eye into answerable clinical research questions about treatment effectiveness. Clinicians around the world who manage patients with dry eye rated each question's importance from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important) using a 2-round online Delphi survey. We considered questions as "important" if ≥ 75% of respondents assigned a rating of 6 or more in round 2. We mapped the identified important clinical research questions to reliable systematic reviews published up to March 2016.

Results

Seventy-five clinicians from at least 21 countries completed both Delphi rounds. Among the 58 questions, 24 met our definition of "important": 9/24 and 7/24 addressed topical and systemic treatments, respectively. All 4 questions with the highest 25th percentiles addressed topical treatments. Although 6/24 "important" questions were associated with 4 existing reliable systematic reviews, none of these reviews came to a definitive conclusion about treatment effectiveness.

Conclusions

We identified gaps pertaining to treatment options for dry eye. Future clinical research on the management of dry eye should strongly consider these prioritized questions.

### Inflammation in dry eye disease: how Do we break the cycle? [^116cMn6Q]. Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

This article reviews the literature and summarizes the role of inflammation in dry eye disease. A PubMed search was performed using the keywords inflammatory cycle and dry eye. All searches were limited to articles published in or translated into the English language, dating from 1973 through March 2017. There were no restrictions on the study design. Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of dry eye disease has revealed that inflammation is a core driver: the so-called "vicious circle" of inflammation. Researchers continue to analyze the precise mechanisms by which inflammation occurs. This has led to therapeutic options to break the cycle. Continued animal and human studies reveal other potential sites for treatment in this complex host of disorders.

### Tolerability of current treatments for dry eye disease: a review of approved and investigational therapies [^11313tvr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common, multifactorial ocular disease impacting 5% to 20% of people in Western countries and 45% to 70% in Asian countries. Despite the prevalence of DED and the number of treatment approaches available, signs and symptoms of the disease continue to limit the quality of life for many patients. Standard over-the-counter treatment approaches and behavior/environmental modifications may help some cases but more persistent forms often require pharmacological interventions. Approved and investigational pharmaceutical approaches attempt to treat the signs and symptoms of DED in different ways and tend to have varying tolerability among patients. While several pharmacological approaches are the standard for persistent and severe disease, mechanical options provide alternate treatment modalities that attempt to balance efficacy and comfort. Newer approaches target the causes of DED, utilizing novel delivery methods to minimize irritation and adverse events. Here, we review approved and investigational approaches to treating DED and compare patient tolerability.

### Tolerability of current treatments for dry eye disease: a review of approved and investigational therapies [^111MTPLy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In moving beyond artificial tears, treatments for DED focus on the multitude of complex mechanisms that may be implicated in the disease. The persistent burden on the patient and impact DED has on QoL facilitate further evaluation of increasingly effective and well-tolerated treatments. Although currently approved treatments have improved outcomes, AEs and poor tolerability mean these therapeutic options are not suitable for all patients. However, new treatments or regimens with improved AE profiles are becoming increasingly more tolerable. Additionally, educating patients on the nature of the disease as well as tools to mitigate potential treatment-related AEs will encourage patient adherence and lead to improved treatment outcomes.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^115jmPN2]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome — staging notes — one or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state, options within a category are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid, the evidence available to support options differs and may be lower for newer options so each treatment option should be considered in accordance with the level of evidence available at the time management is instigated, and the severity and etiology of the dry eye disease state will dictate the range and number of options selected from one or more steps.

### Managing dry eye disease and facilitating realistic patient expectations: a review and appraisal of current therapies [^111g1FCa]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite the broader understanding of DED that we enjoy today and the advent of numerous, multimodal forms of therapy, there are still many challenges and limitations. Some of the current limitations of DED therapy may be addressed by new treatment options such as OTX-101. These newer options may help decrease the time to symptom relief, providing the patient with an incentive for treatment continuation. New treatment options may also have a favorable tolerability profile, which may enhance patient persistence. By addressing the limitations of the current pharmacologic therapies, new therapeutic options may help eye care practitioners more effectively treat and manage DED.

Managing DED appropriately and facilitating realistic patient expectations are necessary to ensure patient satisfaction and compliance with their treatment. Practitioners should explain the etiologies of the condition in clear and comprehensible terms, as well as the goals and expected length of time for all therapies prescribed. Moreover, eye care practitioners need to emphasize that the interventions may be slow to yield results, and that therapy must be continued even after the symptoms have improved. These are the cornerstones of successfully managing patients with DED.

### Managing dry eye disease and facilitating realistic patient expectations: a review and appraisal of current therapies [^112aU1C2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by loss of homeostasis of the tear film and accompanied by ocular signs and symptoms such as corneal and conjunctival damage, patient discomfort, and visual disturbance. The prevalence of DED ranges from 5%−33%. Patients with DED may have a reduced quality of life due to their discomfort and visual disturbances. The multifactorial nature of DED requires a multi-targeted treatment approach to address the signs and symptoms. Treatment for DED should follow a step-wise approach beginning with education, dietary modification, and lid and lash hygiene, and progressing to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Ocular lubricants, a mainstay of DED therapy, provide temporary symptomatic relief for the patient, but do not address the underlying pathophysiology. Some currently available pharmacologic treatments that address the underlying pathophysiology of DED may have a delay of 3−6 months in the onset of therapeutic effect; however, these treatment options may also have tolerability issues. These challenges highlight the need for newer pharmacologic treatments with an earlier onset of observable clinical effect and the potential for improved tolerability profile. Patient education is vital to DED management and should convey the complex and chronic nature of DED. It is important for the eye care practitioner to set realistic expectations with the patient when managing DED to help improve treatment success. This helps the patient understand the need for ongoing treatment and that results will likely not be seen immediately. This review covers the current management of DED, focusing on pharmacologic management, and offers recommendations for the practitioner to help facilitate realistic patient expectations for the treatment of DED.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116RkKQp]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome management — general principles emphasize that patients with dry eye symptoms often have many contributory factors and it is imperative to treat any causative factors that are amenable to treatment; tear replacement is frequently unsuccessful when used as the sole treatment if additional causative factors are not concomitantly addressed; patient education is a critically important aspect of successful management, and the ophthalmologist should educate the patient about the natural history and chronic nature of dry eye; realistic expectations for therapeutic goals should be set and discussed with the patient; and Table 3 lists a staged approach to treating dry eye syndrome, noting that specific therapies may be chosen from any category regardless of the level of disease severity, depending on physician experience and patient preference.

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^115nF17E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is frequently undertreated. Barriers to appropriate treatment include the time required to adequately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment based on the patient's severity level, the perception by clinicians that the condition has minor impact on patient well-being, the perception by patients that the disease is normal or less important than other conditions that require treatment, lack of understanding of the disease process, and a perceived paucity of therapeutic options. Supplemental artificial tears and eyelid hygiene are common treatment modalities for dry eye disease, yet many patients continue to experience significant disruption to their daily lives. Our findings suggest that dry eye symptoms are frequently troublesome to the patient at all levels of disease severity, and require attention and adequate treatment. A complete and comprehensive medical and ocular history conducted by clinicians should help correctly identify patients who may have ambiguous symptoms without clinical signs or vice versa, and allow proper treatment and management of dry eye disease.

### Trends in dry eye disease management worldwide [^115cyQrz]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Survey Results

Given the extensive research and development into new therapeutic options for the treatment of DED we anticipated a modified treatment approach among practitioners. Where the more traditional treatments work to address the symptoms and restore the ocular surface, the newer therapeutic modalities endeavour to reverse the primary cause of the DED (such as inflammation).

In this literature review the general trend among practitioners did follow a stepwise treatment approach. Mild dry eye was treated with non-preserved artificial tear substitutes combined with lid hygiene. Therapeutics for moderate to severe dry eye meant the addition of non-preserved gels or ointments and topical anti-inflammatories. In addition, it was found that the proportion of anti-inflammatory drugs used increased with the treatment of moderate to dry eye. There seems to be consensus over the last twenty years that therapeutic management is based on disease severity. Successful management can be determined by improvement of patient-reported symptoms and a reduction in ocular signs.

### A practical approach to severity classification and treatment of dry eye disease: a proposal from the Mexican dry eye disease expert panel [^1161VY2c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is an increasingly prevalent, multifactorial, and highly complex health problem that may require multidisciplinary management for the ocular surface alterations and their neurological, metabolic, and immunological aspects. Successful management of the disease relies on early diagnosis, correct classification of subtype and severity of DED, followed by a customized treatment strategy which focuses on resolving the problems experienced by the individual patient, together with in-depth and effective follow-up to minimize the problem, thus improving the patient's quality of life. Next step, we intend to validate the proposed DED severity classification of the Mexican Dry Eye Disease Expert Panel in the setting of controlled studies.

It is important to remember that the term "dry eye" describes a multifactorial condition, the hallmarks of which are signs on the ocular surface with clinical manifestations and etiologies that vary inter-individually. Therefore, the patient's dry eye severity classification evaluation should be comprehensive, practical, and accessible to any eye care clinician. In this way, a systematic and individualized treatment approach accounting for each affected individual's specific circumstances will assure improvement of her (his) therapeutic outcome.

### Dysfunctional tear syndrome: a Delphi approach to treatment recommendations [^1159fvXk]. Cornea (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop current treatment recommendations for dry eye disease from consensus of expert advice.

Methods

Of 25 preselected international specialists on dry eye, 17 agreed to participate in a modified, 2-round Delphi panel approach. Based on available literature and standards of care, a survey was presented to each panelist. A two-thirds majority was used for consensus building from responses obtained. Treatment algorithms were created. Treatment recommendations for different types and severity levels of dry eye disease were the main outcome.

Results

A new term for dry eye disease was proposed: dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS). Treatment recommendations were based primarily on patient symptoms and signs. Available diagnostic tests were considered of secondary importance in guiding therapy. Development of algorithms was based on the presence or absence of lid margin disease and disturbances of tear distribution and clearance. Disease severity was considered the most important factor for treatment decision-making and was categorized into 4 levels. Severity was assessed on the basis of tear substitute requirements, symptoms of ocular discomfort, and visual disturbance. Clinical signs present in lids, tear film, conjunctiva, and cornea were also used for categorization of severity. Consensus was reached on treatment algorithms for DTS with and without concurrent lid disease.

Conclusion

Panelist opinion relied on symptoms and signs (not tests) for selection of treatment strategies. Therapy is chosen to match disease severity and presence versus absence of lid margin disease or tear distribution and clearance disturbances.

### How can we best diagnose severity levels of dry eye disease: current perspectives [^1137rWb9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common ocular condition, but the diagnosis relative to other ocular conditions and the evaluation of severity of the condition has often been difficult. This challenge can be due to clinical signs and symptoms not always correlating with each other. An understanding of the various components which create the condition, as well as the diagnostic measures used to evaluate these components, is useful to the clinician working with DED patients. This review paper will discuss traditional diagnostic options, diagnostic imaging, and Advanced Point of Care testing capabilities to determine the severity level of dry eye disease more adequately.

### Treatment of Sjögren's syndrome-associated dry eye an evidence-based review [^1166HiV6]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Outcomes-based review of reported treatment options for patients with dry eye secondary to Sjögren's syndrome (SS).

Clinical Relevance

Dry eye affects many individuals worldwide. Significant proportion of patients with dry eye has underlying SS, a progressive autoimmune condition. The few suggested guidelines for the treatment of dry eye are mostly based on severity of symptoms and/or clinical findings rather than on outcomes analysis, and do not differentiate SS from other causes of dry eye. METHODS AND LITERATURE REVIEW: A search strategy was developed to identify prospective, interventional studies of treatments for SS-associated dry eye from electronic databases. Eligible references were restricted to English-language articles published after 1975. These sources were augmented by hand searches of reference lists from accessed articles. Study selection, data extraction, and grading of evidence were completed independently by ≥ 4 review authors.

Results

The searches identified 3559 references as of August 10, 2010. After duplicate review of the titles and abstracts, 245 full-text papers were assessed, 62 of which were relevant for inclusion in the review.

Conclusions

In the current literature on SS-associated dry eye, there is a paucity of rigorous clinical trials to support therapy recommendations. Nonetheless, the recommended treatments include topical lubricants, topical anti-inflammatory therapy, and tear-conserving strategies. The efficacy of oral secretagogues seems greater in the treatment of oral dryness than ocular dryness. Although oral hydroxychloroquine is commonly prescribed to patients with SS to alleviate fatigue and arthralgias, the literature lacks strong evidence for the efficacy of this treatment for dry eye.

### Expert opinion in the management of aqueous deficient dry eye disease (DED) [^115h6HhD]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The need for alternative, more effective DED treatments is clear. By determining current practice patterns, this survey offers insight into alternative therapies that are already being used amongst practitioners. Additionally, the results of this survey identify therapies of interest and important clinical outcomes that can aid in the development of future clinical studies.

### Call to action: treating dry eye disease and setting the foundation for successful surgery [^113yy39U]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common disease that can reduce the quality of life. Prevalence estimates vary but have been reported to be as high as 60% in some populations. Diagnosis is complicated by a multifactorial etiology and a disconnection between clinical signs and patient-reported symptomatology. Critically, preexisting DED can exacerbate postoperative dry eye symptoms and reduce patient satisfaction after ocular surgery, highlighting the value of thorough evaluation and screening for signs and symptoms of DED in preparation for ocular surgery. This article reviewed predisposing and exacerbating factors for DED and presented an argument for the importance of adequately treating DED prior to surgery, from the perspective of both the patient and the provider. It briefly reviewed currently available methodologies and emphasized the utility of multimodal diagnosis and treatment algorithms to optimize outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Managing dry eye disease and facilitating realistic patient expectations: a review and appraisal of current therapies [^112ELDvy]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dry eye disease (DED), also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by symptoms such as ocular discomfort and visual disturbance. The reported prevalence of DED estimates vary widely, from 5% to 33%, which may reflect both differing populations and inconsistent diagnostic criteria. Patients with moderate-to-severe DED may experience a reduced quality of life due to ocular pain, difficulty in performing daily activities, and depression. There is also a significant societal cost, both indirect (eg, reduced work productivity) and direct (eg, treatment costs).

Many patients believe that once they begin treatment for DED, they will see an immediate improvement in their symptoms. It is essential that the eye care practitioner helps the patient understand the need for ongoing treatment, and that results will likely not be seen immediately. The patient also needs to be instructed that there may be adverse events from the treatment itself, such as instillation site pain. This review discusses the etiology of DED, as well as recommendations for management of DED and the limitations encountered in the current treatment for DED, and finally, how to facilitate realistic patient expectations for the treatment of DED.

### Update in current diagnostics and therapeutics of dry eye disease [^1135PVrs]. Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Dry eye disease (DED) represents a heterogeneous group of conditions with tear film insufficiency and signs and/or symptoms of ocular surface irritation. The clinical manifestations of DED can be highly variable; hence the diagnosis is often based on a combination of symptoms, signs, and clinical tests, given that any one of these alone would miss a significant number of patients. Similarly, the treatment must often be tailored to each patient by targeting the specific mechanisms involved in his or her disease. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances that have allowed us to better recognize, categorize, and treat patients with DED. The most notable new diagnostic tests in DED are tear film osmolarity, inflammatory biomarkers, and meibomian gland imaging. Therapeutically, anti-inflammatory therapy, meibomian gland heating and expression, and scleral contact lenses are some of the latest options available for treating DED.

### Dry eye syndrome: an update in office management [^116whDuo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and tear film that results in ocular discomfort, visual disturbances, and tear instability, with potential damage to the cornea and conjunctiva. Risk factors for dry eye syndrome include age (> 50 years old), female sex, environments with low humidity, systemic medications, and autoimmune disorders. There are several treatment options that range from artificial tears to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agents. Treatment of this highly prevalent condition can drastically improve the quality of life of individuals and prevent damage to the ocular surface.

### Advances, limitations and future perspectives in the diagnosis and management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome [^112WhdG1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a complex systemic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands such as the lacrimal glands. Dry eye disease is one of the most prevalent complications of Sjögren's syndrome, affecting most patients. It significantly impairs quality of life and management is often difficult and unsatisfactory, in part due to weak correlation between symptoms and signs and poor recognition of the three main subtypes aqueous-deficient, evaporative and neuropathic dry eye. This review provides an overview of key aspects of dry eye disease, such as its multifactorial aetiology and recent insights into pathophysiology. The uses and pitfalls of commonly-used diagnostic tests for dry eye are reviewed, as well as the increasing number of new imaging technologies and biomarkers to refine diagnosis. There are many current and emerging treatment options for dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome, but high-level evidence of efficacy is mostly lacking, as are evidence-based treatment algorithms. All these aspects make the management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome challenging.

### Advances in understanding and managing dry eye disease [^116LgMnt]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present evidence from the literature and scientific meetings to support fundamental changes in concepts regarding the prevalence, pathogenesis, definition, diagnosis, management of dry eye disease (DED) and the prospects for the development of new therapies.

Design

Analysis and clinical perspective of the literature and recent presentations.

Methods

Review and interpretation of literature.

Results

The tear film and ocular surface form an integrated physiologic unit linking the surface epithelia and secretory glands via a neural network. This sensory-driven network regulates secretory activity in quantity and composition, supporting the homeostasis of the system. The tear film forms a metastable covering between blinks, subserving clear vision, and maintains the health and turnover of the ocular surface cells. Disturbance of intrinsic factors such as increasing age; hormonal balance; systemic or local autoimmune disease, or both; systemic drugs or extrinsic factors including topical medications; environmental stress; contact lens wear; or refractive surgery result in a final common pathway of events at the tear film and ocular surface, resulting in DED. Diagnosis of DED and the design of clinical trials for new drugs have been hampered by a lack of correlation between signs and symptoms and flawed endpoints; successful new drug applications likely will require new approaches, such as the use of objective biomarkers for disease severity.

Conclusions

Recent advances in our knowledge of the causation of DED open opportunities for improving diagnosis and disease management and for developing new, more effective therapies to manage this widely prevalent and debilitating disease state.

Dry eye syndrome staged management — Step 3 states that if the above options are inadequate consider oral secretagogues, autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops, platelet-rich plasma eye drops, blood based products, and therapeutic contact lens options (soft bandage lenses with caution and rigid scleral lenses). One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state, and options within a category are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid. It should be noted that the evidence available to support the various management options differs and will inevitably be lower for newer management options.

### TFOS DEWS III: management and therapy [^114g5CgZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

This report provides an evidence-based review of current strategies to manage dry eye disease (DED). First-line management focuses on methods to replenish, conserve and stimulate the tear film, with an emphasis on ocular supplements, which remain the cornerstone of DED treatment. Meibomian gland dysfunction, a primary contributor to DED, is typically treated with warm compresses and a wide variety of in-office treatments, including device-driven technologies to warm the eyelids, intense pulsed light therapy, low-level light therapy and other new and emerging technologies. Lid hygiene treatments include lid wipes, anti-Demodex therapies, blepharoexfoliation and topical antibiotics. DED caused by certain etiological drivers can benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies, including corticosteroids, T-cell immunomodulatory topical drugs and a wide variety of pharmacological agents, in addition to biologic tear substitutes such as autologous serum and platelet-rich plasma. Emerging therapies, such as neuromodulation via nasal neurostimulation and novel pharmacological treatments offer potential future options. Advanced options, including amniotic membrane grafts and complex surgical methods, provide options for severe or refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications, including optimized blinking, dietary supplementation and environmental adjustments, play a crucial role in long-term management. Patient education and adherence to treatment regimens remain essential for sustained symptom relief. The TFOS DEWS III prescribing algorithm provides an evidence-based framework to offer guidance to clinicians in selecting relevant interventions based on disease etiology that aim to provide targeted management of the subtype of DED that an individual is experiencing.

### Choice of artificial tear formulation for patients with dry eye: where do we start? [^117R1yc2]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

Dry eye is prevalent in many parts of the world. As a result, ophthalmologists and other health care professionals, such as optometrists and general practitioners, often help these patients manage their symptoms. The most common form of treatment for management of dry eye is over-the-counter tear lubricants. A number of tear lubricant formulations are available that vary by their mechanism of action. This article suggests simple guidelines on how lubricants can be selected for patients with mild to moderate dry eye. Side effects of lubricants, such as burning on instillation because of mismatches of eye drop with tear acidity, are also discussed.

### Diagnosing the severity of dry eye: a clear and practical algorithm [^115egzf9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Several systems for classifying DED severity already exist. The Triple Classification System bases severity on the continuing presence of symptoms, along with increasing signs of disease. The DEWS approach ranks DED severity on four levels, centred around simultaneous exacerbation of signs and symptoms. New Japanese DED diagnostic criteria now include symptomatology, and the presence of symptoms and signs is required for a diagnosis of 'definite dry eye', which correlates with more severe disease. All these classification systems require severe signs and severe symptoms for a diagnosis of severe disease. However, the ODISSEY scoring algorithm provides diagnostic pathways for patients with more complex discordant DED.

There are several limitations to the use of this model. The method of panel-based consensus is by its very nature not necessarily evidence based. The paucity of 'gold-standard' DED biomarkers with well-established criteria also impacts any attempt to standardise DED severity evaluation. Furthermore, the use of specific recommended assessments will heavily depend on local availability, training and cost. There is also an issue of pre-existing differences in definitions of dry eye. For example, the Japanese recognise a short break-up time, dry eye condition, characterised by very short TBUT and severe symptoms, but with minimal surface damage. This scenario is very similar to Scenario C of the algorithm presented in this paper. The Japanese do not consider this condition severe, however, following the DEWS approach and the algorithm presented here, it would satisfy criteria for diagnosis as severe DED.

Nevertheless, by using a hierarchical approach to provide a range of acceptable marker options relevant for each patient it is hoped that, after extensive validation, this algorithm can be broadly applied across a range of clinical and geographical settings.

The next stage is to test the validity of the ODISSEY scoring algorithm in the context of clinical trials. It is hoped implementation of this tool will help to better define trial outcomes and accelerate clinical development of new treatments. Once validated, this algorithm will also aid the ophthalmologist in patient follow-up and treatment optimisation.

Introduction

Why develop a novel pharmaceutical agent for dry eye disease (DED)? In the annals of ophthalmic drug discovery and development, dry eye has a vast history of clinical trial failures leading to collective disappointment for patients and clinicians who are seeking new therapeutic options. The general approach for managing DED has not changed dramatically over the past 50 years; lubricating artificial tears and punctal plugs represent the mainstay of therapy to alleviate disease symptoms and enhance ocular surface tear film volume. For patients, the symptoms of chronic ocular discomfort, dryness, and irritation are associated with significant impairment in their visual-related quality of life. For eye care specialists, DED remains one of the most common reasons for patient visits and the burden is increasing as the population ages. Attempts to advance new drug treatments to the marketplace have not been without significant effort. Of the nearly 30 programs that have endeavored to develop a pharmaceutical agent for DED (and estimated billions of dollars invested in research and development), only cyclosporine-A (CsA) 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion (Restasis ®; Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, cyclosporine emulsion has its limitations in the treatment of dry eye. It is indicated solely to increase tear production and not for the treatment of the oft-disabling symptoms associated with DED. It has a long onset of action (eg, up to 6 months) and has failed to show a significant dose response; many patients discontinue its use due to the burning sensation associated with administration. Even with the availability of cyclosporine, the overwhelming majority of surveyed ophthalmologists (94%) desire additional treatment options. Thus, a large unmet need remains for newer agents that can rapidly diminish the symptoms of disease, have a rapid onset of action, protect the ocular surface, and are well tolerated.

### Agreement of physician treatment practices with the international task force guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of dry eye disease [^113DTmQx]. Cornea (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical implementation of guidelines for the treatment of dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS) developed by the International Task Force (ITF) of dry eye disease experts.

Methods

Nine physicians implemented the ITF guidelines for 3 months. Newly diagnosed patients with DTS rated their ocular symptoms and were clinically examined. Using the guidelines, physicians determined the DTS severity level (0–4, where 4 is most severe) and made their therapeutic choices.

Results

Of 183 patients enrolled (mean age, 65.1 years; range, 25–91 years), 67% presented without lid margin disease, and 68% had no apparent ocular surface inflammation. Symptoms were significantly more severe in patients with altered tear distribution or evident inflammation (P < 0.05). Most patients diagnosed at severity level 1 did not have lid margin disease (56/61, 92%), and inflammation was not apparent (53/58, 91%); 43% of severity level 1 patients (27/63) were treated at level 2 (therapeutic choices include unpreserved tears or topical cyclosporine). Most patients presenting with inflammation were diagnosed at severity level 2 (74%, 32/43). More than 9 in 10 severity level 2 patients were treated at level 2 (100/106; 94%). Physicians reported that 96% of their treatment recommendations were consistent with management they would have recommended if they had not consulted the ITF guidelines. They spent an average of 4.5 minutes per patient applying the guidelines.

Conclusions

Implementation of the ITF guidelines was simple and not time consuming. Many practitioners chose to treat patients diagnosed at severity level 1 with treatments at level 2 that include unpreserved tears and topical cyclosporine.

### A practical approach to severity classification and treatment of dry eye disease: a proposal from the Mexican dry eye disease expert panel [^11258Cis]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dry eye disease (DED) has a higher prevalence than many important systemic disorders like cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, representing a significant quality of life burden for the affected patients. It is a common reason for consultation in general eye clinics worldwide. Nowadays, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach at the high corneal and ocular surface specialty level should be reserved for cases of severe and chronic dry eye disease associated with systemic autoimmune diseases or complicated corneal and ocular surface pathologies. In such cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic approach is often complex, elaborate, time-consuming, and costly due to the use of extensive dry eye questionnaires, noninvasive electronic diagnostic equipment, and clinical laboratory and ancillary tests. However, other eye care specialists attend a fair amount of DED cases; therefore, its diagnosis, classification, and management should be simple, practical, achievable, and effective. Considering that many patients attending non-specialized dry eye clinics would benefit from better ophthalmological attention, we decided to elaborate a practical DED classification system based on disease severity to help clinicians discriminate cases needing referral to subspecialty clinics from those they could attend. Additionally, we propose a systematic management approach and general management considerations to improve patients' therapeutic outcomes according to disease severity.

Managing DED

Treatment goals include the reduction of inflammation and the restoration of tear film homeostasis, which, in turn, would optimize preoperative measurements, maximize postoperative outcomes, and improve patient satisfaction. Several treatment options are available for DED regardless of whether patients are undergoing surgery or not. To reach treatment goals, a combination of these options may be the best approach. Treatments such as procedural/devices, anti-inflammatory medications, supplements, and lifestyle modifications can be considered. Figures 1 to 3 show various preoperative treatments of dry eye and the postoperative outcomes.

### Systematic review of randomised clinical trials on topical ciclosporin A for the treatment of dry eye disease [^1137BzF9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Topical ciclosporin A (CsA) is a therapeutic option for dry eye disease (DED) to control ocular surface inflammation and improve tear function. The aim of this study is to systematically review data from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy and safety of topical CsA treatment for DED.

Methods

Articles published up to December 2012 were identified from Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A total of 18 RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of different topical CsA formulations for the treatment of DED were selected according to the set criteria. The Jadad score was calculated to assess RCT quality.

Results

The mean Jadad score of the included RCTs was 2.8 ± 0.6. All CsA formulations proved safe for the treatment of DED. Symptoms improved in 100% (9/9) RCTs, tear function improved in 72% (13/18) RCTs and ocular surface damage was ameliorated in 53% (9/17) RCTs in patients with DED. No improvements with CsA treatment versus control were observed in DED resulting from surgical procedures, contact lens use and thyroid orbitopathy. Statistical comparison of CsA efficacy through a meta-analysis of data was not possible due to a lack of standardised criteria and comparable outcomes among studies.

Conclusions

Although topical CsA appears to be a safe treatment for DED, evidence emerging from RCTs is limited, and this affects the strength of recommendations to healthcare providers and policymakers for optimal management. Standardised diagnostic criteria to assess the efficacy of topical CsA are recommended to improve the design of future RCTs in DED.

### Dry eye disease: consideration for women's health [^112cKMCZ]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

DED can be a complex and time-consuming condition to manage, and some individuals with DED experience refractory symptoms. It is well supported that the sex and gender differences between women and men, especially as they age, contribute to differences in the prevalence and severity of DED.

In this study, we have reviewed sex and gender differences in DED causes, clinical sign presentation, patient experience of symptoms, and — perhaps most relevantly — differences in treatment response and efficacy. While some of these differences are biological, with sex-specific hormones having a great effect on DED etiology, there are also comorbidities and gender-based factors that contribute to DED risk in women. Because there is a strong association of autoimmune diseases and DED, especially those that primarily affect women, both systemic and overall effects of DED need to be assessed in treatment options of DED and comorbidities. The high burden of comorbidities women with DED face suggests they would benefit from an interdisciplinary approach to DED treatment. Women are diagnosed with DED at earlier ages, and progression to severe forms of the disease is more prevalent in women than men. Thus, earlier diagnosis of DED in women may result in a significant improvement in their quality of life.

In light of the many women's health topics raised here with associations to DED, opportunities for educating women and health care providers on this highly prevalent and burdensome disease should be maximized; and when dry eye is suspected, referral to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a dry eye examination is warranted.

### Personalized management of dry eye disease: beyond artificial tears [^112QSkKH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments for Dry Eye Disease: Beyond Artificial Tears

The major cause of DED for each patient should be identified and therapies should be based on individual characteristics. Depending on the severity and subtype, the presence of inflammation, and the presence of external and behavioral factors that may be contributing to DED, the management of DED may be different between individuals and even different during various stages of a patient's life. The goal of management is to restore homeostasis of the ocular surface. Indeed, the TFOS DEWS II Management and Therapy Report highlights that for DED, a step-wise treatment approach is not possible due to the complexity of the disease and the variability between patients. Furthermore, management of DED may require more than one treatment and thus patient understanding of the benefits and limitations of their treatments, as well as their expectation needs to be discussed. Behavioral changes should be encouraged, for example healthier digital screen habits. For inflammation in DED, several topical anti-inflammatory therapies exist, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and lifitegrast. These therapies have been recommended as potential treatment options for both evaporative and aqueous deficient DED. For patients with MGD, additional treatment options include warm compresses with lid massage, manual meibomian gland expression, oral omega supplements, thermal pulsation, intraductal probing, intense pulsed light, and topical antibiotics, which are aimed at improving meibomian gland expressibility. For patients with aqueous deficiency, additional possible therapies include moisture chamber eye wear and punctal plugs, which are aimed at improving retention of the aqueous tear film. Importantly, eyelid disease and inflammation may need to be treated before the insertion of punctal plugs so that infection and inflammatory mediators may first be cleared. Therapies to promote tear production include varenicline solution nasal spray, external neurostimulation, and oral pilocarpine.

Patients with DED may show a mixture of clinical features, including inflammation, MGD, and aqueous deficiency. Therefore, the most prominent clinical feature may need to be considered at the start. In addition to comorbidities, possible triggering events (eg, prior surgery, medications, and contact lens use) are factored in to identify disease characteristics and shape treatment decisions. History of previous treatments can provide guidelines for new or supplemental therapies. Notably, patients may show changes in disease characteristics over time, which may require corresponding adjustments in treatment.

Follow-up after initiating various treatments is highly recommended to confirm patients are adhering to treatments as well as ensuring improvements are occurring to the ocular surface.

### Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids for dry eye disease [^112pro5x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements, involving omega-3 and/or omega-6 components, have been proposed as a therapy for dry eye. Omega-3 PUFAs exist in both short- (alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]) and long-chain (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) forms, which largely derive from certain plant- and marine-based foods respectively. Omega-6 PUFAs are present in some vegetable oils, meats, and other animal products.

Objectives

To assess the effects of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplements on dry eye signs and symptoms.

Search Methods

CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, two other databases and three trial registries were searched in February 2018, together with reference checking. A top-up search was conducted in October 2019, but the results have not yet been incorporated.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving dry eye participants, in which omega-3 and/or omega-6 supplements were compared with a placebo/control supplement, artificial tears, or no treatment. We included head-to-head trials comparing different forms or doses of PUFAs.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 34 RCTs, involving 4314 adult participants from 13 countries with dry eye of variable severity and etiology. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. Nine (26.5%) studies had published protocols and/or were registered. Over half of studies had high risk of bias in one or more domains. Long-chain omega-3 (EPA and DHA) versus placebo or no treatment (10 RCTs) We found low certainty evidence that there may be little to no reduction in dry eye symptoms with long-chain omega-3 versus placebo (four studies, 677 participants; mean difference [MD] -2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.14 to 0.19 units). We found moderate certainty evidence for a probable benefit of long-chain omega-3 supplements in increasing aqueous tear production relative to placebo (six studies, 1704 participants; MD 0.68, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.09 mm/5 min using the Schirmer test), although we did not judge this difference to be clinically meaningful. We found low certainty evidence for a possible reduction in tear osmolarity (one study, 54 participants; MD -17.71, 95% CI -28.07 to -7.35 mOsmol/L). Heterogeneity was too substantial to pool data on tear break-up time (TBUT) and adverse effects. Combined omega-3 and omega-6 versus placebo (four RCTs) For symptoms (low certainty) and ocular surface staining (moderate certainty), data from the four included trials could not be meta-analyzed, and thus effects on these outcomes were unclear. For the Schirmer test, we found moderate certainty evidence that there was no intergroup difference (four studies, 455 participants; MD: 0.66, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.77 mm/5 min). There was moderate certainty for a probable improvement in TBUT with the PUFA intervention relative to placebo (four studies, 455 participants; MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.07 seconds). Effects on tear osmolarity and adverse events were unclear, with data only available from a single small study for each outcome. Omega-3 plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone (two RCTs) For omega-3 plus conventional therapy versus conventional therapy alone, we found low certainty evidence suggesting an intergroup difference in symptoms favoring the omega-3 group (two studies, 70 participants; MD -7.16, 95% CI -13.97 to -0.34 OSDI units). Data could not be combined for all other outcomes. Long-chain omega-3 (EPA and DHA) versus omega-6 (five RCTs) For long-chain omega-3 versus omega-6 supplementation, we found moderate certainty evidence for a probable improvement in dry eye symptoms (two studies, 130 participants; MD -11.88, 95% CI -18.85 to -4.92 OSDI units). Meta-analysis was not possible for outcomes relating to ocular surface staining, Schirmer test or TBUT. We found low certainty evidence for a potential improvement in tear osmolarity (one study, 105 participants; MD -11.10, 95% CI -12.15 to -10.05 mOsmol/L). There was low level certainty regarding any potential effect on gastrointestinal side effects (two studies, 91 participants; RR 2.34, 95% CI 0.35 to 15.54).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the findings in this review suggest a possible role for long-chain omega-3 supplementation in managing dry eye disease, although the evidence is uncertain and inconsistent. A core outcome set would work toward improving the consistency of reporting and the capacity to synthesize evidence.

### Outcomes evaluated in randomized controlled trials of treatments for dry eye: a systematic review [^115MYjB3]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To initiate the process of core outcome set development for dry eye disease (DED) by conducting a systematic review of all outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for DED. A core outcome set is an agreed-upon minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials in a topic area.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase from January 1, 2016 to January 3, 2024 for RCTs of treatments for DED. Post hoc, we decided to focus on recent evidence and excluded RCTs published before 2016. Two independent investigators screened titles and abstracts (initially) and full-text articles (subsequently), resolving conflicts through discussion. We refined a previously developed outcome taxonomy for DED. We extracted all outcome domains and measurement instruments used for those domains in the included sample of RCTs.

Results

Our searches identified 6477 unique records, and we included 300 RCTs. The most frequently used outcome domains across all RCTs were tear film stability (90.6% of RCTs), overall assessment of ocular symptoms (84.3%), corneal staining score (75.7%), tear production (66.0%), conjunctival staining score (39.7%), visual acuity (35.0%), meibomian gland plugging/clogging grade (27.0%), inferior tear film meniscus height (16.0%), and adverse events (28.0%). There was considerable inconsistency regarding measurement instruments.

Conclusions

Variability in outcome measures and instruments used underscores the need for a core outcome set for DED. Our next steps are to begin prioritizing the identified outcomes for a core outcome set for DED.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a condition frequently encountered in ophthalmology practice worldwide. The purpose of this literature review is to highlight the worldwide trends in DED diagnosis and therapy amongst practitioners and determine if a more uniform approach to manage this multifactorial condition has developed over the past two decades. A manual literature search utilizing PubMed was conducted to obtain papers with survey results relating to ophthalmology and optometry diagnosis and treatment of dry eye from January 2000 to January 2020. This did not include data from clinical trials as we were only interested in community clinical practice trends. The terms "dry eye" and "survey" were searched in combination with one or more of the following words or phrases: prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, therapy, etiology, risk factors, therapy, and quality of life. Papers were selected based on their direct applicability to the subject and were only included if they contained relevant survey data from community practitioners. The available literature suggests common trends worldwide in the diagnosis and treatment of DED. These trends have not modified substantially over the past two decades. Practitioner education on the benefits of measuring tear film homeostasis could increase its use as a diagnostic tool to complement current tools. Of the results found, 75% of the papers were published after 2006 and only one paper after 2017. More recent survey results are required to determine if research into DED pathophysiology is altering the current trend in DED management.

### Efficacy of lifitegrast ophthalmic solution, 5.0%, in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease: a post hoc analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^115y3qJM]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are post hoc treatment outcomes of lifitegrast by severity of dry eye disease (DED)?

Findings

In this post hoc analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials including 1429 patients, treatment with lifitegrast in the subgroup with an inferior corneal staining score of greater than 1.5 and eye dryness score of at least 60 at baseline (ie, moderate to severe DED) showed lifitegrast-treated participants had higher odds of achieving simultaneous improvement in clinical signs and symptoms than placebo-treated participants.

Meaning

The results of this post hoc analysis suggest that lifitegrast treatment may be associated with a response in the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe DED.

### Economic burden and loss of quality of life from dry eye disease in Canada [^111PX6kK]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Dry eye disease (DED) is a complex, multifactorial disorder of the periocular tear film that may result in damage to the ocular surface and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. Globally, the estimated prevalence of DED ranges between 5% and 50%. In Canada, the prevalence of DED has been estimated at 21%.

Diagnosis of DED should consider symptomatology, visual disturbance, tear film stability and composition, tear volume, damage and/or inflammation of the ocular surface and eyelid aspects (eg, blepharitis, lid wiper epitheliopathy). In particular, the major cause of DED needs to be recognised before treatment plans can be developed.

The Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) II proposed a stepwise treatment approach with follow-up to monitor signs and symptoms of DED, in order to ensure that other comorbid ocular surface diseases are also treated appropriately. Initially, DED is often treated with ocular lubricants. If this approach proves inadequate, prescribed topical drugs (eg, antibiotics, corticosteroids, secretagogues and immunomodulatory or lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 antagonist drugs) or oral antibiotics can be considered. Additional options include overnight chamber devices and tear conservation measures. Where treatment remains ineffective, the next step is to use serum eye drops, therapeutic contact lenses or oral secretagogues. If the above measures fail to control the disease, the TFOS DEWS II report identifies further options as lacrimal duct occlusion or longer term topical corticosteroids (monitored closely to minimise potential adverse side effects such as cataract formation and glaucoma).

### Combination of hyaluronic acid, carmellose, and osmoprotectants for the treatment of dry eye disease [^113y54g9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Final conclusions

DED is an often chronic disease that tends to need prolonged treatment. It is a highly prevalent pathology that may have a very significant effect on the ability to perform daily tasks, and therefore, it requires adequate treatment from the early stages of the disease. The combination of HA, CMC, and osmoprotectants has proven to be effective in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye through the synergic action of all its components. Therefore, it can be a recommended option for dry eye of any degree of severity. Overall, artificial tear substitutes are a therapeutic option that can be used from mild cases to the most severe cases in combination with other treatments and multidisciplinary recommendations, which may include hygienic, nutritional, psychological, and lifestyle measures and how to adjust environmental conditions.

### Latin American consensus on ocular lubricants and dry eye disease (LUBOS): a report on severity classification, diagnosis, and therapy [^112tiZea]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This consensus aims to establish a practical severity classification for applying a tailored stepladder treatment algorithm helpful to any clinician.

Methods

A modified Delphi methodology was used to establish a consensus on the definition, diagnosis, severity classification, and treatment algorithms for dry eye disease (DED) adapted to the needs of Latin America. The consensus focused on promoting the effective use of lubricants and providing straightforward, practical guidance for ophthalmologists treating dry eyes. Twenty-eight corneal specialists from representative Latin American countries reviewed the scientific evidence and drew on their expertise to answer specifically designed open-ended questions.

Results

A simple diagnostic algorithm (clinical history, DED questionnaire, and dry eye clinical tests) identified patients with the disease. A practical severity classification system of four grades: mild, moderate, severe, and LUBOS plus DED was based on four criteria: OSDI, film break-up time, Sjögren International Collaborative Clinical Alliance ocular surface staining score, and international workshop on meibomian gland dysfunction meibomian gland functionality test. For classification, ≥ 2 criteria of the highest severity grade from the worse eye were considered. A stepladder therapeutic algorithm aligned with disease severity consisted of 5 steps, each with proposed and recommended treatment alternatives. Patient education, lifestyle recommendations, adverse environment avoidance, lubricants, and eyelid therapy were reinforced during the therapy period.

Conclusions

The LUBOS expert panel consensus considered the diverse geoenvironmental, socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic factors pertinent to Latin America. This consensus offers an accessible and cost-effective tool, enabling professionals to detect, evaluate, and grade the severity of dry eye disease effectively for planning adequate therapeutic strategies that can be monitored with confidence.

### Physician satisfaction with anti-inflammatory topical medications for the treatment of dry eye disease [^112eomFk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ophthalmic disorders. Pathogenesis of the disease includes inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland. Two anti-inflammatory prescription treatments are currently available: cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% (CYC) and lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution (LIF). The objective of this survey-based study was to assess physician satisfaction with CYC and LIF for the treatment of DED.

Methods

Physicians currently treating DED patients with CYC or LIF were asked to rate the experiences of their patients currently or formerly using CYC and LIF, and their own perspectives on the two treatments.

Results

Twenty-one physicians participated in the survey, providing responses on behalf of 210 patients. Overall, physicians reported low levels of satisfaction with onset of action of CYC and LIF, and fewer than half considered either drug to be effective in managing symptoms or improving patient quality of life (QoL). Burning sensation and dysgeusia were the most frequently reported side effects. Onset of action and effectiveness after onset were the main switching drivers. Although two-thirds of physicians were satisfied with the overall effectiveness of CYC and LIF, all physicians agreed that more DED treatment options are needed, with > 50% strongly agreeing.

Conclusion

Physicians perceived a gap in DED management with currently available topical anti-inflammatory agents. Although satisfaction with CYC and LIF was high, few physicians considered these medications to be effective in managing symptoms or improving QoL.

### Topical lifitegrast therapy for dry eye disease [^114jSte4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

While the extract etiologies of dry eye disease are not completely understood, inflammation of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland likely plays a role in its pathogenesis. Anti‐inflammatory therapies for dry eye disease recommended by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society's Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) include the use of topical corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and lifitegrast. Lifitegrast is an antagonist of lymphocyte function‐associated antigen‐1 (LFA‐1), an integrin found on the surface of lymphocytes. Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1), an adhesion protein and the native ligand of LFA‐1, is normally expressed on antigen‐presenting and endothelial cells. In dry eye disease, ICAM‐1 expression is also increased on conjunctival epithelial cells. By blocking LFA‐1 from interacting with ICAM‐1, lifitegrast prevents the activation of an inflammatory response, resulting in a decrease in inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Lifitegrast is also thought to increase goblet cell number and cell area, as well as tear formation. Due to its small molecular size, lifitegrast also has good solubility in aqueous media, absorption into ocular tissues, and clearance from systemic circulation, thus, giving it good in vitro and in vivo safety profiles.

Lifitegrast therapy was approved for use in dry eye disease by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. However, the application for market authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was withdrawn in June 2020, after it did not receive provisional acceptance, due to concerns about insufficient evidence of efficacy. In the United States and Canada, insurance coverage and cost issues are common barriers to using lifitegrast.

Why it is important to do this review

Treatment of dry eye disease can be challenging for people with dry eye disease and physicians. With the increasing availability of new therapies for dry eye disease, systematic reviews are needed to summarize and GRADE the evidence substantiating their safety and efficacy. A recent overview of systematic reviews found no reliable systematic reviews evaluating the use of lifitegrast for dry eye disease. The goal of this review is to fill that gap, and help people with dry eye disease and physicians make informed decisions about their options for dry eye therapy.

### Topical corticosteroids for dry eye [^113QrcEb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dry eye disease (DED), arising from various etiologic factors, leads to tear film instability, ocular surface damage, and neurosensory changes. DED causes symptoms such as ocular dryness, burning, itching, pain, and visual impairment. Given their well-established anti-inflammatory effects, topical steroid preparations have been widely used as a short-term treatment option for DED. Because of potential risks of ocular hypertension, cataracts, and infections associated with the long-term use of topical steroids, published trials comparing the efficacy and safety of topical steroids (versus placebo) have mostly been of short duration (three to eight weeks).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids compared with no treatment, placebo, other steroidal or non-steroidal therapies, or a combination of therapies for DED.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), without restriction on language or year of publication. The date of the last search was 20 August 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, were compared with no treatment, artificial tears (AT), vehicles, AT plus tobramycin, or cyclosporine A (CsA).

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We identified 22 RCTs conducted in the United States, Italy, Spain, China, South Korea, and India. These RCTs reported outcome data from a total of 4169 participants with DED. Study characteristics and risk of bias All trials recruited adults aged 18 years or older, except one trial that enrolled children and adolescents aged between 3 and 14 years. Half of these trials involved predominantly female participants (median 79%, interquartile range [IQR] 76% to 80%). On average, each trial enrolled 86 participants (IQR 40 to 158). The treatment duration of topical steroids ranged between one week and three months; trial duration lasted between one week and six months. Eight trials were sponsored exclusively by industry, and four trials were co-sponsored by industry and institutional or governmental funds. We assessed the risk of bias of both subjective and objective outcomes using RoB 2, finding nearly half of the trials to be at high risk of bias associated with selective outcome reporting. Findings Of the 22 trials, 16 evaluated effects of topical steroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, as compared with lubricants (AT, vehicle), AT plus tobramycin, or no treatment. Corticosteroids probably have a small to moderate effect on improving patient-reported symptoms by 0.29 standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.42) as compared with lubricants (moderate certainty evidence). Topical steroids also likely have a small to moderate effect on lowering corneal staining scores by 0.4 SMDs (95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) (moderate certainty evidence). However, steroids may increase tear film break-up time (TBUT) slightly (mean difference [MD] 0.70 s, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) but not tear osmolarity (MD 1.60 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -10.47 to 13.67; very low certainty evidence). Six trials examined topical steroids, either alone or in combination with CsA, against CsA alone. Low certainty evidence indicates that steroid-based interventions may have a small to moderate effect on improving participants' symptoms (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.15), but little to no effect on corneal staining scores (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.35) as compared with CsA. The effect of topical steroids compared to CsA alone on TBUT (MD 0.37 s, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.87) or tear osmolarity (MD 5.80 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -0.94 to 12.54; loteprednol etabonate alone) is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. None of the included trials reported on quality of life scores. Adverse effects The evidence for adverse ocular effects of topical corticosteroids is very uncertain. Topical corticosteroids may increase participants' risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio [RR] 5.96, 95% CI 1.30 to 27.38) as compared with lubricants. However, when compared with CsA, steroids alone or combined with CsA may decrease or increase IOP elevation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.33). It is also uncertain whether topical steroids may increase risk of cataract formation when compared with lubricants (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.22), given the short-term use and study duration (four weeks or less) to observe longer-term adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence for the specified review outcomes was of moderate to very low certainty, mostly due to high risk of bias associated with selective results reporting. For dry eye patients whose symptoms require anti-inflammatory control, topical corticosteroids probably provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond lubricants, and may provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond CsA. However, the current evidence is less certain about the effects of steroids on improved tear film quality or quantity. The available evidence is also very uncertain regarding the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids on IOP elevation or cataract formation or progression. Future trials should generate high certainty evidence to inform physicians and patients of the optimal treatment strategies with topical corticosteroids in terms of regimen (types, formulations, dosages), duration, and its time-dependent adverse profile.

Treatment and management

Comprehensive and individualized treatment approaches are vital to successfully restoring homeostasis of the ocular surface. These approaches include various therapeutic interventions that are typically determined by the clinical presentation, accurate diagnosis, disease severity level, and DED classification.

The treatment progression for DED follows a step-wise intervention approach, adapted from the protocol of the TFOS DEWS II report, and is presented in Fig. 1. Additional details are provided Table 1. The process begins with step 1, which emphasizes education, lifestyle modifications, and the use of lubricating eye drops. It then advances to step 2, which involves both nonpharmacological and mild pharmacological management, including use of a nonpreserved ocular lubricant and specific prescription medications. If these initial treatment steps are inadequate, more intensive pharmacological management can be implemented in step 3, with further progression to surgical interventions combined with aggressive pharmacological prescriptions in step 4. The severity level of DED may be used to determine the corresponding treatment step (Table 2). If a patient responds positively to the initial treatment, the treatment may be de-escalated to the corresponding disease severity level.

### Personalized management of dry eye disease: beyond artificial tears [^113Eoo6A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The etiology of DED is multifactorial, and thus management of DED cannot be considered as a one-size-fits-all. Personalized treatment for DED involves clinical assessments of tear film and meibomian gland function, as well as taking the patient's medical and treatment history into consideration. The TFOS DEWS II Management and Therapy Report reports various treatments for DED, including topical prescriptions (corticosteroids, secretagogues, antibiotics, LFA-1 antagonist drugs), oral antibiotics, lid hygiene, warm compression, therapeutic contact lenses, moisture chamber and even surgical punctal occlusion. Artificial tears are one of the options in the armamentarium of therapies for DED, and customization of the treatment will likely contribute to the success of DED management because of its complexity and variability among patients.

Risk Factors for Dry Eye Disease Risk factors for dry eye disease include use of contact lenses, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, and history of stem cell transplant. Dry eye disease may be caused by vitamin A deficiency or Bell palsy, a condition involving facial weakness or paralysis that can lead to incomplete eyelid closure. A higher risk of dry eye disease is also seen in individuals with a sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety or depression, even without use of psychiatric medications. Diagnosis and Treatment of Dry Eye Disease. First-line treatment for dry eye disease is use of an artificial tears solution, which lubricates the eye.

It is important to be aware that over-the-counter artificial tears products that contain a preservative can cause toxic conjunctivitis if used more than 4 to 6 times per day. Similarly, eye drops that provide redness relief should be used sparingly. Ophthalmic gels and ointments, which are thicker than artificial tears, may cause blurring of vision so are generally recommended for use before bedtime. Lifestyle Modifications for Dry Eye Disease Aerobic exercise should be encouraged because it increases secretion of tears. Ingestion of low-glycemic-index foods has also been associated with improvement in dry eye symptoms. For individuals who wear contact lenses, decreased frequency of use may be recommended. Which Patients With Dry Eye Disease Should Be Referred to an Ophthalmologist.

Patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease or those whose symptoms do not improve with over-the-counter treatments should be referred for an ophthalmology evaluation. Advanced Treatments for Dry Eye Disease. Ophthalmologists may prescribe topical anti-inflammatory medications, oral or topical antibiotics, autologous serum eye drops, or platelet-rich plasma. Punctal occlusion, which involves insertion of plugs into tear ducts to prevent drainage of tears, may be performed by an ophthalmologist. Another treatment option is scleral contact lenses, which have a reservoir for tears or ophthalmic medications. Surgery may be recommended for patients with dry eye disease due to abnormal eyelid function or anatomy.

### Interventions for dry eye… [^113QoL6A]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What does the body of reliable systematic reviews provide regarding evidence for the effectiveness and safety of various interventions for dry eye. Findings This overview of reliable systematic reviews finds some evidence for interventions, including environmental and dietary modifications, artificial tears and lubricants, punctal occlusion, intense pulsed light therapy, vectored thermal pulsation therapy, topical corticosteroids/cyclosporine A/secretagogues, and autologous serum. However, certainty of evidence is generally low, rendering findings inconclusive. Meaning Most common dry eye interventions may be effective, but the current evidence is largely inconclusive, and most systematic reviews addressing dry eye interventions were not reliable. Importance Dry eye is a common ocular disease that can have substantial morbidity. Systematic reviews provide evidence for dry eye interventions and can be useful for patients, clinicians, and clinical guideline developers.

Overviews of reviews use explicit and systematic methods to synthesize findings from multiple systematic reviews, but currently, there are no overviews of systematic reviews investigating interventions for dry eye. Results were synthesized from reliable systematic reviews to provide summaries of evidence for each intervention. Evidence for each intervention was defined as conclusive or inconclusive depending on whether high-certainty evidence across systematic reviews was available according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations criteria and whether findings reached statistical or clinical significance. Recommendations were made for further research. Findings Within the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US satellite database, 138 potentially relevant systematic reviews were identified, 71 were considered eligible, and 26 were assessed as reliable. Among reliable systematic reviews, no conclusive evidence was identified for any dry eye intervention.

Inconclusive evidence suggested that environmental modifications, dietary modifications, artificial tears and lubricants, punctal occlusion, intense pulsed light therapy, vectored thermal pulsation therapy, topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine A, topical secretagogues, and autologous serum may be effective. Only unreliable systematic reviews evaluated lifitegrast, oral antibiotics, and moisture chamber devices. Conclusions and Relevance This overview of systematic reviews found some evidence that dry eye interventions may be effective, but no conclusive evidence was available. The conduct and reporting of most systematic reviews for dry eye interventions warrant improvement, and reliable systematic reviews are needed to evaluate lifitegrast, oral antibiotics, and moisture chamber devices.
