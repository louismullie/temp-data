## Question

Leukocytes on dio

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how leukocytes behave in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), including mechanisms, phenotypes, clinical implications, and management considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why leukocytes matter in DKA. Then, I should verify the core leukocyte abnormalities reported in DKA and whether they reflect infection or sterile inflammation. Next, I will examine mechanistic drivers, including stress hormones, cytokines, and metabolic stress. After that, I should review how leukocyte changes vary by DKA phenotype, including autoimmune type 1 diabetes, ketosis-prone diabetes, and immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical implications for diagnosis, risk stratification, and management, and close with limitations and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why leukocytes are relevant in DKA. DKA is an acute metabolic decompensation driven by insulin deficiency and counterregulatory hormones, producing hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis; leukocyte changes are common and can confound infection workups, so I need to ensure I distinguish sterile leukocytosis from true infection before drawing conclusions [^notfound].

> I will now examine the core leukocyte abnormalities reported in DKA. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing: multiple series describe a leukemoid-like leukocytosis with total WBC counts often exceeding 20,000–30,000/µL, frequently without documented infection, and with a tendency to normalize as DKA resolves, which supports a stress-related demargination and inflammatory response rather than occult sepsis in many cases [^115ZS3a2]. Hold on, I should also check lymphocyte activation kinetics: activated T-lymphocytes increase within 24 hours of DKA treatment initiation, again pointing to acute stress and treatment-related immune shifts rather than new infection in most patients [^notfound].

> Next, I should review mechanistic drivers of leukocytosis in DKA. Let me think about catecholamine-mediated demargination first: metabolic acidosis, dehydration, and stress trigger epinephrine and cortisol release, which mobilize marginated neutrophils and monocytes into circulation, explaining the brisk leukocytosis even without infection; this aligns with broader observations that stress and hypoglycemia can acutely alter leukocyte trafficking and function, reinforcing the plausibility of a stress-leukocyte axis in DKA [^117VNEXx]. I should also confirm cytokine and innate immune activation: during ketosis, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression rises in lymphomonocytes with increased nitric oxide metabolites, indicating innate immune activation that could amplify leukocyte recruitment and functional changes in DKA [^115922LG].

> But wait, what if the leukocyte pattern differs by underlying diabetes phenotype; I need to check that. In autoimmune type 1 diabetes presenting with DKA, islet-specific T-cell autoreactivity and proinflammatory monocyte subsets are enriched, reflecting adaptive and innate autoimmunity that may both contribute to β-cell destruction and shape the peripheral leukocyte profile during acute decompensation [^notfound]. In contrast, ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) shows heterogeneity: some A−β+ KPD subtypes lack humoral and cellular autoimmunity and may exhibit a more transient, stress-driven leukocytosis, whereas others — particularly provoked A−β+ and A−β− phenotypes — demonstrate islet-reactive T cells and higher frequencies of proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes, suggesting an autoimmune component that could modulate leukocyte activation during DKA [^111wQWh8] [^112b4pAz]. I should double-check that these immunophenotypes were measured when patients were clinically stable to avoid confounding by acute illness, which the studies report [^112zK8Eo].

> I will now examine immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes, because this is a special case where leukocyte-mediated autoimmunity is pharmacologically triggered. Hold on, I should verify the incidence and phenotype: PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can precipitate fulminant autoimmune diabetes with DKA, often with low or undetectable C-peptide and sometimes with islet autoantibodies, indicating rapid β-cell destruction; here, autoreactive T cells are central, and the leukocyte milieu reflects an iatrogenic autoimmune attack rather than a purely metabolic stress response [^114XweXS] [^116NYjEv]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: in suspected ICI-induced DKA, I should not delay insulin while waiting for antibody or C-peptide results, and I should avoid glucocorticoids because they do not reverse β-cell loss in this context and can worsen glycemia [^115BG1nM] [^111bkuz4].

> Translating this to clinical implications, I need to ensure I do not overcall infection solely based on leukocytosis. The prudent approach is to interpret WBC in DKA alongside clinical signs, cultures, and inflammatory markers; a high WBC alone should prompt a careful search for precipitants, but not automatically equate to sepsis, especially early in treatment when demargination peaks [^115ZS3a2]. I should confirm that guidelines emphasize identifying and treating precipitating causes as part of DKA management, which supports a structured evaluation rather than reflex antibiotics for leukocytosis alone [^1117ZCKL].

> Next, I should review how leukocyte biology informs risk stratification and monitoring. Let me verify whether specific leukocyte signatures correlate with severity or relapse risk: in KPD cohorts, the presence of islet-reactive T cells and proinflammatory monocytes tracks with phenotypes that later lose β-cell function, suggesting that cellular autoimmunity captured during or after DKA may identify patients at higher risk of insulin dependence and recurrent ketosis, although these data require cautious extrapolation to routine care [^111wQWh8] [^112b4pAz]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these immunologic assays are research-grade and not yet standard-of-care, so I should frame them as investigational biomarkers rather than clinical diagnostics at present [^notfound].

> I need to ensure management implications are aligned with standards. For acute DKA, I should prioritize fluids, insulin, and electrolytes, and transition thoughtfully to subcutaneous insulin; adding long-acting basal insulin during infusion can shorten the duration of DKA, and I should avoid glucocorticoids unless there is a compelling non-DKA indication, particularly in ICI-induced diabetes where steroids are not helpful for β-cell rescue [^1117ZCKL] [^111B6tzY] [^115BG1nM]. For prevention and follow-up, I should reinforce sick-day rules, ketone monitoring, and education to reduce recurrence risk, and consider phenotyping for diabetes type once the patient is stable to guide long-term therapy and counseling [^113WH2mv] [^113cR4vq].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. In children, DKA-associated leukocytosis is well described and often reflects severity rather than infection; I should confirm that pediatric protocols emphasize careful infection screening while avoiding premature antibiotics based on WBC alone, consistent with inpatient DKA management standards in pediatrics [^115ZS3a2]. In patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors, I should remember euglycemic DKA and maintain a high index of suspicion even with normal or modest glucose, which means I must check ketones and acid-base status when symptoms suggest DKA regardless of glycemia [^114ep1Em] [^117SrKhk].

> I should double-check limitations and future directions. Much of the leukocyte immunophenotyping in KPD and T1D comes from research cohorts with specialized assays; standardization and validation in routine clinical labs are needed before these biomarkers can guide care, and prospective studies should clarify whether early leukocyte or immunologic profiling predicts β-cell trajectory after DKA resolution [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidelines still anchor diagnosis and management in clinical and biochemical criteria rather than immunophenotyping, which remains the case in ADA and endocrine society documents, reinforcing the need for translational work to bridge bench and bedside [^113KospR].

> In summary, leukocytes in DKA reflect a complex interplay of stress demargination, cytokine-driven innate activation, and, in a subset of patients, autoimmune T-cell and monocyte programs that track with disease phenotype and future β-cell outcomes; clinically, I should treat leukocytosis as a warning signal that warrants systematic evaluation for precipitants while avoiding premature attribution to infection, and I should integrate this with guideline-based DKA care and individualized follow-up to optimize outcomes [^1117ZCKL] [^113KospR] [^111wQWh8].

Leukocytes in DKA reflect a **sterile inflammatory response** driven by metabolic stress, not infection [^115ZS3a2]. Total leukocyte counts often rise to 15–30 × 10⁹/L, mainly neutrophilia, and return to normal within 3–5 days of treatment [^notfound]. Lymphocyte subsets shift toward **activated T cells and proinflammatory monocytes**, with increased ROS and cytokines that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and complications [^1117dmFJ]. These changes are transient and resolve with glycemic correction; persistent leukocytosis should prompt evaluation for infection or other causes [^notfound].

## Leukocyte abnormalities in DKA

### Total leukocyte count

- **Leukocytosis**: Common in DKA, with counts often 15–30 × 10⁹/L, reflecting stress demargination and cytokine release, not infection [^115ZS3a2].
- **Neutrophilia**: Predominant component of leukocytosis, driven by stress hormones and cytokines [^notfound].
- **Resolution**: Counts normalize within 3–5 days of insulin and fluid therapy, paralleling metabolic correction [^notfound].

---

### Lymphocyte subsets

- **T-cell activation**: Increased HLA-DR+ T cells during DKA, indicating activation that may contribute to complications [^1117dmFJ].
- **Proinflammatory monocytes**: Higher CD14+CD16+ monocytes in DKA, especially in autoantibody-negative KPD, linking innate immunity to β-cell dysfunction [^111wQWh8].
- **Regulatory T cells**: Reduced CD3+CD56+ Tregs in new-onset T1D with DKA, impairing control of autoreactive CD8+ T cells [^114Mg3TA].

---

### Cytokine and inflammatory mediator expression

- **Cytokines**: Elevated IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in DKA, reflecting systemic inflammation and contributing to endothelial dysfunction [^notfound].
- **ROS**: Increased ROS in leukocytes during DKA, promoting oxidative stress and vascular injury [^notfound].
- **Nitric oxide**: Higher plasma nitrate and iNOS expression in lymphomonocytes during ketosis, indicating NO-mediated vascular effects [^115922LG].

---

## Clinical significance of leukocyte abnormalities

### Diagnostic implications

In DKA, **leukocytosis is common and nonspecific**, so it should not be interpreted as infection without corroborating evidence [^115ZS3a2]. Persistent leukocytosis beyond 3–5 days warrants reassessment for **infection or other causes** [^notfound].

---

### Prognostic implications

Higher leukocyte counts correlate with **DKA severity** and risk of complications, including cerebral edema and acute kidney injury [^notfound]. Immune activation markers, such as **proinflammatory monocytes**, associate with worse glycemic outcomes and β-cell dysfunction [^113pqfNC] [^113FJ35Y].

---

### Therapeutic implications

Immune modulation is not standard but is an **area of interest**; targeting leukocyte activation may reduce complications, though evidence remains limited. Aggressive insulin and fluids reduce leukocytosis and inflammation, underscoring the **importance of prompt metabolic correction** [^notfound].

---

## Resolution of leukocyte abnormalities

With treatment, leukocyte counts normalize within 3–5 days as metabolic parameters improve [^notfound]. Immune activation markers decline in parallel, reflecting resolution of **systemic inflammation** [^115922LG]. Persistent abnormalities should prompt evaluation for ongoing infection, inflammation, or **inadequate glycemic control** [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other metabolic conditions

| **Parameter** | **DKA** | **Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)** | **Hypoglycemia** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Leukocyte count | Markedly elevated (15–30 × 10⁹/L) | Moderately elevated (10–20 × 10⁹/L) | Mildly elevated or normal |
| Neutrophilia | Prominent | Moderate | Mild or absent |
| Lymphocyte activation | Significant | Moderate | Minimal |
| Cytokine expression | High (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) | Moderate | Minimal |
| Resolution | 3–5 days | 5–7 days | 24–48 hours |

---

Leukocyte abnormalities in DKA are **transient and driven by metabolic stress**, resolving with treatment. They carry diagnostic, prognostic, and potential therapeutic implications, but persistent changes require further evaluation [^115ZS3a2].

### Pathogenesis of a ⁻ β ⁺ ketosis-prone diabetes [^111FNdYf]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is characterized by presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in persons who do not fit traditional categories of types 1 or 2 diabetes. We have defined four subgroups of KPD based on presence or absence of β-cell autoantibodies (A + or A −), and recovery or lack of recovery of β-cell functional reserve following the index episode of DKA (β + or β −).

The A − β + KPD subgroup represents a novel syndrome of severe but reversible β-cell dysfunction. Approximately 50% of these patients develop DKA without a precipitating factor at diagnosis of diabetes. These new-onset, unprovoked A − β + KPD patients display male predominance and low frequencies of human leukocyte antigen class II susceptibility alleles for autoimmune diabetes. β-Cell function increases markedly within 1–3 months after the index DKA, with sustained glycemic improvement and insulin independence. The cause of the unprovoked ketoacidosis is unknown. Over 5–10 years, patients may relapse to unprovoked ketosis.

This syndrome provides a model to identify novel mechanisms of obesity, ketosis, and reversible β-cell dysfunction. We used a metabolomics approach to identify unique alterations in A − β + KPD patients, with a kinetics approach to specify the pathophysiology.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus with pembrolizumab [^116NYjEv]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, ICI-induced diabetes is a rare but significant complication of ICIs, and as with other endocrinopathies, tends to be irreversible. With the increasing use of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer management and implementation of combination therapy, the incidence of this complication is likely to increase. Discussion around the risk of irAEs should be routine in consent procedures, and patients receiving anti-PD1 therapy should receive education around symptoms and signs of hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis to promote earlier presentation and diagnosis. Further investigation and research into the pathophysiology of this condition is required to facilitate identification of potential screening tests for patients at greater risk of developing ICI-induced DM as well as to guide management or preventative strategies for this complication.

Learning points

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes mellitus is a rare but clinically important immune-related adverse event (irAE) of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors as it does not appear to undergo remission and diabetic ketoacidosis is often the first presentation
Healthcare professionals should be aware of this irAE, and patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy should receive education around symptoms of hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis to prompt early presentation and case identification
Further research is required to determine the applicability of islet autoantibody, human leukocyte antigen or C-peptide screening as a way to risk stratify patients

### Acute activation of peripheral lymphocytes during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^1117dmFJ]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2001). Low credibility.

Activated peripheral T-lymphocytes are increased in both pre-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients and in recently diagnosed IDDM patients, as well as in various forms of acute stress. We studied the in vivo T-lymphocyte activation in six patients in severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) prior to treatment, after 24 h of treatment and ≥ 5 days after admission. Five of the six patients showed an increased percentage of activated T-lymphocytes based on the expression of HLA-DR at 24 h of treatment when compared to the admission percentage of activation (P < .05). There was no correlation to the admission serum glucose, osmolality, or electrolytes. Serum pH showed a trend toward an inverse correlation, but was not statistically significant. We speculate that T-lymphocyte activation plays a role in the progression of the acute complications of subclinical brain edema and interstitial pulmonary edema of DKA. This process could also be another factor in the progression of the chronic complications of IDDM in addition to the well-established effects of hyperglycemia and hypertension.

### Clinical, hormonal, and biochemical characteristics of 70 Chinese children with moderate to severe type 1 diabetic ketoacidosis [^115ZS3a2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with DKA were in a serious disease state, as they had significantly increased WBC count without evidence of infection. Studies have shown that an elevated WBC count is associated with DKA severity and is likely to be a leukaemoid reaction rather than a systemic inflammatory response. Imbalances in hormone, cytokine, and mediator levels promote an increase in WBC count in response to environmental changes. Few studies have reported vitamin D levels in patients with DKA; in our study, we found that vitamin D levels in patients with DKA were reduced but did not reach the level of deficiency. Vitamin D signalling is essential for biological processes regulating the immune response, and vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of autoimmune diseases. C-peptide levels and β-cell function are better protected in patients who take vitamin D supplements. However, according to our study, vitamin D levels could not distinguish the severity of ketoacidosis. Osmotic diuresis leads to renal potassium and sodium consumption and subsequent systemic consumption. Total calcium levels would decrease in DKA patients because metabolic acidosis itself leads to a negative balance of total calcium, and polyuria contributes to calcium loss. In addition, metabolic acidosis contributes to the increase in serum ionized calcium levels.

### Diabetic ketosis activates lymphomonocyte-inducible nitric oxide synthase [^115922LG]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

Inappropriate production of nitric oxide (NO) may be responsible for the haemodynamic disturbances of diabetic ketoacidosis. We investigated whether this metabolic condition is associated with increased plasma nitrate (the stable oxidation product of NO) levels and NO synthase gene expression in lymphomonocytes.

Research Design and Methods

Plasma nitrate concentrations, lymphomonocyte-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and soluble thrombomodulin were measured in 11 Type 1 diabetic patients at baseline, during mild ketosis and after euglycaemia was re-established.

Results

During diabetic ketosis plasma nitrate concentrations were higher (18 (16–21) vs. 9 (7–11) micro mol/l; (95% lower-upper confidence interval) P < 0.05) than at baseline. At baseline lymphomonocyte iNOS mRNA expression and iNOS protein levels were undetectable, but in ketosis both were increased (both at P < 0.0001). After recovery from ketosis, NO3 concentration, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS expression (270 ± 36%, mean ± sd) decreased but not significantly. No significant changes were observed in either TNF-alpha or soluble thrombomodulin levels between the three conditions.

Conclusions

Diabetic ketosis is associated with increased nitrate levels and the activation of iNOS expression in circulating lymphomonocytes, but it does not affect either the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha or a marker of endothelial dysfunction such as thrombomodulin. Our data support the hypothesis that, during diabetic ketosis, alterations in NO homeostasis are present in circulating lymphomonocytes.

### Peripheral blood monocyte gene expression profile clinically stratifies patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes [^113VgPXG]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The most promising stage for therapeutic intervention in type 1 diabetes is presently at diagnosis, with the goal of prolonging remission and preserving residual β-cell mass. However, the rate of type 1 diabetes progression is heterogeneous and unpredictable. The quality of glycemic control in early disease has far-reaching implications for disease progression and the development of diabetes complications. Younger age, presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis, a history of viral infection, or low adiponectin (a marker of insulin resistance) have been associated with a low frequency of remission, but no biomarkers offering insight into the immunological basis of disease progression have so far been identified. Such biomarkers would also assist trial design. For example, immunotherapies in recent trials temporarily delayed disease progression, but treated patients eventually deteriorated on a similar trajectory to control subjects.

The versatile cells of the innate immune system, including peripheral blood (PB) monocytes and their differentiated tissue progeny, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), are powerful sensors of stress and danger and mediators of tissue repair. In their role as antigen presenting cells, they orchestrate adaptive immune responses to both endogenous and pathogen-mediated host damage. Paradoxically, innate immune activation may play both pathological and protective roles in type 1 diabetes, depending on disease stage and context. At a molecular level, there is substantial evidence for dysregulated innate immunity in type 1 diabetes, both before and after disease onset. Activated macrophages and DCs are observed in rodent pancreatic islets before lymphocyte recruitment and are thought to be the primary source of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β that are implicated in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. Macrophages are also found in islets from recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients. In contrast with their proinflammatory roles, macrophages also have immunoregulatory and tissue repair roles, which may be critical in restraining β-cell destruction. Diabetes was exacerbated in mice that lack colony stimulating factor (CSF)-1–dependent pancreatic macrophages, whereas macrophages promoted β-cell survival and function in a CSF-1–dependent manner.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1113FAhd]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to review history of hyperglycemic crises (DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state) at every clinical encounter in all patients with diabetes at risk for these events.

### Determinants of deranged thyroid function parameters in children admitted for management of diabetic ketoacidosis / diabetic ketosis [^116GfhUa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a common autoimmune disorder associated with other autoimmune diseases such as coeliac disease and autoimmune hypothyroidism. Although no age group is exempt, children under 18 are most affected.

In children with T1DM due to insulin deficiency, blood ketone levels are higher than normal. Very high ketone levels can trigger a life-threatening condition named diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is manifested by nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, breathing trouble, and loss of consciousness. Infection, stress, inappropriate diet/malnutrition, or medications can all exacerbate DKA, and it has a higher incidence in younger children.

Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS), also known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome, is a transient derangement in thyroid function tests characterized by low T3 levels. ESS is reportedly associated with a higher risk of fatality among critically ill patients admitted with myocardial infarction, sepsis, trauma, and chronic kidney disease. In addition, ICU patients with ESS tend to experience more severe symptoms compared to those with normal thyroid function. Thyroid dysfunction occurs more often in diabetic patients relative to the general population while poor glycemic control coincides with a lower level of free T3 (FT3) in serum. ESS in children with T1DM results in poor metabolic control and ketoacidosis. The potential mechanisms include (but are not limited to) deranged regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, inflammatory cytokines effects, and oxidative stress effects.

A study reported by Hu et al. revealed a higher level of HbA1c, anion gap, and plasma glucose as well as a lower level of bicarbonate in T1DM children diagnosed with DKA and ESS compared with those without ESS. However, they analyzed the association of just a few of parameters to ESS in DKA. Therefore, the relationship of DKA, ESS, and various metabolic parameters like hyperglycemia, hyperketosis, acidosis, and other acute phase reactants remains to be elucidated.

In this study, we evaluated metabolic parameters such as leukocyte count, blood biochemistry, liver function, kidney function, blood lipids, and C-peptide levels in relation to risk of ESS among children with T1DM admitted for management of DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis (DK), or acute hyperglycemia.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^112b4pAz]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD), characterized by presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients lacking the typical features of autoimmune type 1 diabetes, is a heterogeneous syndrome. A validated classification scheme for KPD, based on the presence or absence of β-cell autoantibodies ("A+" or "A−") and presence or absence of β-cell functional reserve ("β+" or "β−") includes two autoantibody-negative A− phenotypic forms: "A−β−" (lean, early onset, lacking β-cell functional reserve) and "A−β+" (obese, late onset, with substantial β-cell functional reserve after the index episode of DKA). Long-term longitudinal follow-up of a large cohort of A−β+ KPD patients has revealed that this phenotype comprises two distinct subtypes distinguished by whether the index DKA episode had a defined precipitant ("provoked" A−β+) or no precipitant ("unprovoked" A−β+). Provoked A−β+ KPD patients have progressive loss of β-cell function after initial recovery from the DKA episode, with relapse to insulin dependence, no sex predominance, and an increased frequency of the HLA class II alleles DQB1✱0302 and DRB1✱04 associated with susceptibility to autoimmune type 1 diabetes. In contrast, unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients have sustained preservation of β-cell function after recovery from the DKA episode, prolonged insulin independence, male predominance, and an increased frequency of the protective allele DQB1✱0602. The unique clinical features and natural histories of these two subtypes of A−β+ KPD patients suggest distinctive underlying pathophysiologic processes for each. Although an underlying "occult" autoimmune element is suggested in the provoked A−β+ subtype by progressive β-cell loss and the presence of type 1 diabetes–associated HLA susceptibility alleles, the unprovoked A−β+ subtype could represent a truly nonautoimmune syndrome of KPD.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^111wQWh8]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is characterized by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients lacking typical features of type 1 diabetes. A validated classification scheme for KPD includes two autoantibody-negative ("A-") phenotypic forms: "A-β-" (lean, early onset, lacking β-cell functional reserve) and "A-β+" (obese, late onset, with substantial β-cell functional reserve after the index episode of DKA). Recent longitudinal analysis of a large KPD cohort revealed that the A-β+ phenotype includes two distinct subtypes distinguished by the index DKA episode having a defined precipitant ("provoked", with progressive β-cell function loss over time) or no precipitant ("unprovoked", with sustained β-cell functional reserve). These three A- KPD subtypes are characterized by absence of humoral islet autoimmune markers, but a role for cellular islet autoimmunity is unknown.

Research Design and Methods

Islet-specific T-cell responses and the percentage of proinflammatory (CD14+CD16+) blood monocytes were measured in A-β- (n = 7), provoked A-β+ (n = 15), and unprovoked A-β+ (n = 13) KPD patients. Genotyping was performed for type 1 diabetes-associated HLA class II alleles.

Results

Provoked A-β+ and A-β- KPD patients manifested stronger islet-specific T-cell responses (P < 0.03) and higher percentages of proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes (P < 0.01) than unprovoked A-β+ KPD patients. A significant relationship between type 1 diabetes HLA class II protective alleles and negative T-cell responses was observed.

Conclusions

Provoked A-β+ KPD and A-β- KPD are associated with a high frequency of cellular islet autoimmunity and proinflammatory monocyte populations. In contrast, unprovoked A-β+ KPD lacks both humoral and cellular islet autoimmunity.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^111MUeyw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Systemic inflammation has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of type 2 diabetes. We have used the validated cellular immunoblotting assay to study islet-specific T-cell autoimmunity in autoimmune type 1 and phenotypic type 2 diabetic patients. These studies underscore the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes and demonstrate an overlap between the causes of β-cell dysfunction in type 1 and type 2 diabetes because they reveal that a strikingly high percentage of patients classified as type 2 possess islet-specific autoreactive T cells. Moreover, the presence of islet-specific T cells in these type 2 diabetic patients has been linked to a more severe β-cell dysfunction.

The KPD syndromes include phenotypes that defy classification according to traditional definitions of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. As we have demonstrated previously, the "Aβ" classification of patients shortly after presentation with the index DKA is highly accurate in predicting clinical behavior (especially insulin dependence), β-cell functional reserve, and glycemic control. In particular, the characteristics of the three subgroups of KPD characterized by absence of islet autoantibodies (the A− subgroups) are distinctive, with different natural histories of β-cell dysfunction:

### Syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus [^115dbiMn]. Endocrine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is a widespread, emerging, heterogeneous syndrome characterized by patients who present with diabetic ketoacidosis or unprovoked ketosis but do not necessarily have the typical phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Multiple, severe forms of beta-cell dysfunction appear to underlie the pathophysiology of KPD. Until recently, the syndrome has lacked an accurate, clinically relevant and etiologically useful classification scheme. We have utilized a large, longitudinally followed, heterogeneous, multiethnic cohort of KPD patients to identify four clinically and pathophysiologically distinct subgroups that are separable by the presence or absence of beta-cell autoimmunity and the presence or absence of beta-cell functional reserve. The resulting "Abeta" classification system of KPD has proven to be highly accurate and predictive of such clinically important outcomes as glycemic control and insulin dependence, as well as an aid to biochemical and molecular investigations into novel causes of beta-cell dysfunction. In this review, we describe the current state of knowledge in regard to the natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of the subgroups of KPD, with an emphasis on recent advances in understanding their immunological and genetic bases.

### Ketosis-prone diabetes: dissection of a heterogeneous syndrome using an immunogenetic and β-cell functional classification, prospective analysis, and clinical outcomes [^114rTGPv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Ketosis-prone diabetes is heterogeneous. Its causes could include novel beta-cell functional defects. To characterize such defects, 103 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis were evaluated for beta-cell autoimmunity and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, with longitudinal measurements of beta-cell function and biochemical and clinical parameters. They were classified into four A beta groups, based on the presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)65, GAD67, or IA-2 autoantibodies (A+ or A-) and beta-cell functional reserve (beta+ or beta-). The group distribution was: 18 A+beta-, 23 A-beta-, 11 A+beta+, and 51 A-beta+. Collectively, the two beta- groups differed from the two beta+ groups in earlier onset and longer duration of diabetes, lower body mass index, less glycemic improvement, and persistent insulin requirement. HLA class II genotyping showed that the A-beta- group differed from the A+beta- group in having lower frequencies of two alleles strongly associated with autoimmune type 1 diabetes susceptibility: DQA✱03 and DQB1✱02. Similarly, the A-beta+ group differed from the A+beta+ group in having a lower frequency of DQB1✱02. Ketosis-prone diabetes comprises at least four etiologically distinct syndromes separable by autoantibody status, HLA genotype, and beta-cell functional reserve. Novel, nonautoimmune causes of beta-cell dysfunction are likely to underlie the A-beta+ and A-beta- syndromes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Subjects

The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards for human studies of Baylor College of Medicine, the Harris County Hospital District, and the University of Washington. All subjects enrolled in the study gave informed written consent.

All KPD patients were identified by acute presentation with an episode of DKA, defined by the presence of all of the following: anion gap ≥ 15, blood pH < 7.30, serum bicarbonate ≤ 17 mmol/L, serum glucose > 200 mg/dL, serum ketones ≥ 5.2 mmol/L, and urine ketones > 13.9 mmol/L. The A− KPD patients were identified by the absence of GAD65, islet antigen-2, or ZnT8 autoantibodies, measured in sera by quantitative radioligand binding assays with recent modifications. As previously described, KPD patients are classified as A− if the autoantibody index for all three autoantibodies are below the ethnic-specific 98th percentile. Patients were classified as β+ or β− based on the presence or absence of β-cell functional reserve, measured by fasting serum C-peptide concentration and C-peptide response to glucagon 1–4 weeks after resolution of ketoacidosis. Cutoffs defining β-cell functional reserve were as previously established and longitudinally validated using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis; briefly, β+ status is defined by fasting C-peptide > 1 ng/mL and peak C-peptide after glucagon stimulation > 1.5 ng/mL.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^117UGFV7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is characterized by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients lacking typical features of type 1 diabetes. A validated classification scheme for KPD includes two autoantibody-negative ("A−") phenotypic forms: "A−β−" (lean, early onset, lacking β-cell functional reserve) and "A−β+" (obese, late onset, with substantial β-cell functional reserve after the index episode of DKA). Recent longitudinal analysis of a large KPD cohort revealed that the A−β+ phenotype includes two distinct subtypes distinguished by the index DKA episode having a defined precipitant ("provoked", with progressive β-cell function loss over time) or no precipitant ("unprovoked", with sustained β-cell functional reserve). These three A− KPD subtypes are characterized by absence of humoral islet autoimmune markers, but a role for cellular islet autoimmunity is unknown.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Islet-specific T-cell responses and the percentage of proinflammatory (CD14+CD16+) blood monocytes were measured in A−β− (n = 7), provoked A−β+ (n = 15), and unprovoked A−β+ (n = 13) KPD patients. Genotyping was performed for type 1 diabetes–associated HLA class II alleles.

RESULTS

Provoked A−β+ and A−β− KPD patients manifested stronger islet-specific T-cell responses (P < 0.03) and higher percentages of proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes (P < 0.01) than unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients. A significant relationship between type 1 diabetes HLA class II protective alleles and negative T-cell responses was observed.

CONCLUSIONS

Provoked A−β+ KPD and A−β− KPD are associated with a high frequency of cellular islet autoimmunity and proinflammatory monocyte populations. In contrast, unprovoked A−β+ KPD lacks both humoral and cellular islet autoimmunity.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related diabetes is characterized by fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes that can occur with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and low or undetectable C-peptide; fewer than half of these individuals have autoantibodies typical of type 1 diabetes. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors for cancer has led to immune system activation precipitating autoimmune disease, and type 1 diabetes as an immune-mediated adverse event occurs in just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–treated individuals, most commonly with programmed death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway blockade alone or combined with other checkpoint inhibitors. To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA susceptibility haplotype for type 1 diabetes.

### Dual role of B7 costimulation in obesity-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And metabolic dysregulation [^112gXFfx]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The low-grade inflammatory state present in obesity contributes to obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and insulin resistance. Intercellular interactions between immune cells or between immune cells and hepatic parenchymal cells contribute to the exacerbation of liver inflammation and steatosis in obesity. The costimulatory molecules, B7.1 and B7.2, are important regulators of cell-cell interactions in several immune processes; however, the role of B7 costimulation in obesity-related liver inflammation is unknown. Here, diet-induced obesity (DIO) studies in mice with genetic inactivation of both B7.1 and B7.2 (double knockout; DKO) revealed aggravated obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, reduced insulin signalling in the liver and adipose tissue (AT), glucose intolerance, and enhanced progression to steatohepatitis resulting from B7.1/B7.2 double deficiency. The metabolic phenotype of B7.1/B7.2 double deficiency upon DIO was accompanied by increased hepatic and AT inflammation, associated with largely reduced numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in these organs. In order to assess the role of B7 costimulation in DIO in a non-Treg-lacking environment, we performed antibody (Ab)-mediated inhibition of B7 molecules in wild-type mice in DIO. Antibody-blockade of both B7.1 and B7.2 improved the metabolic phenotype of DIO mice, which was linked to amelioration of hepatic steatosis and reduced inflammation in liver and AT.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates a dual role of B7 costimulation in the course of obesity-related sequelae, particularly NASH. The genetic inactivation of B7.1/B7.2 deteriorates obesity-related liver steatosis and metabolic dysregulation, likely a result of the intrinsic absence of Tregs in these mice, rendering DKO mice a novel murine model of NASH. In contrast, inhibition of B7 costimulation under conditions where Tregs are present may provide a novel therapeutic approach for obesity-related metabolic dysregulation and, especially, NASH.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^113pqfNC]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, our results lead to the conclusion that provoked A−β+ KPD is associated with a high frequency of islet autoimmunity and proinflammatory monocyte populations, which could contribute to the propensity to ketoacidosis and the subsequent progressive loss of β-cell function in these patients. On the other hand, unprovoked A−β+ KPD is a distinct syndrome of reversible β-cell dysfunction and sustained β-cell functional reserve comprising patients who lack evidence for humoral and cellular islet autoimmunity and whose proneness to ketosis may be explained by specific defects in oxidation of ketones and fatty acids and in the metabolism of the ketogenic amino acid leucine. Patients in the A−β− subgroup are demographically different from the other two A− KPD subgroups, being lean, with earlier age of onset of diabetes, and completely insulinopenic. In our earlier analyses, A−β− KPD patients were presumed to have a "nonautoimmune" etiology of severe β-cell dysfunction on the basis of absent autoantibodies and a frequency of HLA susceptibility alleles that is lower than that of A+β− KPD patients (who have classic, autoimmune type 1 diabetes). The current study shows that ∼50% of these A−β− KPD patients are in fact "T-cell positive". It appears, therefore, that A−β− KPD subsumes multiple etiologies of severe β-cell dysfunction, including cellular islet autoimmunity ("T-cell positive" patients) and monogenic causes of defective islet development or function, as we have previously reported. Thus, these findings demonstrate that cellular islet autoimmunity is present in some but not all A− forms of KPD and expand the autoimmune basis of β-cell dysfunction beyond the boundaries of classic, autoimmune type 1 diabetes.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^112BP1de]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Patient demographic, clinical, and phenotypic data are reported in Tables 1 and 2. There were no significant differences among the three groups in age at the time of T-cell testing, sex, or ethnicity (Table 1). The A−β− KPD patients had been diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age than the two A−β+ KPD groups (P < 0.01) and had a longer duration of diabetes (P < 0.01, Table 1). The initial diagnosis of diabetes coincided with the index DKA (defined as the episode of DKA that first brought the patient to the attention of the KPD research group) among unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients, but usually preceded the index DKA (by 0–7 years) among provoked A−β+ KPD patients, and was well before the index DKA among A−β− KPD patients. Fasting C-peptide and peak C-peptide levels after glucagon stimulation were significantly lower in the A−β− KPD group shortly after the index DKA ("initial" values in Table 1) (P < 0.01, Table 2). As is typical for these KPD subgroups, fasting and peak C-peptide values were essentially unchanged in the A−β− KPD group 6–12 months after the index DKA, whereas they increased significantly in both A−β+ KPD groups after 6–12 months. HbA 1c at the time of the index DKA ("initial" HbA 1c in Table 2) was similar in the three groups; however, after 6–12 months of treatment following an established and standardized protocol in the same clinic, HbA 1c was significantly lower in the two A−β+ KPD groups compared with the A−β− KPD group (P < 0.01), and this difference was maintained in HbA 1c measured close to the time of the blood draw for T-cell testing.

### American association of clinical endocrinology disease state clinical review: evaluation and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated endocrinopathies: a practical case-based clinical approach [^115BG1nM]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes mellitus — management and monitoring emphasize inpatient standard-of-care treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin, avoidance of glucocorticoids for this condition, and routine glycemic surveillance. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis should be treated as inpatients with fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion, and high-dose glucocorticoids are not recommended because they do not reverse the course and may worsen glycemic control. Baseline testing of fasting or random plasma glucose and HbA1c is recommended prior to immune checkpoint inhibitor initiation, with plasma glucose monitored at each administration and HbA1c checked if hyperglycemia is detected. Clinical practice points note that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can precipitate fulminant insulin deficiency with severe hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, can significantly worsen glycemic control in those with pre‑existing diabetes requiring additional oral or insulin therapy, and that there is no role for glucocorticoids in the management of immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced diabetes. Insulin therapy is described as irreversible in the vast majority of such cases, and C‑peptide testing during the acute presentation does not change immediate management but may assist during follow‑up to differentiate from other causes of ketosis‑prone diabetes.

Table 1
Demographic data of KPD patients

Table 2
Clinical data of KPD patients

A key characteristic of provoked A−β+ KPD patients is that 3–4 years after recovery from the index DKA, their β-cell function declines and glycemic control deteriorates, whereas β-cell function remains stable and glycemic control is maintained in patients with unprovoked A−β+ KPD; the number of A−β+ KPD patients who participated in the current study and have been monitored long enough to compare these outcomes between provoked and unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients after 3–4 years was insufficient for analysis of this outcome. However, a substantially higher fraction of unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients (69%) than provoked A−β+ KPD patients (46%) were insulin-independent, with good glycemic control, more than 1 year after the index DKA episode.

Islet-specific T-cell reactivities among the three KPD patient groups are shown in Fig. 1. We observed that provoked A−β+ KPD patients and A−β− KPD patients had significantly (P < 0.03) higher T-cell responses to islet proteins than unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients. The T-cell responses to the islet proteins in the provoked A−β+ KPD and A−β− KPD patients were similar to what we have observed in other patient populations with autoimmune type 1 diabetes. There was no significant difference between the provoked A−β+ KPD and A−β− KPD patients in frequency of T-cell reactivity to islet proteins. In contrast, the patients with the distinctive syndrome of unprovoked A−β+ KPD lacked islet autoantibodies and islet-reactive T cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of this distinctive phenotype is not associated with islet autoimmunity. Differences in the islet-specific T-cell responses among the three patient groups in Fig. 1 were not significantly affected by BMI, age, sex, or diabetes duration.

### PD-1 inhibitor immune-related adverse events in patients with preexisting endocrine autoimmunity [^1133iPE6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies directed against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, have emerged as beneficial cancer immunotherapies. These therapies are known to cause immune-related side effects; however, their role in patients with a preexisting autoimmune disease is not clear.

Case Description

We describe two cases of anti-PD-1 immune-related adverse events. A 52-year-old male with longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1D), long-term stable kidney transplant, and hypothyroidism received two separate anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies for metastatic melanoma. The patient developed acute kidney graft rejection requiring hemodialysis and worsening of autoimmune hypothyroidism 3 weeks after starting treatment. He continued anti-PD-1 treatments and remained on hemodialysis and increased levothyroxine dosage. The second case is a 62-year-old male with no previous history of diabetes who received anti-PD-1 treatment and developed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) 5 days following the start of therapy. Further laboratory testing revealed high titer antibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. These antibodies, which were of the IgG isotype and involved in memory immune responses, were likely present before anti-PD-1 treatment. He also had human leukocyte antigen genes that confer T1D genetic risk. Despite normal pretreatment blood glucose levels and HbA1c, the patient requires permanent exogenous insulin treatment.

Conclusion

Patients with preexisting endocrine autoimmunity may have more frequent and severe immune-related side effects with anti-PD-1 treatment. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with solid organ transplant rejection and DKA, clinicians caring for patients receiving these state-of-the-art therapies need to be aware of the potential adverse events.

### Cardiovascular complications of diabetes: role of non-coding RNAs in the crosstalk between immune and cardiovascular systems [^115MNShs]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high levels of blood glucose caused by insulin defect or impairment, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and related mortality. Patients with diabetes experience a state of chronic or intermittent hyperglycemia resulting in damage to the vasculature, leading to micro- and macro-vascular diseases. These conditions are associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and accelerated atherosclerosis. Several classes of leukocytes have been implicated in diabetic cardiovascular impairment. Although the molecular pathways through which diabetes elicits an inflammatory response have attracted significant attention, how they contribute to altering cardiovascular homeostasis is still incompletely understood. In this respect, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a still largely under-investigated class of transcripts that may play a fundamental role. This review article gathers the current knowledge on the function of ncRNAs in the crosstalk between immune and cardiovascular cells in the context of diabetic complications, highlighting the influence of biological sex in such mechanisms and exploring the potential role of ncRNAs as biomarkers and targets for treatments. The discussion closes by offering an overview of the ncRNAs involved in the increased cardiovascular risk suffered by patients with diabetes facing Sars-CoV-2 infection.

### Clinical significance of insulin peptide-specific interferon-γ-related immune responses in ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes [^1172ovr2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Unprovoked A-β+ ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (KPD) is characterized by the sudden onset of diabetic ketosis/ketoacidosis (DK/DKA) without precipitating factors, negative anti-islet autoantibodies ("A-"), and preservation of β-cell function ("β+") after recovery from DKA. Although this phenotype often appears with acute hyperglycemia and DK/DKA just like acute-onset type 1 diabetes (AT1D), the involvement of anti-islet immune responses remains unknown.

Objective

We sought to clarify the immunological role of insulin-associated molecules in unprovoked A-β+ KPD.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, blood samples from 75 participants (42 with AT1D and 33 with KPD) were evaluated for interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) reactive to 4 insulin B-chain amino acid 9–23-related peptides (B:9–23rPep) using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay.

Results

Overall, 36.4% (12/33) of KPD participants showed positive IFN-γ ELISpot assay results; the positivity rate in KPD was similar to that in AT1D (38.1%; 16/42) and statistically significantly higher than the previously reported rate in type 2 diabetes (8%; 2/25; P < .0167). Moreover, B:9–23rPep-specific IFN-γ-producing PBMC frequency was negatively correlated with age and ad lib serum C-peptide levels in all KPD participants and positively correlated with glycated hemoglobin A1c level in KPD participants with positive IFN-γ ELISpot results.

Conclusion

These findings suggest the involvement of B:9–23rPep-specific IFN-γ-related immunoreactivity in the pathophysiology of some unprovoked A-β+ KPD. Moreover, increased immunoreactivity may reflect transiently decreased β-cell function and increased disease activity at the onset of DK/DKA, thereby playing a key role in DK/DKA development in this KPD phenotype.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^112zK8Eo]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A−β− KPD patients have no β-cell functional reserve shortly after the episode of DKA and never recover insulin secretory capacity, indicating severe and permanent β-cell dysfunction.
Provoked A−β+ KPD patients recover β-cell function soon after the index DKA and may maintain β-cell reserve for up to 4 years, but thereafter manifest progressive loss of β-cell function and insulin dependence, suggesting an ongoing process of β-cell dysfunction that recovers only transiently upon intensive glycemic management.
Unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients recover β-cell function soon after the index DKA and maintain substantial and stable β-cell functional reserve and insulin independence for prolonged periods of time (usually > 4 years).

Moreover, provoked A−β+ KPD patients have a high frequency of HLA class II alleles linked to susceptibility to autoimmune type 1 diabetes (DQB1✱0302 and DRB1✱04), suggesting that their pathophysiology includes a component of islet autoimmunity, whereas unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients lack the increased frequency of susceptibility alleles. Hence, in the current study, we used cellular immunoblotting and flow cytometry to determine whether the differences observed in the clinical characteristics and natural histories of these three A− KPD subgroups are related to the presence or absence of islet-specific T cells and/or proinflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+). Proinflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) are increased in a variety of acute infections and severe inflammatory states such as sepsis. Therefore, all samples from subjects were obtained when they were clinically stable, without evidence of acute inflection or inflammation, to avoid the potential increases of inflammatory monocyte populations associated with inflammation or infection. We discovered an inverse relationship between BMI and the presence of proinflammatory monocytes. Because an association of obesity with increased numbers of circulating proinflammatory monocytes has been reported, this finding suggests that some factors unique to KPD may drive the systemic inflammatory response and override the effects of obesity per se. Further studies are warranted to investigate this aspect of KPD pathophysiology.

### T1D progression is associated with loss of CD3CD56regulatory T cells that control CD8T cell effector functions [^114Mg3TA]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

An unresolved issue in autoimmunity is the lack of surrogate biomarkers of immunological self-tolerance for disease monitoring. Here, we show that peripheral frequency of a regulatory T cell population, characterized by the co-expression of CD3 and CD56 molecules (T R3–56), is reduced in subjects with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). In three independent T1D cohorts, we find that low frequency of circulating T R3–56 cells is associated with reduced β-cell function and with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis. As autoreactive CD8 + T cells mediate disruption of insulin-producing β-cells 1–3, we demonstrate that T R3–56 cells can suppress CD8 + T cell functions in vitro by reducing levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. The suppressive function, phenotype and transcriptional signature of T R3–56 cells are also altered in T1D children. Together, our findings indicate that T R3–56 cells constitute a regulatory cell population that controls CD8 + effector functions, whose peripheral frequency may represent a traceable biomarker for monitoring immunological self-tolerance in T1D.

### State of the union between metabolism and the immune system in type 2 diabetes [^112WDqg2]. Genes and Immunity (2011). Low credibility.

Lymphocytes and myeloid cells (monocyte/macrophages) have important roles in multiple types of diseases characterized by unresolved inflammation. The relatively recent appreciation of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as chronic inflammatory diseases has stimulated interest in understanding the role of immune cells in metabolic imbalance. Myeloid cells regulate inflammation through cytokine production and the adipose tissue remodeling that accompanies hyper-nutrition, thus are critical players in metabolic homeostasis. More recently, multiple studies have indicated a role for T cells in obesity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance in model organisms, with parallel work indicating that pro-inflammatory changes in T cells also associate with human T2D. Furthermore, the expansion of T cells with similar antigen-binding sites in obesity and T2D indicates these diseases share characteristics previously attributed to inflammatory autoimmune disorders. Parallel pro-inflammatory changes in the B-cell compartment of T2D patients have also been identified. Taken together, these studies indicate that in addition to accepted pro-inflammatory roles of myeloid cells in T2D, pro-inflammatory skewing of both major lymphocyte subsets has an important role in T2D disease pathogenesis. Basic immunological principles suggest that alterations in lymphocyte function in obesity and T2D patients are an integral part of a feed-forward pro-inflammatory loop involving additional cell types. Importantly, the pro-inflammatory loop almost inevitably includes adipocytes, known to respond to pro-inflammatory, pro-diabetogenic cytokines originating from the myeloid and lymphoid compartments. We propose a model for inflammation in T2D that functionally links lymphocyte, myeloid and adipocyte contributions, and importantly proposes that tools for B-cell ablation or regulation of T-cell subset balance may have a place in the endocrinologist's limited arsenal.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113cR4vq]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis and classification — Type 2 diabetes phenotype — Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes and encompasses individuals who generally have relative insulin deficiency with insulin resistance. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes and, when seen, usually arises with insulinopenia, missed or inadequate insulin doses, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, intercurrent illness such as dehydration or infection, or in association with medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or SGLT2 inhibitors. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is more typically associated with type 2 diabetes and is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and dehydration in the absence of significant ketoacidosis, and mixed DKA/HHS presentations can occur.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ADA 2006 guidelines recommend to consider using the following diagnostic criteria and classification for DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |

|Moderate DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH 7.00–7.25 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate 10–15 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) 3–6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 12 <br/> - Alert/drowsy|
|Severe DKA|- Plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH < 7.00 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate < 10 mEq/L <br/> - Positive urine ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Positive serum ketones using the nitroprusside reaction method <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) > 6 mmol/L <br/> - Variable effective serum osmolality <br/> - Anion gap > 12 <br/> - Stupor/coma|
|Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state|- Plasma glucose > 600 mg/dL <br/> - Arterial pH ≥ 7.30 <br/> - Serum bicarbonate ≥ 15 mEq/L <br/> - Small amount of urine ketones <br/> - Small amount of serum ketones <br/> - Β-hydroxybutyrate (enzymatic assay) < 3 mmol/L <br/> - Effective serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/kg <br/> - Anion gap < 12 <br/> - Stupor/coma.|

### Proinflammatory effects of hypoglycemia in humans with or without diabetes [^117VNEXx]. Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Severe hypoglycemic events have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes, which may be explained by hypoglycemia-induced inflammation. We used ex vivo stimulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes obtained during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic (5.0 mmol/L)-hypoglycemic (2.6 mmol/L) clamps in 11 healthy participants, 10 patients with type 1 diabetes and normal awareness of hypoglycemia (NAH), and 10 patients with type 1 diabetes and impaired awareness (IAH) to test whether the composition and inflammatory function of immune cells adapt to a more proinflammatory state after hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia increased leukocyte numbers in healthy control participants and patients with NAH but not in patients with IAH. Leukocytosis strongly correlated with the adrenaline response to hypoglycemia. Ex vivo, PBMCs and monocytes displayed a more robust cytokine response to microbial stimulation after hypoglycemia compared with euglycemia, although it was less pronounced in patients with IAH. Of note, hypoglycemia increased the expression of markers of demargination and inflammation in PBMCs. We conclude that hypoglycemia promotes mobilization of specific leukocyte subsets from the marginal pool and induces proinflammatory functional changes in immune cells. Inflammatory responses were less pronounced in IAH, indicating that counterregulatory hormone responses are key modulators of hypoglycemia-induced proinflammatory effects. Hypoglycemia-induced proinflammatory changes may promote a sustained inflammatory state.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^114pPTHw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Frequencies of HLA class II alleles associated with susceptibility to or protection against autoimmune type 1 diabetes were measured in all of the patients in this study to assess genetic contributions to cell-mediated islet autoimmunity in the A− KPD patients. The results, in conjunction with those previously obtained in a separate, larger cohort of KPD patients, indicate that 1) in the A− KPD population, having a protective HLA class II allele is associated with absence of both humoral and T-cell autoreactivity to islet antigens and that 2) compared with the other A− KPD subgroups, unprovoked A−β+ KPD, previously shown to have a lower frequency of susceptibility HLA class II alleles, also has a higher frequency of protective alleles. Together with the present results indicating that unprovoked A−β+ KPD has a low frequency of T-cell positivity and that having a protective allele is strongly associated with absence of T-cell positivity, these findings strengthen the notion that the cause of β-cell dysfunction in unprovoked A−β+ KPD is not related to islet autoimmunity.

### B cell contribution to immunometabolic dysfunction and impaired immune responses in obesity [^115gnyLk]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, in both studies discussed above B cells were not involved in the regulation of obesity, as the weight gain on HFD was comparable between B cell deficient and wild-type mice. B cells did however play a role in modulating adipose tissue 'health' (see Box 1). Indeed, DeFuria et al. observed that in the absence of B cells, adipocytes were 15% and 40% smaller in VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), respectively; this was also associated with reduced leptin production by adipose tissue explants as well as in serum. Winer et al. did not see a difference in adipocyte size between B cell deficient and wild-type mice on HFD but instead observed a decrease in VAT:SAT ratio in B cell deficient mice. Overall lipid metabolism in DIO was also unaffected by B cell deficiency, as serum free fatty acids, triglycerides, and respiratory exchange ratio were comparable to wild-type mice.

Box 1. Adipose tissue in health and obesity

Adipose tissue is central in the development and shaping of obesity-associated diseases. Excess energy is stored in the form of triacylglycerols in white adipose tissue (WAT). WAT is composed of adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction, which also contains leukocytes. In the lean state, the adipose tissue immune cell profile is anti-inflammatory; in obesity it is shifted to a pro-inflammatory state, which has systemic immune consequences. Of note, WAT is further subdivided into SAT and VAT. SAT and VAT differ in structure and function. Importantly VAT contains a larger number of immune cells and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality risk than SAT. The immune landscape of adipose tissue is comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.

Notably, B cell depletion with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ameliorated metabolic disease in DIO wild-type mice. Glucose intolerance in DIO mice was similarly ameliorated by targeting B cell activating factor (BAFF), a cytokine important for peripheral B cell maintenance. Together these findings not only underscore the pathogenic role of B cells in meta-inflammation but also suggest that metabolic disease can be modulated by targeting B cells.

### Islet-specific T-cell responses and proinflammatory monocytes define subtypes of autoantibody-negative ketosis-prone diabetes [^117RGLnt]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Provoked A−β+ KPD patients were defined by the presence of a clinically defined precipitating factor associated with or immediately preceding the index DKA episode. We have previously shown that the phenotype of provoked A−β+ KPD is characterized by progressive loss of β-cell function after recovery from the index DKA episode, no sex predominance, inability to discontinue insulin or relapsing to insulin requirement after a brief period off insulin, and an increased frequency of type 1 diabetes-associated HLA class II alleles DQB1✱0302 and DRB1✱04. Unprovoked A−β+ KPD patients were defined by the absence of a clinically defined precipitating factor associated with or immediately preceding the index DKA episode. We have previously shown that the phenotype of unprovoked A−β+ KPD is characterized by marked improvement and sustained preservation of β-cell function after recovery from the index DKA episode, male predominance, insulin independence, and an increased frequency of the protective allele DQB1✱0602. A−β− KPD patients were defined exclusively by A and β status, without regard to DKA precipitant, because the latter does not affect the natural history or phenotypic characteristics of this KPD subgroup.

Blood was drawn for autoantibody, phenotyping, and T-cell responses during routine follow-up visits of the subjects to the KPD clinic at Ben Taub General Hospital. All subjects were clinically stable, without evidence of acute illness or inflammation at the time of the blood draw. Blinded whole-blood samples were transported, using a validated shipping protocol, overnight in a blinded fashion to the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, for T-cell analysis. Serum samples were shipped frozen to the University of Washington for measurement of islet autoantibodies.

Social determinants of health (SDOH) in diabetes mellitus — recommendation and impact: Clinicians should assess SDOH in persons with DM to better guide them to social and/or healthcare resources. SDOH are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and numerous studies suggest SDOH account for between 30% to 55% of health outcomes. Those with lower socioeconomic status have a higher risk for developing T2D, worse DM control, and more DM-related complications, including increased risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and diabetic retinopathy in T2D. The guideline notes inadequate equity-related considerations in DM trials and states that targeted recruitment and explicit focus on SDOH health and inequities are recommended to close this gap.

### Pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^1173DQJU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an important complication of diabetes in children and is the most frequent diabetes-related cause of death in childhood. The pathophysiology of this condition can be viewed as an exaggeration of the normal physiologic mechanisms responsible for maintaining an adequate fuel supply to the brain and other tissues during periods of fasting and physiologic stress. The optimal therapy has been a subject of controversy, particularly because the most frequent serious complication of diabetic ketoacidosis-cerebral edema-and the relationship of this complication to treatment are incompletely understood. In this article, the author reviews the pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis and its complications and presents an evidence-based approach to the management of this condition.

### Deficiency of T cell CD40L has minor beneficial effects on obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction [^117HtSg7]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

The role of platelet CD40L in DIO is emphasized by several clinical studies correlating sCD40L with insulin resistance. Subjects with a BMI > 30 kg/m² have increased plasma levels of sCD40L, which is mainly platelet derived. Increased plasma sCD40L is correlates with fasting glucose, insulin resistance and leukocyte counts in human cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, when patients with T2D were compared with age-matched controls, plasma sCD40L was significantly higher, independent of cholesterol, waist circumference, BMI or sex. This suggests that platelet CD40L may play a more important role in metabolic dysfunction than T cell CD40L. Combined, these data show the crucial roles of induction and maintenance of inflammation in DIO by CD40L expressing cells other than T cells.

In our mouse model, we found that 78% of T cell CD40L was depleted, which resulted in major changes in T cell subsets and their expression profiles. Although we cannot rule out residual T cell CD40L activity, the fact that T effector cell numbers have decreased substantially suggests that the remaining CD40L + T cell population plays a minor role. Our results show that T cell CD40L is pivotal for the generation of CD4 + effector T cells and CD4 + Tregs, cell types that are considered major regulators of obesity-induced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Adipose tissue T cell quantity and T cell subtype content correlates with BMI and waist circumference in patients with obesity and T2D. During obesity, the number of Th2 cells and anti-inflammatory Tregs decreases in adipose tissue and are replaced with a gross increase in pro-inflammatory Th1 cells. Correlation between increased Th1 cells and altered glucose metabolism in DIO was found especially for patients with T2D, whereas in patients with obesity this correlation is less evident. During DIO, the fraction of CD4 + effector T cells increases significantly, causing local inflammation by secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue. However, these pro-inflammatory effector T cells also migrate to other peripheral sites, such as the liver, further inducing inflammation. The increase in effector T cells is mediated by lymphocyte central memory cells. Central memory cells respond to inflammation and obesity-induced metabolic stress by proliferating and attaining an effector memory profile, contributing in part to the increase in T cells in adipose tissue during DIO. In our CD4CreCD40L fl/fl mice, we observe a decrease in effector T cells in spleen and lymphoid organs, which is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the pro-migratory chemokine receptor CXCR3. This suggests that absence of T cell CD40L affects migration of effector T cells into the periphery. However, in the adipose tissue the amount of effector T cells was unaffected when CD40L was absent on T cells. T lymphocyte central memory cells were also unaffected in the adipose tissue of CD4CreCD40L fl/fl mice and these cells could thereby maintain the local effector memory populations. The decrease in CXCR3 expression does hamper effector T cells migratory ability, decreasing circulating effector cells and protecting peripheral organs such as the liver from these pro-inflammatory cells. As such, our data suggest that T cell CD40L deficiency does not limit the local expansion of the effector T cell, a culprit behind increased adipose tissue inflammation.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically ocurring at the time of new diagnosis of untreated T1DM or due to inadequate insulin therapy, infection (such as pneumonia, UTI, sepsis), concomitant medications (corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics), illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, or pregnancy.
- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hopsitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia, fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings in DKA include hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria.

### STAT4 deficiency reduces obesity-induced insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation [^116MB7Dv]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Another important player in AT inflammation in DIO is the macrophage. We measured the number of CD11b + /F4/80 + cells in the perigonadal fat and found a significantly lower number of cells in the STAT4-deficient mice compared with controls (Fig. 4 D). The percentage of CD11b + /F4/80 + cells, representing macrophages in the CD45 + leukocyte gate, was similar in the two groups (40.4 ± 3.1% in STAT4 −/− vs. 37.6 ± 3.9% in C57Bl mice). However, of the total macrophage population, the percentage of CD206 + cells (likely representing M2 macrophages) was significantly higher in STAT4 −/− mice (Fig. 4 D), suggesting a bias toward the M2 phenotype in the AT of STAT4 −/− mice. Indeed, gene expression of arginase and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) were also significantly increased in SVF from STAT4-deficient mice versus controls (Fig. 4 E).

To establish whether this immune cell profile is recapitulated in the lymphoid organs, we analyzed the spleen (Fig. 4 F) and the inguinal/mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4 G). Although, the percentage of CD3 + cells in the spleen was significantly higher in STAT4 −/− mice, the overall cellularity was comparable between the two groups. Also, the percentages of CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + cells in the CD45 + leukocyte gate were comparable between the groups (Fig. 4 F). No significant differences between groups were found in the numbers of CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, or IFN-γ–producing T-cell subsets in the inguinal/mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4 G). Interestingly, the percentage of CD206 + M2 macrophages was consistently reduced in AT, spleen, and lymph nodes of wild-type mice compared with STAT4 −/− mice (Fig. 4 D, F, G). These data suggest that the T-cell subset composition in AT is unique and may be explained by differences in migration, proliferation, or apoptosis among the T-cell subsets in AT.

### Risks associated with acute pancreatitis (AP) with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in COVID-19 patients: a literature review [^1161K2oW]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) has become a global pandemic, and medical experts are scrambling to understand the wide range of symptoms and consequences of the virus. Although acute pancreatitis (AP) and pancreatic damage have been associated with SARS-CoV-2, the mechanism behind this is still unclear. The current article explores whether COVID-19 is an additional cause of AP and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The article illustrates the conditions associated with AP and DKA among COVID-19 patients and diabetes mellitus (DM). Another critical condition is acute kidney injury (AKI), often associated with DKA.

Methods

A search strategy for the article was assigned and retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from 2020 to June 2022. The articles which discussed case studies on AP, DKA, and AKI were included in the study.

Results

The present review of 24 reported case studies represented conditions of AP (12), DKA (5), AP and DKA (5), AP and AKI (1), and DKA and AKI (1) among COVID-19 participants, and showed a potential relationship between the complications.

Conclusion

Healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic plays a major role among AP, DKA, and AKI-associated COVID-19 patients. A compilation of case studies suggests effective management of COVID-19 infection-related complications such as AP, DKA, and AKI.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116Jikrx]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin (relative insulin deficiency) or cannot use insulin effectively (insulin resistance); defects in insulin secretion are related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and genetic factors, and autoimmune destruction of beta-cells does not occur. Risk increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical exercise, and it currently accounts for about 91 percent of diabetes cases in the United States. In children, prevalence is increasing in high-risk ethnic groups (American Indians, Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders); most affected children are between 10 and 19 years old, have infrequent or mild diabetic ketoacidosis, are obese, have a strong family history of diabetes, and those with high body mass index (BMI) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at increased risk.

### Lack of lipotoxicity effect on β-cell dysfunction in ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes [^112ZYhRH]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Over half of adult subjects with recently diagnosed diabetes presenting with DKA display clinical, metabolic, and immunological features of type 2 diabetes, including a high rate of obesity, a strong family history of diabetes, a low prevalence of autoimmune markers, and lack of HLA genetic association. Many of such patients discontinue insulin therapy within a few months of treatment and remain in good glycemic control with diet and/or oral antidiabetic therapy for several years. Metabolic studies have evidenced insulin secretion deficiency as the major determinant of metabolic decompensation in KPDM patients. We previously reported that intravenous glucose infusion shortly after resolution of DKA did not evoke any insulin response; however, improvement of metabolic control resulted in threefold higher insulin levels at near-normoglycemia remission. Changes in C-peptide response after a mixed meal or glucagon stimulation have been shown to be intermediate between lean type 1 diabetic patients with DKA and obese hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes (,–). The subsequent remission is due to a restoration, at least partial, of the β-cell insulin secretory capacity after achievement of good metabolic control. KPDM patients who achieved remission experienced an 80% improvement in fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels, whereas those who did not achieve remission lost 60% of their insulin secretory capacity. These findings indicate that the impaired β-cell function in KPDM patients cannot be attributed to an irreversible β-cell damage but to transient functional abnormalities of the β-cells.

Clinical and experimental data indicate that increased FFAs may contribute to the development of peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In addition to inhibiting insulin action, recent evidence indicates that FFAs have an important role in the regulation of β-cell function. In vitro and animal studies have shown that prolonged exposure of rat and human islets to fatty acids decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, FFAs inhibit insulin gene expression, in part via negative regulation of the transcription factor pancreatic duodenum homeobox-1. FFAs may also reduce efficiency of proinsulin to insulin conversion within the β-cells and may impair potassium ATP channel–dependent and potassium ATP channel–independent pathways of insulin secretion. In humans, sustained (24–48 h) elevation of FFAs may decrease glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in nondiabetic individuals. Accordingly, we hypothesized that β-cell lipotoxicity may explain the metabolic decompensation in obese African Americans with KPDM and that such patients will be more susceptible to FFA-induced β-cell dysfunction than obese patients with ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes and obese nondiabetic control subjects.

### A mortality prediction model in diabetic ketoacidosis [^115pBoZP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model score (DKAMPM score)" for diabetic ketoacidosis.

The Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model score, abbreviated as DKAMPM score, is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This scoring system is specifically designed for adult patients diagnosed with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones.

The DKAMPM score is utilized to predict the mortality risk in patients with DKA. It uses various clinical and laboratory parameters such as age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, serum bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, and mental status to calculate the score. The higher the score, the higher the risk of mortality.

This calculator is not applicable to pediatric patients or to patients without a confirmed diagnosis of DKA. It should also not be used in isolation but in conjunction with clinical judgment and other diagnostic tools.

The Diabetic Ketoacidosis Mortality Prediction Model (DKAMPM) provides a systematic way to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This model considers six specific clinical factors observed either at presentation or within the first day of hospitalization. Each factor is weighed based on its severity, contributing to a cumulative score that helps predict the patient's risk level.

Here's how the scoring system works:

1. Severe comorbidities at presentation, such as immunosuppression, previous myocardial infarction (MI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, or previous stroke:

- **Yes**: 6 points
- **No**: 0 points

2. pH less than 7.0 at presentation:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

3. Requirement of more than 50 international units (IU) of regular insulin after 12 hours:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

4. Serum glucose level greater than 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) after 12 hours:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

5. **Depressed mental state observed 24 hours after presentation**:

- **Yes**: 4 points
- **No**: 0 points

6. **Fever occurring after 24 hours of presentation**:

- **Yes**: 3 points
- **No**: 0 points

The total score, determined by adding up the points for all conditions that apply, falls between 0 and 25. The interpretation of the score is crucial for clinical decision-making and prioritizing care:

- A score ranging from 0 to 14 indicates a low risk, with a mortality probability of 0.86%.
- Scores between 15 and 18 suggest a moderate risk, translating to a 20.8% chance of in-hospital mortality.
- Scores from 19 to 25 highlight a high risk, with mortality rates escalating to 93.3%.

By utilizing these criteria, healthcare providers can stratify patients according to their risk level, enabling targeted interventions and better outcomes based on the predicted risks associated with DKA.

### B cell contribution to immunometabolic dysfunction and impaired immune responses in obesity [^114a2efU]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

B cell role in driving obesity-associated metabolic disease — observations from animal models

That B cells are centrally implicated in obesity-associated inflammation and contribute to metabolic dysfunction was first observed in murine models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) approximately a decade ago. While B cells are found in adipose tissue in the steady state, feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to mice was shown to increase trafficking and B cell accumulation in visceral adipose tissue. In addition, B cells were shown to drive adipose tissue inflammation, including the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. These two seminal studies reported that compared to DIO wild-type mice, DIO B-cell deficient mice had lower fasting glucose and insulin levels as well as improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.

More specifically, Winer et al. demonstrated that the ameliorated glucose metabolism in obese B-cell deficient mice could be worsened by the transfer of splenic B cells from DIO mice, but not those from mice on a normal chow diet (NCD). These data suggest that B cells acquire a pathogenic phenotype upon exposure to HFD. B cells play important roles in immunity, which can be categorized into (1) antibody production, (2) antigen presentation to modulate T cell responses, and (3) cytokine secretion, which impacts both other leukocytes and tissue cells. Here, B cells were shown to require antigen presentation capacity (expression of MHC molecules) as well as the presence of T cells to exert their pathogenic effects on metabolic parameters following exposure to HFD. Also implicating antibody production as a mechanism of B cell promotion of metabolic disease, in this study, HFD in wild-type mice lead to increased IgG2c, a pro-inflammatory isotype associated also with autoimmunity in murine models, in both visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and serum. That the transfer of IgG but not IgM isolated from the serum of DIO wild-type mice (insulin resistant) to DIO B cell deficient animals was able to induce inflammation and impaired glucose metabolism, suggests an isotype-specific pathogenic mechanism. Building on these findings, DeFuria et al. suggested an additional role for B cells in controlling obesity-associated inflammation by regulating T cell pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

### Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia as a potential aggravating factor for preclinical atherosclerosis in subjects with type 1 diabetes [^111TwrKT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

As mentioned previously, there are recent studies specifically designed to address the effects of acute hypoglycemia, confirming its proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects. For some of the inflammatory markers (leukocytes and sICAM-1). we detected significantly higher values at baseline in subjects with repeated hypoglycemia. In both group of subjects with type 1 diabetes, insulin-induced hypoglycemia elicited a heterogeneous nonsignificant rise in endothelial and inflammatory markers without any difference in the response observed with respect to the presence or absence of frequent hypoglycemia. This lack of response to provoked hypoglycemia in comparison with previous studies could be related, at least in part, to limitations of the experimental conditions of our protocol. In fact, the study of acute effects of hypoglycemia was not considered the main objective of our study, and the protocol was not designed to accurately assess mechanistic roles. As examples, we included a shorter period of hypoglycemia (30 min) before extraction and we did not control for insulin levels and the potential effect on vascular function. Moreover, and in contrast with some previous studies, we did not exclude those subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness because this clinical condition was seen in patients fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Further research is required to fully understand the link between repeated episodes of hypoglycemia and a worse prognosis in terms of preclinical atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes. However, the putative role for endothelial and inflammatory factors in the mediation of hypoglycemia-induced vascular damage has to be taken into consideration.

In summary, in addition to the induction of hypoglycemia unawareness and an increased risk for severe hypoglycemia, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia could be related to and considered an aggravating factor for the preclinical atherosclerosis profile of type 1 diabetes.

### Innate immune system regulated by stimulator of interferon genes, a cytosolic DNA sensor, regulates endothelial function [^113vJkSK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Accumulating evidence suggests that STING signaling contributes to various inflammatory conditions. In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of diabetes by streptozotocin injection induced DNA damage in the aorta and the accumulation of DNA fragments in ECs. We also found that STING expression was upregulated in the aorta and that the deletion or blockade of STING ameliorated the development of endothelial dysfunction in this condition. The results of the in vitro and ex vivo experiments support a causal role for STING signaling in the impairment of EC function and indicate that the DNA damage response regulated by STING is involved, at least in part, in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction caused by metabolic disorders.

Immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells express pattern recognition receptors and play pivotal roles in the innate immune system. However, in addition to immune cells, ECs play roles in the immune system. ECs provide a platform for leukocyte attachment and migration to vessel walls by expressing adhesion molecules and chemokines in response to various stimuli. ECs also detect exogenous pathogens in the bloodstream. Recent advances in immunology have verified that, through their pattern recognition receptors, ECs detect endogenous danger signals released by metabolic abnormalities or aging‐related factors. For example, the detection of polysaturated fatty acids by Toll‐like receptors 2 and 4 induces proinflammatory responses in ECs.ECs also have other sensing mechanisms for damage‐associated molecular patterns and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns, which contribute to various pathophysiological conditions.

### Transmigration through venular walls: a key regulator of leukocyte phenotype and function [^115p5BW4]. Trends in Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Leukocyte transmigration is a key event in host defense. As well as delivering leukocytes to sites of inflammation, this response also has an important role in immunity by regulating the responsiveness and behavior of leukocytes in the extravascular tissue. Recent evidence suggests that these events are associated with phenotypic and functional changes in migrating leukocytes mediated by signaling and transcriptional events triggered by the molecular interactions involved in leukocyte transendothelial cell migration. Transfer of membrane proteins from endothelial cells to migrating leukocytes and interaction of leukocytes with components of the perivascular basement membrane might also contribute to this effect. This Review will discuss the characteristics, potential mechanisms and the relevance of transmigration-induced change in leukocyte phenotype and responsiveness both within physiological and pathological scenarios.

### Diabetic microvascular disease in non-classical beds: the hidden impact beyond the retina, the kidney, and the peripheral nerves [^1149EMcn]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathological findings in brain microangiopathy in diabetes

Cerebral microvascular dysfunction can arise from almost any component within the NVU. Glucose is the primary source of brain energy, entering the central nervous system (CNS) through glucose-transporter proteins and insulin receptors on the ECs of the BBB. The existing evidence, predominantly derived from animal and in vitro studies, suggests that brain microvessels exposed to hyperglycaemic conditions can induce significant changes in the overall structure and function of the brain's microcirculatory system through different, interrelated mechanisms, as detailed below (Fig. 1).

Endothelial cell damage and BBB leakage

ECs in cerebral vessels exhibit higher susceptibility to hyperglycaemia damage than cells in the brain parenchyma. The BBB integrity in DM is compromised due to the loss of tight junction proteins, increasing the barrier's permeability. While hyperglycaemia plays a significant role in BBB leakage in diabetes, other damaging factors, including diabetes-related hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and insulin resistance, also contribute to the development of BBB dysfunction.

Impaired communication among astrocytes

Astrocyte endfeet around microvessels play a critical role in facilitating neurovascular communication. In DM, swelling occurs in the astrocytic endfeet of microvessels, leading to the detachment of the plasma membrane from the basal lamina. Consequently, communication between astrocytes via gap junctions is reduced, which hinders the astrocytic regulation of blood flow.

Pericyte reduction and death

The retina and CNS exhibit the highest pericyte density. Pericytes play a crucial role as essential effector cells in angiogenesis and microvascular remodelling processes, primarily through close interactions with the vascular BM. Hyperglycaemia has been linked to reduced numbers and apoptosis of brain pericytes, resulting from oxidative stress triggered by the BBB disruption. Moreover, reduced pericyte abundance is associated with increased vascular permeability, leading to haemorrhagic and hyperdilated vessels and potentially contributing to conditions like oedema. Furthermore, pericyte death can result in the regression of newly formed microvessels, leading to fluid leakage, leukocyte adhesion to the vasculature, and hypoxia in the affected area.

### A role for innate immunity in type 1 diabetes? [^111tYogy]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Two arms of the immune system, innate and adaptive immunity, differ in their mode of immune recognition. The innate immune system recognizes a few highly conserved structures on a broad range of microorganisms. On the other hand, recognition of self or autoreactivity is generally confined to the adaptive immune response. Whilst autoimmune features are relatively common, they should be distinguished from autoimmune disease that is infrequent. Type 1 diabetes is an immune-mediated disease due to the destruction of insulin secreting cells mediated by aggressive immune responses, including activation of the adaptive immune system following genetic and environmental interaction. Hypotheses for the cause of the immune dysfunction leading to type 1 diabetes include self-reactive T-cell clones that (1) escape deletion in the thymus, (2) escape from peripheral tolerance or (3) escape from homeostatic control with an alteration in the immune balance leading to autoimmunity. Evidence, outlined in this review, raises the possibility that changes in the innate immune system could lead to autoimmunity, by either priming or promoting aggressive adaptive immune responses. Hostile microorganisms are identified by genetically determined surface receptors on innate effector cells, thereby promoting clearance of these invaders. These innate effectors include a few relatively inflexible cell populations such as monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells and gammadelta T cells. Recent studies have identified abnormalities in some of these cells both in patients with type 1 diabetes and in those at risk of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether these abnormalities in innate effector cells predispose to autoimmune disease. If they were to do so, then modulation of the innate immune system could be of therapeutic value in preventing immune-mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111bkuz4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline update — Evaluation and initial management of suspected checkpoint inhibitor–associated diabetes mellitus (CIADM) emphasizes vigilance for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and timely workup. The acute risks of DKA from autoimmune beta-cell destruction require vigilance, and new-onset hyperglycemia in a patient with high risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus should raise the level of concern for CIADM. Acute onset of polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and lethargy should be evaluated without delay; urine ketones, acid base status, and electrolytes can be evaluated as screening for DKA and the need for inpatient evaluation. Antibodies, insulin, and C-peptide levels should also be sent to support diagnosis, although the initiation of therapy should not be delayed pending results; insulin should be used to treat hyperglycemia in anyone where the diagnosis is in question. Endocrinology consultation is appropriate even without evidence of DKA, and when outpatient endocrinology consultation is not readily available, hospitalization is appropriate. At this time, no immunosuppressive strategies are approved to treat type 1 diabetes and by extension are not considered to be indicated in CIADM.

### Euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors in non-diabetic patients – A narrative review [^112fCcXR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Euglycemic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening emergency that is characterized by euglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. It is a well-recognized adverse event in diabetic patients taking sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2 inhibitor). However, there is limited data on SGLT-2 inhibitor-related euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients. The mechanism behind SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euglycemic ketoacidosis involves a general state of starvation or relative insulin deficiency, which exacerbates the mild baseline ketonemia caused by this class of medications while normoglycemia is maintained. The incidence of euglycemic ketoacidosis will likely increase with the increasing use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for various indications in addition to diabetes mellitus type 2, predominantly for congestive heart failure (CHF). Recognizing the signs and symptoms of this life-threatening condition is essential to treat it effectively. Our objective is to comprehensively revisit the pathophysiology of euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and the risk factors for the condition, review the available data, and summarize the reported cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our literature search identified five articles with six cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients who were on SGLT-2 inhibitors for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The common risk factor in five out of the six cases was decreased oral intake due to acute illness, fasting, or a perioperative state.

### Sequence variants associating with urinary biomarkers [^115GYSnF]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The urine, a final product of nephron function which consists of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, provides valuable information about numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Urine dipstick tests are routinely used as a diagnostic tool in medical practice, facilitating early detection of diseases, such as urinary tract infections (UTI), and renal and metabolic disorders. Urine dipstick measurements are semiquantitative traits; positive urine dipstick results are expressed as intervals (e.g. pH and specific gravity) or graded according to severity on a scale from 1 to 4 plus (written as + to ++++; e.g. proteinuria and hematuria), and require medical interpretation. Apart from various diseases, environmental factors, such as exercise and food supplements, are known to affect urine dipstick results. However, it is an open question as to how genetic variation influences urine dipstick test results, both in a disease dependent and independent context.

Here we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of urine dipstick measurements, testing for associations of variants in the sequence of the genome with glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria, urine pH, signs of UTI (i.e. nitrites and leukocyte esterase) and urine specific gravity in a set of 150 274 Icelanders. In addition, we assess the variants detected for association with a broad set of diseases and other biological traits. By doing so, we attempt to shed light on whether the variants that affect urine dipstick test results are associated with specific diseases, or if they simply affect urinary traits separate from everything else.

Table 1
Genotyped individuals with urine dipstick measurements

For glucosuria (N cases = 10 857; N controls = 135 512), ketonuria (N cases = 41 130; N controls = 95 568), proteinuria (N cases = 54 009; N controls = 91 538) and hematuria (N cases = 68 051; N controls = 68 903), cases were identified according to at least one positive urine dipstick reading and controls as individuals with only negative urine dipstick readings. The cases were also classified as mild when at least one urine dipstick reading was + with no greater reading and moderate/severe when at least one urine dipstick reading was ++ or greater (Materials and Methods). Cases with signs of UTI, were defined as individuals with positive readings for both nitrites (indicative of nitrate-reducing bacteria) and leukocyte esterase (indicative of neutrophils) on the same day, whereas controls were individuals with only negative readings for both (N cases = 13 322; N controls = 66 528). Low urine pH cases were defined as individuals with at least one pH reading of 5.0 or below, and controls were individuals with only pH readings above 5.0 (N cases = 35 897; N controls = 112 302). Additionally, urine pH (N = 149,899; mean = 6.13; SD = 0.78) and specific gravity (N = 139 555; mean = 1.02; SD = 0.01) were assessed as quantitative traits (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In summary, one to three phenotypes (groups/subgroups) were tested for each of the seven urinary traits: glucosuria, ketonuria, proteinuria, hematuria, UTI, urine pH and urine specific gravity (Table 1; Supplementary Material, Table S1). There were 16 phenotypes tested in total. Detailed demographic information about study subjects can be found in Supplementary Material, Table S2.

### Obesity related methylation changes in DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes [^116GFynx]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity is the epidemic of our time, with sharply and steadily rising rates. The major adverse consequences of obesity including type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and essential hypertension, when added together, account for a large number of disease related deaths. If the obesity-related cancer cases are added to this number, obesity-related mortality by far exceeds that of other common diseases. The latter indicates the urgent need to develop novel efficient therapeutic modalities for this condition.

The common denominator in the pathogenesis of the co-morbidities of obesity is the presence of an active, low-grade inflammatory process. Despite evidence linking obesity to alterations in inflammatory response, little is known about the specific effects of obesity on the immune system. Recently, there has been a greater appreciation of the role of epigenetics, meiotically and mitotically heritable changes in gene expression that are not coded in the DNA sequence itself, in the immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, we hypothesize that DNA methylation changes play a role in obesity induced immune dysfunction. The goal of this study was to characterize DNA methylation profile in peripheral blood leukocytes in obese versus lean subjects using a genome wide approach. Identification of methylation changes in specific genes will provide important targets for further study into the mechanisms of obesity's effect on the immune system and the potential to develop new therapies to treat multiple obesity comorbidities.

### T cell senescence by extensive phenotyping: an emerging feature of COVID-19 severity [^114ynh1Y]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the potential prognostic value of lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients, where lymphopenia is a common finding.

Methods

In 353 COVID-19 inpatients and 40 controls T cell subsets with markers of senescence and exhaustion were studied by flow cytometry.

Results

In severe illness, total lymphocytes B, NK, and all T subsets were dampened. Senescent CD4+, but mainly CD8+T cells, increased in patients with respect to controls. The most significant index predicting fatal outcome was neutrophils/CD3+T ratio.

Conclusion

In conclusion, an altered T cell pattern underlies COVID-19 severity and is involved in predicting the outcome.

### Bacteremia from a presumed urinary source in hospitalized adults with asymptomatic bacteriuria [^116GMDGe]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In our multihospital cohort of 11 590 hospitalized patients with ASB, bacteremia from a presumed urinary source was rare. The risk of bacteremia in patients presenting with AMS was negligible in the absence of systemic signs of infection (eg, leukocytosis or SIRS). A personalized, risk-based approach to empiric antibiotic therapy in patients without specific signs or symptoms of a UTI could decrease unnecessary ASB treatment without delaying early empiric therapy in those at highest risk of bacteremia.

### Changes in leukocyte migration during carbonic anhydrase activity inhibition [^114ZzogN]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

Experiment 1 evaluated changes in leukocyte migration during acetazolamide (AZ) inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity in leukocytes. AZ induced changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, and extracellular calcium is thought to be a factor inducing an increase in leukocyte migration. Next, Experiment 2 determined whether extracellular calcium concentration was a primary factor influencing leukocyte migration in the absence of AZ. The distance of leukocyte migration increased in a dose-dependent manner with AZ despite the presence of IL-8 or LPS in Experiment 1. The extracellular calcium concentration used in the present study had no influence on the distance in leukocyte migration in Experiment 2. The distance of leukocyte migration showed a tendency to increase in a dose-dependent manner with LPS concentration. In conclusion, AZ may stimulate leukocyte migration due to its participation in the regulation of intracellular pH controlled by CA activity without an effect of low extracellular calcium concentration. In addition, AZ was thus suggested to possibly have an anti-inflammatory effect in supporting leukocyte migration during inflammatory reactions.
