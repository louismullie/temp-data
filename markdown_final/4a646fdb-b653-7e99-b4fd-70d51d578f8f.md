## Question

Do you schedule atropine for increased secretions or use as needed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether atropine should be scheduled or used as needed for increased secretions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where atropine is used for secretions. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and mechanism to see if scheduled dosing makes physiologic sense. Next, I will review guideline-based and trial evidence for each context. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and note exceptions where scheduled dosing is appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where atropine is used to reduce secretions. The main scenarios are organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, perioperative or procedural antisialagogue use, and end-of-life management of noisy secretions ("death rattle"), with occasional use for chronic sialorrhea in neurologic disease. I should also remember that atropine is paired with neostigmine to blunt muscarinic effects during neuromuscular blockade reversal, which is a different but related use-case for secretion control [^33f1e0e1] [^5f0157d8] [^c3a20130].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacology to see if scheduled dosing aligns with how atropine works. Atropine competitively antagonizes muscarinic receptors, reducing glandular secretions; onset is rapid (about 30–60 seconds IV, 15–30 minutes IM), and duration is relatively short (about 2–4 hours), which argues for titration to effect rather than fixed-interval scheduling in most settings. Importantly, atropine can thicken secretions if overdosed, so I should be cautious not to overtreat [^4043f811] [^407a143f] [^d90a7db3].

> For organophosphate or carbamate poisoning, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought "scheduled infusions are standard", but wait, let me verify the endpoint. Guidelines emphasize titrating atropine rapidly and repeatedly until the patient is "atropinized" (clear lungs, heart rate > 80, systolic BP > 80 mmHg), often requiring large cumulative doses; maintenance infusions are then adjusted to clinical response, not to a fixed schedule. So, even here, dosing is response-driven rather than strictly scheduled, though continuous infusions are commonly used once atropinization is achieved [^d538d218] [^20278609] [^c514673a] [^52c76b5d].

> For perioperative or procedural antisialagogue use, I should confirm whether prophylaxis helps. Evidence is mixed: some studies show reduced secretions with glycopyrrolate or atropine, but others show no clear benefit or even hemodynamic drawbacks; importantly, routine prophylaxis is not recommended by anesthesia guidelines for aspiration risk reduction, so if used, it is typically as a single pre-procedure dose rather than a scheduled regimen. Let me reconsider: in select high-risk airway cases, a one-time dose may be reasonable, but scheduled repeat dosing is not supported [^184497fd] [^65427ad6] [^7ae86ff4] [^8dc603a1].

> For end-of-life secretions ("death rattle"), I should double-check the evidence before recommending scheduled atropine. High-quality reviews and RCTs show no consistent benefit of anticholinergics over placebo, and expert guidance favors nonpharmacologic measures first (repositioning, suctioning, family education); if medications are used, they are given as needed to reduce distress, not on a fixed schedule. So, scheduled atropine here is not supported by evidence and may worsen secretion viscosity without improving patient-centered outcomes [^34b01419] [^c2f2aa3a] [^5f0157d8] [^a87aecaa].

> For chronic sialorrhea in neurologic disease, let me verify dosing patterns. Small studies and expert reviews describe sublingual atropine drops used intermittently (for example, 2–3 drops sublingually two to three times daily), with titration to effect and attention to tolerability; this is fundamentally an as-needed, individualized approach rather than a rigid schedule. I should confirm that systemic anticholinergics often cause side effects, reinforcing the principle of using the lowest effective dose as needed [^40f16f4f] [^59d2997c] [^ca1fa759].

> But wait, what if the question is about atropine with neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade? I need to ensure I'm precise here. The indication is to prevent muscarinic side effects (bradycardia, secretions) during reversal; atropine or glycopyrrolate is given as a single dose immediately before or with neostigmine, not as a scheduled series, and glycopyrrolate is often preferred for hemodynamic stability. So, again, this is a one-time, as-needed coadministration rather than scheduled dosing [^c3a20130] [^92a72885] [^fc2ebb37].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Across contexts, atropine for secretions is best used as needed, titrated to clinical effect, with attention to endpoints such as drying of secretions, respiratory effort, and tolerability. Scheduled dosing is generally not supported except in the narrow scenario of organophosphate poisoning where continuous infusion maintains atropinization after initial boluses, and even there, infusion rates are adjusted to clinical response rather than a fixed timetable [^d538d218] [^20278609] [^5f0157d8].

> Practically, I need to ensure safety checks are explicit. Monitor for anticholinergic toxicity (dry mouth, tachycardia, agitation, urinary retention, ileus), avoid overtreatment that thickens secretions, and reassess frequently. In pediatrics, remember the longer half-life and greater sensitivity, so start low and go slow. In end-of-life care, prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and use anticholinergics sparingly, if at all, for patient and family comfort [^866c5337] [^407a143f] [^5f0157d8].

Use atropine for increased secretions **as needed**, not on a fixed schedule, because its duration of action is short (about 2–4 hours) [^407a143f] and secretions fluctuate with disease activity. Schedule atropine only in **specific scenarios** where sustained antisialagogue effect is required (e.g. organophosphate poisoning with continuous infusion) [^d538d218] or when used with neostigmine to prevent bradycardia and secretions during reversal of neuromuscular blockade [^c3a20130]. For routine secretions, titrate doses to effect and reassess frequently to avoid overtreatment and anticholinergic side effects [^c514673a].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for as-needed dosing

- **Short duration of action**: Atropine's antisialagogue effect lasts 2–4 hours, so fixed scheduling risks undertreatment or overtreatment as secretions vary [^407a143f].

- **Rapid onset**: IV/IM onset is 1–2 minutes, allowing titration to immediate clinical needs [^notfound].

- **Dose-response variability**: Secretion severity varies with disease activity, supporting individualized, as-needed dosing [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios supporting as-needed dosing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for as-needed dosing** |
|-|-|
| General excessive secretions (e.g. sialorrhea, bronchorrhea) | Secretions fluctuate; titrate to effect to minimize anticholinergic side effects [^notfound] |
| End-of-life care (death rattle) | Secretions are intermittent; as-needed anticholinergics are standard to balance benefit and side effects [^5f0157d8] |
| Procedural sedation (e.g. ketamine) | Hypersalivation is variable; prophylactic atropine is not routinely required and can be given as needed [^bec87e1b] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where scheduled dosing may be appropriate

- **Organophosphate poisoning**: Continuous atropine infusion is standard to maintain atropinization until secretions dry and ventilation improves [^d538d218] [^20278609].

- **Neostigmine reversal**: Atropine is co-administered with neostigmine to prevent bradycardia and secretions; this is a scheduled, one-time dose rather than ongoing scheduling [^c3a20130].

- **Specific procedures**: Some bronchoscopy or anesthesia protocols may use scheduled antisialagogues, but evidence is mixed and context-dependent [^7ae86ff4] [^8dc603a1].

---

## Risks and benefits of scheduled versus as-needed dosing

| **Parameter** | **Scheduled dosing** | **As-needed dosing** |
|-|-|-|
| Benefits | - Sustained secretion control in select scenarios (e.g. organophosphate poisoning) <br/> - Predictable effect in procedures | - Individualized therapy <br/> - Reduced anticholinergic side effects <br/> - Lower risk of overtreatment |
| Risks | - Overtreatment <br/> - Anticholinergic toxicity (dry mouth, tachycardia, delirium) <br/> - Thickened secretions | - Under-treatment if not reassessed frequently <br/> - Requires vigilant monitoring |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **General secretions**: Use as-needed dosing with frequent reassessment to balance efficacy and side effects [^notfound].

- **Organophosphate poisoning**: Use continuous infusion with clear endpoints (dry secretions, improved ventilation) [^d538d218] [^20278609].

- **End-of-life care**: Use as-needed anticholinergics with nonpharmacologic measures; evidence for routine scheduling is limited [^5f0157d8] [^a87aecaa].

---

## Practical clinical approach

- **Assess secretion severity and frequency**: Determine whether secretions are continuous or intermittent.

- **Start with as-needed dosing**: Titrate to effect, monitoring for dry mouth, tachycardia, and delirium [^866c5337].

- **Consider scheduled dosing only**: In specific scenarios (e.g. organophosphate poisoning, neostigmine reversal) where sustained effect is required [^d538d218] [^c3a20130].

- **Reassess frequently**: Adjust dosing based on clinical response and side effects [^c514673a].

---

Use atropine for increased secretions **as needed** unless there is a specific indication for scheduled dosing, such as organophosphate poisoning or neostigmine reversal. Titrate to effect and monitor for anticholinergic side effects to optimize comfort and safety.

Excess oral secretions or sialorrhea is a common problem affecting children and adults with neurological disorders, as well as those approaching the end of life because of a variety of underlying illnesses. Systemic anticholinergic medications are often prescribed in an attempt to improve quality of life and reduce complications; yet, response rates are variable, and a sizable proportion of patients discontinue these drugs as a result of intolerable side effects. This report describes the successful use of a local treatment, sublingually delivered ophthalmic atropine drops, to reduce sialorrhea in a child receiving palliative care. In addition, medical evidence for the safety and efficacy of traditionally prescribed systemic medications for the treatment of pediatric sialorrhea is reviewed.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — medication administration for acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning states that atropine, in large and potentially multiple doses, is the antidote for an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning and should be administered immediately followed by repeated doses until the patient's secretions resolve. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) is a secondary treatment and, when possible, should be administered concurrently with atropine. The stock of atropine and pralidoxime chloride available to emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians is usually not sufficient to fully treat the victim; however, EMS clinicians should initiate atropine and, if available, pralidoxime chloride. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines.

Loading with atropine and IV fluids

Dose of atropine

For an unconscious patient, give atropine 1.8–3 mg (three to five 0.6 mg vials) rapidly IV into a fast-flowing IV drip. Although it is preferable that oxygen is given early to all ill patients, do not delay giving atropine if oxygen is unavailable. Because atropine dries secretions and reduces bronchospasm, its administration will improve patient oxygenation. There is no good evidence that giving atropine to a cyanosed patient causes harm.

Atropine takes only a few minutes to work. During the 5 min after atropine administration, record three other signs of cholinergic poisoning against which atropine dosing will be titrated (Table 1): (1) air entry into lungs; (2) blood pressure; (3) heart rate.

There is no need to do this before atropine is given, because pinpoint pupils and sweating in a region where these pesticides are common are sufficient to indicate OP/carbamate poisoning and trigger the decision to give atropine.

If the clinical presentation is not clear, administer atropine 0.6–1 mg. A marked increase in heart rate (more than 20–25 beats/min) and flushing of the skin suggest that the patient does not have significant cholinergic poisoning and further atropine is not required.

Giving fluids

While waiting for the atropine to have effect, ensure that the two IV drips have been set up (one for fluid and drugs, the other for atropine). Give 500–1000 mL (10–20 ml/kg) of normal saline over 10–20 min.

Assess whether enough atropine has been given – is the patient atropinised?

Three to five minutes after giving atropine, check the five markers of cholinergic poisoning (Table 2). Mark them on an OP/carbamate observation sheet (Table 1). A uniform improvement in most of the five parameters is required, not improvements in just one. However, the most important parameters are air entry on chest auscultation, heart rate, and blood pressure.

Pupil dilatation is sometimes delayed. Because patients do not die from constricted pupils, and the other parameters may improve more rapidly, it is reasonable to wait for the pupils to dilate. Check frequently and carefully that the other parameters are improving.

When all the parameters are satisfactory, the patient has received enough atropine and is 'atropinised'.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^22512878]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Carbamates, Nerve Agents, Organophosphates) exposure — recommended doses and administration routes are outlined as follows: The medication dosing tables are based upon the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient. For organophosphate or severe acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure, the required dose of atropine necessary to dry secretions and improve the respiratory status may exceed 20 mg. Atropine should be administered rapidly and repeatedly until the patient's clinical symptoms diminish and must be given until the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent has been metabolized. Because Duodote® auto-injectors contain pralidoxime chloride, they should not be used for additional dosing of atropine beyond the recommended administered dose of pralidoxime chloride. All the medications can be administered intravenously in the same doses cited for the intramuscular route; however, intramuscular administration is highly recommended to eliminate the inherent delay associated with establishing intravenous access. The medications can be administered via the intraosseous route; however, intramuscular administration remains the preferable due to the inherent delay associated with establishing intraosseous access and the limited use of this route of administration for other medications.

Pediatric nerve-agent exposure — management includes supportive care and, when indicated, prompt administration of the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime, and autoinjectors are particularly important in mass-casualty incidents when there is a need to treat large numbers of victims as quickly and efficiently as possible. Because the continued absence of a combination pediatric autoinjector in the United States leaves the use of standard, multidose vials as the only therapeutic option, consensus guidelines now recommend that children weighing 13 kg or more (2–3 years of age or older) receive a 600-mg dose of pralidoxime from an autoinjector because this pralidoxime dose falls within the range of safety for the drug. Children weighing less than 13 kg can receive the customary weight-based (20–50 mg/kg) dose, administered from a multidose vial; if the multidose vial is unavailable, an autoinjector could be used, and repeat dosing of atropine may be necessary to mitigate secretions. Previously, only the devices approved for adults, containing 2 mg of atropine and 600 mg of pralidoxime, were available.

### End-of-life care: managing common symptoms [^5f0157d8]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Physicians should be proficient at managing symptoms as patients progress through the dying process. When possible, proactive regimens that prevent symptoms should be used, because it is generally easier to prevent than to treat an acute symptom. As swallowing function diminishes, medications are typically administered sublingually, transdermally, or via rectal suppository. Opiates are the medication of choice for the control of pain and dyspnea, which are common symptoms in the dying process. Delirium and agitation may be caused by reversible etiologies, which should be identified and treated when feasible. When medications are required, haloperidol and risperidone are effective options for delirium. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with medications targeting the etiology. Constipation may be caused by low oral intake or opiate use. Preventive regimens to avoid constipation should include a stimulant laxative with a stool softener. Oropharyngeal secretions may lead to noisy breathing, sometimes referred to as a death rattle, which is common at the end of life. Providing anticipatory guidance helps families and caregivers normalize this symptom. Anticholinergic medications can modestly help reduce these secretions. Effective symptom control in end-of-life care can allow patients to progress through the dying process in a safe, dignified, and comfortable manner.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^b3efd186]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Glycopyrrolate has minimal central anticholinergic effects, a lesser impact on cardiac conduction, and a stronger inhibitory effect on salivary secretion, making it an ideal anticholinergic agent. Glycopyrrolate may be preferred in scenarios where hemodynamic stability is prioritized, considering its higher risk of dry mouth.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^b55b312b]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Muscle relaxants are commonly used anesthetic agents that are often administered alongside sedatives and analgesics to facilitate tracheal intubation and meet surgical needs. However, residual muscle relaxants following anesthesia can lead to complications such as respiratory failure and aspiration. In pediatric practice, neostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is frequently used to counteract the effects of muscle relaxants. However, it can lead to muscarinic side effects, such as bradycardia and increased secretions, which require the use of anticholinergic agents.

Atropine is commonly used in pediatric anesthesia, but its rapid onset and short duration may lead to significant fluctuations in heart rate when administered in combination with neostigmine. Glycopyrrolate does not have central effects, exerts a lesser impact on cardiac conduction, and provides stronger inhibition of salivary secretion, making it a more suitable alternative.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind controlled trial to compare the effects of glycopyrrolate and atropine on heart rate and postoperative complications in pediatric patients undergoing muscle relaxant antagonism.

Atropine use and endpoints of atropinization — In adults and children with life-threatening organophosphate or carbamate poisoning including cardiac arrest, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchorrhea, or bronchospasm, early atropine improved survival in 1 clinical trial; larger doses than for typical bradycardia are often required, the initial dose is doubled every 5 minutes until atropinization is achieved (clear chest on auscultation; heart rate > 80/min; systolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg), and maintenance can be achieved by an atropine infusion.

Bulbar symptoms

With sialorrhoea, atropine and ipratropium bromide usually work well as patients can adjust their dosing and timing. If it is insufficient, we normally recommend half a hyoscine patch for 72 hours for a couple of weeks, before increasing to a full patch if required. In patients without dysphagia or orofacial incoordination/dystonia, gum chewing can increase swallow frequency and so help with hypersalivation.

We believe it is important to make early referral to speech and language therapy services for voice therapy (eg, Lee Silverman) and to consider options such as voice banking. Voice banking is the process of creating a personalised synthetic voice, to use later. Patients and carers often are not aware of the availability of communication aids (eg, amplifiers, tablets or eye-gaze devices) and may not think to approach healthcare professionals for assistance with communication, making it important for the MDT to offer these services proactively.

Swallowing difficulties often cause significant distress in people with MSA. Frequent choking can cause meal anxiety and increased meal duration (sometimes up to 1–2 hours) reduces quality of life. Dysphagia of liquids also has implications for fluid status, and for ability to participate meaningfully with everyday activities. Again, we recommend early referral to speech and language therapy. This is partly for support around textures and positioning, but also because the change in swallowing and diet often marks a noticeable change in a patient's life, and can trigger thoughts around disease progression and planning. Not everyone will want to start those conversations then; however, it is a good time to make people aware of their options (eg, risk feeding, gastrostomy) and to know that there is a team which whom they can to discuss these should they wish.

There is insufficient evidence on the best timing for gastrostomy insertion. On balance, we recommend that this be done before the patient is in extremis; in our experience urgent admissions, are often preceded by malnutrition and dehydration giving greater procedure risk, as well as increased patient distress. Once the tube is in, the patient can to eat and drink for pleasure if they wish but use the tube for nutrition and fluids. There is no evidence that gastrotomies reduce aspiration or infections, but they are a potential palliative measure to improve the quality of the life.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^9ce574c4]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Principles of medication management at end-of-life — ventilator withdrawal and secretion control: Precede the ventilator withdrawal with the cessation of neuromuscular blockade, and administer appropriate medications for sedation and analgesia, and for the prevention and treatment of dyspnea. Often the patient is simply extubated after suctioning because oral and respiratory secretions can cause stridor, airway obstruction, or the "death rattle." Head of bed elevation, oral suctioning, and transdermal scopolamine can reduce secretions. Patients and families find dyspnea very distressing — reassure them.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^fc2ebb37]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Neostigmine is a commonly used cholinesterase inhibitor, but it can lead to muscarinic side effects such as bradycardia and increased airway secretions, which necessitates co-administration with anticholinergic drugs. Glycopyrrolate and atropine are both widely used anticholinergics; however, glycopyrrolate is a potent, long-acting option. Compared to atropine, glycopyrrolate's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics make it more suitable for use with neostigmine in reversing neuromuscular blockade during anesthesia. Glycopyrrolate has a stronger and longer-lasting peripheral anticholinergic effect, being 5–6 times more potent than atropine and having a duration that is 3–4 times longer. When combined with neostigmine to reverse non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, glycopyrrolate results in fewer episodes of tachycardia and is more effective at reducing salivary secretions, effectively countering the muscarinic symptoms caused by neostigmine.

In pharmacokinetics, glycopyrrolate takes effect within 1 min after administration and lasts for 2–4 h, with its inhibition of salivary secretion persisting for up to 7 h. It has a limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and in infants and children, it exhibits a higher volume of distribution and clearance compared to adults.

The primary advantage of glycopyrrolate is its minimal impact on heart rate, resulting in more stable hemodynamics. Evidence suggests atropine administration during pediatric anesthesia may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Conversely, clinical data indicate glycopyrrolate demonstrates superior cardiac rhythm stability. Due to shortages of glycopyrrolate and its established clinical use, there has been limited research in recent years. Currently, there is a lack of studies on the optimal dosing of glycopyrrolate when used in conjunction with neostigmine in pediatric patients.

### Randomized double-blind trial of sublingual atropine vs. placebo for the management of death rattle [^c2f2aa3a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Noisy breathing because of respiratory tract secretions (RTS), often referred to as "death rattle", occurs in up to half of all dying patients. Despite a lack of evidence showing benefit compared with placebo, antimuscarinic medications have been used in an attempt to decrease noise associated with RTS and to decrease family distress.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of the antimuscarinic medication atropine with that of placebo in reducing noise associated with death rattle.

Methods

Terminally ill adult hospice inpatients who developed noisy breathing as a result of RTS were randomized to double-blind treatment with atropine or placebo. Study drug was given as a single sublingual dose. Noise from breathing was monitored at baseline and at two and four hours.

Results

One hundred thirty-seven participants were randomized to atropine or placebo. Reduction in noise score from baseline to two hours after dose occurred in 37.8% and 41.3% of subjects treated with atropine and placebo, respectively (P = 0.73). Noise score reduction at four hours occurred in 39.7% and 51.7% of subjects treated with atropine and placebo, respectively (P = 0.21). Differences between groups were not significant at either time point. Atropine was well tolerated. Heart rate increased slightly in both groups (+1.1/minute for atropine and +3.1/minute for placebo) but not significantly.

Conclusion

Sublingual atropine given as a single dose was not more effective than placebo in reducing the noise associated with death rattle.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^02413e0b]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Palliative care best practices — ventilator withdrawal and dyspnea management advise to precede the withdrawal of ventilator support with the cessation of neuromuscular blockade and to administer appropriate medications for sedation, pain control, and prevention of dyspnea. Opioids are the first line for treatment of dyspnea, and if dyspnea is refractory, then administer small doses of benzodiazepines that are titrated to effect. Often the patient is simply extubated after suctioning because oral and respiratory secretions can cause stridor, airway obstruction, or the "death rattle." To diminish secretions, scopolamine is effective, as are elevating the head of the bed and oral suctioning. Patients and families find dyspnea very distressing, so reassure them that medications will be offered and dyspnea will be managed.

### Combined inhaled anticholinergics and short-acting beta2-agonists for initial treatment of acute asthma in children [^ed6b9d10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are several treatment options for managing acute asthma exacerbations (sustained worsening of symptoms that do not subside with regular treatment and require a change in management). Guidelines advocate the use of inhaled short acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) in children experiencing an asthma exacerbation. Anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium bromide and atropine sulfate, have a slower onset of action and weaker bronchodilating effect, but may specifically relieve cholinergic bronchomotor tone and decrease mucosal edema and secretions. Therefore, the combination of inhaled anticholinergics with SABAs may yield enhanced and prolonged bronchodilation.

Objectives

To determine whether the addition of inhaled anticholinergics to SABAs provides clinical improvement and affects the incidence of adverse effects in children with acute asthma exacerbations.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000), EMBASE (1980 to April 2000), CINAHL (1982 to April 2000) and reference lists of studies of previous versions of this review. We also contacted drug manufacturers and trialists. For the 2012 review update, we undertook an 'all years' search of the Cochrane Airways Group's register on the 18 April 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized parallel trials comparing the combination of inhaled anticholinergics and SABAs with SABAs alone in children (aged 18 months to 18 years) with an acute asthma exacerbation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used the GRADE rating system to assess the quality of evidence for our primary outcome (hospital admission).

Main Results

Twenty trials met the review eligibility criteria, generated 24 study comparisons and comprised 2697 randomised children aged one to 18 years, presenting predominantly with moderate or severe exacerbations. Most studies involved both preschool-aged children and school-aged children; three studies also included a small proportion of infants less than 18 months of age. Nine trials (45%) were at a low risk of bias. Most trials used a fixed-dose protocol of three doses of 250 mcg or two doses of 500 mcg of nebulized ipratropium bromide in combination with a SABA over 30 to 90 minutes while three trials used a single dose and two used a flexible-dose protocol according to the need for SABA. The addition of an anticholinergic to a SABA significantly reduced the risk of hospital admission (risk ratio (RR) 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.85; 15 studies, 2497 children, high-quality evidence). In the group receiving only SABAs, 23 out of 100 children with acute asthma were admitted to hospital compared with 17 (95% CI 15 to 20) out of 100 children treated with SABAs plus anticholinergics. This represents an overall number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 16 (95% CI 12 to 29). Trends towards a greater effect with increased treatment intensity and with increased asthma severity were observed, but did not reach statistical significance. There was no effect modification due to concomitant use of oral corticosteroids and the effect of age could not be explored. However, exclusion of the one trial that included infants (< 18 months) and contributed data to the main outcome, did not affect the results. Statistically significant group differences favoring anticholinergic use were observed for lung function, clinical score at 120 minutes, oxygen saturation at 60 minutes, and the need for repeat use of bronchodilators prior to discharge from the emergency department. No significant group difference was seen in relapse rates. Fewer children treated with anticholinergics plus SABA reported nausea and tremor compared with SABA alone; no significant group difference was observed for vomiting.

Authors' Conclusions

Children with an asthma exacerbation experience a lower risk of admission to hospital if they are treated with the combination of inhaled SABAs plus anticholinergic versus SABA alone. They also experience a greater improvement in lung function and less risk of nausea and tremor. Within this group, the findings suggested, but did not prove, the possibility of an effect modification, where intensity of anticholinergic treatment and asthma severity, could be associated with greater benefit. Further research is required to identify the characteristics of children that may benefit from anticholinergic use (e.g. age and asthma severity including mild exacerbation and impending respiratory failure) and the treatment modalities (dose, intensity, and duration) associated with most benefit from anticholinergic use better.

### Adjunctive atropine is unnecessary during ketamine sedation in children [^bec87e1b]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The prophylactic coadministration of atropine or other anticholinergics during dissociative sedation has historically been considered mandatory to mitigate ketamine-associated hypersalivation. Emergency physicians (EPs) are known to omit this adjunct, so a prospective study to describe the safety profile of this practice was initiated.

Objectives

To quantify the magnitude of excessive salivation, describe interventions for hypersalivation, and describe any associated airway complications.

Methods

In this prospective observational study of emergency department (ED) pediatric patients receiving dissociative sedation, treating physicians rated excessive salivation on a 100-mm visual analog scale and recorded the frequency and nature of airway complications and interventions for hypersalivation.

Results

Of 1,090 ketamine sedations during the 3-year study period, 947 (86.9%) were performed without adjunctive atropine. Treating physicians assigned the majority (92%) of these subjects salivation visual analog scale ratings of 0 mm, i.e., "none", and only 1.3% of ratings were ≥ 50 mm. Transient airway complications occurred in 3.2%, with just one (brief desaturation) felt related to hypersalivation (incidence 0.11%, 95% confidence interval = 0.003% to 0.59%). Interventions for hypersalivation (most commonly suctioning) occurred in 4.2%, with no occurrences of assisted ventilation or intubation.

Conclusions

When adjunctive atropine is omitted during ketamine sedation in children, excessive salivation is uncommon, and associated airway complications are rare. Anticholinergic prophylaxis is not routinely necessary in this setting.

### Neostigmine [^d7455017]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Muscarinic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, and bradycardia) may appear with overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection (cholinergic crisis), but may be managed by the use of additional atropine or glycopyrrolate. The possibility of iatrogenic overdose can be lessened by carefully monitoring the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation. Should overdosage occur, ventilation should be supported by artificial means until the adequacy of spontaneous respiration is assured, and cardiac function should be monitored.

Overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection can cause cholinergic crisis, which is characterized by increasing muscle weakness, and through involvement of the muscles of respiration, may result in death. Myasthenic crisis, due to an increase in the severity of the disease, is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness and may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis. However, such differentiation is extremely important because increases in the dose of neostigmine methylsulfate injection or other drugs in this class, in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or "insensitive" state, could have grave consequences. The two types of crises may be differentiated by the use of edrophonium chloride as well as by clinical judgment.

Treatment of the two conditions differs radically. Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis requires more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, cholinergic crisis calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type. The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended. Atropine may also be used to lessen gastrointestinal side effects or other muscarinic reactions; but such use, by masking signs of overdosage, can lead to inadvertent induction of cholinergic crisis.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^f569ae17]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

There were also some limitations in the present study. First, this study only included boys scheduled to undergo penile flap surgery, sex may exert an influence on drug metabolism, these findings may not generalize to girls, other age groups, or patients undergoing higher-stress procedures (e.g. thoracic/abdominal surgeries). Future research should include more diverse pediatric populations. Second, during the pre-experiment, excessive salivation occurred when attempting to induce anesthesia without atropine, so atropine was used for both groups during anesthesia induction in this study. Although this may have impacted baseline heart rate, the medication was consistent across both groups and is unlikely to affect the study's outcomes. Third, routine neuromuscular blockade monitoring should be performed, but due to the institution's lack of adequate monitoring equipment, the failure to conduct such monitoring represents a limitation of this study. Without objective assessment of blockade reversal (e.g. train-of-four monitoring), the efficacy of both drug combinations in achieving adequate reversal cannot be confirmed, which weakens the clinical relevance of the safety outcomes reported. Future research should employ more objective criteria for evaluating neuromuscular blockade. Fourth, the exact ratio of atropine and glycopyrrolate to neostigmine had not been conclusively determined. In numerous studies, nuanced variations exist in the dosing ratios of atropine or glycopyrrolate to neostigmine. Ramamurthy got similar conclusions, suggesting that a dosage of 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate mixed with 1 mg of neostigmine appeared to be optimal for achieving the most stable heart rate and the lowest incidence of arrhythmias. Our adopted dosing regimens in this study were guided by clinical evidence from both adult and pediatric populations, as well as approved drug labeling in our jurisdiction. Future studies should further investigate drug dosing in pediatric patients. Fifth, this study only demonstrated a statistically significant difference, which should be viewed as a physiological signal worthy of investigation rather than a definitive clinical indicator. While maintaining stable heart rates may be advantageous for pediatric patients, there is insufficient data to determine to what extent it influences clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to establish this relationship.

### Is oxygen required before atropine administration in organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide poisoning? – A cohort study [^055ca265]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment and procedure

Patients were resuscitated following standard protocols, including evaluation of airway breathing and circulation. Due to the absence of emergency departments at the time of the study in the study hospitals, patients first received medical care on arrival at the medical ward. This typically delayed initial treatment by 10 min. Oxygen was not immediately available at any site of resuscitation.

Conscious patients with cholinergic signs (especially miosis, sweating, ref 13) were given an initial dose of 0.6–1.2 mg of atropine rapidly IV; unconscious patients were treated with an initial dose of atropine 1.8–3 mg. If after 5 min atropinisation had not occurred, a double dose was given. This doubling was continued each time that there was no response (improved heart rate and blood pressure, clear lungs). Because oxygen was rarely available on the ward and had to be brought from intensive care, protocols did not require the administration of oxygen before atropine since this would delay treatment.

Once stable, patients received activated charcoal as per their allocation during the RCT. No patients in this cohort received forced emesis; patients presenting within 1 h of a potentially lethal ingestion who provided consent underwent gastric lavage.

Patients were resuscitated with fluids to ensure adequate fluid output and ventilated as necessary. Symptomatic patients also received 1 g of pralidoxime chloride every 6 h for 1–3 days or, if they were recruited to the pralidoxime RCT, they received either placebo or 2 g of pralidoxime chloride over 20 min followed by 0.5 g/hr until death, they had no further need for atropine, or 7 days. Sick patients were placed on a cardiac monitor (including oxygen saturation monitoring) for several hours after arrival in the ward; due to a lack of intensive care beds, the majority of patients were managed on the open ward for the first few hours to days. Temporary pacemakers were not used for these patients.

Patients were seen by study doctors soon after their admission to the medical ward, frequently while unstable in the first few hours, and then twice daily on ward rounds. They were also called to see the patient whether any events occurred. Events, such as endotracheal intubation, seizures, cardiorespiratory arrests or death, were recorded at the time of the event and entered into a prospective database. We used the incidence of fatal primary cardiac arrests as a sensitive (but non-specific) marker of likely ventricular dysrhythmias.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (carbamates, nerve agents, organophosphates) exposure — assessment and severity classification describes toxicity, symptom patterns, and grading. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents are highly toxic chemical agents and can rapidly be fatal, and patients with low-dose chronic exposures may have a more delayed presentation of symptoms; antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime) are effective if administered before circulation fails. The patient may develop miosis (pinpoint pupils), bronchospasm, bradycardia, vomiting, and excessive secretions in the form of tearing, salivation, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, urination, and bronchorrhea. Penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) will cause headache, confusion, generalized muscle weakness, seizures, and lethargy or unresponsiveness. Estimated level of exposure based upon signs and symptoms is categorized as mild (miosis alone or miosis and severe rhinorrhea), mild to moderate (localized swelling, muscle fasciculations, nausea and vomiting, weakness, shortness of breath), and severe (unconsciousness, convulsions, apnea or severe respiratory distress requiring assisted ventilation, flaccid paralysis). Onset of symptoms can be immediate with an exposure to a large amount of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

### Pyridostigmine bromide (regonol) [^c3a20130]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

REGONOL®(pyridostigmine bromide injection, USP) 2 mL single-dose ampule is for intravenous use only. This drug should be administered by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians familiar with the use of agents which reverse or antagonize the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents. Dosage must be individualized in each case. The dosage information which follows is derived from studies based upon units of drug per unit of body weight and is intended to serve as a guide only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

NOTE: CONTAINS BENZYL ALCOHOL (see PRECAUTIONS)

Reversal doses of REGONOL®range from 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg.5,10,11,12,13The onset time to peak effect is dose-dependent; return of twitch height to 90% of control occurs within approximately 6 minutes following administration of a 0.25 mg/kg dose of REGONOL®.5,12At lower doses, full recovery usually occurs within 15 minutes in most patients, although others may require a half-hour or more.

When REGONOL®is given intravenously to reverse the action of muscle relaxant drugs, it is recommended that atropine sulfate (0.6 to 1.2 mg) or an equipotent dose of glycopyrrolate be given immediately prior to or simultaneously with the administration of REGONOL®. Side effects, notably excessive secretions and bradycardia are thereby minimized. Please refer to the appropriate prescribing information prior to the use of glycopyrrolate or atropine sulfate.

To obtain maximum clinical benefits of REGONOL®and to minimize the possibility of overdosage, the monitoring of muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is advised. REGONOL®should be administered after spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function has begun.

Satisfactory reversal can be evident by adequate voluntary respiration, respiratory measurements and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator device. It is recommended that the patient be well-ventilated and a patent airway maintained until complete recovery of normal respiration is assured. Once satisfactory reversal has been attained following administration of REGONOL®, recurrence of paralysis is unlikely to occur.

Inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade by anticholinesterase drugs is possible with all curariform drugs, and is managed by manual or mechanical ventilation until recovery is judged adequate. The administration of additional doses of anticholinesterase reversal agents is not recommended since excessive dosages of such drugs may produce depolarizing block through their own pharmacological actions.

### Atropine and scopolamine for the treatment of sialorrhea… [^ca1fa759]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

to the editor: In their article, "Sialorrhea: A Management Challenge, " 1 the authors advocate the use of glycopyrrolate tablets and scopolamine topical patches for the treatment of sialorrhea. I propose that physicians also should consider two alternatives: low-dose atropine sulfate tablets and scopolamine hydrobromide tablets. One study 2 documented that oral administration of atropine reduced the amount of resting secretion, intraoral accumulation, and pharyngeal-laryngeal pooling of saliva by more than 50 percent of baseline levels, with negligible side effects. Another study 3 demonstrated depression of salivation up to 80 percent in healthy adult patients taking oral atropine. Atropine tablets reduce salivation in infants, children, and adults. The medication may be administered every four to six hours as needed. The average wholesale price of atropine tablets is approximately one third of the price of glycopyrrolate tablets. 4 in reply: We appreciate Dr.

Sherman's insights into additional medical treatment options for sialorrhea and agree that a variety of preparations of anticholinergic medications may offer promising results. Unfortunately, study of the use of low-dose atropine sulfate tablets or scopolamine hydrobromide tablets for the treatment of sialorrhea is limited, especially in children. Although oral anticholinergic medications are consistently reliable in their reduction of sialorrhea, side effect profiles frequently result in discontinuation of their use. 1, 2 A retrospective review and a prospective randomized trial of the use of transdermal scopolamine for the treatment of drooling demonstrate high efficacy and low toxicity. 3, 4. Dr. Sherman references a case report 5 of the use of atropine to control sialorrhea in a patient with a closed head injury. The toxicities frequently associated with systemic anticholinergics may not have been apparent in this patient because of his underlying mental status. Dr.

Sherman further indicates that oral atropine was demonstrated to reduce salivation by up to 80 percent in healthy adults; the applicability of this data to patients with pathologic sialorrhea has not been elucidated.
6. Although there is potentially a variety of cost-effective, efficacious medications in the treatment of sialorrhea, further study is indicated.

### Edrophonium chloride (Enlon) [^6a59a1b1]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

With drugs of this type, muscarine-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions
	and bradycardia) often appear with overdosage (cholinergic crisis). An important complication that can arise is obstruction of the airway by bronchial secretions. These may be managed
	with suction (especially if tracheostomy has been performed) and by the use of atropine. Many experts have advocated a wide range of dosages of atropine (for ENLON, see atropine dosage
	below), but if there are copious secretions, up to 1.2 mg intravenously may be given initially and repeated every 20 minutes until secretions are controlled. Signs of atropine overdosage
	such as dry mouth, flush and tachycardia should be avoided as tenacious secretions and bronchial plugs may form. A total dose of atropine of 5 to 10 mg or even more may be required. The
	following steps should be taken in the management of overdosage of ENLON:

Adequate respiratory exchange should be maintained by assuring an open airway and by the use of assisted respiration augmented by oxygen.
Cardiac function should be monitored until complete stabilization has been achieved
Atropine sulfate in doses of 0.4 to 0.5 mg should be administered intravenously. This may be repeated every 3 to 10 minutes. Because of the short duration of action of ENLON the
	total dose required will seldom exceed 2 mg.
Pralidoxime chloride (a cholinesterase reactivator) may be given intravenously at the rate of 50 to 100 mg per minute; usually the total dose does not exceed 1000 mg. Extreme	caution should be exercised in the use of pralidoxime chloride when the cholinergic symptoms are induced by double-bond phosphorous anticholinesterase drugs.9
If convulsions occur or shock is present, appropriate measures should be instituted.

### Interventions for noisy breathing in patients near to death [^34b01419]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Noisy breathing (death rattle) occurs in 23 to 92% of people who are dying. The cause of death rattle remains unproven but is presumed to be due to an accumulation of secretions in the airways. It is therefore managed physically (repositioning and clearing the upper airways of fluid with a mechanical sucker) or pharmacologically (with anticholinergic drugs).

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions used to treat death rattle in patients close to death.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), before and after studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies in adults and children with death rattle were sought by MEDLINE (1966 to 2007), EMBASE (1980 to 2007), CINAHL (1980 to 2007), the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant trials and reports were checked and investigators who are known to be researching this area were contacted for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

RCTs, controlled before and after studies and ITS reporting the outcome of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treating death rattle.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted by two independent review authors and trials were quality scored. There was insufficient data to carry out an analysis.

Main Results

Thirty studies were identified, of which only one study met the inclusion criteria. This small study was a randomised placebo-controlled trial of the use of hyoscine hydrobromide in patients with death rattle. Hyoscine hydrobromide tended to reduce death rattle compared to placebo but this was not significant. A larger randomised study, comparing atropine, hyoscine butylbromide and scopolamine, is in progress.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to show that any intervention, be it pharmacological or non-pharmacological, is superior to placebo in the treatment of death rattle. We acknowledge that in the face of heightened emotions when death is imminent, it is difficult for staff not to intervene. It is therefore likely that the current therapeutic options will continue to be used. However, patients need to be closely monitored for lack of therapeutic benefit and adverse effects while relatives need time, explanation and reassurance to relieve their fears and concerns. There is a need for more well-designed multi-centre studies with objective outcome measures and the ability to recruit sufficient numbers.

### Clinical effects of adjunctive atropine during ketamine sedation in pediatric emergency patients [^91209658]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prophylactic coadministration of anticholinergics during dissociative sedation has been considered necessary to mitigate ketamine-associated hypersalivation. Given recent conflicting conclusions regarding adjunctive atropine, we compared the incidence of hypersalivation, degree of secretion, and related side effects with atropine or placebo as an adjunct to intravenous (IV) ketamine sedation for children.

Methods

This controlled trial randomized children, 1 to 10 years old, requiring ketamine sedation in a tertiary emergency department to receive 0.01 mg/kg of atropine or placebo, along with IV ketamine (2 mg/kg). A nurse rated preprocedure and postprocedure salivation on a 100-mm visual analog scale and recorded the frequency and nature of airway complications and interventions for hypersalivation.

Results

During 27 months, 140 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the 2 groups (P > .05). Secretion was significantly less in the atropine vs placebo group (mean visual analog scale score ± SD, 21.2 ± 13.1 [preprocedure] to 16.5 ± 9.9 [postprocedure] vs 22.4 ± 13.5 [preprocedure] to 27.0 ± 15.9 [postprocedure], respectively; P < .05). Visual analog scale scores greater than 50 were assigned to 7 (9.7%) of 72 and 1 (1.5%) of 68 patients in the placebo and atropine groups, respectively; these patients needed only medical procedures such as suction or airway repositioning. Heart rate was significantly higher in the atropine group compared with the placebo group (P < .05). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of other adverse events.

Conclusion

Atropine as an adjunct to IV ketamine sedation in children significantly reduced hypersalivation, without providing a clinical benefit.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — atropine for hemodynamically significant bradycardia and atrioventricular block is described with dosing, efficacy context, and cautions: Atropine enhances atrioventricular nodal conduction and automaticity and is generally given in 0.5- to 1.0-mg IV increments; advanced cardiac life support recommendations advise early use for hemodynamically significant bradycardia, including atrioventricular block, and uncontrolled cohort studies suggest efficacy particularly in acute inferior MI. Atropine is unlikely to improve atrioventricular block at the His bundle or His-Purkinje level and, for this reason, should be used judiciously in patients with atrioventricular block and wide QRS complexes that suggest the presence of significant His Purkinje disease; adverse effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, anhidrosis, urinary retention, delirium, and excessive increase in heart rate may be problematic, particularly in patients with acute MI.

### Progressive supranuclear palsy: diagnosis and management [^59d2997c]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Keening, wailing, and perpetual 'stammer': Some patients utter repetitive, loud vocalisations for minutes or hours on end. This is exhausting to be near, and may be the last straw for carers at home, and may even prevent care-home placement. It resembles an extreme stammer, but with a quality that might suggest distress. It helps to explain to carers that it rarely indicates distress, and that it is part of the illness. If worse at night, then sedation as above may help.

Drooling and sialorrhoea: Drooling in PSP results from not swallowing saliva, rather than overproduction. It may be exacerbated by anterocollis: repositioning may be all that is required. We advise against hyoscine patches because of the harmful anticholinergic effects. A better alternative with negligible systemic side effects is oral atropine drops, 2–3 sublingual drops, 2–3 times per day. The number of drops and frequency can be readily titrated, particularly if saliva becomes too thick. Alternatives are: salivary gland botulinum toxin, which is a less reversible/titratable option; and oral glycopyrronium, although we are not convinced of its value in PSP given that it primarily aids chest secretions and may have systemic side effects.

Involuntary eye closure is common in PSP. It can be mild and irritating or severe with functional blindness. It may be caused blepharospasm (especially pretarsal blepharospasm) or apraxia of lid opening — the inability to open the eyes voluntarily despite normal peripheral levator function. It may respond well to botulinum toxin injections. Eyelid opening apraxia (not blepharospasm) is a diagnostic criterion for PSP but is uncommon in the early stages.

### Early management after self-poisoning with an organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide-a treatment protocol for junior doctors [^52c76b5d]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Observation of the patient

Review the patient and assess the five parameters every 15 min or so to see whether the atropine infusion rate is adequate. As atropinisation is lost, with for example recurrence of bronchospasm or bradycardia, give further boluses of atropine until they disappear, and increase the infusion rate (Table 1).

Once the parameters have settled, see the patient at least hourly for the first 6 hours to check that the atropine infusion rate is sufficient and that there are no signs of atropine toxicity. As the required dose of atropine falls, observation for recurrence of cholinergic features can be done less often (every 2–3 hours). However, regular observation is still required to spot patients at risk of, and going into, respiratory failure.

### Galantamine hydrobromide [^4481bca9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug.

As in any case of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized. Signs and symptoms of significant overdosing of galantamine are predicted to be similar to those of overdosing of other cholinomimetics. These effects generally involve the central nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system, and the neuromuscular junction. In addition to muscle weakness or fasciculations, some or all of the following signs of cholinergic crisis may develop: severe nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal cramping, salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.

Tertiary anticholinergics such as atropine may be used as an antidote for galantamine hydrobromide overdosage. Intravenous atropine sulfate titrated to effect is recommended at an initial dose of 0.5 mg to 1.0 mg i.v. with subsequent doses based upon clinical response. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other cholinomimetics when coadministered with quaternary anticholinergics. It is not known whether galantamine and/or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration). Dose-related signs of toxicity in animals included hypoactivity, tremors, clonic convulsions, salivation, lacrimation, chromodacryorrhea, mucoid feces, and dyspnea.

### A comprehensive analysis of in-hospital adverse events after scopolamine administration: insights from a retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide inpatient database [^e0c26bc3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common, yet complex problem affecting anesthetic care, occurring in up to 80% of high-risk patients. Furthermore, PONV is associated with prolonged hospitalizations, increased rate of readmissions, and magnified healthcare costs.

Scopolamine is a common agent used for the treatment of PONV and post-discharge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) given its long duration of activity and unique transdermal dosing regimen. The agent acts as a competitive antagonist of the acetylcholine muscarinic receptor and works primarily in smooth muscle and the central nervous system to directly antagonize cholinergic synaptic transmissions. The parasympathetic activity produced leads to drying of secretions, increased cardiac output, and reduced nausea and vomiting. According to consensus guidelines, the risk of experiencing delayed nausea and vomiting significantly diminishes after the age of 50, making it a less prominent concern in older populations. Despite scopolamine's frequent usage and recognized efficacy, concerns have emerged regarding the potential for increased side effects, particularly in elderly patients. This population faces an elevated risk of delirium and potential side effects due to scopolamine's anticholinergic properties. The adverse effects of scopolamine are well documented, with patients receiving transdermal scopolamine commonly experiencing effects such as urinary retention, dry mouth, mydriasis, visual disturbances, and amblyopia. Furthermore, the use of transdermal scopolamine may result in significant elevations in heart rate when compared to placebo. Surprisingly, while numerous case reports have highlighted these concerns, no comprehensive study has quantified the frequency and severity of these side effects in the context of scopolamine administration in elderly patients. This critical gap in our understanding warrants further investigation on the safety and appropriateness of scopolamine use in this particular patient population. We therefore hypothesized that perioperative scopolamine use in older adults would be associated with worse clinical outcomes, mainly increased risk of pneumonia, delirium, urinary retention, and increased rate of readmissions.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^55631348]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine for bradycardia — key evidence and dosing: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing coronary perfusion, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia, and from a clinical standpoint it is predominantly used in the electrophysiology laboratory (1–20 mcg/ min intravenously); two RCTs of isoproterenol as adjunctive therapy in the setting of cardiac arrest did not show improved return of spontaneous circulation or survival to hospital discharge. In a trial of 82 patients with unstable bradycardia refractory to intravenous fluid bolus and atropine randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine at doses of 5 mcg/ kg/ min, titrated every 2 minutes by 5 mcg/ kg/ min to a maximum of 20 mcg/ kg/ min, there was no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In a study of 25 patients who had undergone heart transplant, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or less commonly sinus arrest in 20%, and evidence for parasympathetic reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplant was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series using heart rate variability response to neck suction to test autonomic responses.

### Is atropine needed with ketamine sedation? A prospective, randomised, double blind study [^e3266bbc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare atropine with placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures. Outcome measures included hypersalivation, side effect profile, parental/patient satisfaction, and procedural success rate.

Methods

Children aged between 1 and 16 years of age requiring ketamine procedural sedation in a tertiary emergency department were randomised to receive 0.01 mg/kg of atropine or placebo. All received 4 mg/kg of intramuscular ketamine. Tolerance and sedation scores were recorded throughout the procedure. Side effects were recorded from the start of sedation until discharge. Parental and patient satisfaction scores were obtained at discharge and three to five days after the procedure, with the opportunity to report side effects encountered at home.

Results

A total of 83 patients aged 13 months to 14.5 years (median age 3.4 years) were enrolled over a 16 month period. Hypersalivation occurred in 11.4% of patients given atropine compared with 30.8% given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.91). A transient rash was observed in 22.7% of the atropine group compared with 5.1% of the placebo group (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 26.6). Vomiting during recovery occurred in 9.1% of atropine patients compared with 25.6% of placebo patients (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.02). There was a trend towards better tolerance in the placebo group. No patient experienced serious side effects.

Conclusion

Ketamine sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse events were noted.

### Anticholinergic premedication for flexible bronchoscopy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of atropine and glycopyrrolate [^7ae86ff4]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Anticholinergic premedication is commonly used during flexible bronchoscopy, although the benefits are unproven and potential risks exist.

Methods

We studied 1,000 patients undergoing diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy to investigate the efficacy and safety of atropine and glycopyrrolate. Patients received atropine (0.01 mg/kg; n = 339), glycopyrrolate (0.005 mg/kg; n = 336), or placebo (2 mL of normal saline solution; n = 325) IM before bronchoscopy in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Bronchoscopist- and patient-reported secretions, cough and patient discomfort, oxygen desaturation, procedure time, and procedure-related adverse events were compared among the groups.

Results

After adjusting for covariates, glycopyrrolate (p = 0.02), but not atropine (p = 0.064), was associated with reduced bronchoscopist-reported airway secretions. Neither drug was independently associated with patient-reported airway secretions or with bronchoscopist- or patient-reported cough or discomfort. Neither drug was independently associated with oxygen desaturation. Atropine was associated with a longer procedure time (p = 0.042). Rise in heart rate and BP was significantly greater with anticholinergics, particularly atropine, compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Anticholinergic premedication may reduce airway secretions during flexible bronchoscopy but is not associated with any significant reduction in cough, patient discomfort, oxygen desaturation, or procedure time and is associated with greater hemodynamic fluctuations. Routine anticholinergic premedication may be unnecessary or even harmful during flexible bronchoscopy.

### The use of atropine in a nerve agent response with specific reference to children: are current guidelines too cautious? [^3ee6e8e6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

This review examines the potential use of nerve agents by a terrorist organisation against a civilian population, which has become an increasingly apparent threat in the UK. Present guidelines for the use of atropine, particularly in children, following such an event are unclear. No precise agreement exists on the most appropriate dose of atropine, or the frequency with which it should be administered. This uncertainty leaves children vulnerable as potentially life-saving treatment may be crucially delayed. Guidelines must be standardised to allow rapid antidotal delivery and maximise the potential for survivors. This review examines the issues currently surrounding the use of atropine in children following a nerve agent attack and propose strategies for treating exposed children.

### Atropine (Atropen auto-injector) [^d90a7db3]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions.

Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents.

Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block, which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular block and nodal rhythm.

Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis or weakness, fasciculations or tremors.

Atropine is not dependable in reversing the weakness or paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Severe difficulty in breathing requires artificial respiration in addition to the use of atropine.

Systemic doses of atropine slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Atropine can dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly the "blush" area (atropine flush), may cause atropine "fever" due to suppression of sweat gland activity especially in infants and small children and may inhibit sweating, thereby causing hyperthermia, particularly in a warm environment or with exercise [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Practice guidelines for preoperative fasting and the use of pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration: application to healthy patients undergoing elective procedures: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on preoperative fasting and the use of pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration [^d64dae90]. Anesthesiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence model — interventions and outcomes lists identification of patients at increased risk of pulmonary aspiration (e.g., obesity, diabetes, smoking history) via medical records review (focused history), physical examination, and patient questionnaire; preoperative fasting interventions including clear liquids for adults and for children, each as clear liquids between 2 and 4 h versus more than 4 h, breast milk between 2 and 4 h versus more than 4 h, formula between 2 and 4 h versus more than 4 h, and solids and nonhuman milk with solids less than 4 h versus more than 4 h and solids between 4 and 8 h versus more than 8 h; preoperative pharmacologic interventions including gastrointestinal stimulants (metoclopramide, cisapride), gastric acid secretion blockers (H2 receptor antagonists, cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, other H2 receptor antagonists), proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lanzoprazole, other proton pump inhibitors), antacids (sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium trisilicate), antiemetics (ondansetron), and anticholinergics (atropine, glycopyrrolate), as well as multiple versus single pharmacologic agents; and outcomes with expected benefits of prevention or reduction of perioperative pulmonary aspiration and reduction of complications associated with pulmonary aspiration including pneumonia, respiratory disabilities, and perioperative morbidity.

### Atropine sulfate monohydrate (atropine sulfate) [^407a143f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

After intramuscular administration, atropine is absorbed with peak concentration occurring at 30 min following injection.

Effects of exercise:

Exercise following intramuscular administration of atropine significantly increases the absorption of atropine due to increased perfusion in the muscle, with an increase in AUC by approximately 20% and Cmax by approximately 80%.

Distribution

Atropine is distributed throughout the body. Atropine's plasma protein binding is about 44% and saturable in the 2 to 20 mcg/mL concentration range.

Elimination

The pharmacokinetics of atropine is nonlinear after intravenous administration of 0.5 to 4 mg. Atropine disappears from the blood following injection with a plasma half-life of about 2–4 hours. Much of the drug is destroyed by enzymatic hydrolysis, particularly in the liver, with 13 to 50% is excreted unchanged in the urine.

Metabolism

The major metabolites of atropine are noratropine, atropin-n-oxide, tropine, and tropic acid. The metabolism of atropine is inhibited by organophosphate pesticides.

Specific Populations

Pregnant Women

Atropine readily crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation, but is not found in amniotic fluid.

Nursing Mother

Traces are found in various secretions, including milk.

Pediatric and Geriatric Patients

The elimination half-life of atropine is more than doubled in children under two years, and the elderly (> 65 years old) compared to other age groups.

Recommended therapies for sialorrhea — anticholinergic medications, botulinum toxin therapy to salivary glands, and salivary gland radiation therapy (RT) — are outlined with directive wording as follows: For anticholinergic medications, an initial trial of an inexpensive oral anticholinergic is suggested; continue to use if the benefits are greater than the side effects; and more expensive and potentially longer-acting anticholinergic patch medication also can be considered, with remarks noting they are relatively inexpensive and readily available. For botulinum toxin therapy to salivary glands, limited data, doses are not defined; remarks state inexpensive, lasting beneficial effects on salivary function, but treatment may need to be repeated and is associated with viscous saliva and mild to moderate pain. For salivary gland RT, limited data, doses not defined; remarks note long-lasting relief, however associated with irreversible dryness, and guidance to suggest reserving RT to experienced centers.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^8b9fa4d5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart rate is one of the most important indicators of hemodynamics in children, and this study monitored heart rate changes as the primary observation metric reflecting the cardiovascular effects of glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate has a weaker effect on M 2 receptors, which are involved in heart rate regulation in the heart and presynaptic terminals. Its onset time (1–2 min) and duration of action (2–4 h) are synchronized with those of neostigmine, making the combination beneficial for stabilizing heart rate in patients. In contrast, atropine is a non-selective M receptor antagonist with a rapid onset (30–60 s) and a short duration (15–30 min). To reduce oral secretions, atropine was administered during anesthesia induction in both groups, which can increase heart rate. However, considering that the baseline heart rate in this study was measured immediately after administering neuromuscular blockade reversal agents at the end of surgery — a considerable time after anesthesia induction — and given that both groups received the same medication, the influence of atropine on the baseline can be disregarded. In this study, both groups of children reached peak heart rates 2 min after administration, which is earlier than the 3 min observed in adult studies, indicating differences in drug metabolism between children and adults. When used in combination with neostigmine, atropine can lead to heart rate fluctuations and may induce tachyarrhythmias. Compared to glycopyrrolate, atropine's quick onset and short duration can significantly increase heart rate when used to reverse muscle relaxation, potentially triggering tachyarrhythmias. Subsequently, as the effects of atropine wane, heart rate may decrease, leading to significant fluctuations that can destabilize hemodynamics. In contrast, the combination of glycopyrrolate with neostigmine results in a more stable heart rate and improved hemodynamic stability during recovery. This combination can significantly reduce the risk of postoperative cardiovascular adverse events, such as tachycardia and myocardial ischemia. The subjects of this study were children undergoing penile flap surgery under laryngeal mask general anesthesia combined with caudal block, which provides effective and comprehensive analgesia. Additionally, maintaining a certain depth of anesthesia before remove the laryngeal mask eliminates hemodynamic fluctuations caused by pain or airway irritation, leading to more accurate results.

### Anticholinergics and ketamine sedation in children: a secondary analysis of atropine versus glycopyrrolate [^8fa7da9c]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Adjunctive anticholinergics are commonly administered during emergency department (ED) ketamine sedation in children under the presumption that drying oral secretions should decrease the likelihood of airway and respiratory adverse events. Pharmacologic considerations suggest that glycopyrrolate might exhibit a superior adverse effect profile to atropine. The authors contrasted the adverse events noted with use of each of these anticholinergics in a large multicenter observational database of ketamine sedations.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of an observational database of 8,282 ED ketamine sedations assembled from 32 prior series. The authors compared the relative incidence of six adverse events (airway and respiratory adverse events, laryngospasm, apnea, emesis, recovery agitation, and clinically important recovery agitation) between children who received coadministered atropine, glycopyrrolate, or no anticholinergic. Multivariable analysis using the specific anticholinergic as a covariate was performed, while controlling for other known predictors.

Results

Atropine was associated with less vomiting (5.3%) than either glycopyrrolate (10.7%) or no anticholinergic (11.4%) in both unadjusted and multivariable analyses. Glycopyrrolate was associated with significantly more airway and respiratory adverse events (6.4%) than either atropine (3.3%) or no anticholinergic (3.0%) and similarly more clinically important recovery agitation (2.1% vs. 1.2 and 1.3%). There were, however, no differences noted in odds of laryngospasm and apnea.

Conclusions

This secondary analysis unexpectedly found that the coadministered anticholinergic atropine exhibited a superior adverse event profile to glycopyrrolate during ketamine sedation. Any such advantage requires confirmation in a separate trial; however, our data cast doubt on the traditional premise that glycopyrrolate might be superior. Further, neither anticholinergic showed efficacy in decreasing airway and respiratory adverse events.

### Addition of neostigmine and atropine to conventional management of postdural puncture headache: a randomized controlled trial [^a24cd0f8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) lacks a standard evidence-based treatment. A patient treated with neostigmine for severe PDPH prompted this study.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blind study compared neostigmine and atropine (n = 41) versus a saline placebo (n = 44) for treating PDPH in addition to conservative management of 85 patients with hydration and analgesics. The primary outcome was a visual analog scale score of ≤ 3 at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were the need for an epidural blood patch, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Patients received either neostigmine 20 μg/kg and atropine 10 μg/kg or an equal volume of saline.

Results

Visual analog scale scores were significantly better (P < .001) with neostigmine/atropine than with saline treatment at all time intervals after intervention. No patients in the neostigmine/atropine group needed epidural blood patch compared with 7 (15.9%) in the placebo group (P < .001). Patients required no > 2 doses of neostigmine/atropine. There were no between-group differences in neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting. Complications including abdominal cramps, muscle twitches, and urinary bladder hyperactivity occurred only in the neostigmine/atropine group (P < .001).

Conclusions

Neostigmine/atropine was effective in treating PDPH after only 2 doses. Neostigmine can pass the choroid plexus but not the blood-brain barrier. The central effects of both drugs influence both cerebrospinal fluid secretion and cerebral vascular tone, which are the primary pathophysiological changes in PDPH. The results are consistent with previous studies and clinical reports of neostigmine activity.

### Death rattle: critical review and research agenda [^ff3523d7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this critical review was to assess the literature regarding the treatment of death rattle at the end of life to provide an update information regarding this difficult issue. To provide suggestions for future research agenda, the approach was analytic and based on clinical considerations, rather than on raw evidence only. Both published and unpublished reports from an extensive search of electronic databases. Any randomized-controlled trial or clinical reports with a significant number of patients was considered. Eleven reports fulfilled the inclusion criteria in this systematic review. Four controlled studies, four comparative audits, and three clinical reports with a significant number of patients were selected. Despite anticholinergic or antimuscarinic medications are the drugs of choice in practice, there is a lack of supporting evidence for the use of anticholinergics to treat death rattle. Regardless of the methodological limitations of existing studies, an a priori observation was missed. Most studies were performed with the intent to treat rather than to prevent death rattle. However, from a pharmacological perspective, anticholinergic agents are unable to reduce the secretions once they are formed, but may just limit a further production. In conclusion, studies on the use of antisecretive agents provided only minor evidence of efficacy, ultimately raising questions about the routine inclusion of anticholinergic treatment in end of life pathways for the treatment of death rattle. However, this observation could be confuted by the use of these same drugs used earlier in a prophylactic perspective, in the context of a comprehensive management of the dying patients.

### Refractory death rattle: deep aspiration facilitates the effects of antisecretory agents [^adb1bc5e]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic drugs, including atropine, hyoscine butylbromide, and scopolamine, have been shown to be equally effective in the treatment of death rattle. However, anticholinergic drugs may only be effective in reducing the production of further secretions, rather than eliminating the existing ones. A case is described in which a preventive procedure was undertaken to carefully eliminate secretions before starting anticholinergic drugs. Airway aspiration under light anesthesia removed secretions before starting anticholinergic drugs. Low doses of propofol were given intravenously to make a laryngoscopy feasible, allowing the complete aspiration of large amounts of tracheal secretions. No death rattle was perceived until death. Relatives were satisfied with the treatment and the peaceful death. Antisecretory agents may only prevent further accumulation of fluids along the airways and in the pharynx. The use of these drugs, supplemented by this aspiration procedure in carefully selected patients, may help eliminate death rattle in patients with advanced illness who are unable to cough or swallow. Explanation and reassurance to relieve fears and concerns regarding a procedure aimed to improve the quality of end-of-life care are of paramount importance, and active collaboration in decision making facilitates a timely intervention. This preliminary experience may help further research on the best treatment at the end of life.

### Prevalence, impact, and treatment of death rattle: a systematic review [^a87aecaa]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Death rattle, or respiratory tract secretion in the dying patient, is a common and potentially distressing symptom in dying patients. Health care professionals often struggle with this symptom because of the uncertainty about management.

Objectives

To give an overview of the current evidence on the prevalence of death rattle in dying patients, its impact on patients, relatives, and professional caregivers, and the effectiveness of interventions.

Methods

We systematically searched the databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. English-language articles containing original data on the prevalence or impact of death rattle or on the effects of interventions were included.

Results

We identified 39 articles, of which 29 reported on the prevalence of death rattle, eight on its impact, and 11 on the effectiveness of interventions. There is a wide variation in reported prevalence rates (12%-92%; weighted mean, 35%). Death rattle leads to distress in both relatives and professional caregivers, but its impact on patients is unclear. Different medication regimens have been studied, that is, scopolamine, glycopyrronium, hyoscine butylbromide, atropine, and/or octreotide. Only one study used a placebo group. There is no evidence that the use of any antimuscarinic drug is superior to no treatment.

Conclusion

Death rattle is a rather common symptom in dying patients, but it is doubtful if patients suffer from this symptom. Current literature does not support the standard use of antimuscarinic drugs in the treatment of death rattle.

Inhaled anticholinergic drugs are poorly absorbed which limits the troublesome systemic effects observed with atropine, and extensive use across doses and settings has shown them to be very safe; the main side effect is dryness of mouth, while occasional urinary symptoms have been reported without data proving a true causal relationship. Some patients using ipratropium report a bitter, metallic taste. An unexpected small increase in cardiovascular events in COPD patients regularly treated with ipratropium bromide has been reported, whereas in a large, long-term clinical trial tiotropium added to other standard therapies had no effect on cardiovascular risk. Although there were initial concerns about tiotropium delivered via the Respimat inhaler, a large trial observed no difference in mortality or exacerbation rates when comparing tiotropium in a dry-powder inhaler and the Respimat inhaler. There are less safety data for other LAMAs, but anti-cholinergic side-effect rates appear low and generally similar, and use of solutions with a facemask can precipitate acute glaucoma due to direct contact between the solution and the eye.

### Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (duoDote) [^13b1990c]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atropine

Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system.

Pralidoxime

Pralidoxime reactivates acetylcholinesterase which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to an organophosphorus nerve agent or insecticide. However, pralidoxime does not reactivate acetylcholinesterase inactivated by all organophosphorus nerve agents (e.g., soman). Pralidoxime cannot reactivate phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases that have undergone a further chemical reaction known as "aging." Reactivated acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes excess acetylcholine resulting from organophosphorus poisoning to help restore impaired cholinergic neural function. Reactivation is clinically important because only a small proportion of active acetylcholinesterase is needed to maintain vital functions.

Atropine

Atropine reduces secretions in the mouth and respiratory passages, relieves airway constriction, and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis. In severe organophosphorus poisoning, a fully atropinized patient may develop or continue to have respiratory failure and may require artificial respiration and suctioning of airway secretions. Atropine may cause thickening of secretions.

Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine increases heart rate and reduces atrioventricular conduction time. Adequate atropine doses can prevent or abolish bradycardia or asystole produced by organophosphorus nerve agents.

Atropine may decrease the degree of partial heart block which can occur after organophosphorus poisoning. In some patients with complete heart block, atropine may accelerate the idioventricular rate; in others, the rate is stabilized. In some patients with conduction defects, atropine may cause paradoxical atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.

Atropine will not act on the neuromuscular junction and has no effect on muscle paralysis or weakness, fasciculations or tremors; pralidoxime is intended to treat these symptoms.

Systemic doses of atropine slightly raise systolic and lower diastolic pressures and can produce significant postural hypotension. Such doses also slightly increase cardiac output and decrease central venous pressure. Atropine can dilate cutaneous blood vessels, particularly the "blush" area (atropine flush), and may inhibit sweating, thereby causing hyperthermia, particularly in a warm environment or with exercise [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Sublingual atropine for sialorrhea secondary to parkinsonism: a pilot study [^40f16f4f]. Movement Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Sialorrhea is a relatively common symptom in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and related conditions for which most of the accepted treatments are either highly invasive or may cause substantial systemic side effects. This study describes an open-label pilot study of sublingual atropine drops for the treatment of sialorrhea in 7 patients (6 with Parkinson's disease, 1 with progressive supranuclear palsy). Participants demonstrated statistically significant declines in saliva production, both objectively and subjectively. Self-reported drooling severity showed a significant decline between baseline and 180 minutes, t(6) = 3.240 P < 0.025 (eta(2) = 0.636), and between baseline and 1 week, t(6) = 4.583 P < 0.005 (eta(2) = 0.778). Objectively measured saliva production decreased significantly between baseline and the 1-week follow-up, t(6) = 2.711 P < 0.05 (eta(2) = 0.551). Delirium occurred in 1 patient (concurrent with a urinary tract infection), and 2 patients experienced worsening of hallucinations (active hallucinosis was concealed by both individuals to allow participation in the trial). The remaining trial participants did not experience any anticholinergic side effects. This trial shows that, in selected patient populations, sublingual atropine is a simple and inexpensive treatment for sialorrhea associated with parkinsonism.

### Atropine sulfate monohydrate (atropine sulfate) [^4043f811]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Atropine is an antimuscarinic agent since it antagonizes the muscarine-like actions of acetylcholine and other choline esters.

Atropine inhibits the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves, and on smooth muscles which respond to endogenous acetylcholine but are not so innervated. As with other antimuscarinic agents, the major action of atropine is a competitive or surmountable antagonism which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at receptor sites of the effector organ (e.g., by using anticholinesterase agents which inhibit the enzymatic destruction of acetylcholine). The receptors antagonized by atropine are the peripheral structures that are stimulated or inhibited by muscarine (i.e., exocrine glands and smooth and cardiac muscle). Responses to postganglionic cholinergic nerve stimulation also may be inhibited by atropine but this occurs less readily than with responses to injected (exogenous) choline esters.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Atropine-induced parasympathetic inhibition may be preceded by a transient phase of stimulation, especially on the heart where small doses first slow the rate before characteristic tachycardia develops due to paralysis of vagal control. Atropine exerts a more potent and prolonged effect on heart, intestine and bronchial muscle than scopolamine, but its action on the iris, ciliary body and certain secretory glands is weaker than that of scopolamine. Unlike the latter, atropine in clinical doses does not depress the central nervous system but may stimulate the medulla and higher cerebral centers. Although mild vagal excitation occurs, the increased respiratory rate and (sometimes) increased depth of respiration produced by atropine are more probably the result of bronchiolar dilatation. Accordingly, atropine is an unreliable respiratory stimulant and large or repeated doses may depress respiration.

Adequate doses of atropine abolish various types of reflex vagal cardiac slowing or asystole. The drug also prevents or abolishes bradycardia or asystole produced by injection of choline esters, anticholinesterase agents or other parasympathomimetic drugs, and cardiac arrest produced by stimulation of the vagus. Atropine also may lessen the degree of partial heart block when vagal activity is an etiologic factor. In some patients with complete heart block, the idioventricular rate may be accelerated by atropine; in others, the rate is stabilized. Occasionally a large dose may cause atrioventricular (A-V) block and nodal rhythm.

### Evaluation of the pediatric bonfils fiberscope for elective endotracheal intubation [^5daf2c3d]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Difficult airway management in children is a particular challenge for anesthesiologists and pediatricians. This study was designed to evaluate the performance of the recently developed pediatric versions of the Bonfils fiberscope for elective endotracheal intubation during routine surgical procedures.

Methods

After approval by the institutional review board and written informed consent, 55 children (age 6 ± 4 years) scheduled for elective minor surgical procedures were enrolled. Nineteen children received atropine before the intubation attempt, while in the remaining 36 children, no antisialogogue was used. For endotracheal tubes up to 3.5 mm internal diameter, a fiberscope with outer diameter (OD) 2 mm, and for larger endotracheal tubes, a fiberscope OD 3.5 mm was used. Time to intubation and failure rate were obtained.

Results

In the 36 children without and the 19 children with atropine pretreatment, the success rate for tracheal intubation on the first attempt was 69%/78% (25/15 patients). 4/3 patients and 2/0 patients were intubated after two and three attempts, respectively, and in 5/1 patients (14%/5%) intubation failed even after three attempts. Time to intubation was median 58/60 s, 25th-75th percentile 35–100/32–110 s, and range 14–377/18–360 s. In both groups, failed intubations were because of the secretions contaminating the optic aperture.

Conclusions

High failure rate and increased intubation times suggest that the pediatric Bonfils fiberscope has significant drawbacks when used for intubation of normal pediatric airways.

### Sugammadex for reversing neuromuscular blockade in infants and children [^98dba78b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are an essential component of modern anesthesia practice, facilitating optimal surgical conditions by inducing skeletal muscle relaxation, enabling tracheal intubation, and improving intraoperative safety. Their use is particularly important in pediatric anesthesia, where maintaining adequate ventilation and surgical exposure can be challenging due to the unique anatomical and physiological characteristics of infants and children. Rocuronium and vecuronium are widely used NMBAs that effectively induce temporary muscle paralysis.

Traditionally, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, such as neostigmine, have been the standard agents used for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade. The mechanism of action of these agents involves inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction, and restoring neuromuscular transmission by displacing the neuromuscular agent from its binding site. However, they do have disadvantages. Their non‐specific effect causes concurrent stimulation of muscarinic receptors, leading to undesirable cholinergic side effects such as bradycardia, bronchospasm, and muscarinic side effects such as salivation, increased bronchial secretions, and gastrointestinal hypermotility, which require a high dose of anticholinergic agents for mitigation. For instance, neostigmine is often co‐administered with the anticholinergic agents atropine or glycopyrrolate, which can cause adverse effects such as tachycardia, dry mouth, and urinary retention. Another concern about the use of neostigmine is the persistence of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade despite administering the reversal agent, which can increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications such as hypoxia and respiratory distress, especially among pediatric patients with limited respiratory reserve. Given these risks, further investigation into alternative reversal agents such as sugammadex is warranted, specifically in terms of benefits and harms in comparison to neostigmine and pyridostigmine.

Atropine

Atropine competitively blocks the effects of acetylcholine, including excess acetylcholine due to organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning, at muscarinic cholinergic receptors on smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, secretory gland cells, and in peripheral autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system.

Pralidoxime Chloride

Pralidoxime chloride reactivates acetylcholinesterase which has been inactivated by phosphorylation due to susceptible organophosphorus nerve agents having anticholinesterase activity. However, pralidoxime chloride does not reactivate acetylcholinesterase inactivated by all organophosphorus nerve agents (e.g. soman). Pralidoxime chloride cannot reactivate phosphorylated acetylcholinesterases that have undergone a further chemical reaction known as "aging". Reactivated acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes excess acetylcholine resulting from organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning to help restore impaired cholinergic neural function.

### Early oral hydration on demand in postanesthesia care unit effectively relieves postoperative thirst in patients after gynecological laparoscopy: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^0bec19dd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study was the first to allow early oral hydration on demand in patients in the PACU after a gynecological laparoscopy under general anesthesia. The findings of this randomized study show that this practice was not only safe and effective in relieving postoperative thirst in patient but could also significantly increase patient comfort. This study added clinical practice evidence on early oral hydration on demand in patients in the PACU.

In our study, the prevalence of thirst in patients in the PACU was as high as 94.4%, significantly higher than the results reported by Lee et al. The main reasons are as follows: ① The average preoperative fasting time was approximately 13 h, much longer than the specified period, which was consistent with the previous report by Wu et al. ② Atropine was used in 90 (50%) patients in the course of surgery to prevent severe bradycardia or combined with neostigmine to antagonize the residual muscle relaxation after general anesthesia, thereby improving the safety and subsequent recovery in patients. The application of atropine inhibited glandular secretion and increased postoperative thirst. ③ The main focus of our study were female patients. Female patients with insufficient water intake generally feel more pain and anxiety. This can further increase their thirst intensity. Therefore, it is necessary to relieve postoperative thirst in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy with general anesthesia.

### Comparative effects of glycopyrrolate vs. atropine combined with neostigmine on heart rate dynamics and safety outcomes in pediatric patients: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^a092e1b9]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Another advantage of glycopyrrolate is that its quaternary ammonium structure makes it less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in fewer central nervous system-related adverse events, such as postoperative delirium, and minimal cognitive impact. This makes it an ideal anticholinergic agent to be used in conjunction with neostigmine. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences in recovery time or the incidence of delirium between the two groups, and glycopyrrolate did not demonstrate a clear advantage in reducing postoperative delirium in children. Numerous factors can influence postoperative delirium, including advanced age, cognitive impairment, anemia, infection, and pain, with anticholinergic drugs being only one of the contributing factors. Furthermore, assessing postoperative delirium in children is more challenging than in adults.

Our study observed a significantly higher incidence of dry mouth in the glycopyrrolate group compared to the placebo (42% vs. 21%, P < 0.01). Glycopyrrolate, as an anticholinergic agent, causes dry mouth by competitively blocking M 3 muscarinic receptors on the salivary glands. This inhibits the action of acetylcholine, significantly reducing salivary secretion. Dry mouth is a direct manifestation of its peripheral anticholinergic effects and a common side effect. While dry mouth is a known side effect of anticholinergics like glycopyrrolate in adults, its implications in pediatric populations warrant specific emphasis. Age has no prominent effect on the pharmacokinetics of glycopyrrolate in children older than 2 months. In pediatric patients, dry mouth can cause discomfort, irritability, or difficulty swallowing, which may affect postoperative recovery, which can exacerbate anxiety in both the children and their parents. Shortening the preoperative and postoperative fasting periods can partially alleviate dry mouth discomfort in pediatric patients. For example, the preoperative water fasting time may be delayed until 2 h before surgery. Postoperatively, based on the patient's level of consciousness, the fasting duration may be appropriately reduced, with oral fluid intake attempted as early as 2 h after surgery.

Atropine toxicity

Excess atropine causes agitation, confusion, urinary retention, hyperthermia, bowel ileus and tachycardia. During regular observation for signs of overtreatment, check for the features given in Table 3.

The presence of all three suggests that too much atropine is being given. Stop the atropine infusion. Check again after 30 min to see whether the features of toxicity have settled. If not, continue to review every 30 min or so. When they do settle, restart at 70–80% of the previous rate. The patient should then be seen frequently to ensure that the new infusion rate has reduced the signs of atropine toxicity without permitting the reappearance of cholinergic signs.

Do not follow heart rate and pupil size because they can be fast or slow, and big or small, respectively, depending on the balance of nicotinic and muscarinic features. Tachycardia also occurs with rapid administration of oximes and with pneumonia, hypovolaemia, hypoxia, and alcohol withdrawal, and is not a contraindication to giving atropine.

Catheterise unconscious patients soon after resuscitation is completed. Look for urinary retention in an agitated confused patient; agitation may settle after insertion of the catheter.

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^48fb3865]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

For SG-related any-grade diarrhea, we recommend initiating treatment with 4 mg of oral loperamide, followed by 2 mg thereafter with each episode, to a maximum dose of 16 mg/day until resolved. If diarrhea is not resolved after 24 hours or the patient is experiencing 3–4 stools per day when at a near maximum loperamide dose, oral 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine sulfate should be considered 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 20 mg diphenoxylate-0.2 mg atropine sulfate per day until control is achieved. Discontinue diphenoxylate-atropine use if clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days of administering the maximum dose. Because the severity of diarrhea associated with SG can vary widely by case, some patients may benefit from alternating loperamide with diphenoxylate-atropine administration. We have used loperamide prophylactically (not routine) and administered loperamide alternating with diphenoxylate-atropine. The PRIMED study included an investigation of the use of prophylactic loperamide with SG therapy, with loperamide given for 3 consecutive days after SG administration (ie, Days 2, 3, and 4 and Days 9, 10, and 11) for the first 2 cycles (with the option to extend to the next cycle based on the physician's discretion). Rates of diarrhea (34%)were lower compared with those reported in the ASCENT (65%)and TROPiCS-02 (62%)studies (Table 1). Constipation was observed in 46% of patients in PRIMED; whereas rates of 37% and 19% were observed in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02, respectively. Octreotide (100–150 μg, may increase to 500–2000 μg intravenous [IV] or SQ 3 times daily; discontinue within 24 hours of resolution to reduce risk of ileus) can also be effective with unusual cases of persisting diarrhea. However, the octreotide injection is painful, and ice on the injection site may be helpful. Additionally, patients should hydrate with oral or IV fluids as needed.

### Clinical features of audible upper airway secretions ("death rattle") in patients with cancer in the last days of life [^9920c3e9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, this study found a statistically significant association between the presence restlessness / agitation (and pain) and the presence of audible secretions. We found no supporting evidence within the literature, and there are multiple references to the fact that patients with audible secretions do not generally appear to be distressed (suggesting an absence of agitation). Additionally, Campbell et al. reported that audible secretions were not associated with "respiratory distress". Reassuringly, this study noted that most patients with audible secretions were not restless / agitated (or in pain). It is unclear why such an association would exist, and this will be further examined in the ongoing (larger) CHELsea II trial.

In terms of management, the "usual" interventions for audible secretions involve repositioning of the patient, oropharyngeal suctioning, reassurance for the relatives (around the absence of patient distress), and use of anticholinergic medication, although other strategies have been suggested to manage this condition (i.e. reduction in rate of respiration, bronchodilation). The relevant Cochrane systematic review concluded that "there was no evidence to show that any intervention, be it pharmacological or non-pharmacological, was superior to placebo in the treatment of noisy breathing". However, the data from this study, and clinical experience, suggests that many patients with audible secretions do improve following treatment with anticholinergic medication, although whether this is due to the medication or natural history remains undetermined.

The main strengths of this study are the trial design (i.e. multicentre randomised controlled trial), and the routine / regular assessment of audible secretions. The main limitations of this study are the sample size (i.e. 200 participants), and the subjective assessment of audible secretions. Thus, the assessment was clinical in nature, and necessitated differentiation between "death rattle" and other potential causes of "noisy breathing". Importantly, there is no method of differentiating between the different types of audible upper airway secretions.

### Narrative review of diagnosis, management and treatment of dysphagia and sialorrhea in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^03c58cf4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Enteral tube feeding represents a safe method to ensure adequate nutrition in patients with severe dysphagia. Various methods include nasogastric (NG) tubes, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), PEG with jejunal extension (PEG-J), surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ), and surgical jejunostomy. Another way is the percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG), which is less invasive. These procedures can be performed on an outpatient or inpatient basis in settings such as the endoscopy suite, radiology suite, or operating room. Fine-bore NG are suitable for short-term feeding, but they pose challenges such as easy displacement, high visibility, discomfort for the patient, and elevated risk of ulceration, aspiration pneumonia, and oro­pharyngeal secretions. PEG with pre-intervention antibiotic treatment, gradual restoration of feeding, and peri-interventional support is recommended for cases of advanced dysphagia and weight loss. In the most recent Cochrane review, results from 23 non-randomized studies comparing enteral tube feeding to oral feeding in individuals with ALS were examined. Notably, two prospective and five retrospective studies indicated an extended survival for individuals with ALS after undergoing PEG compared to those without PEG, even after accounting for potential confounding factors in multivariate analysis. However, four prospective, 10 retrospective, and two post hoc analysis studies did not demonstrate a survival advantage associated with PEG. All of these findings collectively supported the conclusion that there is no evidence indicating that enteral tube feeding enhances survival, nutritional status, or QoL in patients with ALS compared to the continuation of oral feeding alone.

Pharmacological treatment options for sialorrhea include pirenzepine, ipratropium bromide spray, scopolamine transdermal patch, amitriptyline, sublingual application of atropine 1% eye drops, and ultrasound-guided injection of incobotulinumtoxin A into the parotid and submandibular salivary glands. Fractionated radiation of salivary glands (7–8 Gray) is considered as an option in cases of treatment-resistant sialorrhea. The latest Cochrane review identified only four randomized controlled trials with 110 ALS patients. There was low-certainty or moderate-certainty evidence supporting the effectiveness of botulinum toxin B injections into salivary glands and moderate-certainty evidence for the use of oral combination of 20 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide and 10 mg quinidine sulfate in treating sialorrhea in motor neuron disease. However, the evidence comparing radiotherapy to botulinum toxin A injections and scopolamine patches was too uncertain to draw conclusive conclusions.

### Is oxygen required before atropine administration in organophosphorus or carbamate pesticide poisoning? – A cohort study [^35ceb568]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pesticide self-poisoning is a major global clinical problem, killing an estimated 350,000 people every year. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified pesticide poisoning as the single most common method of suicide worldwide. Organophosphorus (OP) insecticides are the most important pesticides and act through phosphorylating the active site of cholinesterases, resulting in acetylcholine build-up. This produces excessive cholinergic stimulation, causing clinical features in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Carbamate insecticides are also important and produce similar effects.

Despite the widespread incidence of OP and carbamate insecticide poisoning, there has been little agreement about the best treatment. Therapy involves resuscitation including administration of oxygen and fluids, support for airway and ventilation, a muscarinic antagonist (usually atropine) and, for OP poisoning, an acetylcholinesterase reactivator (usually pralidoxime or obidoxime). Atropine and oximes were introduced into clinical practice without clinical trials to guide their use; therefore, the best way of using these drugs is still under study.

A recent trial from Bangladeshshowed markedly more rapid atropinisation of OP-poisoned patients with a doubling dose regimenof atropine rather than a standard bolus dose regimen. The time to stabilisation was reduced from a mean of 152 min (95% CI: 130–173) to 24 min (95% CI: 20–28) (P < 0.001) in those receiving the doubling regimen; this faster stabilisation was associated with a mortality reduction from 22.5% to 8% (P = 0.01). This study demonstrates a clear clinical benefit achieved by administering atropine rapidly to sick patients with anticholinesterase insecticide poisoning.

However, such rapid administration of atropine is hindered by textbooks and articles stating that oxygen must be given prior to atropine due to the risk of atropine-induced ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (Box 1). District hospitals in rural Asia, which deal with the vast majority of anticholinesterase poisoned patients, are often understaffed and inadequately equipped. Many of the these hospitals do not have easy access to oxygen and this practice therefore causes a delay in administering atropine or for atropine to be withheld. This delay will result in prolonged hazardous cholinergic effects such as bronchospasm, bronchorrhoea, bradycardia and hypotension, risking the patient's life (Box 2).

This effect is manifested by mild central vagal excitation and moderate respiratory stimulation. Atropine sulfate also acts peripherally as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic actions of acetylcholine. It does not prevent the release of acetylcholine but antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine on the effector cells. These actions include vasodilation, drying of the mouth, an increase in the pulse rate, inhibition of contractions of the gastrointestinal tract, ureter, and bladder, and reduction of salivary, bronchial, gastric and sweat gland secretions. Following clinical and larger doses, atropine sulfate causes dilation of the pupils and paralysis of accommodation and in narrow-angle glaucoma, can increase intraocular pressure. Receptors at various sites are not equally sensitive to inhibitory effects of antimuscarinics; therefore, the degree of inhibition at each site is dose-dependent.

In general, the relative sensitivity of physiologic functions, proceeding from the most sensitive, is as follows: secretions of the salivary, bronchial, and sweat glands; pupillary dilation, ocular accommodation, and heart rate; contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder and smooth muscle of the GI tract; and gastric secretion and motility. and 50% of the patients died in the atropine only and the atropine plus obidoxime groups, respectively. Although not statistically significant, AChE reactivation was only observed in the atropine plus 2-PAM group. In other clinical. Hyperglycemia, ketonuria, low serum triglyceride, hypopotassemia were observed in severely affected victims, which abnormalities were attributed to damage of the adrenal medulla. Oximes, atropine sulfate, diazepam and ample intravenous infusion were effective treatments. Pralidoxime iodide IV reversed cholinesterase and symptoms quickly even if administered 6 h after exposure. Hague JD, Derr JJ.

### Glycopyrrolate (Glycopyrrolate 1ml) [^92a72885]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents, inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions.

Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms (e.g., bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, and intestinal hypermotility) induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases.

The highly polar quaternary ammonium group of glycopyrrolate limits its passage across lipid membranes, such as the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide, which are highly non-polar tertiary amines which penetrate lipid barriers easily.

With intravenous injection, the onset of action is generally evident within one minute. Following intramuscular administration, the onset of action is noted in 15 to 30 minutes, with peak effects occurring within approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The vagal blocking effects persist for 2 to 3 hours and the antisialagogue effects persist up to 7 hours, periods longer than for atropine.

### Endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) in children: a position paper from the NASPGHAN pancreas committee [^c3d32c7a]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). High credibility.

Safety of endoscopic pancreatic function testing (ePFT) and medication effects: ePFT is technically a straightforward procedure to perform in children and requires sedation for endoscopy, carrying the standard risk for both anesthesia and EGD. Secretin can cause a mild increase in heart rate with an average rise of 7 beats/min and mild elevations in blood pressure, but these changes are not clinically significant, and the serum half-life of intravenously administered secretin is 4 minutes. There are currently no contraindications to human secretin, pork allergy applies only to porcine-derived secretin, secretin can be used safely during acute pancreatitis if needed, and adverse events have not been reported with CCK in pediatric studies. Several medications modify pancreatic secretions: morphine increases pancreatic secretion and decreases enzyme secretion; glucagon suppresses pancreatic enzyme output and, to a lesser extent, bicarbonate; diazepam with hyoscine butylbromide reduces trypsin secretion and delays appearance of bilirubin in duodenal aspirate; and low-dose atropine (0.01 mg/kg) decreases both basal and secretin-stimulated bicarbonate secretion. The impact of these medications on the sensitivity and specificity of ePFT for diagnosing EPI in children needs further study.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine — clinical considerations: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand and decreases coronary perfusion, it is best avoided where coronary ischemia is a concern and has only a second-line role in resuscitation, with two randomized trials in cardiac arrest showing no improvement in return of spontaneous circulation or survival. In unstable bradycardia refractory to fluids and atropine, a trial of 82 patients randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In heart transplant recipients, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest in 20% of 25 patients, and parasympathetic reinnervation was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series.

### Audit of double-lumen endobronchial intubation [^8dc603a1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many technical variations are possible in the placing and management of a double-lumen tube (DLT). We surveyed our practice to relate these variations to the course of the anaesthetic.

Methods

We used a questionnaire to obtain details of technique in 506 consecutive double lumen intubations. The details were related to the incidence of secretions, tube displacement, and decreases of oxygen saturation (< 88%) during one lung anaesthesia (OLA).

Results

Robertshaw tubes were used for 482 of the 506 intubations. During OLA there were 48 instances of desaturation (< 88%), 19 cases of upper lobe obstruction, 15 of carinal obstruction, 16 of isolation failure, eight of excessive secretions (none of whom had received an antisialogogue; P < 0.01) and 12 miscellaneous events. The experience of the anaesthetist or use of a fibre-optic bronchoscope did not affect these events. Air was of no advantage as a maintenance gas. Atropine 400–600 micro g appeared to prevent desaturation on OLA (P < 0.05) but glycopyrrolate 200 micro g did not.

Conclusion

Most factors had little effect on the progress of the anaesthetic, but an antimuscarinic usefully reduced secretions, and atropine (but not glycopyrrolate) was associated with less desaturation during OLA.

Revised ATA management guidelines for MTC — management of hormonally active metastasis–related diarrhea explains that diarrhea is a common occurrence in patients with advanced MTC and markedly elevated serum Ctn levels and occurs most frequently with advanced disease and hepatic metastases; it may be hypersecretory, due to enhanced gastrointestinal motility, or both. Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol intake and to maintain a diet that limits high-fiber foods, and the antimotility agents loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, or codeine have minimal side effects and should be used as first-line therapy; treatment with somatostatin analogs and debulking of large tumors has also been employed, and rarely the MTC cells inappropriately secrete corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) or ACTH.

The second problem was related to the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. This syndrome often involves respiratory impairment and dysphagia that can increase the risk of postoperative respiratory complications due to regurgitation and aspiration of oral secretions or gastric contents during the perioperative period. In general, cranial nerves play an important role in regulating all the phases of swallowing. Therefore, impairment of the cranial nerves (especially V, VII, IX, X, and XII) can lead to decreased laryngeal behavior, pharyngeal retention after swallowing, decreased vocal fold adduction leading to dysphonia and decreased coughing effectiveness, and silent aspiration. In our patient's case, dysphagia was observed because cerebral nerves IX, X, and XII were affected. In addition, silent aspiration is not related to food intake and often occurs when aspiration worsens owing to a decrease in the cough reflex at night. Therefore, even patients who have undergone gastrostomy and have no oral intake should be carefully monitored. Although our patient had no oral food intake in the perioperative period, he was hospitalized for aspiration pneumonia at least once a year; therefore, it was highly probable that he aspirated oral secretions on a routine basis due to dysphagia. Hence, the patient was at a particularly high risk of aspiration pneumonia in the perioperative period. Therefore, anesthesia was planned to prevent aspiration as much as possible. First, no premedication was administered to avoid functional impairment of swallowing and cough reflexes due to somnolence. Although we were concerned about the increase in secretions due to weeping, we thought it would be possible for him to enter the operating room and receive an intravenous line without premedication, considering his cooperation during blood collection and in general. In addition, an anticholinergic agent, atropine sulfate, was administered immediately after securing the venous route to control oral secretions. Anticholinergic drugs can also cause depression of cough reflex, impairment of ciliary motility, and increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. However, in studies of Moebius syndrome, there were significant problems of partial airway obstruction, pulmonary aspiration, and hypoxemia due to secretions during recovery, so the use of antisialagogues could be recommended. That was a difficult decision, but we used atropine sulfate because of excessive saliva production in this case.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^5901fa6e]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the 2002 version of "Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient".

Design

A Task Force comprising 17 members of the Society of Critical Medicine with particular expertise in the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents; a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert; and a medical writer met via teleconference and three face-to-face meetings and communicated via e-mail to examine the evidence and develop these practice guidelines. Annually, all members completed conflict of interest statements; no conflicts were identified. This activity was funded by the Society for Critical Care Medicine, and no industry support was provided.

Methods

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation expert on the Task Force created profiles for the evidence related to six of the 21 questions and assigned quality-of-evidence scores to these and the additional 15 questions for which insufficient evidence was available to create a profile. Task Force members reviewed this material and all available evidence and provided recommendations, suggestions, or good practice statements for these 21 questions.

Results

The Task Force developed a single strong recommendation: we recommend scheduled eye care that includes lubricating drops or gel and eyelid closure for patients receiving continuous infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. The Task Force developed 10 weak recommendations. 1) We suggest that a neuromuscular-blocking agent be administered by continuous intravenous infusion early in the course of acute respiratory distress syndrome for patients with a PaO2/FIO2 less than 150. 2) We suggest against the routine administration of an neuromuscular-blocking agents to mechanically ventilated patients with status asthmaticus. 3) We suggest a trial of a neuromuscular-blocking agents in life-threatening situations associated with profound hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, or hemodynamic compromise. 4) We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents may be used to manage overt shivering in therapeutic hypothermia. 5) We suggest that peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring may be a useful tool for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade but only if it is incorporated into a more inclusive assessment of the patient that includes clinical assessment. 6) We suggest against the use of peripheral nerve stimulation with train of four alone for monitoring the depth of neuromuscular blockade in patients receiving continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 7) We suggest that patients receiving a continuous infusion of neuromuscular-blocking agent receive a structured physiotherapy regimen. 8) We suggest that clinicians target a blood glucose level of less than 180mg/dL in patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. 9) We suggest that clinicians not use actual body weight and instead use a consistent weight (ideal body weight or adjusted body weight) when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agents doses for obese patients. 10) We suggest that neuromuscular-blocking agents be discontinued at the end of life or when life support is withdrawn. In situations in which evidence was lacking or insufficient and the study results were equivocal or optimal clinical practice varies, the Task Force made no recommendations for nine of the topics. 1) We make no recommendation as to whether neuromuscular blockade is beneficial or harmful when used in patients with acute brain injury and raised intracranial pressure. 2) We make no recommendation on the routine use of neuromuscular-blocking agents for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest. 3) We make no recommendation on the use of peripheral nerve stimulation to monitor degree of block in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 4) We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular blockade to improve the accuracy of intravascular-volume assessment in mechanically ventilated patients. 5) We make no recommendation concerning the use of electroencephalogram-derived parameters as a measure of sedation during continuous administration of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 6) We make no recommendation regarding nutritional requirements specific to patients receiving infusions of neuromuscular-blocking agents. 7) We make no recommendation concerning the use of one measure of consistent weight over another when calculating neuromuscular-blocking agent doses in obese patients. 8) We make no recommendation on the use of neuromuscular-blocking agents in pregnant patients. 9) We make no recommendation on which muscle group should be monitored in patients with myasthenia gravis receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. Finally, in situations in which evidence was lacking or insufficient but expert consensus was unanimous, the Task Force developed six good practice statements. 1) If peripheral nerve stimulation is used, optimal clinical practice suggests that it should be done in conjunction with assessment of other clinical findings (e.g., triggering of the ventilator and degree of shivering) to assess the degree of neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 2) Optimal clinical practice suggests that a protocol should include guidance on neuromuscular-blocking agent administration in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 3) Optimal clinical practice suggests that analgesic and sedative drugs should be used prior to and during neuromuscular blockade, with the goal of achieving deep sedation. 4) Optimal clinical practice suggests that clinicians at the bedside implement measure to attenuate the risk of unintended extubation in patients receiving neuromuscular-blocking agents. 5) Optimal clinical practice suggests that a reduced dose of an neuromuscular-blocking agent be used for patients with myasthenia gravis and that the dose should be based on peripheral nerve stimulation with train-of-four monitoring. 6) Optimal clinical practice suggests that neuromuscular-blocking agents be discontinued prior to the clinical determination of brain death.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — atropine and isoproterenol in sinus bradycardia: In patients with sinus bradycardia, atropine at dosages of 0.5 to 2 mg usually enhances automaticity, but in rare cases can be associated with intra-atrial reentry and or sinus pauses. The sinoatrial node response to atropine is bimodal, lower doses (usually < 0.5 mg) are associated with slower rates and acceleration with higher doses. In patients with hemodynamically unstable sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, atropine has demonstrated some benefit and minimal risk of worsening bradycardia, ischemia or potentiating ventricular fibrillation, and in an RCT of men undergoing elective laparoscopic prostate surgery, atropine effectively treated anesthetic induced sinus bradycardia. For isoproterenol, there are numerous case reports and series describing the salutary use in patients presenting with sinus bradycardia; however, there are no clinical trials or observational series data to support or discourage its use in this setting, and because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand through beta-1 effects while decreasing coronary perfusion attributable to beta-2 effects, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia.
