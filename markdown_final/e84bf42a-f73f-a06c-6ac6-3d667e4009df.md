## Question

A 52-year-old man underwent a kidney transplant 6 months ago and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. He is admitted to the hospital with a painful, vesicular rash distributed along the right thoracic dermatome, which is clinically diagnosed as herpes zoster. His wife, who is his primary caregiver, and his 18-year-old daughter, who lives in the same household, have both never had chickenpox or received any varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. The infectious diseases team is consulted for infection control and prevention recommendations.

Based on current guidelines, what infection control precautions should be implemented for this patient during his hospital stay, and what specific recommendations should be made for his VZV-seronegative household contacts?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about infection control precautions for a kidney transplant recipient with herpes zoster and what to do for his VZV-seronegative household contacts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and the implications for transmission. Then, I should verify the most authoritative guideline for isolation in solid organ transplant recipients with zoster. Next, I will review general isolation principles to ensure consistency. After that, I need to check the household contact risk and the timing and options for post-exposure prophylaxis, including vaccine versus VariZIG. Finally, I will synthesize practical, time-sensitive recommendations and note any exceptions or special circumstances I should confirm before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the patient's risk and why this matters for infection control. A kidney transplant recipient 6 months post-transplant on tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone is significantly immunocompromised, and herpes zoster in this population carries a meaningful risk of dissemination and severe complications, which elevates transmission concerns and justifies enhanced precautions until dissemination is excluded or the illness resolves [^114BPwx5] [^117QVpHY].

> Wait, let me verify the most specific guidance for isolation in solid organ transplant recipients with zoster. The American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases Community of Practice recommends that all immunosuppressed patients admitted with varicella or herpes zoster be placed on airborne and contact precautions, which applies directly to this patient regardless of whether the rash is localized or disseminated at presentation [^114BPwx5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should reconcile this with broader isolation frameworks. The CDC 2007 isolation guideline advises airborne plus contact precautions for disseminated zoster and for immunocompromised patients with localized disease until dissemination is ruled out, and standard precautions for immunocompetent patients with localized, coverable lesions until crusted; given the transplant status, the AST directive to use airborne and contact precautions is the more conservative and appropriate standard here [^1131socN] [^114BPwx5].

> I need to ensure I specify duration and practical steps. Precautions should continue until all lesions are dry and crusted and no new lesions have appeared for at least 48 hours, with daily reassessment for dissemination; if dissemination is identified, extend precautions for the duration of illness and coordinate with infection prevention for room assignment and staffing of immune caregivers when possible [^1131socN] [^111XJLH6].

> Next, I should review the household contact risk and the window for intervention. Close household exposure to zoster carries a nontrivial risk of primary varicella in susceptible contacts, with attack rates around 15% in one study, and the risk is higher with prolonged, intimate contact; thus, post-exposure prophylaxis should be offered as soon as possible, ideally within 3 days and up to 5–10 days depending on modality, balancing efficacy and feasibility [^1135NHyY].

> Let me consider vaccination first. For immunocompetent, VZV-seronegative adults with a discrete exposure, varicella vaccine is preferred if administered within 3–5 days of exposure, with possible benefit up to 5 days; this leverages both pre-symptomatic protection and attenuation of disease if infection occurs, and aligns with ACIP/AST guidance for post-exposure vaccination in eligible contacts [^1173wkiz] [^1135NHyY].

> But wait, what if vaccine is contraindicated or the window is missed. VariZIG is indicated for high-risk, seronegative contacts, including those with close exposure to zoster, and should be given as soon as possible and within 10 days; in this case, both the wife and adult daughter are seronegative and have had close exposure, so VariZIG is reasonable if vaccine is not feasible or if more than 5 days have elapsed since exposure [^1173wkiz].

> I should double-check the timing nuance. If VariZIG is given, varicella vaccination should be delayed for about 5 months to avoid interference; conversely, if antiviral post-exposure prophylaxis is used, vaccination should be delayed by at least 3 days after the last antiviral dose, which matters if antivirals are chosen instead of VariZIG in exceptional circumstances [^112buwqq] [^112BN1aQ].

> Let me synthesize the household recommendations succinctly. Both the wife and daughter should receive post-exposure prophylaxis urgently: prioritize varicella vaccine if within 3–5 days of exposure, otherwise administer VariZIG as soon as possible within 10 days; counsel on symptom surveillance for 10–21 days and advise avoiding contact with the patient until his lesions are crusted to reduce transmission risk [^117NF1xj] [^115hsJAZ].

> I should confirm a potential point of confusion. Initially, I thought the recombinant zoster vaccine might be appropriate for the 18-year-old daughter, but wait, that would be incorrect for post-exposure prophylaxis; Shingrix is for prevention of zoster in immunocompromised adults and is not indicated for post-exposure prevention of varicella in seronegative contacts, so I should not recommend RZV for her in this context [^1137fhkA] [^114FFxtk].

> Finally, I will integrate the inpatient and outpatient actions into a coherent plan. Inpatient: maintain airborne and contact precautions with immune caregivers when possible until lesions are crusted and no new lesions appear for 48 hours, with daily reassessment for dissemination. Outpatient: arrange urgent post-exposure prophylaxis for the wife and daughter within the next 1–2 days, document immunity status and exposure details, and provide return precautions for fever or rash; coordinate with occupational health if any healthcare workers were exposed and ensure VZV immunity documentation for staff caring for the patient [^114BPwx5] [^1131socN] [^117NF1xj].

For a kidney transplant recipient with herpes zoster, **airborne and contact precautions** are required for the duration of illness and until all lesions are crusted, given the risk of dissemination and transmission [^114BPwx5] [^1131socN]. Susceptible household contacts (wife and daughter) should receive **varicella vaccine within 3–5 days** of exposure if feasible; if not, give VariZIG within 10 days [^117NF1xj] [^115hsJAZ]. Monitor contacts for fever or rash for 21 days and advise strict hand hygiene and avoidance of contact with the patient until lesions are crusted [^notfound].

## Infection control precautions for the hospitalized patient

### Isolation precautions

- **Airborne and contact precautions**: Required for immunocompromised patients with herpes zoster, including solid organ transplant recipients, for the duration of illness and until all lesions are crusted [^114BPwx5] [^1131socN].

- **Standard precautions**: Hand hygiene, gloves, gown, mask, and eye protection during patient care [^1131socN].

- **Room placement**: Preferentially in a negative-pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR); if unavailable, place in a private room with the door closed [^1131socN].

- **Duration of precautions**: Continue until all lesions are dry and crusted, with no new lesions for 48 hours [^notfound].

---

### Healthcare worker precautions

Healthcare workers should be **immune to VZV** (documented vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, or verified history of varicella or zoster) [^112hm7oW]. Susceptible workers should avoid caring for the patient; if unavoidable, use airborne and contact precautions with fit-tested N95 respirators [^1131socN].

---

## Recommendations for VZV-seronegative household contacts

### Post-exposure prophylaxis

- **Varicella vaccine**: Offer to susceptible contacts within 3–5 days of exposure; may still be given up to 10 days, though efficacy wanes with delay [^117NF1xj].

- **VariZIG**: If vaccine is contraindicated or unavailable, administer VariZIG within 10 days of exposure (ideally within 96 hours) [^115hsJAZ] [^115CFqzM].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for fever or rash for 21 days after exposure; advise immediate medical evaluation if symptoms occur [^notfound].

---

### Infection control measures at home

- **Avoidance of contact**: Susceptible contacts should avoid direct contact with the patient until all lesions are crusted [^113qc4Vu].

- **Hand hygiene**: Strict hand hygiene after any contact with the patient or environment [^1131socN].

- **Isolation of patient**: The patient should remain isolated at home until lesions are fully crusted [^111upqMD].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Setting** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Hospitalized patient | - Airborne and contact precautions <br/> - Standard precautions <br/> - Negative-pressure room if available <br/> - Continue until lesions are crusted |
| Healthcare workers | - Documented VZV immunity required <br/> - Susceptible workers avoid care or use N95 respirators |
| Household contacts | - Varicella vaccine within 3–5 days of exposure <br/> - VariZIG if vaccine contraindicated or unavailable <br/> - Monitor for 21 days <br/> - Avoid contact until lesions are crusted |

---

These measures align with current guidelines and balance the patient's need for care with the risk of VZV transmission to susceptible contacts [^114BPwx5] [^1131socN] [^117NF1xj].

Prevention of transmission from zoster — exclusion, contact avoidance, and postexposure prophylaxis: Some health-care institutions might exclude personnel with zoster from work until their lesions dry and crust. Persons with localized zoster should avoid contact with susceptible persons at high risk for severe varicella in household and occupational settings until lesions are crusted, including pregnant women, all premature infants born to susceptible mothers, infants born at < 28 weeks gestation to susceptible mothers regardless of their maternal immune status, and immunocompromised persons of all ages. Persons with opportunities for contact with such high risk-persons in household or occupational settings should be informed about how to recognize the signs and symptoms of zoster. If a person susceptible to varicella infection has close exposure to a person with zoster, postexposure varicella prophylaxis with varicella vaccine or VARIZIGSM should be considered.

Risk for transmission of Oka/Merck strain after receiving zoster vaccine — persons with close household or occupational contact with those at risk for severe varicella need not take any precautions after receiving zoster vaccine except if a varicella-like rash develops, when standard contact precautions are adequate; transmission of the Oka/Merck strain VZV from recipients of zoster vaccine has not been detected. If a susceptible, immunocompromised person is exposed to a vaccine-related rash, VARIZIG™ need not be administered because disease is expected to be mild, and acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are active against live-attenuated Oka/Merck strain VZV and can be used if severe illness develops in the susceptible contact.

Herpes zoster — transmission — indicates that zoster lesions contain high concentrations of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that can be spread, presumably by the airborne route, and cause primary varicella in exposed susceptible persons; localized zoster is only contagious after the rash erupts and until the lesions crust and is less contagious than varicella. In one household study, varicella occurred among 15.5% of susceptible contacts exposed to zoster, whereas following household exposure to varicella VZV transmission occurred among 71.5% of susceptible contacts.

### Herpes virus infections in kidney transplant patients (HINT) [^115AeJU8]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with kidney failure, and in 2021, 252 kidney transplantations were performed in Denmark. Varicella-zoster virus is a vaccine-preventable disease that causes varicella during primary infection and herpes zoster when reactivated later in life. VZV is one of the most common infections after organ transplantation, and kidney transplant recipients have high risk of herpes zoster. Furthermore, kidney transplant recipients that acquire herpes zoster have high risk of disseminated and severe disease as well as increased risk of post-herpetic neuralgia. Until 2021, the only available VZV/herpes zoster vaccines in Europe were live vaccines, and live vaccines are contraindicated in immunosuppressed individuals due to the risk of infection with the vaccine strain.

However, a new, non-live, recombinant subunit herpes zoster vaccine that can be used in immunosuppressed individuals was recently approved and became available in Denmark in October 2021. The efficacy of Shingrix® in healthy individuals is excellent both with regard to preventing herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia. However, organ transplant recipients receive high doses of immunosuppressive medication, and information on efficacy and immunogenicity of Shingrix® in immunosuppressed individuals is sparse. One randomized study found the efficacy of the vaccine to be good in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Furthermore, one phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 246 kidney transplant recipients, and the vaccine was found to be safe and to induce antibody responses, but the study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy.

At present, international guidelines recommend vaccination against herpes zoster prior to or after transplantation, but there is no information about the optimal timing of vaccination or duration of the immune response in transplant recipients. Poor or no antibody response after vaccinations are documented among organ transplant recipients. Vaccination prior to transplantation or early post-transplantation may be of benefit because patients are at the highest risk of infections early post-transplantation due to high load of immunosuppressive therapy, however, this is also the period with the highest risk of non-response to vaccines. It is therefore of great importance, for both individual patients and for society, to determine the optimal timing of vaccination, response rates and duration of protection prior to use of vaccines in organ transplant recipients.

The investigators will conduct a prospective observational exploratory study including kidney transplant candidates and recipients who are offered Shingrix® vaccination. Shingrix® vaccination is routine care, and vaccination is not a part of the study, and acceptance of vaccination is not mandatory to participate in the study. The study is a national collaboration that includes all Danish kidney transplantation centers and kidney transplant recipients from all Danish regions. The study has potential to contribute with necessary information to design optimal programs for vaccine roll-out and thereby to reduce the incidence of herpes zoster and herpes zoster-related complications including hospital admissions in kidney transplant recipients as well as other solid organ transplant recipients. Furthermore, the investigators will explore differences in the immune systems of kidney transplant recipients who get VZV infections and those who don't.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) prevention — pre-exposure measures in adults and adolescents with HIV specify that adults and adolescents with HIV who have CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 and who do not have documentation of varicella vaccination, a history or diagnosis of varicella or herpes zoster, or laboratory confirmation of VZV disease are addressed, and anyone with HIV who is VZV seronegative should avoid exposure to persons with varicella or herpes zoster (CIII). Household contacts who are VZV-susceptible should be vaccinated to prevent potential transmission of VZV to at-risk people with HIV (BIII). In VZV-seronegative persons aged ≥ 18 years with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3, administer primary varicella vaccination in two doses (0.5 mL SQ) 3 months apart (BIII). If vaccination results in disease due to live-attenuated vaccine virus, treatment with acyclovir is recommended (AIII). If post-exposure VariZIG has been administered, wait ≥ 5 months before varicella vaccination (CIII), and if post-exposure acyclovir has been administered, wait ≥ 3 days before varicella vaccination (CIII). Administration of varicella vaccine to severely immunocompromised people with HIV (CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3) is contraindicated (AIII).

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) primary infection — pre-exposure prevention applies to patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 who have not been vaccinated, have no history of varicella or herpes zoster, or who are seronegative for VZV (BIII), and routine VZV serologic testing in adults and adolescents with HIV is not recommended. Preferred pre-exposure prevention is primary varicella vaccination (VarivaxTM), two doses (0.5 mL SQ each) administered 3 months apart (BIII); if vaccination results in disease because of vaccine virus, treatment with acyclovir is recommended (AIII). Post-exposure prevention of primary varicella infection uses varicella-zoster immune globulin (VariZIGTM) 125 IU per 10 kg (maximum 625 IU) IM, administered as soon as possible, preferably within 96 hours, but up to 10 days after exposure (AIII), and individuals receiving monthly high-dose IVIG (> 400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected if the last dose of IVIG was administered < 3 weeks before exposure. Alternative strategies are that VZV-susceptible household contacts of susceptible HIV-infected persons should be vaccinated to prevent potential transmission of VZV to their HIV-infected contacts (BIII), and alternative post-exposure options include acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day for 5–7 days beginning 7–10 days after exposure (BIII), or valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day for 5–7 days (BIII); these alternatives have not been studied in the HIV population.

### Primary varicella after transplantation [^1154pomv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old white woman 6 months status post cadaveric renal transplant developed a mild case of primary varicella-zoster (VZ). It is hypothesized that the limited nature of her illness was due to infection with vaccine-type VZ virus instead of wild-type VZ. Approximately 1 month prior, she had daily household contact with a child who had developed a rash after immunization with live attenuated varicella vaccine. This case highlights several important questions. Should special precautions be undertaken with renal transplant recipients naive to varicella infection after vaccination of household contacts? Should pretransplant immunization with varicella vaccine be performed routinely in naive patients? Should naive patients transplanted and maintained on immunosuppressive therapy be vaccinated? Until there are clinical trials to answer these questions, it may be instructive to consider the recommendations for pediatric and immunocompromised patients.

### Transmission of vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus: a systematic review [^113ou7QP]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Live vaccines usually provide robust immunity but can transmit the vaccine virus.

Objective

To assess the characteristics of secondary transmission of the vaccine-strain varicella-zoster virus (Oka strain; vOka) on the basis of the published experience with use of live varicella and zoster vaccines.

Data Sources

Systematic review of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scopus databases for articles published through 2018.

Study Selection

Articles that reported original data on vOka transmission from persons who received vaccines containing the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus.

Data Extraction

We abstracted data to describe vOka transmission by index patient's immune status, type (varicella or herpes zoster) and severity of illness, and whether transmission was laboratory confirmed.

Results

Twenty articles were included. We identified 13 patients with vOka varicella after transmission from 11 immunocompetent varicella vaccine recipients. In all instances, the vaccine recipient had a rash: 6 varicella-like and 5 herpes zoster. Transmission occurred mostly to household contacts. One additional case was not considered direct transmission from a vaccine recipient, but the mechanism was uncertain. Transmission from vaccinated immunocompromised children also occurred only if the vaccine recipient developed a rash postvaccination. Secondary cases of varicella caused by vOka were mild.

Limitations

It is likely that other vOka transmission cases remain unpublished.

Conclusions

Healthy, vaccinated persons have minimal risk for transmitting vOka to contacts and only if a rash is present. Our findings support the existing recommendations for routine varicella vaccination and the guidance that persons with vaccine-related rash avoid contact with susceptible persons at high risk for severe varicella complications.

Live vaccine recommendations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) outline candidate vaccines, timing before immunosuppressive therapy, and household contact guidance. For measles mumps rubella (MMR) with unknown vaccination history, check titer before immunization and give "Two doses (> 28 days apart) at least 6 weeks before starting immunosuppressive therapy", it is "Contraindicated" in patients already on immunosuppressive treatment, and family contacts are "Yes". For varicella with unknown vaccination history or exposure, check titer and give "2 doses (4–6 weeks apart) at least 1 month before starting immunosuppressive therapy", use in patients already on immunosuppressive medications "Depends on the type of immunosuppressive medications", and family contacts are "Yes, if vaccine related rash occurs, immunosuppressed IBD patient should avoid contact". For herpes zoster in "patients aged 50 or older", do not check titer, give "1 dose at least 1 month before starting immunosuppressive therapy", use while already on immunosuppression "Depends on the type of immunosuppressive medications", and family contacts follow the same rash-avoidance instruction as varicella.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^1137nwaL]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology of zoster and complications — risk factors: Previous varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is a necessary precondition for zoster, and approximately 99.5% of the U.S. population aged ≥ 40 years has serologic evidence of prior infection, placing most older adults at risk. Early-life infection greatly increases pediatric risk; when VZV occurs before age 2 months, the risk for zoster by age 12 years is increased > 35-fold compared with infections after infancy. Among vaccine recipients, the Oka/Merck strain can establish latency and clinically reactivate, but in immunocompromised children the risk for zoster was approximately 65% less in those who had received varicella vaccine compared with those with previous wild-type varicella. Age is the most important risk factor, with one study showing incidence increased by a factor of > 10, from 0.74 per 1000 person years in children aged 10 years to 10.1 per 1000 person years in persons aged 80–89 years, with much of the increase beginning at age 50–60 years, and approximately 50% of persons who live to age 85 years will have experienced zoster. For context on exposure timing to vaccine-strain VZV, varicella vaccination is recommended for children aged ≥ 12 months.

### Clinical overview of shingles (herpes zoster) [^111upqMD]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and can be prevented with Shingrix vaccine.
- Herpes zoster is hard to diagnose in children and younger adults, especially if the clinical presentation is mild.
- Older adults and people who are immunocompromised are at high risk for shingles complications. Cause Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes varicella. Primary infection with VZV causes varicella. After a person has varicella, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia. VZV can reactivate later in a person's life and cause herpes zoster, a painful maculopapular, and then a vesicular rash. Keep Reading: Clinical Overview of Chickenpox. Who is at risk People who had chickenpox can get shingles. About 1 in 3 people in the United States will develop herpes zoster during their lifetime.

Most people have only one episode, but herpes zoster can recur. A person's risk for herpes zoster and related complications, including hospitalizations, sharply increases after 50 years of age. The reasons why VZV reactivates and causes herpes zoster are not well understood. However, a person's risk for herpes zoster increases as their VZV-specific cell-mediated immunity declines. This decline in immunity can result from increasing age and medical conditions or medications that suppress a person's immune system. People with the following conditions that compromise or suppress their immune system have an increased risk for herpes zoster:

- Bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients.
- Cancer, especially leukemia and lymphoma.
- Human immunodeficiency virus.
- Taking immunosuppressive medications, including steroids. About 30% of people hospitalized with herpes zoster have compromised or suppressed immune systems.

Other potential risk factors for herpes zoster have been identified, but the findings are inconsistent or unexplained. For example:

- More women than men develop shingles.
- Herpes zoster is less common in black people than in white people. How it spreads People with active herpes zoster lesions can spread VZV. VZV causes varicella in people who never had chickenpox or those who didn't receive the varicella vaccine. Once varicella resolves, these people would be at risk for herpes zoster. Active herpes zoster lesions are infectious through direct contact with vesicular fluid; or breathing in virus particles from the blisters until they dry and scab over. People with active herpes zoster lesions should cover their lesions; and avoid contact with susceptible people in their household and occupational settings until their lesions are dry and scabbed. Clinical features People with herpes zoster can have pain, itching, or tingling in the area where the rash will develop.

People with herpes zoster have a rash in one or two adjacent dermatomes. The rash most commonly appears on the trunk along a thoracic dermatome or on the face. It usually does not cross the body's midline and heals in 2 to 4 weeks. Shingles complications include postherpetic neuralgia, hearing or vision loss, encephalitis, and pneumonia. The signs and symptoms of herpes zoster are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash appears. However, clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster might not be possible in the absence of a rash. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems because of disease or therapy. Varicella vaccines contain live attenuated VZV, which results in latent infection.

### Notes from the field: hospital contact investigation for a patient who developed a zoster vaccine-related rash-Maryland, February 2015 [^112hm7oW]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Development of a generalized rash following zoster vaccination is rare, but can occur. Circulation of wild type VZV has declined considerably during the era of varicella and zoster vaccines; however, given the delays and challenges in determining if a vesicular rash in a vaccine recipient is VZV, early institution of a contact investigation by clinicians and public health officials might mitigate the risk for VZV transmission. Potentially exposed contacts without evidence of VZV immunity should be vaccinated against varicella. Both varicella vaccination and varicella zoster immune globulin are most effective in preventing disease in susceptible persons when administered as soon as possible after exposure.

Health care settings should ensure that health care workers are immune to VZV. Documentation of immunity includes: 1) written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of varicella vaccine; 2) laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease; 3) diagnosis or verification of a history of varicella disease by a health care provider; or 4) diagnosis or verification of a history of herpes zoster by a health care provider. This case highlights the importance of maintaining vigilance for unusual events following the use of live vaccines in persons who receive immunosuppressant medications, the importance of vaccination for primary prevention of communicable diseases in hospital settings, and the value of a robust occupational health program as a critical component of hospital infection control efforts.

Varicella exposure and exogenous boosting — exposure to varicella might reduce herpes zoster risk, with an inverse relation between annual varicella incidence in children aged < 5 years and zoster incidence in adults aged 15–44 years; a case-control study showing a graded reduction with a 74% reduction in risk for zoster among persons with three or more exposures compared with no exposures; and a cohort analysis indicating adults living with children had a 25% decrease in zoster incidence, with boosting lasting an average of 20 years (95% CI = 7–41 years). However, contrary evidence notes women are at greater risk for zoster despite likely increased child exposure, and a Japanese study found the risk for zoster in children was not diminished by repeated varicella exposures.

T-VEC — administration precautions specify infection‑control measures and provider restrictions: Institutions determine biosafety levels and handling precautions for live viruses, with contact precautions and protection for patients, caregivers, and clinical staff. The US FDA recommends that pregnant or immunosuppressed providers not administer or handle T‑VEC due to the potential for disseminated herpes infection. Because the virus can persist on dressings over injected lesions, care is needed when removing bandages and gauze, and it is recommended that a patient keep dressings on for 1 week; some institutions label the bandage so contact precautions are evident if the patient is hospitalized.

Herpes zoster — dissemination and complications in immunocompromised and HIV-infected persons — are characterized by true cutaneous dissemination that generally occurs only among immunocompromised patients, occurring in up to 37% of zoster cases in the absence of antiviral treatment; visceral complications occur in 10%–50% of episodes and, even with antiviral treatment, the case fatality rate from visceral dissemination is 5%–15%. Compared with other immunocompromised persons, among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) the clinical features of zoster are less severe and visceral dissemination less common, but presentations unique to HIV include atypical skin eruptions and an aggressive variant of acute retinal necrosis that generally results in blindness; alveolar bone necrosis and tooth exfoliation also have been reported.

### Updated recommendations for use of variZIG – United States, 2013 [^115hsJAZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for VariZIG — eligibility and timing — state that the decision to administer VariZIG depends on whether the patient lacks evidence of immunity to varicella, whether the exposure is likely to result in infection, and whether the patient is at greater risk for varicella complications than the general population; for high-risk patients with additional exposures 3 weeks after initial administration, another dose should be considered. CDC recommends administration as soon as possible after exposure to varicella-zoster virus and within 10 days. Patients without evidence of immunity who are at high risk, exposed to varicella or herpes zoster, and for whom varicella vaccine is contraindicated, should receive VariZIG; groups include immunocompromised patients, newborns whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around delivery (5 days before to 2 days after), hospitalized premature infants born at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation whose mothers lack evidence of immunity, hospitalized premature infants born at < 28 weeks of gestation or who weigh ≤ 1,000 g at birth regardless of maternal immunity, and pregnant women without evidence of immunity.

Varicella vaccination in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — Adults with IBD should be assessed for prior exposure to varicella and vaccinated if naive prior to initiation of immunosuppressive therapy when possible. Conditional recommendation, with very low level of evidence. Varicella is highly contagious with ~90% of susceptible close contacts infected after exposure and a pre-vaccine U.S. burden of ~4 million cases, 10,600 hospitalizations, and 100–150 deaths annually. Patient recall is unreliable: in one study of 163 pediatric IBD patients, only 77% had measurable varicella titers despite 66% reporting disease or vaccination; in another study of 121 IBD patients, 97/104 (93%) reporting prior varicella-zoster virus (VZV) exposure were VZV-immunoglobulin G seropositive with positive and negative predictive values of 93 and 93%. The ACIP recommends varicella vaccination with 2 doses at 12–15 months and 4–6 years for children, and two doses at least 28 days apart for people 13 years or older without prior infection or vaccination. Varicella vaccination is contraindicated 1–3 months before start of biologics and if on one of these agents, though IDSA guidance states it can be considered for nonvaricella-immune patients receiving long-term low-dose immunosuppression; a small series of six pediatric patients vaccinated while on thiopurines or infliximab reported no adverse events. Household contacts without contraindications can be vaccinated, with avoidance of contact until rash resolution if a post-vaccination rash occurs. These data suggest that IBD patients be tested for varicella exposure and be vaccinated if nonimmune.

### Isolation precautions for visitors [^116DNkDn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Visitor isolation precautions — education, screening, and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance indicate that visitors are a dynamic population within a healthcare facility, so education of visitors must be an ongoing activity, and the screening of visitors for symptoms of infection is another constant challenge with efforts that should be systematic throughout healthcare facilities with particular focus in wards that house immunocompromised adult and pediatric patients. For extended household exposure, family members are generally not required to wear masks or respirators; those without extensive exposure are recommended to wear masks or, in the case of airborne infections, to avoid entry into the patient room altogether. Fit testing of visitors for N95 respirators is beyond the capability of most infection control departments and would be logistically difficult for most hospitals to incorporate routinely; however, it could potentially be done on a case-by-case basis.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117AgzK9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

Both serologic and clinical evaluations demonstrated that varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) was equivalent to ZIG in susceptible, immunocompromised children if administered within 96 hours of exposure, and in one study approximately one in five developed clinical varicella and one in 20 developed subclinical disease compared with 65%–85% attack rates among historical controls, with illness severity evaluated by percentage with > 100 lesions or complications. The effectiveness of VZIG when administered > 96 hours after initial exposure was not evaluated.

### Prevention and control of nosocomial varicella during the United States varicella vaccination program era [^1116mWTY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The United States varicella vaccination program has successfully reduced varicella incidence and hospitalizations by ≥ 90%, consequently reducing the risk of nosocomial exposures. However, patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) continue to introduce varicella zoster virus (VZV) into healthcare settings. Herpes zoster (HZ) is less contagious than varicella, but it can also result in exposures. Unrecognized varicella and HZ may lead to extensive contact investigations, control efforts, and HCP furloughs that result in significant disruption of healthcare activities as well as substantial costs. Robust occupational health and infection prevention programs that ensure healthcare personnel immunity and prompt recognition and isolation of patients with varicella or HZ will lower the risk of VZV transmission and reduce or eliminate the need to furlough exposed HCP and associated costs.

Vaccines

Vaccination is crucial for reducing infection risk, morbidity, and mortality in patients with SID. Due to the heterogeneous nature of SID and limited clinical data, vaccination recommendations are mainly based on expert opinion.

To maximize efficacy, vaccines must be administered as soon as immune deficiency is diagnosed or before initiating immunosuppressive therapy. Live attenuated vaccines, such as measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), live-attenuated influenza, varicella, and yellow fever vaccines should generally be avoided in immunocompromised individuals and, in some cases, by their household members, due to the risk of uncontrolled replication of the weakened pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. The immunogenicity of non-live vaccine is considered to be suboptimal in immunocompromised patients. Revaccination after receipt of HCT, SOT and cellular therapies is recommended. The quality of vaccine response in SID patients is often suboptimal, depending on the underlying disease. For this reason, household members, close contacts, and caregivers should also be vaccinated to reduce exposure risk.

Annual seasonal influenza and Covid-19 vaccinations are recommended in the fall/winter. For pneumococcal infections, the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (preferably 20-valent) is recommended. Recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine is recommended in all VZV-seropositive individuals. Additional vaccinations may be recommended depending on immune deficit (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis in asplenic patients or patients treated with eculizumab) and exposures. Assessing the immune response by measuring vaccine-specific anti-pneumococcal antibodies can help to estimate protection level and monitor changes over time. Other vaccination strategies depend on the specific underlying disease or treatment and are outlined in Table 4.

Vaccination suggestions according to the secondary immunodeficiency etiology

Vaccination against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recommended by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention for all adults aged 75 and older and for adults aged 60 to 74 at increased risk for severe RSV. Vaccination before the age of 60 must be evaluated on a case by case basis

Tuberculosis

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by infection of the lungs and other organ systems with Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. TB is transmitted by small airborne respiratory droplets that may remain suspended in the air and travel long distances. It usually spreads only through air and not by contact with surfaces or objects.

Individuals with active TB should be considered contagious until they are treated with antituberculosis medications. They will receive follow-up testing to prove that they are no longer contagious. Those who are most at risk of getting TB have shared the same air space for a prolonged period in an enclosed environment with a person who has an active TB infection.

A person can have latent TB (LTBI) after infection with M. tuberculosis. This occurs when the bacteria remain in the body but do not cause disease. A person with LTBI and no symptoms is not contagious. Sometimes the bacteria cause active disease in a person with untreated LTBI. This can occur at any time after their infection, but most commonly it happens 1–6 months following the infection. It is characterized by fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, and cough. There is no vaccine available in the United States to prevent TB infection.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with active tuberculosis from entry to the family-centered residential facility until they have written medical clearance from the treating licensed clinician or local public health department that they are considered non-infectious. Verbal medical clearance by direct telephone consultation with a public health official is also acceptable.
Allow individuals with LTBI infection to enter the facility.
Restrict all family members who were exposed to a person with active TB from entering the facility until they have written medical clearance from the treating licensed clinician or the local public health department that they are considered non-infectious. Verbal medical clearance by direct telephone consultation with a health department official is also acceptable.
Ask any guest with a new diagnosis of active TB and their family members to leave the facility immediately. Require written medical clearance for readmission to the facility per the instructions above. Based upon consultation with the local public health department, the program manager may need to identify and notify all exposed guests and instruct them to seek medical attention.

Herpes zoster — diagnosis and laboratory testing — notes that zoster diagnosis might not be possible in the absence of rash and that in its classical manifestation the signs and symptoms are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash has appeared; more frequently, zoster is confused with the rash of herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the accuracy of diagnosis is lower for children and younger adults. Tzanck smears detect multinucleated giant cells but do not distinguish between infections with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV; culture can take several days with false negative results, direct fluorescent antibody staining is rapid and is sensitive, and polymerase chain reaction can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively though not available in all settings, with modifications able to distinguish wild-type VZV from the Oka/Merck vaccine strain. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing chickenpox from disseminated zoster might not be possible by examination or serology, and history of VZV exposure, a dermatomal rash onset, and results of VZV antibody testing at or before rash onset might help guide the diagnosis.

Post-exposure prophylaxis of VZV primary infection — HIV adults and adolescents: Indication (AIII) includes close contact with a person who has active varicella or herpes zoster and being susceptible to VZV. Preferred prophylaxis is VariZIG™ 125 IU/10 kg (maximum of 625 IU) IM, administered as soon as possible and within 10 days after exposure to a person with active varicella or herpes zoster (AIII); if post-exposure VariZIG has been administered, wait ≥ 5 months before varicella vaccination (CIII). Patients receiving monthly high dose IVIG (i.e., > 400 mg/kg) probably do not require VariZIG if the last IVIG dose was administered ≤ 3 weeks before exposure. Alternative prophylaxis (begin 7–10 days after exposure) is acyclovir 800 mg PO 5 times a day for 5–7 days (BIII) or valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day for 5–7 days (BIII); if acyclovir or valacyclovir is used, varicella vaccines should not be given < 72 hours after the last antiviral dose.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114oxE9t]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What recommendations are being reviewed?

Since 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 60 years with 1 dose of herpes zoster vaccine.

Why are the recommendations being reviewed now?

After approval by the Food and Drug Administration for use of zoster vaccine in adults aged 50 through 59 years in 2011, ACIP initially considered use of the vaccine among adults in this age group, but declined to change its recommendations at that time, citing shortages of Zostavax and limited data on long-term protection afforded by herpes zoster vaccine. A new review was conducted because the manufacturer has resumed routine supply of Zostavax and additional data on long-term protection have become available.

What is currently recommended?

Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP's recommendation remains unchanged; herpes zoster vaccine is routinely recommended only for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Because the protection offered by the herpes zoster vaccine wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and duration of protection beyond 5 years is uncertain, it is unknown to what extent persons vaccinated before age 60 years will be protected as they age and their risk for herpes zoster and its complications increases. Because duration of protection offered by the vaccine is uncertain, the need for revaccination is not clear. Assuming waning of vaccination protection according to currently available studies, the cost-effectiveness model projects a substantially greater reduction of disease burden, health care utilization, and costs with vaccination of older adults who have higher incidence of herpes zoster and related complications. Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP maintained its current recommendation that herpes zoster vaccine be routinely recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

### Strategies for herpes zoster vaccination of immunocompromised patients [^116u16nH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A vaccine to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) in adults ≥ 60 years of age with healthy immune systems was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This vaccine is contraindicated in persons with certain immunodeficiency states or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy. On the basis of studies of the varicella vaccine in healthy and immunosuppressed children and studies of HZ vaccine in healthy adults before its licensure, a series of strategies are proposed for evaluating the live HZ vaccine in immunosuppressed persons. In addition, the use of other vaccines, including heat-inactivated or replication-defective varicella-zoster virus to prevent HZ in immunocompromised persons, is also discussed.
