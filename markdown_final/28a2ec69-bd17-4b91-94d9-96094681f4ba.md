## Question

What are the risks associated with dobutamine stress echocardiogram?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks associated with dobutamine stress echocardiography, including adverse effects, contraindications, prognostic implications, and special-population considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic and hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and how they translate into adverse effects. Then, I should verify the incidence and spectrum of complications from large registries and contemporary series. Next, I will review absolute and relative contraindications and protocol-related safety measures. After that, I need to examine prognostic risk stratification embedded in guideline frameworks. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical risk–benefit summary with monitoring and mitigation strategies.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation and expected physiologic effects, because the risk profile is largely driven by dobutamine's beta-1 agonism and, at higher doses, beta-2 effects. Dobutamine increases heart rate two- to threefold, augments contractility, and raises systolic blood pressure about 1.5- to 2-fold, while beta-2–mediated vasodilation can cause a mild fall in diastolic pressure; these changes increase myocardial oxygen demand and can unmask ischemia or arrhythmias in susceptible myocardium, which frames the adverse event spectrum I need to anticipate [^112dkv7V].

> I will now examine the common adverse effects and their frequencies, but wait, let me verify these against contemporary series rather than relying solely on older data. Very common effects include sinus tachycardia, palpitations, headache, dyspnea, and chest discomfort; common effects include hypertension, angina, premature ventricular contractions, and injection-site reactions; arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occur in a minority but are clinically important, and symptomatic hypotension is less frequent but not rare in real-world cohorts [^114uju6T] [^115KGKA5] [^1149dK9W] [^1118fpbj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without quantifying serious complications. In a large international registry of 85,997 stress echocardiograms, life-threatening events occurred in 86 patients, with 63 events during dobutamine (rate ~1 in 557), including 5 deaths (ventricular fibrillation or cardiac rupture), indicating that while overall safety is high, rare catastrophic events do occur; contemporary series generally report no fatalities and low rates of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, reinforcing that risk is low but nonzero and mandates continuous monitoring and readiness to treat [^113xfyAc] [^115KGKA5] [^114AKjNx].

> Let me consider arrhythmias more closely, because they are a key safety signal. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurs in roughly 2–5% and is usually benign in the absence of inducible ischemia, though its prognostic significance may vary with resting ejection fraction; sustained ventricular tachycardia is rare and not a sensitive or specific marker of ischemia; atrial fibrillation occurs in about 0.8–1% and is strongly associated with age and prior AF, with most episodes converting spontaneously within 24 hours; atropine-related bradyarrhythmias, including complete heart block, are uncommon but documented, particularly in cardiac transplant recipients [^1118fpbj] [^116wFPSi] [^1149dK9W] [^117XLiW9] [^113TTX3d].

> I need to check hemodynamic complications next. Hypertensive responses occur in approximately 7% in some series and are more likely with higher baseline blood pressure and nitrate use; symptomatic hypotension is less frequent (~1–2%) and often reflects vasodilatory effects at higher doses; importantly, severe hypertension or a drop in systolic blood pressure > 40 mmHg should prompt termination, and uncontrolled hypertension is a contraindication to testing [^115KGKA5] [^1168kgoV] [^1145ymMw].

> But wait, what about ischemia-related events during the test itself. Chest pain and ischemic ECG changes can occur, and very rarely patients develop ischemia sufficient to precipitate malignant arrhythmias; case reports describe ventricular fibrillation in late recovery after peak stress, underscoring the need to monitor through the recovery phase and to have resuscitation capability immediately available [^114uju6T] [^1174Nfeu].

> Next, I should review absolute and relative contraindications and protocol endpoints so I don't overstate test safety. Absolute or strong relative contraindications include hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction, uncontrolled or severe systemic hypertension, serious arrhythmias, unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome, and hypersensitivity to dobutamine; endpoints include achievement of 85% age-predicted maximal heart rate, significant arrhythmias, severe hypertension, hypotension, intolerable symptoms, or new/worsening wall motion abnormalities, and atropine should be used judiciously with attention to neuropsychiatric effects and body habitus [^1145ymMw] [^11121285] [^111ZGTWa].

> Hold on, I should verify electrolyte-related risk because I recall a teaching point about potassium. Initially, I thought any potassium abnormality might be prohibitive, but wait, let me verify the data; a large series suggests DSE is generally safe even with potassium abnormalities, with a small increase in supraventricular arrhythmias only when potassium is severely low (≤ 3.1 mmol/L), so correcting marked hypokalemia beforehand is reasonable but routine cancellation for mild abnormalities is not supported [^1179t62M].

> I will now examine prognostic risk stratification, because the clinical "risk" of DSE extends beyond immediate adverse events to downstream outcomes. A normal DSE confers an excellent short-term prognosis with annualized hard cardiac event rates around 1% early after testing, but this "warranty period" is not indefinite; over longer follow-up, risk converges, especially in higher-risk cohorts such as those with diabetes or CKD, and failure to achieve target heart rate, resting LV dysfunction, and extent of ischemia independently predict worse outcomes [^112YmuKM] [^115e4UZW] [^113eAB8X] [^116FYnrs].

> Let me double-check the ischemic threshold concept, since it refines perioperative and longitudinal risk. Ischemia occurring at a low heart rate or early during infusion identifies patients at highest risk of perioperative and late cardiac events, and guidelines endorse using the heart rate at ischemia onset divided by age-predicted maximal heart rate to quantify risk and guide management decisions [^112pN12Q] [^112zgcaG].

> Next, I should review special populations where risk may be amplified or management modified. In diabetes, inability to exercise is common and DSE provides incremental prognostic value, but event rates after a normal DSE rise over time, suggesting a limited warranty and potential value in repeat testing; in CKD, combining clinical risk scores with DSE improves identification of a high-risk subgroup; in women, abnormal DSE predicts adverse outcomes independent of sex, though exercise testing is preferred when feasible; in advanced liver disease, DSE is frequently used for pre-transplant CAD screening, but clinicians must weigh bleeding and contrast risks if catheterization follows; in cardiac transplant recipients, atropine can precipitate conduction block, warranting heightened vigilance [^112WXXj9] [^113eAB8X] [^116FYnrs] [^113vqPmg] [^1145ymMw] [^111qU3FM] [^113TTX3d].

> I need to ensure I address false positives and test performance, because misclassification can alter perceived risk. False-positive stress echocardiograms occur in a meaningful minority, more often with low pretest probability, and while FP results carry lower MACE than true positives, evidence is mixed on whether FP patients have higher risk than true negatives; thus, results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when positive, correlated with pretest probability and, if needed, anatomic testing [^115R5kWT] [^1148G48V] [^116mxzHy].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk–benefit balance and practical mitigation. DSE is generally safe and well tolerated in appropriately selected patients, with serious complications on the order of 1 in 500–1000 and death exceedingly rare in contemporary practice; risks are minimized by adhering to contraindications, using standardized protocols with continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring, ensuring resuscitation readiness, and monitoring through recovery; when adverse effects occur, they are usually transient and respond to stopping the infusion and giving beta-blockers or other supportive measures as indicated [^113xfyAc] [^115KGKA5] [^113ZdCfQ].

> In summary, I should confirm that the main risks of dobutamine stress echocardiography include common but usually benign symptoms and arrhythmias, uncommon but clinically important hypertensive or hypotensive reactions, and rare but potentially catastrophic events such as sustained ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction; careful patient selection, protocol adherence, and vigilant monitoring are essential, and the test's prognostic yield — particularly the heart rate at ischemia and the extent of wall motion abnormalities — adds critical value that often outweighs these manageable risks when the indication is appropriate [^113xfyAc] [^112zgcaG] [^1145ymMw].

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is generally safe, but it carries **important risks** that must be managed proactively. The most common are **arrhythmias** (PVCs, NSVT, AF, SVT) [^1149dK9W] and **hypotension or hypertension** [^114uju6T]; serious events such as sustained VT/VF, MI, or death are rare but possible [^113xfyAc]. Risk is higher in patients with **severe LV dysfunction**, **uncontrolled hypertension**, **significant valvular disease**, or **prior arrhythmias**. Precautions include strict adherence to protocols, continuous ECG and BP monitoring, readiness with beta-blockers and resuscitation equipment, and avoidance in patients with absolute contraindications [^1168kgoV] [^111ZGTWa]. With these measures, **DSE remains safe and effective** for most patients.

---

## Common risks and side effects

- **Arrhythmias**: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), atrial fibrillation (AF), and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are the most frequent complications, typically transient and self-limited [^114eZqSe] [^1118fpbj].

- **Hypotension or hypertension**: Dobutamine can cause significant blood pressure fluctuations, including hypotension or hypertension, particularly in patients with autonomic instability or those on antihypertensive medications [^114uju6T].

- **Chest pain and palpitations**: These symptoms are common during DSE but are usually transient and resolve with cessation of the infusion [^114uju6T].

- **Nausea, headache, and anxiety**: These mild side effects are common but generally well tolerated [^114uju6T].

---

## Serious complications

Although rare, **serious complications** can occur:

- **Sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation**: These life-threatening arrhythmias are rare but require immediate intervention [^113xfyAc].

- **Myocardial infarction (MI)**: Rarely, patients may experience MI during or after DSE, particularly those with significant coronary artery disease [^113xfyAc].

- **Stroke**: Stroke is a rare but serious complication, typically associated with embolic events in patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease [^113xfyAc].

- **Death**: Mortality associated with DSE is extremely rare, with reported rates of approximately 0.05% [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient characteristics **increase the risk** of complications during DSE:

- **Severe left ventricular dysfunction**: Patients with reduced ejection fraction are at higher risk of arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability [^116rMjDt].

- **Uncontrolled hypertension**: Severe hypertension increases the risk of hypertensive crisis during dobutamine infusion [^115KGKA5].

- **Significant valvular heart disease**: Particularly severe aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation, increases the risk of hemodynamic compromise [^116rMjDt].

- **History of arrhythmias**: Patients with prior arrhythmias are more likely to experience recurrent arrhythmias during DSE [^1149dK9W].

---

## Precautions and safety measures

To minimize risks, **strict adherence to safety protocols** is essential:

- **Continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring**: Essential throughout the test to detect arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability early [^114RhXKA].

- **Gradual dose titration**: Dobutamine is administered in incremental doses, allowing assessment of patient tolerance and early detection of adverse effects [^11121285].

- **Immediate availability of beta-blockers**: Beta-blockers are readily available to reverse the effects of dobutamine if necessary [^113ZdCfQ].

- **Trained personnel**: Experienced healthcare professionals must be present to manage potential complications [^117QwS9b].

- **Patient selection**: Careful screening for contraindications and patient-specific risk factors is critical before proceeding with DSE [^111ZGTWa].

---

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include **unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome**, **severe uncontrolled hypertension**, **severe aortic stenosis**, and **recent myocardial infarction**. Relative contraindications include **moderate valvular heart disease**, **controlled arrhythmias**, and **mild hypertension**.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography is a valuable diagnostic tool with a **generally favorable safety profile**. The most common risks are arrhythmias and hemodynamic fluctuations, while serious complications are rare. Adherence to safety protocols, careful patient selection, and continuous monitoring are essential to minimize risks and ensure patient safety [^113xfyAc].

Stress echocardiography predictors of risk — Table 3 classifies prognosis as very low risk with "MI, cardiac events < 1%/y" and good exercise capacity ("7 METs men 5 METs women"); low risk with "MI, cardiac death < 2%/y" for a normal pharmacologic study with "achievement of HR ≥ 85% age-predicted maximum for dobutamine stress, and low to intermediate pretest probability of CAD"; and high risk (RR ≈ 4-fold over low risk) features including "Baseline EF < 40%", multivessel or rest-plus-remote ischemia, a "low ischemic threshold" such as "Ischemia with 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole or 20 μg/kg/min dobutamine or based on heart rate", where definitions include "HR < 60% of age-predicted maximum, HR < 70% of age-predicted maximum, or at HR < 120/min", and "Ischemic WMA, no change or decrease in exercise EF", alongside listed "factors increasing risk" including increasing age, male sex, diabetes, high pretest probability, and stress ECG with ischemia.

### Prognostic relevance of a false-positive stress echocardiography response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115R5kWT]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight that FP stress echocardiogram results are common, frequently associated with patients who have a low pre-test probability. An FP result is not associated with increased incidence of MACE when compared with true-positive results. There is insufficient evidence to establish whether FP results on dobutamine stress echocardiography identify a cohort of high-risk patients in comparison to true-negative results.

### A clinical and echocardiographic score for assigning risk of major events after dobutamine echocardiograms [^113CRiAs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to develop and validate a risk score combining both clinical and dobutamine echocardiographic (DbE) features in 4890 patients who underwent DbE at three expert laboratories and were followed for death or myocardial infarction for up to five years.

Background

In contrast to exercise scores, no score exists to combine clinical, stress, and echocardiographic findings with DbE.

Methods

Dobutamine echocardiography was performed for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease in 3156 patients at two sites in the U.S. After exclusion of patients with incomplete follow-up, 1456 DbEs were randomly selected to develop a multivariate model for prediction of events. After simplification of each model for clinical use, the models were internally validated in the remaining DbE patients in the same series and externally validated in 1733 patients in an independent series.

Results

The following score was derived from regression models in the modeling group (160 events): DbE risk = (age.0.02) + (heart failure + rate-pressure product < 15000).0.4 + (ischemia + scar).0.6. The presence of each variable was scored as 1 and its absence scored as 0, except for age (continuous variable). Using cutoff values of 1.2 and 2.6, patients were classified into groups with five-year event-free survivals > 95%, 75% to 95%, and < 75%. Application of the score in the internal validation group (265 events) gave equivalent results, as did its application in the external validation group (494 events, C index = 0.72).

Conclusions

A risk score based on clinical and echocardiographic data may be used to quantify the risk of events in patients undergoing DbE.

Preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) risk stratification — in patients in whom preoperative stress testing is appropriate before noncardiac surgery, a normal DSE has been shown to be associated with an excellent outcome whereas a positive study is associated with peri-operative events, and the heart rate at which ischemia develops during DSE can be used for risk stratification.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^112pN12Q]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — ischemia onset and perioperative risk — states that with modalities imaging at various stages of stress (dobutamine or supine bicycle), images from each stage should be reviewed to determine the heart rate and stage at which ischemia first occurs. This is useful in perioperative risk stratification because ischemia occurring at a low heart rate identifies patients at highest risk of a perioperative event, and the ischemic threshold is calculated as the heart rate at which ischemia first occurs divided by 220 minus the patient's age, multiplied by 100.

Table 12 — Recommendations for stress echocardiography in the context of non-cardiac surgery state that a pharmacologic stress imaging test such as dobutamine stress echocardiography is recommended before high-risk surgery in patients with more than two clinical risk factors and poor functional capacity (< 4 METs), and may be considered before high- or intermediate-risk surgery in patients with suspected cardiac symptoms and poor functional capacity (< 4 METs).

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^115moDj2]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

New Knowledge Gained

Dobutamine stress echocardiography and dobutamine stress 99m Tc-sestamibi SPECT are comparable in predicting long-term (> 14 years) cardiac mortality and hard cardiac events in high-risk patients (patients unable to perform exercise testing). From a clinical view, both techniques can be used interchangeably to classify patients as low or high risk of cardiac events.

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^1132e2nN]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

DSE is widely used for diagnosis and risk stratification, but the very long-term prognostic value of this test in patients with diabetes is not defined. Accurate long-term risk stratification of these patients is required to optimize patient management. Patients with normal DSE are considered at low risk of cardiac events; the annualized event rate is generally < 1% during the first years after testing. Accordingly, in these low-risk patients, further (invasive) diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and associated medical care costs can be avoided.

Still, over time, a significant change in risk may occur after a normal DSE. The underlying clinical risk of patients with diabetes and history of CAD may significantly influence the event rate after a normal DSE. These observations have lead to the perception that a "warranty period" exists after a normal DSE. In the currently available literature, mean follow-up after DSE was ∼3 years. Very long-term outcome data after DSE are lacking and, consequently, the duration of the low-risk status after a normal test is not clear.

### Prognostic relevance of a false-positive stress echocardiography response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148G48V]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Stress echocardiography is a widely available and used imaging modality in the assessment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and preoperative risk stratification. Despite the higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) observed in positive stress echocardiography results, the prognostic relevance of a false-positive (FP) stress echocardiogram is unclear.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO Open Dissertation and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 15 April 2024, for studies evaluating the prognostic relevance of a FP stress echocardiogram response in patients with suspected or known IHD. Primary outcomes included the occurrence of MACE within the studied follow-up duration. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the direction of effect and allow comparisons between FP, true-positive and true-negative stress echocardiography results.

Results

A total of five studies were included with 2426 patients (mean age 56–66 years, 60.2% males). In total, there were 737 (30.3%) FP stress echocardiogram results. MACE occurred in 274 participants, of which 79 (28.8%) occurred within the FP stress echocardiography group. Meta-analysis from three studies demonstrated more MACE outcomes in patients with a true positive in comparison to a FP stress echocardiography result (RR 1.64, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.20). Two studies reported increased MACE outcomes in patients with a FP result when compared with a true negative result.

Conclusions

An FP stress echocardiogram result is common and frequently associated with patients who have a low pre-test probability for IHD. FP results are not associated with increased incidence of MACE when compared with true positive results; however, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether FP results in dobutamine stress echocardiography identify a cohort of high-risk patients in comparison to true negative results.

Stress echocardiography is a widely available and used imaging modality in the assessment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and preoperative risk stratification. Despite the higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) observed in positive stress echocardiography results, the prognostic relevance of a false-positive (FP) stress echocardiogram is unclear.

The authors searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO Open Dissertation and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 15 April 2024, for studies evaluating the prognostic relevance of a FP stress echocardiogram response in patients with suspected or known IHD. Primary outcomes included the occurrence of MACE within the studied follow-up duration. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the direction of effect and allow comparisons between FP, true-positive and true-negative stress echocardiography results.

Results

A total of five studies were included with 2426 patients (mean age 56–66 years, 60.2% males). In total, there were 737 (30.3%) FP stress echocardiogram results. MACE occurred in 274 participants, of which 79 (28.8%) occurred within the FP stress echocardiography group.

Two studies reported increased MACE outcomes in patients with a FP result when compared with a true negative result.

Conclusions

An FP stress echocardiogram result is common and frequently associated with patients who have a low pre-test probability for IHD. FP results are not associated with increased incidence of MACE when compared with true positive results; however, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether FP results in dobutamine stress echocardiography identify a cohort of high-risk patients in comparison to true negative results.

### Comparison of all-cause mortality in women with known or suspected coronary artery disease referred for dobutamine stress echocardiography with normal versus abnormal test results [^112HUBCo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The presence of myocardial ischemia during dobutamine stress echocardiography is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in women after adjustment for clinical data. This association is observed in patients who have proved coronary artery disease and in patients who have no history of coronary artery disease.

### Outcomes after normal dobutamine stress echocardiography and predictors of adverse events: long-term follow-up of 3014 patients [^115e4UZW]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Normal exercise echocardiography predicts a good prognosis. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is generally reserved for patients with comorbidities which preclude exercise testing. We evaluated predictors of adverse events after normal DSE.

Methods and Results

We studied 3014 patients (1200 males, 68 ± 12 years) with normal DSE, defined as the absence of wall motion abnormality at rest or with stress. During median follow-up of 6.3 years, all-cause mortality and cardiac events, defined as myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization, occurred in 920 (31%) and 231 (7.7%) patients, respectively. Survival and cardiac event-free probabilities were 95 and 98% at 1 year, 78 and 93% at 5 years, and 56 and 89% at 10 years, respectively. Age, diabetes mellitus, and failure to achieve 85% age-predicted maximal heart rate were independent predictors of mortality and cardiac events. Patients with all three of these characteristics had a 13% probability of cardiac events within the first year and higher risk throughout follow-up.

Conclusion

Prognosis after normal DSE is not necessarily benign, but depends on patient and stress test characteristics. Careful evaluation, using clinical and stress data, is required to identify patients with normal DSE who are at increased risk of adverse outcomes during long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

In this study DSE and MPI provide comparable prognostic information for the prediction of cardiac mortality and hard (cardiac mortality and nonfatal MI) cardiac events in patients unable to perform exercise testing. Both techniques can be used interchangeably to classify patients as low or high risk of cardiac events.

### Long-term (> 10 years) prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in a high-risk cohort [^114FCQq3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) at > 10-year follow-up is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the very long-term prognostic value of DSE in a high-risk cohort of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. This prospective, single-center study included 3,381 patients who underwent DSE from January 1990 to January 2003. Two-dimensional echocardiographic images were acquired at rest, during dobutamine stress, and during recovery. Follow-up events were collected and included overall mortality, cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and revascularization. The incremental value of DSE in the prediction of selected end points was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. During a mean follow-up of 13 ± 3.2 years (range 7.3 to 20.5 years), there were 1,725 deaths (51%), of which 1,128 (33%) were attributed to cardiac causes. Patients with an abnormal DSE had a higher mortality rate (44% vs 35% at 15-year follow-up, p < 0.001) than those with a normal DSE. When comparing echocardiographic variables at rest to variables at maximum dose dobutamine, the chi-square of the test improved from 842 to 870 (p < 0.0001) and from 684 to 740 (p < 0.0001) for all-cause mortality and cardiac death, respectively. DSE provided incremental value in predicting all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and hard cardiac events. There seems, however, to be a "warranty period" of approximately 7 years, when the survival curves of a normal and abnormal DSE no longer diverge.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^114nGT54]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — before noncardiac surgery: Cardiac risk factors and stress tests help to identify patients at high risk before major vascular surgery, and pharmacologic stress echocardiography has been shown to be a powerful tool for cardiac risk stratification before vascular and nonvascular surgery, with test results providing better risk stratification than clinical indices; ischemia occurring at less than 60% of age-predicted maximal heart rate identifies patients at highest risk, and in a meta-analysis pharmacologic stress tests had a higher overall sensitivity and specificity than the other tests; for preoperative risk stratification, dobutamine stress echocardiography had a similar sensitivity to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and a higher specificity and a better overall predictive accuracy, and in clinically intermediate and high risk patients receiving beta-blockers it can help identify those in whom surgery can still be performed and those in whom cardiac revascularization should be considered.

### Prognostic relevance of a false-positive stress echocardiography response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1131v1Pz]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stress echocardiography is an established and widely used non-invasive functional imaging tool for the detection and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or, for patients with high preoperative risk profiles. Stress echocardiography can be undertaken using a number of stressors including exercise, dobutamine, dipyridamole or pacing. Stress echocardiography has been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy, reliable prognostic value in the management of patientsand is a cost-effective non-invasive imaging modality.

Sensitivity and specificity rates for stress echocardiography have been reported as 85% and 75%, respectively, for exercise stress, 80% and 86% for dobutamine stress and 93% and 92% dipyridamole as a stressor. For the detection of significant IHD on stress echocardiography, a positive response related to the stressor is required and involves the presence of new, or worsening left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormality being present, compared with baseline echocardiography imaging.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that positive stress echocardiography results were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, this review did not consider the impact of false-positive (FP) stress echocardiography results, whereby the stress echocardiogram result indicates the presence of IHD, which is not subsequently confirmed on coronary angiography.

An FP stress echocardiography result has previously been associated with low risk patients cohorts, chest wall deformitiesand hypertensive response to exercise testing. As such, an FP result has previously been considered as being benign. However, there is also evidence to suggest that FP results are associated with a higher rate of MACE. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate and summarise the available evidence on the prognostic relevance of a FP stress echocardiogram for patients undergoing stress echocardiography for the assessment of IHD or preoperative risk stratification.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112TNuFK]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress echocardiography — risk stratification by wall motion score index (WMSI) and ejection fraction (EF) is supported by multivariate analysis identifying WMSI and EF as the best predictors of cardiac events, with a cohort of 1,500 patients undergoing stress echocardiography (34% treadmill, 66% dobutamine) and a follow-up of 2.7 ± 1 years reporting non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiac death in 31 and 44 patients, respectively; a normal stress echocardiogram with a WMSI of 1 conferred a benign prognosis, while intermediate WMSI (1.1–1.7), high WMSI (≥ 1.7), and an ejection fraction of ≤ 45% further stratified risk, with peak stress WMSI delineating low- (0.9%/year), intermediate- (3.1%/year), and high-risk (5.2%/year) groups for cardiac events.

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^116G9n3i]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. As such, non-invasive imaging techniques are important to diagnose and risk stratify patients with CAD. In patients who cannot exercise, due to conditions such as degenerative joint disease and peripheral vascular disease, pharmacologic stress testing is an appropriate alternative. Both dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) are widely used for the evaluation of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, and provide significant prognostic information.-Currently, information on the long-term relative prognostic value of DSE compared to MPI is lacking. Therefore, this study evaluated the long-term prognostic value of DSE compared to MPI in patients unable to perform exercise testing.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography — viability assessment and dosing protocols are described as follows: An initial infusion of dobutamine at 2.5 μg/kg/ min, with gradual increase to 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 μg/kg/ min, is frequently used, and functional improvement without untoward side effects may prompt escalation of the drip rate to 40 μg/kg/ min and, if needed, atropine injection. Dysfunctional myocardium responses include biphasic response, sustained improvement, worsening of function, and no change in function; the highest sensitivity for detection of viability is noted when improvement at low-dose dobutamine echocardiography is considered, whereas highest specificity is achieved when a biphasic response occurs. Reported accuracy shows sensitivity ranging from 71% to 97% and specificity from 63% to 95%; patients with a large area of viable myocardium (> 25% of LV) have a high likelihood of improvement in EF and a better outcome after revascularization, and it is recommended that improvement by at least one grade in two or more segments be demonstrated.

Prognostic value and special populations — Among women and men, "the magnitude of risk associated with stress echocardiographic abnormalities is independent of sex". After acute myocardial infarction, "Resting LV function is a major determinant of prognosis", and stress echocardiography "can be performed safely early after myocardial infarction" to assess global and regional function and "detect the presence and extent of residual myocardial ischemia". The "extent of residual ischemia is related to adverse cardiac outcomes" and provides information "incremental to that obtained by exercise ECG or angiography"; the "incremental prognostic value of stress echocardiography is preserved in patients with abnormal LV function", and in ischemic cardiomyopathy with heart failure and low EF, "myocardial ischemia during dobutamine stress echocardiography was predictive of cardiac death, especially among patients who did not undergo coronary revascularization".

Stress echocardiography — risk assessment in women with suspected ischemic heart disease: After a normal exercise echocardiography, the ischemic heart disease (IHD) event rate is reported as " < 1% per year", and abnormal stress echocardiography is linked to adverse outcomes, including myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization, IHD death, and all-cause mortality; notably, "The typical IHD event rates for patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography are decidedly higher than for those undergoing exercise testing". Abnormal results are "associated with subsequent IHD events, even in the absence of obstructive CAD by angiography".

### Safety and predictors of complications with a new accelerated dobutamine stress echocardiography protocol [^115KGKA5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study sought to document the safety of a new accelerated dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography protocol and to analyze its complications.

Methods

Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography studies were performed using an incremental dobutamine infusion protocol from 20 to 40 microg/kg/min in 3-minute stages and followed by atropine.

Results

A total of 962 patients were included. Mean age was 64 ± 11 years and 584 were male (61%). Mean ejection fraction was 62 ± 10%. Complications included hypertensive responses in 66 patients (7%), arrhythmias in 26 (2.7%), and symptomatic hypotension in 16 (1.7%). No patient developed heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or died. The independent predictors of hypertensive responses were age, baseline systolic blood pressure, and treatment with nitrates. The independent predictors of arrhythmias were history of hypertension, previous coronary artery disease, and baseline heart rate.

Conclusions

This accelerated dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography protocol is safe in a low-risk population and has a rate of complications similar to that reported for the standard protocol.

### Low-gradient aortic valve stenosis: value and limitations of dobutamine stress testing [^111SytNz]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Aortic valve stenosis has already reached endemic proportions in Western countries. As the prognosis of low-flow aortic valve stenosis under medical treatment is dismal, surgery is recommended in most patients. Preoperative dobutamine stress testing may help to assess surgical risk, but there is no strong scientific evidence to deny surgery based exclusively on the results of this test. The problems associated with clinical decision making in this condition are reviewed.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^116rMjDt]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography — staged dosing and precautions are specified: for detection of inotropic response in HF patients, stages of 5 min are used, starting from 5 up to 20 μg/kg/min, and to fully recruit the inotropic reserve in patients with HF and under β-blocker therapy, doses up to 40 μg/kg/min may be required; in assessment of the patient with possible severe aortic valve stenosis, the maximal dose is usually 20 μg/kg/min, as higher doses are less safe and probably unnecessary; atropine coadministration is associated with higher rate of complications in those with a history of neuropsychiatric symptoms, reduced LV function, or small body habitus; the dobutamine infusion is started as usual at 5 μg/kg/min and titrated upward in steps of 2.5–5 μg/kg/min every 5–8 min, with a period of 2–3 min after each increment before image acquisition to allow the haemodynamic response to develop.

### Prognostic relevance of a false-positive stress echocardiography response: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116mxzHy]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the following key findings: (1) An FP stress echocardiogram result is common, is most likely to occur with exercise stress protocols and occurs more commonly in patients with fewer comorbidities for IHD. (2) Patients with a FP result have lower MACE in comparison to patients who have a true-positive stress echocardiography result. (3) There is insufficient evidence to confirm whether patients with an FP result on dobutamine stress echocardiography, in comparison to a true negative result, are at a higher risk of future MACE.

This systematic review indicates that FP stress echocardiography results are common, occurring in approximately 30% of patients undergoing stress echocardiography. Furthermore, exercise was the most common protocol in patients who had a FP result subsequently followed by the use of dobutamine. These findings are on the higher side of previously published literature whereby FP results have been reported to range from rates of 6%to 28%. Exercise protocols have previously been reported as being commonly associated with FP results due to hypertensive response to exercise, worsening of non-ischaemic RWMAs including abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branch block, a decrease in contractile responseand poor image quality resulting in the misinterpretation of wall motion changes. However, literature on this is mixed, with some studies highlighting exercise stress echocardiography protocols as being most commonly associated with FP results, whereas other studies suggest there to be similar rates of FP results among exercise, dobutamine and dipyridamole protocols.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^113ZdCfQ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic stress testing (dobutamine) — In patients who cannot exercise, dobutamine and vasodilator stress are alternatives, and although vasodilators may have advantages for assessment of myocardial perfusion, dobutamine is preferred when the test is based on assessment of regional wall motion. A graded dobutamine infusion starting at 5 μg/kg/min and increasing at 3-minute intervals to 10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/kg/min is the standard for dobutamine stress testing, and inclusion of low-dose stages facilitates recognition of viability and ischemia in segments with abnormal function at rest, even if viability assessment is not the main objective of the test. End points are achievement of target heart rate (defined as 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate), new or worsening wall-motion abnormalities of moderate degree, significant arrhythmias, hypotension, severe hypertension, and intolerable symptoms. Atropine, in divided doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg to a total of 2.0 mg, should be used as needed to achieve target heart rate, increases the sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography in patients receiving beta-blockers and in those with single-vessel disease, and the minimum cumulative dose needed should be used to avoid the rare complication of central nervous system toxicity. Patients given atropine at the 30-μg/kg/min stage reach target heart rate more quickly using lower doses of dobutamine and with fewer side effects; a beta-blocker may be administered to reverse the side effects of dobutamine, and administration of beta-blockers at peak stress or during recovery may increase test sensitivity. Both dobutamine and exercise echocardiography result in a marked increase of heart rate, but the increment in systolic blood pressure is much less with dobutamine compared with exercise.

### Risk stratification of patients with chronic kidney disease: results of screening strategies incorporating clinical risk scoring and dobutamine stress echocardiography [^116FYnrs]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac disease is the principal cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ischemia at dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is associated with adverse events in these patients. We sought the efficacy of combining clinical risk evaluation with DSE.

Methods

We allocated 244 patients with CKD (mean age 54 years, 140 men, 169 dialysis-dependent at baseline) into low- and high-risk groups based on two disease-specific scores and the Framingham risk model. All underwent DSE and were further stratified according to DSE results. Patients were followed over 20 ± 14 months for events (death, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome).

Results

There were 49 deaths and 32 cardiac events. Using the different clinical scores, allocation of high risk varied from 34% to 79% of patients, and 39% to 50% of high-risk patients had an abnormal DSE. In the high-risk groups, depending on the clinical score chosen, 25% to 44% with an abnormal DSE had a cardiac event, compared with 8% to 22% with a normal DSE. Cardiac events occurred in 2.0%, 3.1%, and 9.7% of the low-risk patients, using the two disease-specific and Framingham scores, respectively, and DSE results did not add to risk evaluation in this subgroup. Independent DSE predictors of cardiac events were a lower resting diastolic blood pressure, angina during the test, and the combination of ischemia with resting left ventricular dysfunction.

Conclusion

In CKD patients, high-risk findings by DSE can predict outcome. A stepwise strategy of combining clinical risk scores with DSE for CAD screening in CKD reduces the number of tests required and identifies a high-risk subgroup among whom DSE results more effectively stratify high and low risk.

### Prediction of mortality using dobutamine echocardiography [^112YmuKM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to find out whether dobutamine echocardiography (DbE) could provide independent prediction of total and cardiac mortality, incremental to clinical and angiographic variables.

Background

Existing outcome studies with DbE have examined composite end points, rather than death, over a relatively short follow-up. Clinical and stress data were collected in 3,156 patients (age 63 ± 12 years, 1,801 men) undergoing DbE. Significant stenoses (> 50% diameter) were identified in 70% of 1,073 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Total and cardiac mortality were identified over nine years of follow-up (mean 3.8 ± 1.9). Cox models were used to analyze the effect of ischemia and other variables, independent of other determinants of mortality.

Results

The dobutamine echocardiogram was abnormal in 1,575 patients (50%). Death occurred in 716 patients (23%), 259 of whom (8%) were thought to have died from cardiac causes. Patients with normal DbE had a total mortality of 8% per year and a cardiac mortality of 1% per year over the first four years of follow-up. Ischemia and the extent of abnormal wall motion were independent predictors of cardiac death, together with age and heart failure. In sequential Cox models, the predictive power of clinical data alone (model chi-square 115) was strengthened by adding the resting left ventricular function (model chi-square 138) and the results of DbE (model chi-square 181). In the subgroup undergoing coronary angiography, the power of the model was increased to a minor degree by the addition of coronary anatomy data.

Conclusions

Dobutamine echocardiography is an independent predictor of death, incremental to other data. While a normal dobutamine echocardiogram predicts low risk of cardiac death (on the order of 1% per year), this risk increases with the extent of abnormal wall motion at rest and stress.

### American Society of Echocardiography COVID-19 statement update: lessons learned and preparation for future pandemics [^116xNHWR]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Key points — The type of PPE applied will depend on local policy and resources, and vaccination is one of the most effective countermeasures, with COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines helping reduce illness severity and spread to vulnerable populations; exemptions and staff assignment decisions for unvaccinated personnel depend on local policies and nonpharmacological and behavioral changes also impacted endemic respiratory viruses. A limited study should be performed with images targeted to the clinical question and, for de novo cases, the most common expected findings; the ECG should be imported from the patient's telemetry system where possible or by using time-based acquisitions, measurements should not be performed at the time of acquisition, and UEAs should be readily available as needed. Multimodality imaging may be considered an acceptable alternative to TEE and exercise stress echocardiography in certain circumstances; transporting patients rather than performing bedside echocardiography may risk broader exposure, and dobutamine stress echocardiogram may provide the least exposure risk of any stress test modality.

### Safety of contrast dobutamine stress echocardiography: a single center experience [^113dcxNp]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast is increasingly being used during dobutamine stress echocardiography. However, there are few data regarding the safety of this combination.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 751 consecutive stress echocardiograms, 332 without contrast and 419 with contrast (299 with Sonouve, 120 with Optison). Reported side effects and physiologic data were then compared.

Results

There were no fatalities. The incidence of side effects was similar in the 3 groups. The Optison group had a lower diastolic blood pressure compared with the noncontrast group (P < .05) at rest, and the Sonovue group had a higher peak heart rate compared with the noncontrast group (P < .001). Patients receiving Optison had more premature atrial contractions (P < .05) but there was no difference in the incidence of ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, or vagally mediated episodes.

Conclusion

The use of contrast during dobutamine stress echocardiography was not associated with an increased risk of side effects.

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^112BWJ3H]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study is the first to assess the prognostic value of DSE compared to MPI for long-term outcome. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 172 deaths occurred, of which 72 were due to cardiac causes. Nonfatal MI occurred in 46 patients. The survival curves continued to diverge during the follow-up period, indicating a maintained prognostic value of both DSE and MPI. Both patients with a normal DSE and a normal MPI had a relatively favorable long-term prognosis in contrast to patients with an abnormal imaging result. A multivariable model revealed that both an abnormal DSE and an abnormal MPI had an incremental prognostic value over clinical variables and stress test parameters. Ischemia on DSE but not ischemia on MPI was predictive of outcome. Both modalities were comparable in identifying patients with low or high risk of cardiac events during long-term follow-up.

Alternative imaging and exposure risk — During the early pandemic there was a significant reduction in TEE and exercise stress echocardiography due to aerosol and transmission concerns, leading to increased use of alternative imaging that could provide similar diagnostic information without aerosol risk. Although these may be acceptable alternatives, many situations still require TEE or stress echocardiography and, with appropriate PPE, benefits may outweigh risks; transporting infected patients rather than performing bedside studies may risk broader exposure, and dobutamine stress echocardiogram may provide the least exposure risk among stress tests.

### Cardiac events after noncardiac surgery in patients undergoing preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography: findings from the mayo poce-DSE investigators [^114f7Ek5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines support the use of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) prior to noncardiac surgery in higher-risk patients who are unable to perform at least 4 metabolic equivalents of physical activity. We evaluated postoperative outcomes of patients in different operative risk categories after preoperative DSE.

Methods

We collected data from the medical record on 4494 patients from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2011 who had DSE up to 90 days prior to a noncardiac surgery. Patients were divided into low, intermediate, and high preoperative surgery-specific risk. Baseline demographic data and risk factors were abstracted from the medical record, as were postoperative cardiac events including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality within 30 days after surgery.

Results

There were 103 cardiac outcomes (2.3%), which included myocardial infarction (n = 57, 1.3%), resuscitated cardiac arrest (n = 26, 0.6%), and all-cause mortality (n = 40, 0.9%). Cardiac event rates were 0.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-3.9%) in the low-surgical-risk group, 2.1% (95% CI, 1.6%-2.5%) in the intermediate-surgical-risk group, and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.0%-4.4%) in the high-risk group. Thirty-day postoperative mortality rates were 0%, 0.9%, and 0.8% for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk surgical groups, respectively, and were not statistically different.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate low cardiac event rates in patients who underwent a DSE prior to noncardiac surgery. The previously accepted construct of low-, intermediate-, and high-risk surgeries based on postoperative events of < 1%, 1%-5%, and > 5% overestimates the actual risk in contemporary settings.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography before elevated-risk NCS has been evaluated predominantly in patients at increased cardiovascular risk with poor (< 4 METs) or unknown functional capacity, with a positive test rate reported in the range of 5% to 50%. In studies with event rates of 0% to 15%, a positive dobutamine test predicted preoperative cardiovascular events from 0% to 37%, whereas the negative predictive value was typically > 90%. Dobutamine stress echocardiography is appropriate for patients unable to exercise and should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, serious arrhythmias, unstable or ACS, or hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. There is limited evidence for other stress imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance, in preoperative risk stratification before NCS.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^114YRYqj]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography for risk stratification — Stress echocardiography is a useful technique for the risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD), with studies documenting prognostic use across symptoms, known CAD, prior coronary artery revascularization, prior myocardial infarction, and asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CAD. A normal exercise echocardiogram result is associated with an annual event rate of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction of less than 1%, equivalent to that of an age- and sex-matched population, and these patients do not require further diagnostic evaluation unless there is a change in clinical status. Patients with a normal pharmacologic stress echocardiogram result have a slightly higher event rate. Patients with extensive stress-induced abnormalities in a multivessel distribution are at a high risk of mortality and cardiac events, and in these patients, coronary angiography and subsequent myocardial revascularization may be justified. An exercise wall-motion score index greater than 1.4 or exercise ejection fraction (EF) less than 50% portends a significantly worse prognosis. Baseline left ventricular (LV) function expressed as wall-motion score index or EF remains a powerful predictor, and patients with resting LV dysfunction but no inducible myocardial ischemia have an intermediate risk, whereas patients with resting LV dysfunction and new wall-motion abnormalities have the greatest risk for death and cardiac events.

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^11418N3c]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in diabetic patients. To optimize therapeutic intervention, it is essential to identify patients at risk. Exercise stress testing is the most common stress modality used for the noninvasive evaluation of CAD. However, exercise tolerance in diabetic patients may be impaired, particularly because of the higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is used to assess the severity of CAD in patients unable to perform an adequate exercise test. The safety, feasibility, and accuracy of DSE are comparable in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. DSE has shown an incremental value in predicting death and hard cardiac events at short- and intermediate-term follow-up. However, it is not known whether this incremental value can be maintained at long-term follow-up.

The goals of the current study with 13-year follow-up were to 1) assess very long-term outcome after DSE in patients with diabetes, 2) identify predictors of increased risk in patients with diabetes, and 3) define a low-risk period after normal DSE.

### Occurrence of atrial fibrillation during dobutamine stress echocardiography: incidence, risk factors, and outcomes [^117XLiW9]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The reported incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurring during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) ranges from 0.5% to 4%. The aim of this study was to characterize the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of AF precipitated during DSE.

Methods

The clinical and echocardiographic data of consecutive patients over a 50-month period who were in sinus rhythm and underwent DSE were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

A total of 11,806 consecutive patients underwent DSE and met all inclusion criteria. AF developed during DSE in 122 patients (1%), 71 of whom had histories of AF. The duration of AF was < 1 hour in 74 patients (61%) and < 24 hours in 117 patients (96%). Of the 47 patients who were still in AF when dismissed from the echocardiography laboratory, 21 had outpatient follow-up within 24 hours, eight were already inpatients, and 18 were triaged to the emergency department or hospital. Spontaneous cardioversion occurred in 114 patients (93%). There were no reported complications. The clinical characteristic most strongly associated with the development of AF during DSE was a history of AF (odds ratio, 18.4 if no history of congestive heart failure; P < .001). The presence or extent of stress-induced myocardial ischemia was not predictive of the development of AF.

Conclusions

AF is an infrequent complication of DSE. Most patients return to sinus rhythm spontaneously within 1 hour. Patients with persistent AF can be safely dismissed from the echocardiography laboratory to have outpatient follow-up within 24 hours unless they have suboptimal heart rate control, hypotension, significant symptoms, or markedly abnormal findings on DSE.

### The risk of adverse events associated with atropine administration during dobutamine stress echocardiography in cardiac transplant patients: a 28-year single-center experience [^113TTX3d]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is performed in heart transplant patients, the safety profile of atropine administration in DSE in this setting is unclear.

Methods and Results

We identified heart transplant patients who received atropine during DSE from January 1984 to August 2011 at our institution and compared them with a propensity-scored matched control group of heart transplant patients who underwent DSE without atropine. Adverse events were defined as significant arrhythmias (sinus arrest, Mobitz type II heart block, complete heart block, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation), hypotension requiring hospitalization, syncope or presyncope, myocardial infarction, and death. Forty-five heart transplant patients (median age 62 years, 82% male) received 0.2–1 mg atropine during DSE. Of these, 1 patient (2.2%) developed temporary complete heart block. No adverse events were identified in the control group of 154 patients who received dobutamine without atropine.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that complete heart block can occur infrequently with the administration of atropine in heart transplant patients undergoing DSE. Therefore, patients should be appropriately monitored for these adverse events during and after DSE.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^111kr12G]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — adequate stress thresholds and strategies to address false-negative studies: Suboptimal stress is a primary cause of false-negative studies, and an adequate level of stress is frequently defined as achievement of 85% or more of the patient's age-predicted maximal heart rate for exercise or dobutamine stress and/or a rate-pressure product of 20,000 or more for exercise testing. For those who cannot exercise, pharmacologic stress and atrial pacing are suggested alternatives, and among nonexercise methods the highest heart rates and sensitivity may be achieved with atrial pacing. The use of atropine substantially enhances the sensitivity of dobutamine stress in the setting of beta-blockade and may be required to overcome Wenckebach heart block during atrial pacing, and small comparative studies suggest that imaging during peak exercise may detect abnormalities when posttreadmill images are negative.

### Estimating the accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography and single-photon emission computed tomography among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^116KUqCd]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

When cardiac stress testing is ordered prior to noncardiac surgery, the optimal test modality is unknown. Therefore, we conducted this study to compare the diagnostic accuracy of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in a representative sample of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery without an existing diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The predicted accuracy of DSE was greater than that of SPECT in around 60.5% of cases above the current guideline-recommended risk threshold. In this population, DSE is likely to be more accurate than SPECT in the diagnosis of obstructive CAD. To the extent that making a diagnosis of obstructive CAD changes the decision to pursue noncardiac surgery, DSE likely represents a more efficient testing modality. However, in the range of pretest probabilities among this population, positive results from either test are more likely to represent false positives than true positives.

### Role of noninvasive testing in the clinical evaluation of women with suspected ischemic heart disease: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^113zrzJ4]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — summary and testing recommendation in symptomatic women: "Stress echocardiography with exercise or dobutamine stress is an accurate, noninvasive technique for the detection of obstructive CAD and risk among symptomatic women with intermediate to high IHD risk". "Exercise stress testing is recommended for patients able to achieve maximal exercise capacity/heart rate levels". The modality "provides incremental information beyond that which can be ascertained from clinical symptoms, the ETT, and rest echocardiography data", and its information "appears comparable to that of stress MPI and is predictive of short- and long-term IHD events". Nonischemic causes of cardiac symptoms "can also be recognized with relevant echocardiographic techniques".

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^111Pic6K]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis reported higher annualized cardiac events for patients with normal pharmacological SPECT (1.78%) compared to patients with normal exercise SPECT (0.65%). Several reasons have been attributed for these difference; patients who underwent pharmacological stress SPECT are older, have more co-morbidities and has an increased number of risk factors for CAD. In the current study, we found an annualized hard cardiac event rate of 1.3% for normal dobutamine stress MPI. From a clinical perspective, patients unable to perform exercise tests who have a normal MPI have a good prognosis and could be spared invasive evaluation of the coronary arteries. Based on the current findings, both a normal DSE and a normal stress MPI identified low- and high-risk patient groups. As a consequence, both stress modalities could be used interchangeably in identifying low-risk patient group.

Both DSE and MPI have developed rapidly over the past years and have emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosis and prognosis of CAD. These imaging methods have inherent differences: SPECT probes myocardial hypoperfusion, whereas DSE probes systolic dysfunction. According to the ischemic cascade, a series of biochemical reactions that occurs after inadequate myocardial blood supply, perfusion abnormalities precede systolic dysfunction. This may influence the sensitivity and specificity of MPI and DSE for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. DSE is less sensitive in detecting CAD for mild disease, but more specific for the overall patient group. Stress SPECT has a higher diagnostic accuracy in patients with multivessel CAD. A recent multicenter studycompared commonly used imaging techniques and found that both MPI and stress echocardiography had good diagnostic accuracy for CAD (area under the curve 0.74 and 0.70, respectively). Our findings show that there are comparable implications in risk-stratifying patients, using either modality. Which of these modalities is most suitable still depends on the patients clinical status, availability, and local expertise and costs.

This study has some limitations. First, the prognostic value of gated SPECT was not examined, due to the fact that at the time of data collection gated SPECT was not routinely performed in our center. As a result left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was not available. Also, LVEF was not routinely examined during DSE. Information about LVEF could have improved the current analysis. Second, attenuation or scatter correction during stress SPECT was not routinely performed. Previous studies have shown that attenuation correction contribute to optimize further risk stratification. Third, the patient population was relatively small. This could have influenced the results.

5 DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (DSE)

Stress echocardiography using low dose Dobutamine to elicit contractile response in viable segments with systolic dysfunction, is a low risk, quick, noninvasive test with no radiation risk. VM with a contractile reserve in a minimum of > 5 segments, increases the success rate of functional recovery following coronary revascularization.

5.1 DSE viability testing protocol

Typically, to induce a contractile response in baseline dysfunctional segments, Dobutamine is started at low doses (2.5–5 μg/kg/min) and gradually increased to intermediate doses (up to 20 μg/kg/min). Subsequently, to assess ischemic response, infusion is incrementally increased to stress doses (up to 40 μg/kg/min), with the addition of IV Atropine as needed (up to 2 mg in divided doses), to achieve a target heart rate (85% (220‐age). Under close hemodynamic and EKG monitoring, Dobutamine is infused for 3 min at each stage but infusion time can be variable based on patient's hemodynamics and contractile response.

Four distinct responses to dobutamine stress have been described. A biphasic response, in which contractility improves with low dose dobutamine and worsens at higher doses due to ischemia has been shown to be 60% sensitive and 88% specific in predicting contractile recovery 6 weeks after coronary revascularization. Second, PVM with reduced perfusion reserve may have no contractile reserve and DSE may further worsen contractility. Third, when there is a sustained improvement in contractility with increasing dobutamine dose, it is believed to be the myocardium with the restored, normal flow, nontransmural infarction, or remodeled. Finally, if the myocardium is scarred and NV, no contractile response to dobutamine is expected to be seen, however this finding lacks high sensitivity to detect NVM (Figure 2).

DSE is widely available, accessible and inexpensive with no radiation risk. If the positive contractile reserve is demonstrated on DSE, it is a specific sign of VM. However, the absence of contractile reserve on DSE may not preclude viability in advanced stages of thinned, hibernating myocardium. Limitations of DSE include poor acoustic windows and other technical difficulties in image acquisition that may result in images of suboptimal, non‐diagnostic quality.

### Safety of stress echocardiography (from the international stress echo complication registry) [^113xfyAc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The safety of any diagnostic test is a major issue in deciding its practicability and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of various stress echocardiographic modalities in the "real world". From February 1998 to January 2004, a simple written questionnaire was distributed to echocardiography laboratories across the world known to perform stress echocardiography. The following categories of major complications (known to occur during stress testing) were indicated: sustained ventricular tachycardia (> 30 beats/min), ventricular fibrillation, myocardial infarction, third-degree atrioventricular block, severe hypotension requiring therapy, cardiac asystole, cardiac rupture, stroke, and death. Three hundred centers were polled, from which 71 co-investigators responded and reported on 85,997 patient examinations. Exercise was used in 26,295 cases, dobutamine in 35,103, and dipyridamole in 24,599 cases. Life-threatening events occurred in 86 cases: during exercise in 4 patients (event rate 1 in 6,574), during dobutamine infusion (small dose for viability and/or large dose for ischemia) in 63 patients (event rate 1 in 557), and during dipyridamole stress testing in 19 patients (event rate 1 in 1,294). Of the 86 patients with complications, 5 died during dobutamine stress testing (ventricular fibrillation, n = 2; cardiac rupture, n = 3) and 1 after dipyridamole testing (cardiogenic shock). In conclusion, stress echocardiography is a safe method in the real world, but serious complications may occur. Exercise seems safer than pharmacologic stress and dipyridamole safer than dobutamine, possibly because of preselection criteria.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112zgcaG]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Preoperative risk stratification — dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for non-cardiac surgery: for pre-operative risk stratification, exercise stress testing is the modality of choice in most patients who can ambulate, but in high-risk patients with limited exercise capacity due to non-cardiac disease, pharmacological stress testing is preferred and DSE has been shown to be useful for perioperative risk stratification including major vascular and non-vascular surgery. The strongest predictors of postoperative adverse events were ischemia during DSE and a history of congestive heart failure, and DSE findings, including the heart rate at which ischemia develops, could be used to stratify patients at low, intermediate, and high risk for postoperative myocardial infarction and death, with a normal study conferring excellent outcome. Similar to other stress imaging techniques, the positive predictive value of DSE for predicting adverse events in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery was 13% (range 7–42%), whereas the negative predictive value is excellent (99% [range 93–100]). In multiple studies and meta-analyses, the prognostic value of DSE was at least as good as that of SPECT imaging for predicting adverse post-operative events, and in patients evaluated with DSE before vascular surgery and followed for 19 ± 11 months postoperatively, extensive 3 segments stress-induced new wall motion abnormalities and previous myocardial infarction independently predicted late cardiac events.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) pharmacologic protocol — Dobutamine is usually delivered in graded doses starting at 5 μg/kg/ min and increasing at 3-minute intervals to 10, 20, 30 and 40 μg/kg/ min, and low dose dobutamine, with a beginning dose as low as 2.5 μg/kg/ min, may facilitate recognition of myocardial viability in abnormal segments. When target heart rate (HR) cannot be achieved with dobutamine alone, atropine can be added and is delivered in doses of 0.25 to 0.50 mg at 1 min intervals, as needed to achieve target heart rate, to a total of 1.0 to 2.0 mg, with the smaller dosage increment (0.25 mg) suggested in elderly patients, patients with small body habitus, and in those close to the target heart rate. The minimum dose should be used to avoid side effects, and a lower total dose (1.0 mg) is recommended in patients with prior neuropsychiatric symptoms or body mass index less than 24 kg/m2. Atropine delivery at the 20 or 30 μg/kg/min dose of dobutamine, rather than the 40 μg/kg/min dose, facilitates achieving the target HR (85% of the age-predicted maximum HR) earlier. Endpoints for termination include achievement of the target HR, hypotension, new or worsening wall motion abnormalities, significant arrhythmias, severe hypertension, and intolerable symptoms. Withholding beta-blockers will facilitate achievement of target HR but may be accompanied by hypertension or arrhythmias, and elimination of the beta-blocker effect would require withholding these agents for 5 half-lives.

### Does stress echocardiography add incremental value to baseline ejection fraction for the early identification of candidates for implantable defibrillators? [^112XYEjt]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

The measurements of MAPSE and PSV are more robust measurements than EF and are not as sensitive to an unclear visualisation of the myocardium. Although the AUC for both MAPSE and PSV, during both baseline and stress echocardiography, was lower than that for EF, a cut-off of MAPSE 8 mm had similar sensitivity and negative predictive value as a cut-off of EF ≤ 35%. It is possible that this parameter could be used as further clinical assistance when distinguishing high-risk patients from low-risk patients.

During low-dose stress echocardiography, stress was induced by the administration of intravenous dobutamine after which baseline and stress images are compared. A time duration cut-off of in total 6 min of dobutamine infusion was used as endpoint for the stress echocardiography. We did not investigate other commonly reported endpoints for the stress test, such as increase in stroke volume or heart frequency. The rationale for this was the benefit of all patients receiving the same workload. There was, however, a significant increase in EF at group level before and after the administration of dobutamine, indicating increased contractility. Also, only low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed, as the main point of interest was to establish increased contractility. Many studies have addressed the association between viability detected by early stress echocardiography after a myocardial infarction and functional recovery of the left ventricle. Although there seems to be a general consensus that stress echocardiography can be used to predict late left ventricular functional recovery, and also can be used as a predictor for re-infarction and mortality risks, there are still some concerns. First, most of the previous studies were relatively small and performed during an era where thrombolytic therapy was the dominant method of reperfusion. Second, in many of these studies, the baseline EF was relatively high thus including patients who were at relatively low risk. Third, there is a vast discrepancy of the outcome measurement of left ventricular recovery both in terms of what parameter was measured and also when the recovery was meant to take place, making comparisons and generalisations difficult.

### Risk stratification of women with peripartum cardiomyopathy at initial presentation: a dobutamine stress echocardiography study [^115UTv8R]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to determine the prognostic use of inotropic contractile reserve on risk stratification and prognostication of women with peripartum cardiomyopathy.

Background

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare disorder effecting women in their prime years of life. There appears to be an initial high-risk period with 25% to 50% of women dying within the first 3 months postpartum. Early risk stratification and prognostication are, thus, crucial. However, only limited data are available.

Methods

In all, 7 women (mean age 31.8 years) with peripartum cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (mean LV ejection fraction [LVEF] 25.3 ± 9.5%) were studied. Of these, 6 underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography at baseline and a follow-up resting echocardiogram at a mean of 4.7 ± 0.9 months after initial presentation. Resting and peak inotropic contractile reserve, and follow-up LVEF, were computed.

Results

The mean LVEF improved significantly from baseline (25.3 ± 9.5%) to maximal inotropic contractile reserve (53.8 ± 12.6%) (P = 0.0004) and at follow-up (53.0 ± 16.4%) (P = 0.006). Importantly, LVEF at maximal inotropic contractile reserve and at follow-up (5.6 months) did not differ significantly (P = 0.5). The mean LVEF at maximal inotropic contractile reserve correlated well with the follow-up (LVEF R = 0.79). However, the baseline LVEF did not correlate with follow-up LVEF (P = not significant).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with peripartum cardiomyopathy, inotropic contractile reserve during dobutamine stress echocardiography accurately correlates with subsequent recovery of LV function and confers a benign prognosis.

### Does the prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography differ among different age groups? [^112sF9xg]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Age is associated with reduced exercise capacity and greater prevalence of coronary artery disease. Whether the prognostic information obtained from dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), a stress test commonly used for patients unable to perform an exercise test, provides differential information based on age is not well known.

Methods

We studied 6,655 consecutive patients referred for DSE. Patients were divided into 3 age groups: (1) < 60 years (n = 1,389), (2) 60 to 74 years (n = 2,978), and (3) ≥ 75 years (n = 2,288). Mean follow-up was 5.5 ± 2.8 years. End points included all-cause mortality and cardiac events, including myocardial infarction and late (> 3 months) coronary revascularization.

Results

Peak stress wall motion score index was an independent predictor of cardiac events in all age groups (< 60 years: hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, P = 0.02; 60–74 years: HR 1.70, P < .0001; ≥ 75 years: HR 1.10, P = 0.006). In patients ≥ 75 years, peak wall motion score index (HR 1.10, P < .0001) and abnormal left ventricular end-systolic volume response (HR 1.25, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of death. In patients aged 60 to 74 years, abnormal left ventricular end-systolic volume response (HR 1.43, P = 0.0003) was independently related to death, whereas in patients < 60 years, the echocardiographic data assessed during stress were not a predictor.

Conclusions

Dobutamine stress echocardiography provided independent information predictive of cardiac events among all age groups and death in patients ≥ 60 years. However, among patients < 60 years, stress-induced echocardiographic abnormalities were not independently associated with mortality. Comorbidities, which have precluded exercise testing, may be most relevant in predicting mortality in patients < 60 years undergoing DSE.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^115nDBNH]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography — reporting requirements and modality effects — the modality of stress and details of the stress test itself should be considered in interpretation, and the report must include baseline and stress systolic function and segmental wall motion, the protocol used, exercise time or dose of pharmacologic agent, maximum heart rate achieved, adequacy of stress, blood pressure response, reason for test termination, cardiac symptoms during the test, and electrocardiographic changes or significant arrhythmias. In similar extents of coronary artery disease (CAD), stress‑induced decrease in ejection fraction or increase in end‑systolic cavity size are more commonly seen with exercise than with dobutamine stress.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^117QwS9b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) protocols for assessing viability — it is recommended that imaging is performed during at least two low dose stages (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10 μg/kg/min), with the length of each infusion stage adjusted to response and imaging needs. Testing can be performed at the bedside in subjects in the intensive care unit (ICU), with continuous echocardiographic monitoring and the interpreting physician present in person. Discontinuation of beta-blockers is not essential but intermediate doses of dobutamine (15–20 μg/kg/ min) may be needed to elicit a contractile response in the presence of beta-blocker therapy. For low and intermediate dose protocols, continuous monitoring of at least several ECG leads should be performed for detection of ischemic ST-segment abnormalities and arrhythmias, and although considerable information is obtainable at low dose, utilization of stress doses enables detection of flow-limiting stenosis by eliciting a biphasic response.

### Prognostic role of cardiac power in a large cohort of patients with normal ejection fraction referred for dobutamine stress echocardiography [^116iWHAX]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac power reflects cardiac performance in terms of energy transferred by the left ventricle to the aorta per unit time. Peak stress cardiac power has been shown to predict outcomes in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and, more recently, in patients with normal LVEF referred for exercise stress echocardiography. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of cardiac power in patients with normal LVEF referred for dobutamine stress echocardiography.

Methods

Data were studied from 15,576 patients with LVEF ≥ 50% and no significant valvular or right ventricular dysfunction who underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography. Cardiac power at rest and peak stress and power reserve (peak stress minus rest power) were calculated and normalized to left ventricular mass. Outcome end points were all-cause mortality and new-onset heart failure (HF).

Results

The mean age was 66 ± 13 years, and 49% patients were women. Resting and peak stress power/mass were 0.7 ± 0.2 and 1.6 ± 0.6 W/100 g left ventricular myocardium, respectively. During follow-up (median, 3.3 years; interquartile range, 0.7–7.3 years), 2,278 patients died and 2,137 developed HF. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and stress test results, lower peak stress power/mass was independently associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, highest vs lowest quartile, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; p = 0.004) and HF at follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59–0.76; P < .0001). Power reserve showed similar associations with outcomes.

Conclusions

Assessment of cardiac power during dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with normal LVEF provides valuable prognostic information regarding risk for mortality and future HF, in addition to stress test results. It is an important research tool to study cardiac performance, and the development of risk scores incorporating this novel index could be considered after further validation in prospective studies.

### Accelerated dobutamine stress testing: safety and feasibility in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease [^114eZqSe]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Dobutamine pharmodynamics require approximately 10 min to reach steady state. Despite this, standard dobutamine stress echo typically uses 3-min stages of advancing dobutamine doses because of safety concerns.

Hypothesis

In patients with a high pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), a continuous infusion of high-dose dobutamine is a feasible and safe method for performing a dobutamine stress test.

Methods

Forty-seven consecutive patients (mean age 64 ± 11 years) with 3.0 ± 1.4 cardiac risk factors underwent dobutamine stress testing utilizing a single, high-dose (40 mcg/kg/min), continuous dobutamine infusion. The 40 mcg/kg/min infusion was continued for up to 10 min or until a test endpoint had been reached. If a test endpoint was not achieved, atropine (up to 1.0 mg) was added.

Results

Heart rate rose from 71 ± 12 to 137 ± 18 beats/min at peak (p < 0.0001) with a concomitant change in systolic blood pressure (143 ± 35 vs. 167 ± 38 mmHg; p = 0.001) but no change in diastolic blood pressure (74 ± 19 vs. 75 ± 18 mmHg; p = NS). Target heart rate was achieved in 20 of 47 (43%) patients with accelerated dobutamine alone and in 34 of 47 (72%) with the addition of atropine. An average of 11.6 ± 3.7 min was required to obtain target heart rate. Subjective sensations from the dobutamine occurred in 49% of patients (palpitations 21%, nausea 6%, chest pain 6%, headache 6%, dizziness 13%), mild arrhythmia in 48% of patients (ventricular premature beats 38%, supraventricular tachycardia 10%), and one patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

Conclusion

A single, high-dose (40 mcg/kg/min) dobutamine-atropine protocol provides an efficient means of performing dobutamine stress echocardiography with a similar symptom profile as conventional dobutamine infusion protocols in patients with a high pretest probability of CAD. Randomized, controlled studies will be necessary to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this accelerated dobutamine echo protocol.

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^116f6iU1]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Both dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are frequently used for cardiac risk stratification. The long-term relative prognostic value of these modalities has not been studied. Therefore, this study evaluated the long-term prognostic value of DSE compared to MPI in patients unable to perform exercise testing.

Methods

This prospective, single center study included 301 patients (mean age 59 ± 12 years, 56% men) unable to perform exercise tests who underwent DSE and dobutamine stress 99m Tc-sestamibi MPI. End points during follow-up were all-cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify independent predictors of outcome. The probability of survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

A total of 182 patients (60%) had an abnormal DSE and 198 (66%) patients had an abnormal MPI. The agreement between DSE and MPI was 82% (κ = 0.62). During a median follow-up of 14 years (range 5–18), 172 deaths (57%) occurred, of which 72 (24%) were due to cardiac causes. Nonfatal MI occurred in 46 patients (15%). The multivariable analysis demonstrated that an abnormal DSE was a significant predictor of cardiac mortality (HR 2.35, 95% CI [1.17–4.73]) and hard cardiac events (HR 2.11, 95% CI [1.25–3.57]). Also, an abnormal MPI result was a significant predictor of cardiac mortality (HR 3.03, 95% CI [1.33–6.95]) and hard cardiac events (HR 2.06, 95% CI [1.12–3.79]).

Conclusions

DSE and MPI are comparable in predicting long-term cardiac mortality and hard cardiac events in patients unable to perform exercise testing.

### Occurrence of atrial fibrillation during dobutamine stress echocardiography [^1149dK9W]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely used examination for assessment of coronary ischemia, but several complications have been reported. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) during DSE, and a systematic review and meta-analysis were also performed to determine an accurate estimate of the AF incidence. Over a 16-year period, we reviewed all patients referred for DSE. We systematically analyzed all ECG performed during DSE to detect AF during the examination. DSE was completely performed in 4,818 patients (mean age: 62.1 ± 11.7 years). AF was observed in 40 patients (31 men, mean age: 79.7 ± 8.9 years). Incidence of AF during DSE was 0.83%. Regarding the meta-analysis, the combined AF incidence was 0.86%. In our study, patients with AF occurrence had more frequent previous history of paroxysmal AF (p = 0.02) were also older (p < 0.0001) and incidence of AF during DSE increased with age: 0% below 60 years, 0.45% in patients 60 to 69 years, 1.3% in patients 70 to 79 years, and 4% in patients > 80 years (p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with an increased risk of AF were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 3.3, p = 0.003) and previous history of paroxysmal AF (aOR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 1.9; p = 0.04). In conclusion, AF is uncommon during DSE, and elderly patients and patients with previous history of paroxysmal AF are at risk of AF during DSE.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^111JoQJK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta blockade with dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in major vascular surgery — Boersma et al. cohort — used "Cardiac death or nonfatal MI within 30 days after surgery" as the endpoint and reported risk distribution: "611 patients (45%)" had Lee index 1, "509 (38%)" index 2, and "231 (17%)" index " ≥ 3 points". Among "the 83% of patients with < 3 clinical risk factors", those receiving beta blockers had lower cardiac complications "(0.8% [2 of 263])" than those not receiving beta blockers "(2.3% [20 of 855])", and "DSE had minimal additional prognostic value". In patients with " ≥ 3 risk factors (17%)", DSE added prognostic information; among those receiving beta blockers, event risk without versus with stress-induced ischemia was "2.0% [1 of 50] versus 10.6% [5 of 47]". Extent of ischemia further stratified risk: "limited stress-induced ischemia (1–4 segments)" had "2.8% [1 of 36]" events versus " ≥ 5 segments, 36% [4 of 11]". Patients who did not undergo DSE and those without WWMAs had lower rates than those with WWMAs, "0.4% and 1.6% versus 13.5%, respectively", and among "the 222 patients with WWMAs", "67% received beta blockers", with "4.7%" events versus "31.5%" in those not receiving beta blockers. The authors concluded the "additional predictive value of DSE is limited in clinically low-risk patients receiving beta blockers", that "DSE may be avoided" in many who "can proceed safely for surgery without delay", while in intermediate- and high-risk patients receiving beta blockers, DSE "may help identify" those suitable for surgery and those for whom "cardiac revascularization should be considered".

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^111YkkoP]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Outcome

During a mean follow-up of 13 years (SD 3.2), 230 patients (58%) died (121 cardiac deaths), 30 patients (8%) had a nonfatal MI, and 86 (22%) underwent myocardial revascularization. A total of 50 and 45, respectively, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass procedures during follow-up, of whom 9 had both. Among the 141 patients with ischemia by DSE, 62 underwent subsequent revascularization (72% of the total patients revascularized). The remaining patients with ischemia were treated medically.

Clinical and DSE variables associated with an increased risk of all end points of interest in the multivariate model analysis are presented in Table 1. WMSCI at peak-dose dobutamine and LVEF at rest added incremental value to the clinical parameters in predicting all-cause mortality (67 to 93 [P < 0.0001] and 76 [P < 0.0001], respectively). The additional value of DSE, however, did not increase any further after 7 years after the test for all end points of interest. Multivariate analysis showed that WMA at rest, new or worsened WMA, and these DSE parameters combined did not significantly improve the prediction model for adverse outcome.

Table 1
Independent predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, and hard cardiac events using a two-step model

The cumulative survival showed a better, although not significant, survival of normal DSE in comparison with abnormal DSE (74 vs. 68% at 5 years, 57 vs. 49% at 10 years, and 44 vs. 41% at 15 years; overall P = 0.06) (Fig. 2 A). Figure 2 B and C, respectively, shows the event-free survival curves for cardiac death and hard cardiac events with normal versus abnormal DSE. Both cumulative survival free of cardiac death (89 vs. 78% at 5 years, 84 vs. 69% at 10 years, and 81 vs. 66% at 15 years; overall P = 0.003) and hard cardiac events (84 vs. 75% at 5 years, 81 vs. 65% at 10 years, and 77 vs. 63% at 15 years; overall P = 0.009) show a significantly better prognosis in favor of a normal DSE. The interaction between LVEF and peak WMSCI is shown in Fig. 3.

### Comparative definitions for moderate-severe ischemia in stress nuclear, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging [^116yvFAk]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The lack of standardized reporting of the magnitude of ischemia on noninvasive imaging contributes to variability in translating the severity of ischemia across stress imaging modalities. We identified the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) death or myocardial infarction (MI) associated with ≥ 10% ischemic myocardium on stress nuclear imaging as the risk threshold for stress echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. A narrative review revealed that ≥ 10% ischemic myocardium on stress nuclear imaging was associated with a median rate of CAD death or MI of 4.9%/year (interquartile range: 3.75% to 5.3%). For stress echocardiography, ≥ 3 newly dysfunctional segments portend a median rate of CAD death or MI of 4.5%/year (interquartile range: 3.8% to 5.9%). Although imprecisely delineated, moderate-severe ischemia on cardiac magnetic resonance may be indicated by ≥ 4 of 32 stress perfusion defects or ≥ 3 dobutamine-induced dysfunctional segments. Risk-based thresholds can define equivalent amounts of ischemia across the stress imaging modalities, which will help to translate a common understanding of patient risk on which to guide subsequent management decisions.

### Feasibility, efficacy and safety of exercise stress echocardiography during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113goz63]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. They account for approximately 18 million deaths annually, which is significantly higher than the deaths associated with communicable diseases, including the 3.8 million COVID-19 deaths estimated as of the end of June 2021. Early diagnosis and implementation of evidence-based treatment is key to influencing outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Owing to the strain on resources required to treat patients with COVID-19 and the efforts to prevent its spread, there was a marked disruption in cardiovascular diagnostic services across the world at the start of the pandemic. There was a profound reduction in diagnostic procedures performed particularly for exercise electrocardiography (84%), stress echocardiography (SE) (83%) and transoesophageal echocardiography (76%). This was likely due to the aerosolisation risk to staff associated with these procedures at a time when personal protective equipment (PPE) was limited. In our centre, there was a significant reduction in both the number of requests and SE performed — a drop of 83% (figure 1), especially for exercise stress echocardiography (ESE).

Figure 1
The number of referrals made for stress echocardiography reduced by 95.8% at the peak of the pandemic in April 2020 and the number of stress echocardiograms performed reduced by 99%.

In patients able to exercise with no significant left ventricular dysfunction, ESE is the preferred modality for the assessment of myocardial ischaemia because of its ability to provide information on functional capacity, exercise tolerance and symptoms. Additionally, procedure time with ESE is significantly less than that with dobutamine SE. We hypothesised that ESE can be performed safely and efficiently, during the ongoing pandemic, by designing a standard operating procedure incorporating national and local safety guidelines.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^111qU3FM]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment before liver transplantation (LT) specifies that "noninvasive testing with echocardiography is indicated for all adult LT candidates". Because "patients with advanced liver disease may be unable to achieve the target heart rate during a standard exercise test", "these patients should undergo pharmacological stress with adenosine, dipyridamole, or dobutamine", with catheterization "if CAD cannot be confidently excluded", and "Dobutamine stress echocardiography is frequently used as the initial screening test". Risks are noted: "Cardiac catheterization in a patient with cirrhosis is more likely to result in vascular complications such as bleeding compared to controls without liver disease", and many decompensated patients have "tenuous renal function, increasing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy". If "significant coronary artery stenosis (> 70% stenosis) is detected, revascularization may be attempted prior to LT, although rigorous proof of benefit in asymptomatic recipients is lacking", and "Cardiac surgery carries an increased risk in patients with cirrhosis, especially with more decompensated disease".

### Cardiac stress imaging for the prediction of very long-term outcomes: dobutamine stress echocardiography or dobutamineTc-sestamibi SPECT? [^1168kgoV]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Population

The study population consisted of 354 consecutive patients. This study is a continuation of the previously reported study in which the same patient population was evaluated with a mean follow-up of 7.3 years. All patients underwent simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography and dobutamine stress 99m Tc-sestamibi SPECT for the evaluation of suspected or known CAD. Follow-up was successful in 351 (99%) patients. Fifty patients underwent early coronary revascularization < 60 days after MPI and were excluded from analysis. This exclusion was based on previously published data indicating that referral to coronary revascularization in the first 60 days after testing tends to be based on the results of the test. Referral to revascularization > 60 days after testing tends to be based on the worsening of the patient's clinical status. All patients gave informed consent before testing and the local ethics committee approved the study protocol. Patients were enrolled between January 1991 and January 1995. The test in these patients with known or suspected CAD was requested for evaluation of ischemia. Before the stress test, a structured interview was achieved, including assessment of cardiac risk factors. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting glucose level > 140 mg/dL or use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total cholesterol ≥ 6.4 mmol/L or treatment with lipid-lowering medication.

Dobutamine Stress Testing Protocol

The dobutamine stress testing was performed using a standard protocol as described previously. Dobutamine was injected intravenously, starting at a dose of 10 µg/kg/min for 3 min and increasing by 10 µg/kg/min to a maximum dose of 40 µg/kg/min. If the test end point was not reached at a maximum dose of dobutamine, up to 1 mg of atropine was administered intravenously. During stress testing, blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiography were continuously monitored. Test endpoints were achievement of target heart rate (85% of maximum age and sex-predicted heart rate), horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression of more than 2 mm, ST-segment elevation of more than 1 mm, severe angina, systolic blood pressure decrease > 40 mmHg, blood pressure > 240/110 mmHg, or clinically important cardiac arrhythmias. An intravenous beta-blocker was used to reverse the effects of dobutamine/atropine.

Stress echocardiography — patients with diabetes mellitus: Exercise echocardiography is effective for cardiac risk stratification of patients with diabetes mellitus, and among those with multivessel distribution of exercise wall-motion abnormalities, approximately one of 3 patients will experience cardiac death or myocardial infarction during the 3 years after the stress test; many patients with diabetes are unable to undergo an exercise stress test because of the higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy and represent a higher risk population, and dobutamine stress echocardiography was shown to provide independent prognostic information.

### Dobutamine stress echocardiography: impact of abnormal blood potassium levels on cardiac arrhythmias [^1179t62M]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that an abnormal blood potassium level is a relative contraindication to performing dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). However, this has not been previously studied.

Methods

We reviewed a consecutive series of patients who had potassium testing within 48 hours of undergoing DSE for the evaluation of myocardial ischemia over a 10-year period (N = 13,198). Normal potassium range in our laboratory is 3.6–5.2 mmol/L. Hemolyzed samples were not included. The association of potassium levels with the development of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias was assessed.

Results

The incidence of clinically significant arrhythmias was very low (supraventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, 4.9%; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 2.9%; sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, 0.1%), confirming the overall safety of DSE. Most arrhythmias (88%) occurred in patients with normal potassium levels, and arrhythmia rates remained low in patients with potassium abnormalities. Patients with hyperkalemia had a lower risk of developing mild (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22–0.71) and severe (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01–0.68) supraventricular arrhythmias as well as mild ventricular arrhythmias (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83). Even though events were rare, patients with severe hypokalemia (potassium levels ≤ 3.1 mmol/L) had an increased risk of supraventricular arrhythmia and ventricular ectopy.

Conclusions

DSE is safe even in the setting of abnormalities in blood potassium concentrations, and hence cancellation of DSE in patients with potassium abnormalities does not appear warranted. Elevated potassium levels are associated with lower rates of clinically significant supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. While remaining at relatively low risk, patients with very low potassium levels (≤ 3.1 mmol/L) at the time of DSE have a modestly increased risk of arrhythmia. Consideration could be given to correcting severe hypokalemia prior to DSE.

### Long term outcome in patients with silent versus symptomatic ischaemia during dobutamine stress echocardiography [^116vxFnv]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the long term prognosis of patients having silent versus symptomatic ischaemia during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE).

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Tertiary referral centre.

Patients

931 patients who experienced stress induced myocardial ischaemia during DSE.

Results

Silent ischaemia was present in 643 of 931 patients (69%). The number of dysfunctional segments at rest (mean (SD) 9.6 (5.1) v 8.8 (5.0), p = 0.1) and of ischaemic segments (3.5 (2.2) v 3.8 (2.1), p = 0.2) was comparable in both groups. During a mean (SD) follow up of 5.5 (3.3) years, there were 169 (18%) cardiac deaths and 86 (9%) non-fatal infarctions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.05), previous myocardial infarction (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0), and number of ischaemic segments during the test (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.7) as independent predictors of cardiac death and myocardial infarction. For every additional ischaemic segment there was a twofold increment in risk of late cardiac events. The annual cardiac death or myocardial infarction rate was 3.0% in patients with symptomatic ischaemia and 4.6% in patients with silent ischaemia (p < 0.01). Silent induced ischaemia was an independent predictor of cardiac death and myocardial infarction (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0). During follow up symptomatic patients were treated more often with cardioprotective therapy (p < 0.01) and coronary revascularisation (145 of 288 (50%) v 174 of 643 (27%), p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Patients with silent ischaemia had a similar extent of myocardial ischaemia during DSE compared to patients with symptomatic ischaemia but received less cardioprotective treatment and coronary revascularisation and experienced a higher cardiac event rate.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1145ymMw]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Stress testing modalities (Table 2) — exercise (bicycle/treadmill), dobutamine, and dipyridamole/adenosine — are contrasted by physiology, test selection, hemodynamics, and contraindications. Exercise preserves integrity of the electro-mechanical response and is the preferred stress for patients who can attain an adequate level of exercise for known or suspected CAD, with systolic blood pressure ↑↑ by 50%. Dobutamine stimulates beta-1 adrenoceptors with the effect of increased heart rate and/or contractility; contraindications include hemodynamically significant LV outflow tract obstruction and severe systemic hypertension (resting systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg). Vasodilators increase coronary blood flow through effects on adenosine A2A receptors, and myocardial blood flow may be ↑ 3 to 5 times that of resting blood flow; they are the preferred test for myocardial perfusion, with contraindications including pronounced active bronchospastic airway disease.

### Prevalence and potential mechanisms of sustained ventricular arrhythmias during dobutamine stress echocardiography: a literature review [^116wFPSi]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Low credibility.

Sustained ventricular tachycardia during dobutamine stress echocardiography is a rare complication of dobutamine stress echocardiography. It may be related to reduced left ventricular function and prior myocardial infarction but cannot be used as a sensitive or specific sign for myocardial ischemia. The clinical significance of dobutamine stress echocardiography-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia is uncertain, and this condition probably does not represent an adverse prognostic sign.

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^113eAB8X]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the incremental prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) at 13-year follow-up (SD 3.2 years) for predicting mortality and cardiac events in diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 396 diabetic patients (mean age 61 ± 11 years; 252 men [64%]) with limited exercise capacity who underwent DSE for evaluation of ischemia were studied. End points were all causes of mortality, cardiac death, and hard cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction).

Results

During a mean follow-up of 13 years, 230 patients (58%) died (121 cardiac deaths), and 30 patients had nonfatal myocardial infarction. Cumulative survival in patients with an abnormal DSE at 5, 10, and 15 years was 68, 49, and 41%, respectively. In patients with a normal DSE, these respective numbers were 74, 57, and 44%. Multivariate analyses showed that DSE provided incremental value over clinical characteristics and stress test parameters for prediction of mortality and cardiac events. Survival analysis showed that DSE provided optimal risk stratification up to 7 years after initial testing; after that period, the risk of adverse outcome increased comparably in both normal and abnormal DSE patients.

Conclusions

DSE provided restricted predictive value of adverse outcome in patients with diabetes who were unable to perform an adequate exercise stress test. DSE provided optimal risk stratification up to 7 years after initial testing. Repeated DSE at that time might add to its prognostic value.

### Dobutamine stress echocardiography ischemia as a predictor of the placebo-controlled efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention in stable coronary artery disease: the stress echocardiography-stratified analysis of ORBITA [^116xK6ai]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Prerandomization stress echocardiography scores were available for 183 patients (98 PCI and 85 placebo) of the 200 patients randomly assigned in ORBITA. Of the remaining 17 patients, 1 had poor-quality echocardiographic imaging windows, 6 had a previous adverse reaction to dobutamine (5 minor but limiting reactions, 1 severe life-threatening reaction), 6 had a clinical contraindication to dobutamine administration, and in 4 there were logistical reasons as to why the test was not performed.

Patient Demographics

Table 1 shows the patient demographic data. The majority of patients had normal left ventricular systolic function (94.9% in the PCI arm and 90.6% in the placebo arm). Median angina duration was 5 months in the PCI arm (interquartile range, 4–10) and 6 months in the placebo arm (interquartile range, 4–9).

### Prognostic significance of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during dobutamine stress echocardiography [^1118fpbj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) is a well-recognized side effect during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). This study sought to evaluate the prognostic implications of NSVT during DSE on 1,266 consecutive dobutamine stress echocardiograms performed over 1 year. NSVT, defined as ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular premature beats, occurred in 65 of 1,266 patients (5.1%). There was no absolute increased risk in all-cause mortality between the NSVT and no NSVT groups (22% vs 17%, p = 0.15) during the 3-year follow-up. Survival curves generated by the Kaplan-Meier method also demonstrated no increased risk in mortality between the NSVT and no NSVT groups (p = 0.43). When only studies with negative results for inducible ischemia were taken into account, survival curves showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (p = 0.26). Studies with negative results for inducible ischemia were also stratified according to the ejection fraction (EF). Patients without inducible ischemia and mildly reduced to normal EFs (> 0.45) did not have significant differences in survival between the NSVT and no NSVT groups over the 3-year follow-up (p = 0.86). However, patients without inducible ischemia and moderately reduced EFs (0.35 to 0.45) who had NSVT during DSE had significantly reduced survival over the follow-up (p = 0.01).

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^112dkv7V]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress haemodynamics — systemic, LV, and contractile effects: Dobutamine increases determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption with heart rate "two‑ to three‑fold", end‑diastolic volume "1.2‑fold", and systolic arterial pressure "1.5‑ to 2.0‑fold". Myocardial contractility "increases over four‑fold in normal subjects and much less (so less than two‑fold) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy". β‑2 receptor activation contributes to "the mild decrease in blood pressure common at higher dobutamine dose". During infusion, left ventricle (LV) end‑systolic volume decreases more than LV end‑diastolic volume while cardiac output rises, and "LV volumes and wall stress increase less with dobutamine" than with exercise.

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^111oSRay]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were reported as mean ± SD and compared with Student t test. Categorical variables were summarized as percentages; the χ 2 test was used to compare groups. Cumulative survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons between groups based on the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to examine the additional value of DSE with the end points of interest at 7, 8, and 15 years after the test. Variables were selected in a stepwise forward selection manner with entry and retention set at a significance level of 0.05. The incremental value of DSE information over clinical data was assessed in two modeling steps. First, clinical data only were selected to fit a multivariable model. These clinical data were then used as baseline risk factors, and DSE variables were added in a stepwise forward selection manner. The incremental value was determined by comparing the log likelihood χ 2 values of both prediction models.

The presence of a right bundle branch block (RBBB) is associated with increased mortality.

### Dobutamine stress echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography for risk stratification in medically treated unstable angina [^115Hari7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2000). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Previous reports have demonstrated the superiority of exercise echocardiography over exercise electro-cardiography (ex-ECG) for risk stratification in patients with medically stabilized unstable angina (UA). We sought to analyze the prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) compared with ex-ECG for risk stratification in patients with UA.

Methods

Ninety-two patients with medically treated UA were studied (mean age 65 ± 11 years, 24 women, 42% of patients had electrocardiographic abnormalities on admission). Dobutamine stress echocardiography and treadmill ex-ECG were performed on the third day after hospital admission. End points were recurrent UA, myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac death.

Results

Mean follow-up was 24 ± 7 months. During follow-up, 22 patients had cardiac events (18 recurrent UA, 2 MI, 2 cardiac deaths). The event-free survival rate was 80% for patients with negative DSE results for ischemia and 52% for those with positive DSE results (log rank 9.57; p = 0.002), compared with an event-free survival rate of 79% for patients with negative ex-ECG results and 66% for those with positive ex-ECG results (log rank 2.06; P = not significant). Left ventricular dysfunction (P = 0.01) and a positive dobutamine stress echocardiogram (P = 0.03), but not a positive exercise electrocardiogram, were independent predictors of cardiac events during follow-up.

Conclusions

Dobutamine stress echocardiography performed early in medically treated patients with UA predicts cardiac events during follow-up more accurately and with more specificity than ex-ECG does in this population.

### Long-term prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in diabetic patients with limited exercise capability: a 13-year follow-up study [^113huRxQ]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Chaowalit et al. verified the prognostic significance of DSE in predicting mortality and cardiovascular morbidity during a mean period of 5.4 years in a large cohort (N = 2,349) of patients with diabetes in 2006. In multivariate analyses, age, failure to achieve target heart rate, and the percentage of ischemic segments were important predictors of both mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (nonfatal MI and late revascularization). Innocenti et al. assessed the prognostic role of clinical, rest, and stress echocardiographic data in a group of 322 diabetic patients with known or suspected CAD during a mean follow-up duration of 3.3 years. This study shows that presence of viability and severe ischemia during DSE was independently associated with higher occurrence of hard cardiac events.

The current study has limitations. The long-term prognostic value of the test is based on a population referred to DSE for clinical indications. Because of the clinical factors leading patients to be referred for DSE at the time of initial testing, they are likely to have had increased risk. This may limit application of the present findings to patients with diabetes in general. The results may not be necessarily applicable to patients with diabetes and without clinical indication for DSE. Therefore, the use of DSE for risk stratification of all patients with diabetes cannot be recommended.

Exercise or pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging has been recommended by the American Heart Association for evaluation of ischemic heart disease in diabetic patients. However, DSE has the advantages of wider availability and lower cost, and it avoids radiation exposure to the patient. Appropriateness criteria have been developed to provide an estimate of the reasonableness of the use of DSE for several clinical scenarios. A detailed description of appropriate indications of DSE has been published recently, including detection of CAD/risk assessment in selected asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, preoperative evaluation before noncardiac surgery, risk assessment after acute coronary syndrome/postrevascularization, assessment of viability/ischemia, and stress study for hemodynamics.

In conclusion, in this study with a mean follow-up of 13 ± 3.2 years, DSE provided restricted predictive value of adverse outcome in patients with diabetes who were unable to perform an adequate exercise stress test. The value of the test seems optimal till ∼7 years after initial DSE. Repeating the test at that time might add to its diagnostic value.

### Improving prediction of outcomes in African Americans with normal stress echocardiograms using a risk scoring system [^113gUcdt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular mortality is high in African Americans, and those with normal results on stress echocardiography remain at increased risk. The aim of this study was to develop a risk scoring system to improve the prediction of cardiovascular events in African Americans with normal results on stress echocardiography. Clinical data and rest echocardiographic measurements were obtained in 548 consecutive African Americans with normal results on rest and stress echocardiography and ejection fractions ≥ 50%. Patients were followed for myocardial infarction and death for 3 years. Predictors of cardiovascular events were determined with Cox regression, and hazard ratios were used to determine the number of points in the risk score attributed to each independent predictor. During follow-up of 3 years, 47 patients (8.6%) had events. Five variables-age (≥ 45 years in men, ≥ 55 years in women), history of coronary disease, history of smoking, left ventricular hypertrophy, and exercise intolerance (< 7 METs in men, < 5 METs in women, or need for dobutamine stress)-were independent predictors of events. A risk score was derived for each patient (ranging from 0 to 8 risk points). The area under the curve for the risk score was 0.82 with the optimum cut-off risk score of 6. Among patients with risk scores ≥ 6, 30% had events, compared with 3% with risk score < 6 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, African Americans with normal results on stress echocardiography remain at significant risk for cardiovascular events. A risk score can be derived from clinical and echocardiographic variables, which can accurately distinguish high- and low-risk patients.

### Impact of anemia on exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography [^113iCs7A]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The safety and diagnostic accuracy of stress testing in anemic patients have not been well studied. Despite a lack of data, significant anemia may be considered a relative contraindication to stress testing because of safety concerns related to insufficient myocardial oxygen supply.

Methods

The authors reviewed 28,829 consecutive patients with blood hemoglobin drawn within 48 hours of stress echocardiography (15,624 exercise and 13,205 dobutamine). The associations of blood hemoglobin concentration with arrhythmia and other stress echocardiographic findings were examined. Additionally, the effect of anemia on the positive predictive value of stress echocardiography for the detection of significant coronary artery stenosis (≥ 50%) was assessed in patients who subsequently underwent coronary angiography.

Results

Anemia was present in 6,401 patients (22.2%) and was severe (hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL) in 52. Stress testing with either exercise or dobutamine was safe, with no significant increase in serious arrhythmia events or need for hospitalization. In the exercise cohort, worsening anemia was associated with reduced treadmill exercise time, lower peak heart rate, peak rate-pressure product, and achieved workload. In the dobutamine stress cohort, worsening anemia was associated with higher resting heart rate, more use of atropine, and fewer patients attaining target heart rate. The positive predictive value of stress echocardiography was higher in patients with moderate anemia compared with those without anemia (71.8% vs 60.2%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that stress testing is safe in patients with mild and moderately anemia, albeit with a small increase in mild supraventricular arrhythmias with exercise. However, worsening anemia was associated with a significant reduction in exercise capacity. Additionally, worsening anemia was associated with an improvement in the positive predictive value of stress echocardiography. Extrapolation of these data to patients with severe anemia should be performed with caution given the limited number of patients with severe anemia in this study.

### Differential effects of dobutamine versus treadmill exercise on left ventricular volume and wall stress [^1179svj7]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dobutamine and exercise echocardiography are well-validated modalities used for the evaluation of patients with suspected myocardial ischemia. Patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), however, experience less angina, ST-segment depressions, and wall motion abnormalities. Other than the effect on heart rate, the physiologic and volumetric differences between pharmacologic and exercise-induced stress that affect myocardial oxygen demand are not well defined. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that in the absence of ischemia, dobutamine reduces left ventricular (LV) volume, wall tension (WTN), and peak systolic stress (PSS) compared with exercise.

Methods

Seventy patients without ischemia were prospectively enrolled (35 underwent exercise echocardiography and 35 DSE), and various hemodynamic parameters were measured and LV volumes calculated (using the Simpson and Teichholz formulas). Systolic WTN and PSS were determined at rest and stress.

Results

LV end-diastolic volume index fell significantly more with dobutamine than with exercise (-34% vs -9%, P < .0001), as did mean end-systolic volume index (-55% vs -37%, P = 0.07). Systolic blood pressure increased more with exercise (41 ± 22 vs 1 ± 33 mm Hg, P < .0001), as did cardiac index (2.5 ± 0.7 vs 1.0 ± 0.8 L/min/m(2), P < .0001). Systolic WTN increased with exercise by 24% (P < .0001) but decreased with dobutamine by 18% (P < .0001). PSS increased with exercise by 21% (P < .0001) but decreased with dobutamine by 23% (P < .0001).

Conclusions

The degree of stress achieved with DSE appears to be considerably different than with exercise. DSE produces greater reductions in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes than exercise and decreases rather than increases in WTN and PSS. The lower WTN and PSS were related to both a decrease in LV volume and lower systolic blood pressure with dobutamine. These observations support recommendations favoring exercise stress testing in patients able to exercise and reinforce the notion that high-risk echocardiographic features of ischemia such as stress-induced LV dilatation may be less striking or absent with DSE.

Results

Patient Demographics and Stress Test Results

The clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the 301 patients was 59 ± 12 years, and 56% were men. A total of 149 patients (50%) had a previous MI. During the dobutamine-atropine stress test, heart rate increased from a mean (± SD) of 69 ± 13 beats per minute to 136 ± 17 beats per minute (P < .0001), and systolic blood pressure increased from 136 ± 23 mm Hg to 147 ± 30 mm Hg (P < .001). Atropine, which was added in 129 patients (43%), was more frequently administered in patients taking beta-blockers (67% (84/125]) than in those who were not (26% (45/176], P < .0001). Side effects during stress testing included non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 13 patients (4%), atrial fibrillation in 4 patients (1%), severe hypotension in 2 patients (0.7%), nausea in 15 patients (5%), and headache in 15 patients (5%). No patient experienced a MI or fatal complication. The test was terminated because of side effects in 17 patients (6%).

Abnormal DSE was detected in 182 (60%) patients, whereas 198 (66%) patients had an abnormal MPI. The agreement between DSE and MPI was 82% (κ = 0.62). When considered the 152 patients without previous MI the agreement between DSE and MPI was 81% (κ = 0.60). The agreement between DSE and MPI was 86% (κ = 0.36) when only ischemia was considered. Normal DSE and abnormal MPI were observed in 35 patients, whereas 19 patients had a normal MPI and an abnormal DSE. During a median follow-up of 14 years (range 5–18), 172 deaths (57%) occurred, of which 72 (24%) were due to cardiac causes. Nonfatal MI occurred in 46 patients (15%).

### Prognostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with diabetes [^114Sz9tH]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the incremental value of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for the risk stratification of diabetic patients who are unable to perform an adequate exercise stress test. Exercise capacity is frequently impaired in patients with diabetes. The role of pharmacologic stress echocardiography in the risk stratification of diabetic patients has not been well defined.

Research Design and Methods

We studied 396 diabetic patients (mean age 61 ± 11 years, 252 men [64%]) with limited exercise capacity who underwent DSE for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). End points were hard cardiac events (cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) and all causes of mortality.

Results

During a median follow-up of 3 years, 97 patients (24%) died (55 cardiac deaths), and 27 patients had nonfatal myocardial infarction. In an incremental multivariate analysis model, clinical predictors of hard cardiac events were history of congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, hypercholesterolemia, and ejection fraction at rest. The percentage of ischemic segments was incremental to the clinical model in the prediction of hard cardiac events (chi(2) = 37 vs. 18, P < 0.05). Clinical predictors of all causes of mortality were history of congestive heart failure, age, hypercholesterolemia, and ejection fraction at rest. Wall motion score index at peak stress was incremental to the clinical model in the prediction of mortality (chi(2) = 52 vs. 43, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

DSE provides incremental data for the prediction of mortality and hard cardiac events in patients with diabetes who are unable to perform an adequate exercise stress test.

### Exercise-electrocardiography and / or pharmacological stress echocardiography for non-invasive risk stratification early after uncomplicated myocardial infarction. A prospective international large scale multicentre study [^114dgs4B]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of the present study was to assess the relative prognostic value of clinical variables, the exercise electrocardiography test and the pharmacological stress echocardiography test either with dipyridamole or dobutamine early after a first uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction in a large, multicentre, prospective study.

Methods and Results

Seven hundred and fifty-nine in-hospital patients (age = 56 ± 10 years) with a recent and first clinical uncomplicated myocardial infarction, with baseline echocardiographic findings of satisfactory quality, an interpretable ECG and able to exercise underwent a resting 2D echocardiogram, a pharmacological stress test with either dipyridamole or dobutamine and an exercise electrocardiography test at a mean of 10 days from the infarction; they were followed-up for a median of 10 months. During the follow-up, there were 13 deaths, 23 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 59 re-hospitalizations for unstable angina. When all spontaneous events were considered, with multivariate analysis, the difference between the wall motion score index at rest and peak stress (delta wall motion score index), and exercise duration were independent predictors of future spontaneous events (relative risk 7.2; 95% CI = 2.73–19.1; P = 0.000; relative risk 1.1, 95% CI = 1.02–1.18; P = 0.008, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a better outcome for those patients with a negative pharmacological stress echocardiography test compared to patients with low dose positivity (94.7 vs 74.8%, P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Stress echocardiography tests provide stronger information than historical and exercise electrocardiography test variables. Pharmacological echocardiography as well as the exercise ECG is able to predict all spontaneously occurring events when the presence as well as the timing, severity, and extension of stress-induced wall motion abnormalities are considered.

### Ventricular fibrillation in late recovery after dobutamine stress echocardiography [^1174Nfeu]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man with multiple cardiac risk factors, including diabetes mellitus type II, treated hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, had a dobutamine stress echocardiogram performed as part of a preoperative evaluation. At peak stress the patient developed an apical regional wall motion abnormality. Approximately 12 minutes into the recovery period, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated and underwent emergency coronary angiography that showed a 95% distal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis.

### Dobutamine stress echocardiography after positive CCTA: diagnostic performance using fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio as reference standards [^116b8DwF]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive diagnostics have the potential to reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, thereby lowering the risk of procedural complications and exposure to potentially harmful radiation during invasive procedures. The median effective radiation dose during ICA in our study was 5.0 mSv (conversion coefficient = 0.002) for patients who underwent PCI and 2.7 mSv for those who had diagnostic angiography with intracoronary pressure measurements alone. These doses are low compared with recently published data. Similarly, CCTA had a median effective radiation dose of 2.2 mSv (conversion factor = 0.014) and 4.1 mSv (conversion factor = 0.026) which are also low compared with other studies.

In our study, two patients experienced procedural complications related to ICA and pressure measurements. One patient experienced adduction paresis and diplopia during the procedure, with an MRI revealing a small brain stem infarction. In another patient, transient third-degree AV block occurred during adenosine infusion. These incidents underline the low, but inherent risks associated with invasive procedures and the advantage of iFR as an adenosine-free alternative for intracoronary pressure measurement.

Three patients experienced procedural complications during DSE. At peak dobutamine infusion (40 µg/kg/min), one patient experienced transient hypotension and chest pain. This episode was clinically assessed as a possible vagal episode, however, echocardiography indicated ischaemia, later confirmed during the blinded review. Another patient developed chest pain and inferior ST elevations during DSE. Echocardiography revealed ischaemia, also confirmed during the blinded review. The ECG normalised immediately after the dobutamine infusion was stopped, symptoms regressed and troponins were mildly elevated. Recent studies have shown a higher incidence of high-sensitive troponin elevations following stress echocardiography, particularly after DSE, in both patients with positive and negative tests. The clinical significance of such troponin rises remains not well defined and may primarily reflect the physiological effects of dobutamine and the temporary cardiac stress during stress echocardiography, rather than indicating more significant cardiac events. In the third patient, DSE was terminated prematurely due to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which resolved when dobutamine infusion was stopped and intravenous beta-blocker was administered. SVT has a reported incidence of 1.3% during DSE, consistent with our study.

### Guidelines for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography in ischemic heart disease: from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113DCrvR]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Table 12 — Recommendations for stress echocardiography in patients with symptoms or suspected stable coronary artery disease — non-invasive testing for ischemic heart disease (IHD) states that in suspected stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with intermediate pretest probability and preserved ejection fraction, stress imaging, such as stress echocardiography, is preferred as the initial test option; in patients without typical angina, an imaging stress test is recommended as the initial test for diagnosing stable CAD if the pretest probability is high or if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is reduced; with resting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that prevent accurate interpretation of ECG changes during stress, an imaging stress test is recommended; with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and symptoms consistent with IHD, stress echocardiography (either exercise stress echocardiography [ESE] or dobutamine stress echocardiography [DSE]) is preferred over SPECT imaging because of greater specificity and versatility for detecting other cardiac conditions associated with LBBB; for women with an indication for a noninvasive imaging test for known or suspected CAD, stress echocardiography is the preferred test because of safety and greater specificity; for children with suspected IHD, ESE is the preferred imaging stress test because of the absence of radiation, the absence of need for an intravenous line, and the assessment of exercise capacity; a pharmacologic stress test such as DSE is recommended when patients who meet these indications are unable to exercise; in exertional dyspnea of uncertain etiology, stress echocardiography is the preferred test and tricuspid regurgitation velocity and diastolic function should be assessed at rest and with stress; an imaging stress test should be considered in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and new cardiac symptoms; and an imaging stress test should be considered to assess the functional severity of intermediate lesions on coronary arteriography.

### Safety, feasibility, and prognostic implications of pharmacologic stress echocardiography in 1482 patients evaluated in an ambulatory setting [^111tYoSN]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The outpatient prognostic assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) by exercise electrocardiography has limitations, including the feasibility of the test and its low positive predictive value in several clinical conditions. In the current study we investigated the safety, feasibility, and prognostic value of pharmacologic stress echocardiography in a large cohort of ambulatory patients.

Methods

The study group was made of 1482 ambulatory patients (969 men, aged 60 ± 10 years) who underwent stress echocardiography with either dipyridamole (n = 846) or dobutamine (n = 636) for evaluation of suspected or known stable CAD. The pretest likelihood of CAD was intermediate (< 70%) in 709 patients and high (≥ 70%) in 773 patients.

Results

There was no complication during the dipyridamole test, whereas 2 ischemia-dependent, sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred during the dobutamine test. Limiting side effects were observed in 2% of dipyridamole and in 3% of dobutamine stresses. The echocardiogram was positive in 459 patients. During a mean follow-up of 28 ± 24 months, 58 patients died, 33 had a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 158 underwent early (≤ 3 months) and 64 late (> 3 months) revascularization. Multivariate predictors of hard events (death, infarction) were positive echocardiographic results (hazard ratio [HR] 2.9) and resting wall motion score index (WMSI) (HR 2.3). In considering major events (death, infarction, late revascularization) as end points, positive echocardiographic result (HR 4.3), scar (HR 2.2), and resting WMSI (HR 1.7) were independent prognostic predictors. The 5-year survival rates for the ischemic and nonischemic groups were, respectively, 80% and 91% (HR 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8–8.4; P < .0001) considering hard cardiac events and 65% and 88% (HR 2.6, 95% CI 2.1–5.9; P < .0001) considering major events. Multivariate predictors of major events were positive echocardiographic results (HR 8.2) and male sex (HR 2.5) for the intermediate-risk group and positive echocardiographic results (HR 2.9), resting WMSI (HR 1.8), and prior Q-wave myocardial infarction (HR 1.8) for the high-risk group.

Conclusions

Pharmacologic stress echocardiography is safe, highly feasible, and effective in prognostic assessment of ambulatory patients when both a general population and groups selected on the basis of pretest likelihood of CAD are analyzed. It represents a valid complementary tool to exercise electrocardiography for prognostic purposes in outpatients.

### Predictive value of dobutamine stress perfusion echocardiography in contemporary end-stage liver disease [^1158uww8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Despite these developments, there are still no class 1 indications of how to appropriately evaluate cardiovascular risk in the patient with advanced liver disease. 6 Unlike current radionuclide imaging techniques, myocardial contrast intensity during a continuous infusion of commercially available microbubbles is able to simultaneously examine regional WM and microvascular capillary blood flow at rest and during demand stress. 17, 18 In this context, dobutamine stress perfusion echocardiography (DSPE) has been shown to improve the detection of epicardial disease and to identify patients with abnormal microvascular reserve. 17 Because the use of contrast also improves Doppler signal detection and endocardial border delineation, 19 it can also be utilized to detect other subtle cardiac abnormalities that may be associated with increased risk, such an abnormal diastolic dysfunction or slight variations in left ventricular systolic function, that may predict outcome. Previous studies in an earlier era of LT suggested that MVP abnormalities detected with DSPE may identify those at risk for cardiac complications, but nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients were not evaluated, event rates were low, and the effects of ejection fraction and diastolic function were not simultaneously assessed. 18 The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic importance of DSPE in adult patients undergoing isolated LT for predicting both cardiovascular and overall clinical outcomes in the current era.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — stress echocardiography contraindications include limited imaging windows, acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias or pulmonary disease, and severe hypertension; when pharmacologic stress is needed, agent-specific limits apply. Listed items include "Limited acoustic windows (eg, in COPD patients)", "High-risk unstable angina, active ACS or AMI (< 2 d)", "Contraindications to dobutamine (if pharmacologic stress test needed)", and "Severe systemic arterial hypertension (eg, ≥ 200/110 mm Hg)". Contrast-agent restrictions are noted under "Use of Contrast: Contraindicated in:" including "Hypersensitivity to perflutren" and "Hypersensitivity to blood, blood products, or albumin (for Optison only)". A related footnote states, "Low-dose dobutamine may be useful for assessing for low-gradient AS".

### Intraparenchymal haemorrhage and uncal herniation resulting from dobutamine stress echocardiography [^1129RVHv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) resulting from dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a rare complication in an otherwise relatively safe procedure. There has been one previously reported case of ICH associated with DSE in a patient who was fully anticoagulated. The authors report a second case of ICH associated with DSE leading to a poor outcome. Unlike the previous report, this patient was not fully anticoagulated and bleeding resulted from uncontrolled hypertension. Clinicians should be attentive to the risk of ICH associated with DSE in the setting of uncontrolled hypertension.

### The clinical use of stress echocardiography in non-ischaemic heart disease: recommendations from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^114fx18p]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Stress echocardiography modality selection — exercise vs pharmacologic: Exercise is stated as preferred, and patients able to exercise "should be tested with an exercise modality"; exercise echocardiography can use treadmill or bicycle, with semi‑supine bicycle technically easier for peak‑stress imaging. Pharmacologic stress "does not replicate the complex haemodynamic and neurohumoral changes triggered by exercise"; "Dobutamine is the preferred alternative modality for the evaluation of contractile and flow reserve", while "Vasodilator SE is especially convenient for combined assessment of wall motion and coronary flow reserve", including indications in dilated non‑ischaemic cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Flexible use of all three stressors allows tailoring to the individual patient and avoids specific contraindications.

### Relation of dyspnea in patients unable to perform exercise stress testing to outcome and myocardial ischemia [^1165xxVV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Limited information exists regarding the significance of dyspnea in patients who are unable to exercise and the contribution of myocardial ischemia to this symptom. To assess this, we evaluated results of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and long-term outcome of patients with dyspnea referred for DSE. We studied 6,376 consecutive patients who were unable to perform an exercise test and were referred for DSE. Patients were classified according to presenting symptoms and followed for 5.5 ± 2.8 years. End points were cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction or revascularization), hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and death. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram was positive for ischemia in 19% of patients with dyspnea versus 24% (p = 0.002) of those with typical angina and 17% (p = 0.2) of asymptomatic patients. In multivariate analysis, risk of death was increased in dyspneic patients versus asymptomatic patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, p = 0.02) and patients with chest pain (HR 1.20, p < 0.001). Hospitalization for HF occurred more often in patients with dyspnea (HR 1.26, p = 0.05 vs asymptomatic; HR 1.24, p = 0.06 vs chest pain), especially in the subset without previous HF (HR 1.45, p = 0.006 vs chest pain). Risk of cardiac ischemic events in patients with dyspnea was similar versus asymptomatic patients (HR 0.92, p = 0.39) and decreased versus patients with chest pain (HR 0.70, p < 0.001). In conclusion, in patients referred for DSE, dyspnea was associated with a poor outcome. This increased hazard seems not to be linked to myocardial ischemia, but instead to HF and death.

### The predictive value of dobutamine echo-stress in the clinical… [^116EYG2h]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The goal of this observational cohort study, which is both retrospective and prospective, is to evaluate the long-term clinical and instrumental response to Cardiac Contractility Modulation treatment in adult subjects suffering from symptomatic heart failure due to systolic left ventricular dysfunction, despite adequate medical therapy. Based on the response to stress echocardiography with preimplantation low-dose Dobutamine, the main questions it aims to answer are: Then, searching for indicators that maximize the benefit/risk ratio is appropriate. According to the study's proponents, the contractile reserve of the left ventricle assessed by stress echo to low-dose Dobutamine may be among the most promising indicators for this purpose. Introduction Heart failure has a very poor prognosis in terms of mortality, quality of life, and functional capacity.

It is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases in terms of global prevalence and healthcare costs. Despite appropriate medical care, many patients experience frequent hospitalizations and limitations in daily activities. Pharmacological stress echocardiography Pharmacological stress echocardiography is indicated for the diagnosis and treatment of suspected ischemic heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction of suspected ischemic origin. The examination consists of performing an echocardiogram during the infusion of increasing drug doses that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, stimulating the heart with an effect similar to physical exertion. The heart reacts with increased contraction force and frequency; sometimes, blood pressure can also increase. The examination helps to recognize the possible presence of stress-induced myocardial ischemia.

The protocol for standard dobutamine examination was defined in the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines of 2007. A graduated dobutamine infusion is usually administered at a 5 μg/kg starting dose per minute. The dobutamine infusion aims to achieve a heart rate of 85% of the maximum heart rate predicted for the person's age. The dose of Dobutamine is increased every 3–5 minutes to 10, 20, 30, and finally to 40 μg/kg per minute. On the other hand, the "low-dose" dobutamine stress echocardiography test is optimal for detecting ischemia and assessing viability by searching for the "biphasic response. " A myocardial area increases its contraction at a low dose of inotropic but later becomes hypokinetic or akinetic at higher doses of dobutamine.

### Evaluating noninvasive testing for chest pain in women… [^113PWAyf]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Most studies evaluating noninvasive testing for potential coronary artery disease have been performed on men. Recent studies have found that these noninvasive tests have poorer specificity in women. This may lead to a delay in establishing the diagnosis of CAD in women, which may influence their treatment and prognosis. Lewis and associates evaluated the dobutamine stress echocardiogram in women who present with chest pain and are at risk for CAD. Women who presented with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia were considered for the study. To be enrolled, the women also had to show clear indications for coronary angiography. After initial evaluation, a dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed following an established protocol. Blinded persons performed wall-motion analysis of 16 myocardial segments, and a score was assigned to each patient. Coronary angiography was then performed on all the patients.

Ninety-two women were enrolled in the study, the majority of whom presented with chest pains. Sixty-seven percent of the patients reached their target heart rate during the stress test. Sixteen percent of the tests were stopped because the patients developed anginal chest pains. The dobutamine stress echocardiogram was normal in 54 of 67 patients with no significant CAD, for a specificity of 80. 6 percent. Fourteen patients had wall-motion abnormalities during the tests. The highest coronary angiography severity scores were present in women with abnormal dobutamine stress echocardiograms. In this study, only 27 percent of the women with known CAD risk factors and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia had significant heart disease. The dobutamine stress echocardiogram was successful in identifying women with multivessel CAD but was not as successful in women with single-vessel disease.

The authors conclude that a dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a reliable test in women with multivessel disease presenting with chest pain. However, the authors also point out that this test is usually negative in women who present with chest pain and no coronary stenosis. editor's note: When dealing with chest pain in female patients, physicians are faced with the challenge of how best to evaluate them. Most investigations of cardiovascular disease have focused on male patients. This report gives some of the first information provided from the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation study. The information points out that the dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a good diagnostic tool in women with chest pain.
