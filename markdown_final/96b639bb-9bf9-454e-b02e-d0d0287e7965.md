## Question

Effusive constrictive pericarditis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about effusive-constrictive pericarditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining effusive-constrictive pericarditis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and etiologies. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and hemodynamic hallmarks. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including invasive and noninvasive criteria and imaging. Then, I will examine medical versus surgical management, including special populations like TB and COVID-19. Finally, I should consider prognosis, follow-up, and a practical decision algorithm, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from the literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is best understood as persistent constrictive physiology after drainage of a pericardial effusion, classically due to visceral pericardial inflammation and noncompliance superimposed on tamponade physiology, producing both external fluid compression and intrinsic pericardial restraint of filling, with dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures and enhanced ventricular interdependence [^113sL3dr] [^113L5T9M] [^111ojq2s]. Wait, let me verify the invasive diagnostic criterion: failure of right atrial pressure to fall by at least 50% or below 10 mmHg after pericardiocentesis remains a pragmatic hemodynamic marker, even as noninvasive imaging increasingly detects this entity earlier in practice [^115eniVF] [^113sL3dr].

> I need to check the epidemiology and etiologies next. Prevalence estimates vary by cohort and diagnostic method, with ECP comprising roughly 1.3% of pericarditis presentations and about 6.9% of tamponade cases in prospective series, while surgical cohorts of constrictive pericarditis may include up to a quarter with effusive-constrictive physiology, underscoring selection bias [^113xnFWe]. Hold on, I should verify etiologies: most cases in developed settings are idiopathic or viral, but radiation, malignancy, post-surgical states, and infection are important causes; tuberculosis dominates in endemic regions and carries a higher risk of constriction, and COVID-19 has emerged as a recognized precipitant in case series and reports [^115eniVF] [^113SGDJm] [^1119EvFj] [^114yEn2o].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation. Patients often present with tamponade physiology — hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and distant heart sounds — with additional features of constriction such as Kussmaul's sign, peripheral edema, ascites, and hepatomegaly; symptoms include dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, and abdominal fullness, and importantly, symptoms frequently persist despite successful pericardiocentesis when the visceral pericardium remains inflamed and noncompliant [^1153YMBy] [^114Z7oAp] [^113sL3dr]. Let me consider the hemodynamic signature again: after drainage, right atrial and ventricular end-diastolic pressures remain elevated with a dip-plateau pattern, reflecting ongoing constriction rather than pure tamponade physiology [^11515kVC].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with noninvasive imaging. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to assess effusion, tamponade, and constrictive features such as septal bounce, respirophasic ventricular interdependence, and medial mitral annular e′ velocities, while recognizing that pericardial thickness can be normal in a meaningful minority of true constriction cases [^113sL3dr] [^113qr3SP] [^112DLFfo]. Hold on, I should verify the role of CMR: CMR adds decisive value by detecting pericardial edema on T2-STIR and late gadolinium enhancement indicating active inflammation, helping distinguish transient inflammatory constriction from chronic fibrosis and guiding whether to pursue aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy versus surgery [^113sL3dr] [^112tBdoA]. CT complements by identifying calcification and aiding preoperative planning, and invasive hemodynamics remain the gold standard when noninvasive tests are inconclusive or to confirm the failure of RA pressure to normalize post-drainage [^112GQFwE] [^115eniVF].

> Let me think about medical management and where it fits. If there is active inflammation on CMR or clinical-biomarker evidence, an extended course of NSAIDs plus colchicine for at least 3 months with a slow taper, and consideration of corticosteroids or IL-1 blockade in refractory cases, is recommended, with close surveillance of symptoms, CRP, and imaging at 3 to 6 months to document resolution of constriction before committing to surgery [^112X4PJf] [^113sL3dr]. Wait, I should double-check the mechanism: in transient inflammatory constriction, reversing pericardial inflammation can restore compliance and obviate pericardiectomy, which is why timing and mechanism assessment are pivotal [^113sL3dr] [^117C1UV5].

> Now, I should review surgical management and indications. Radical pericardiectomy is the definitive therapy for persistent constriction, ideally performed after inflammation has been treated medically to reduce operative risk and adhesion burden; partial or anterior-only resections are discouraged given inferior outcomes, and surgery should be centralized at experienced centers [^112GQFwE] [^117C1UV5]. I need to ensure I align with guideline thresholds: ESC recommends pericardiectomy for permanent constriction or failure of medical therapy after 3 to 6 months, and large surgical series show durable symptom improvement in the majority, albeit with nontrivial early morbidity and mortality in high-risk cohorts [^116UW6iU] [^116EP7yM].

> But wait, what about special populations and nuances. In TB-endemic settings, empiric antituberculous therapy is recommended for exudative effusions after excluding other causes, with adjunctive steroids considered in effusive-constrictive disease; pericardiectomy is indicated if there is no improvement or deterioration after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy, acknowledging that TB-related constriction can be transient and reversible with treatment [^11414Qro] [^112YLvAU] [^117Y3ViW] [^117C1UV5]. For COVID-19–associated ECP, case series describe rapid evolution to constriction; management follows the same principles, with anti-inflammatory therapy and timely pericardiectomy when inflammation fails to resolve, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for cardiovascular complications during and after acute infection [^1119EvFj].

> I should confirm the prognosis and follow-up strategy. Idiopathic cases may resolve spontaneously or with anti-inflammatory therapy, whereas TB, radiation, and postsurgical etiologies carry higher risks of persistent constriction; long-term outcomes after pericardiectomy are generally favorable in experienced hands, though recurrence of symptoms can occur if inflammation is ongoing or resection is incomplete [^11515kVC] [^116EP7yM]. Hold on, I should verify surveillance: regular clinical review, CRP, and echocardiography at 3 to 6 months are advised to document resolution of inflammatory constriction and to detect progression early if it occurs [^112X4PJf].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a practical decision pathway. Suspect ECP when tamponade physiology persists after pericardiocentesis or when RA pressure fails to normalize; confirm with echocardiography and CMR for inflammation, and use catheterization if noninvasive tests are equivocal; treat active inflammation aggressively for 3 to 6 months and reserve radical pericardiectomy for refractory or chronic constriction, coordinating care at a pericardial diseases center when available [^113sL3dr] [^112GQFwE] [^111CMZ2N]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought pericardial thickening on CT greater than 3 mm alone would clinch the diagnosis, but I should correct that: thickening supports constriction yet diagnosis requires demonstration of constrictive physiology, and pericardium can be normal in thickness in a substantial fraction of true constriction cases, so imaging must be integrated with hemodynamics and clinical context [^112DLFfo] [^113sL3dr].

> In summary, effusive-constrictive pericarditis reflects the superposition of effusive tamponade and visceral pericardial constriction; accurate recognition hinges on multimodality imaging to detect inflammation and on hemodynamic confirmation when needed, medical therapy targets reversible inflammatory constriction, and radical pericardiectomy is reserved for persistent disease, with etiology-specific nuances in TB and COVID-19 shaping management and prognosis [^113sL3dr] [^112GQFwE] [^11515kVC].

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP) is defined by **persistent constrictive physiology after pericardiocentesis** [^113sL3dr], with a **prevalence of 1.3–6.9%** in tamponade cohorts [^113xnFWe] [^11515kVC]. It presents with tamponade plus constriction: elevated JVP, edema, and dyspnea that persist after drainage, reflecting visceral pericardial inflammation/fibrosis [^113xnFWe] [^113sL3dr]. Diagnosis relies on echocardiography showing septal bounce, respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid inflow, and a non-collapsing IVC; CMR/CT assess inflammation, thickness, and calcification [^114yEn2o] [^112tBdoA]. Hemodynamically, RA pressure fails to drop > 50% or below 10 mmHg post-drainage, with dip-plateau waveforms [^11515kVC]. Management is **anti-inflammatory therapy for inflammatory ECP** [^113cgJZn]; **radical pericardiectomy for chronic or refractory cases** [^11536Ysu]. Prognosis depends on etiology and timeliness: idiopathic cases may resolve, whereas TB, radiation, or postsurgical ECP often progress without surgery [^11515kVC] [^113SGDJm].

---

## Pathophysiology

ECP arises from **two concurrent processes**: a tense effusion causing tamponade and visceral pericardial inflammation/fibrosis causing constriction [^11515kVC]. The effusion raises intrapericardial pressure, compressing chambers and reducing output [^1153YMBy]; the rigid visceral pericardium further restricts filling, producing a mixed tamponade–constriction physiology [^11515kVC]. This dual mechanism explains why symptoms persist after drainage until the constrictive layer is addressed [^117BtUpE].

---

## Etiology

ECP is **idiopathic in ~50%** of cases; known causes include:

- **Infectious**: TB (common in endemic areas), viral (including COVID-19) [^113sL3dr] [^1119EvFj].
- **Inflammatory**: autoimmune (e.g. sarcoidosis, SLE) [^1159cMqx] [^113314j8].
- **Iatrogenic**: post-cardiac surgery, radiation [^113sL3dr] [^113oyvCi].
- **Neoplastic**: metastatic or primary pericardial tumors [^117WMeg3] [^113CHWVm].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients present with **tamponade features** (hypotension, elevated JVP, distant heart sounds, pulsus paradoxus) plus persistent congestion despite drainage — edema, ascites, hepatomegaly, and dyspnea that fail to resolve post-pericardiocentesis [^1153YMBy] [^113sL3dr].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Non-invasive imaging

- **Echocardiography**: septal bounce, respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid inflow (> 25%), IVC dilation with reduced collapse, pericardial thickening [^113F2DCZ] [^113qr3SP].
- **Cardiac MRI**: pericardial thickening, edema (T2-STIR), late gadolinium enhancement (inflammation), ventricular interdependence [^112tBdoA] [^114Qz7sC].
- **CT**: pericardial calcification, thickening, effusion, structural assessment [^112tBdoA] [^113dxueT].

---

### Invasive hemodynamics

Right heart catheterization shows **RA pressure fails to fall > 50% or below 10 mmHg after drainage**, with dip-plateau waveforms and equalized diastolic pressures, confirming constriction [^11515kVC] [^115eniVF].

---

## Management

### Medical therapy

Medical therapy centers on **anti-inflammatory treatment** for inflammatory ECP — NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids or IL-1 blockade if refractory [^115eniVF]. Underlying etiologies should be treated, including antituberculous therapy for TB and disease-specific immunosuppression for autoimmune causes [^112YLvAU].

---

### Surgical therapy

Surgical therapy entails **radical pericardiectomy** for chronic, calcific, or medically refractory ECP; this is the definitive treatment to relieve constriction [^11536Ysu] [^113sL3dr].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and treatment**: idiopathic or viral ECP may resolve with anti-inflammatory therapy, whereas TB, radiation, or postsurgical ECP often progresses to chronic constriction without surgery [^111Ln676] [^113SGDJm]. Early diagnosis and timely pericardiectomy improve outcomes; delayed surgery increases morbidity and mortality [^11536Ysu] [^112Ti1rD].

---

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is a **mixed tamponade–constriction syndrome** requiring multimodality imaging and hemodynamics for diagnosis, with anti-inflammatory therapy for inflammatory disease and radical pericardiectomy for chronic or refractory cases.

### Transitory effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^111Ln676]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion of various sizes is a quite common clinical finding, while its progression to effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs in about 1.4–14% of cases. Although available evidence on prevalence and prognosis of this rare pericardial syndrome is poor, apparently a considerable proportion of patients conservatively managed has a spontaneous resolution after several weeks. A 61-year-old female presented to our emergency department reporting fatigue, effort dyspnea and abdominal swelling. The echocardiography showed large pericardial effusion with initial hemodynamic impact, so she underwent a pericardiocentesis with drainage of 800–850cm³ of exudative fluid, on which diagnostic investigations were undertaken: possible viral and bacterial infections, medical conditions, iatrogenic causes, neoplastic and connective tissue diseases were all excluded. Despite empirical therapy with NSAIDs and colchicine, after about one week she had a recurrence of pericardial effusion and progressive development of constriction. Echocardiography performed after a few weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy showed resolution of constriction and PE, with clinical improvement. If progression of pericardial syndromes to a constrictive form is rarely described in literature, cases of transitory effusive-constrictive phase are even more uncommon, mainly reported during the evolution of pericardial effusion. According to the available data, risk of progression to a constrictive form is very low in case of idiopathic pericardial effusion. We report a case of large idiopathic subacute pericardial effusion, treated with pericardiocentesis and then evolved into an effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A prolonged anti-inflammatory treatment leads to complete resolution of pericardial syndrome without necessity of pericardiectomy.

### Effusive-constrictive pericarditis in the spectrum of pericardial compressive syndromes [^115eniVF]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When pericardial fluid accumulates and exceed the reserve volume of the pericardium or when the pericardium becomes scarred and inelastic, one of three pericardial compressive syndromes may ensue, namely, cardiac tamponade (CT), characterised by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure; constrictive pericarditis (CP), the result of scarring and loss of the normal elasticity of the pericardial sac; and effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP), characterised by the concurrence of a tense pericardial effusion and constriction of the heart by the visceral pericardium. Although relatively uncommon, prevalence estimates vary widely and depend on the nature of the cohorts studied, the methods used to diagnose ECP and the manner in which ECP is defined. Most cases of ECP are idiopathic, reflecting the frequency of idiopathic pericardial disease in general, and other causes include radiation, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection and postsurgical/iatrogenic pericardial disease. The diagnosis of ECP often becomes apparent when pericardiocentesis fails to decrease the right atrial pressure by 50% or to a level below 10mm Hg. Important non-invasive diagnostic modalities include echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and, to a lesser extent, cardiac CT. In cases with clear evidence of pericardial inflammation, a trial of an anti-inflammatory regimen is warranted. A complete pericardiectomy should be reserved for refractory symptoms or clinical evidence of chronic CP.

### Effusive-constrictive pericarditis in the absence of overt pericardial disease on multiple imaging modalities [^117BtUpE]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP) is a rare condition that may prove fatal without appropriate treatment. In ECP, there is concomitant existence of a pericardial effusion and CP, that together lead to impaired cardiac filling. Therapeutic pericardiocentesis only addresses part of the problem; surgical pericardiectomy may be required to relieve the constrictive element. Imaging in ECP characteristically demonstrates calcification or thickening of the pericardium. The authors describe a case of ECP were a number of imaging modalities (including echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance and CT) did not identify overt pericardial disease. The patient underwent surgical pericardiectomy that led to a rapid resolution of symptoms and full recovery. Histopathological analysis of the pericardial biopsy indicated a non-specific pericardial fibrosis, in keeping with the final diagnosis of ECP.

Background

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon pericardial syndrome characterized by concomitant tamponade, caused by tense pericardial effusion, and constriction, caused by the visceral pericardium. We conducted a prospective study of its clinical evolution and management.

Methods

From 1986 through 2001, all patients with effusive-constrictive pericarditis were prospectively evaluated. Combined pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization were performed in all patients, and pericardiectomy was performed in those with persistent constriction. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 15 years (median, 7 years).

Results

A total of 1184 patients with pericarditis were evaluated, 218 of whom had tamponade. Of these 218, 190 underwent combined pericardiocentesis and catheterization. Fifteen of these patients had effusive-constrictive pericarditis and were included in the study. All patients presented with clinical tamponade; however, concomitant constriction was recognized in only seven patients. At catheterization, all patients had elevated intrapericardial pressure (median, 12 mm Hg; interquartile range, 7 to 18) and elevated right atrial and end-diastolic right and left ventricular pressures. After pericardiocentesis, the intrapericardial pressure decreased (median value, -5 mm Hg; interquartile range, -5 to 0), whereas right atrial and end-diastolic right and left ventricular pressures, although slightly reduced, remained elevated, with a dip-plateau morphology. The causes were diverse, and death was mainly related to the underlying disease. Pericardiectomy was required in seven patients, all of whom had involvement of the visceral pericardium. Three patients had spontaneous resolution.

Conclusions

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon pericardial syndrome that may be missed in some patients who present with tamponade. Although evolution to persistent constriction is frequent, idiopathic cases may resolve spontaneously. In our opinion, extensive epicardiectomy is the procedure of choice in patients requiring surgery.

### A girl with right heart failure related to effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^116gAfkp]. Pediatric Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterized by constriction of visceral pericardium with a coexisting tense pericardial effusion. We report a 10-year-old girl with right heart failure due to effusive-constrictive pericarditis. She did not present typical features, such as cardiac tamponade or thickening of pericardium (visceral and parietal), but constrictive physiology was observed by echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography. These noninvasive imaging modalities provided clinical clues to make precise diagnosis. The patient underwent surgical drainage of pericardial fluid and visceral pericardiectomy, which resulted in improved hemodynamics and symptoms.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^1119EvFj]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Only one case of SARS-CoV-2 constrictive pericarditis, beside ours, was described in the literature. A healthy 29-year-old woman with ARDS developed constrictive pericarditis followed by rapid deterioration of her condition and death. Acute pericarditis could be underdiagnosed in COVID-19 infection. In a study with severe and critical COVID-19 infection, the CT scans described pericardial effusion in 4.8%. It is thus important to screen for the presence of pericardial effusion, especially in critically ill patients. Continued observations of the cardiovascular complications of this disease are necessary to fully understand them.

Learning points

COVID-19 cardiovascular complications are frequent and could be associated with increased mortality and long-term prognostic implications. It is important to raise awareness for other, more rare complications, such as pericardial effusion.
Constrictive pericarditis can occur after any pericardial disease process, but also following acute pericarditis (viral or idiopathic), so it should be suspected in any patient with aggravated symptoms.
This case highlights the potential for patients with COVID-19 to develop life-threatening conditions within a short timeframe.
Patients with moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 should undergo an initial evaluation with an ECG, chest X-ray, and transthoracic echocardiogram. This may facilitate early diagnosis and management of COVID-19 associated pericarditis which may improve outcomes.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis: diagnosis by serial echocardiography [^111cyhGn]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2004). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 30-year-old man with acute pericarditis in whom effusive-constrictive physiology developed rapidly in less than 2 weeks. Serial echocardiography demonstrated a dramatic change in the appearance of the pericardial effusion and the pericardial space. The patient underwent pericardiectomy with symptom relief. The findings at operation included a markedly thickened and inflamed pericardium. The case highlights the role of echocardiography in the evaluation of patients with pericardial disease and the echocardiographic features that prompted early surgical intervention.

Constrictive pericarditis phenotypes and imaging roles are outlined, noting significant pericardial inflammation, termed transient constrictive pericarditis, and that this distinction is crucial, as the former usually requires surgical radical pericardiectomy, whereas the latter may resolve spontaneously or with anti-inflammatory therapy given for 3 to 6 months. In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, it is the most common cause of constrictive pericarditis, whereas outside of this setting, the most common cause is idiopathic, followed by post-cardiac surgery and prior mediastinal radiation. Effusive constrictive pericarditis is a distinct entity defined as persistent constrictive pathophysiology after drainage of a pericardial effusion, classically diagnosed invasively by a failure of the right atrial pressure (or pericardial pressure) to decrease following pericardiocentesis and attributed to marked inflammation of the visceral pericardium, although currently it is often diagnosed based on features of constrictive pathophysiology with echocardiography that appear after pericardial effusion drainage. The primary objectives of imaging here are to identify constrictive pathophysiology and to assess the presence and severity of pericardial inflammation, with echocardiography and CMR imaging playing complementary roles, echocardiography serving as the primary and initial modality, whereas CMR offers the most comprehensive assessment of pericardial inflammation.

Discussion

At present, limited data have been published on pericarditis and pericardial effusion in COVID-19, and only one case of constrictive pericarditis was reported.

Constrictive pericarditis is characterised by inflammation and fibrotic thickening of the parietal and visceral pericardium, causing a restriction in cardiac filling and leading to hypodiastolic heart failure. The most common causes of constrictive pericarditis are cardiac surgery, radiotherapy, tuberculous and purulent pericarditis. Idiopathic and viral pericarditis have a low incidence of constrictive complications.

Constrictive pericarditis is usually a late complication of chronic pericarditis. In rare cases, like the one presented here, it could have a more rapid, subacute evolution. Baker described in 2004 a similar case of a 30-year-old man with acute pericarditis that developed effusive-constrictive physiology in less than 2 weeks. The patient was treated initially with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine, but pericardiectomy was needed. The pericardial cavity was filled with fibrinous gelatinous exudates with adhesions to the epicardial surface. Pathological examination noted non-specific findings including fibrosis, chronic inflammation and granulation tissue. The cause of the pericarditis was thought to be idiopathic, presumed viral.

The concept of effusive-constrictive pericarditis was established in 1971 by Hancock. Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterised by pericardial effusion, often with cardiac tamponade, and restrictive cardiac filling physiology. Although the gold standard to establish the diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis has been invasive, involving simultaneous measurement of intrapericardial and intracardiac pressures before and after pericardial drainage, the echocardiography could establish the diagnosis more rapidly. Echocardiography shows a mixed haemodynamic pattern with elements of constriction and tamponade. The main echocardiographic features are the absence of normalisation in inferior vena cava dilatation and restoration of its respiratory changes, persistently remaining significant respiratory variation of the mitral and tricuspid inflow Doppler pattern, abnormal/paradoxical movement of the interventricular septum (septal bounce) and preserved or increased medial mitral e′ velocity.

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Effusive constrictive pericarditis — epidemiology, pathology, and when to image are outlined as follows: Effusive CP "is the most uncommon of the pericardial constraint syndromes". Reported prevalence includes "1.3% in a prospective series of patients evaluated from 1986 to 2001 presenting with pericarditis and 6.9% of those with cardiac tamponade". In surgical cohorts, "In a surgical series of 95 patients undergoing surgery for CP, effusive-constrictive etiology accounted for 24% of patients". Pathologically, "The distinguishing histopathologic feature of effusive CP is the involvement of the visceral pericardium along with a tense PEF contributing to constrictive physiology". For care pathways, "imaging is indicated in the evaluation and management of pericardial disease in the settings described above or in the workup of CP".

Background

Considered in the beginning a respiratory illness, with the increase in cases it became evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects multiple organs, including the heart. The cardiovascular changes range from asymptomatic increase in myocardial injury markers, contractility disorders, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, vascular insufficiency and sudden cardiac arrest. We report the case of a rapidly installed constrictive pericarditis in the setting of COVID-19.

Neoplastic pericardial effusion is a common and serious manifestation of advanced malignancies. Lung and breast carcinoma, haematological malignancies, and gastrointestinal cancer are the most common types of cancer involving the pericardium. Pericardial involvement in neoplasia may arise from several different pathophysiological mechanisms and may be manifested by pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, effusive-constrictive pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis. Management of these patients is a complex multidisciplinary problem, affected by clinical status and prognosis of patients.

We report a 9-year-old boy with progressive heart failure due to effusive-constrictive pericarditis. The patient was successfully rescued by extensive surgical removal of the thickened pericardium. The histopathological examination revealed degenerative changes of myocardium without significant inflammation, indicating that surgical pericardiectomy should be performed for subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis before progression to definite constrictive pericarditis.

### Breaking hearts and taking names: a case of sarcoidosis related effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^1159cMqx]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pericardial involvement of sarcoidosis is a rare cause for acute heart failure, and usually occurs as a result of the development of a pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Even rarer still, is the manifestation of constrictive pericarditis. We report a case of sarcoidosis with lung, pleural, and pericardial involvement with effusive-constrictive pericarditis leading to cardiac tamponade.

Case Presentation

A 34-year-old Caucasian man presented for evaluation of a history of worsening exertional dyspnea, edema, and weight loss. A high-resolution chest computed tomography showed diffuse pulmonary nodules with upper lobe predominance and in a perilymphatic distribution; large right pleural effusion; and large pericardial effusion with pericardial thickening. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated early tamponade physiology for which a pericardial drain was placed. After removal of the drain he developed cardiogenic shock from cardiac tamponade attributed to the reaccumulation of a pericardial effusion and urgent pericardial window was performed. Serial echocardiography was concerning for organization and localization of the pericardial fluid. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a significant reduction in pericardial slippage between the parietal and visceral layers around the heart collectively suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Confirmation of effusive-constrictive pericarditis was noted on right heart catheterization. He then underwent pericardiectomy, which on histopathologic evaluation demonstrated non-necrotizing granulomas, thus confirming pericardial involvement of sarcoidosis.

Conclusions

We report a case demonstrating unique manifestations of sarcoidosis; effusive-constrictive pericarditis presenting with acute congestive heart failure.

### Malignant primary pericardial mesothelioma presenting as effusive constrictive pericarditis: a case report study [^113CHWVm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary pericardial mesothelioma (PPM) is a rare malignancy with a high prevalence of mortality. The diagnosis is usually challenging using a variety of imaging modalities and invasive procedures and is generally performed at the later stages of the disease or in autopsy. This case study points to an unconventional presentation of PPM and the challenges in diagnosing this rare mortal malignancy.

Case Presentation

This study presents a 44-year-old woman with no remarkable medical history with an initial diagnosis of effusive constrictive pericarditis at first hospitalization. Imaging evaluations, including transthoracic echocardiography and chest computed tomography scan, demonstrated visible thickened pericardium, pericardial effusion, and mass-like lesions in pericardium and mediastinum. The definite diagnosis of primary pericardial mesothelioma was established after pericardiectomy and histopathology examinations. Chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin was administrated to the patient, and she has been through four cycles of chemotherapy with no complications to date.

Conclusion

Constrictive pericarditis is an uncommon presentation of PPM. Due to the high mortality rate and late presentation, difficulties and uncertainties in diagnosis, being aware of this rare malignant entity in different cardiac manifestations, particularly when there is no clear explanation or response to treatment in such conditions, is highly important.

### Malignant primary pericardial mesothelioma presenting as effusive constrictive pericarditis: a case report study [^111VnCXr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our patient was presented with non-specific symptoms and electrocardiography changes accompanied by elevated LDH and inflammatory markers. After multimodality imaging, effusive constrictive pericarditis, which is considered an unconventional presentation of PPM, was diagnosed. Therefore, although PPM is known as a rare and highly lethal disease due to itlate presentation and uncertainties in diagnosis, it is of importance to be aware of this condition in various cardiac manifestations, including pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, patients presenting with clinical and imaging findings consistent with constrictive pericarditis, and even heart failure presentations, particularly when there is no clear explanation and response to treatment in such conditions.

### Subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 [^116cQEng]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Although the pathophysiology of pericarditis in COVID-19 is unknown, it is hypothesised that it occurs secondary to the systemic inflammatory response and the subsequent cytotoxic and immune-mediated effects related to SARS-CoV-2. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released via the associated angiotensin II pathway could promote inflammation and fibrosis of the pericardium in COVID-19 infection.

In developing countries, and this is the case of Romania, TB remains an important cause of pericarditis and it progresses to constriction more frequently than with viral aetiologies. In TB constrictive pericarditis pathogenic mechanism are similar, with increased ACE levels, resulting in increased enzymatic cleavage of Ac-SDKP and a subsequent dampening in its antifibrotic potential, which potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of constriction. Also, marked elevations of IL-10 and IFN-γ accompanied by low levels of bioactive TGF-β levels in tuberculous pericardial fluid suggest a Th-1 mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the pathogen. The lymphocyte Th1 pathway is also involved in COVID-19 infection. It was reported that COVID-19 has higher morbidity and mortality in people with low Th1 immunity. In severe cases, studies showed a Th2 response against SARS-CoV-2, rather than a Th1 response. New studies are necessary to explain the aggressivity of the virus in some healthy young patients. In our case, the severe evolution could be related to a dysfunction of the innate immune system or by mutations of genes involved in the inflammatory response.

Constrictive pericarditis — treatment approach on clinical examination and echocardiography ± cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) details subacute and chronic pathways with explicit actions. Subacute management lists "NSAIDs + colchicine for at least 3 months with slow taper†" with a "Low threshold for adding anti–IL-1 agent or corticosteroid", plus "Regular surveillance of clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers (CRP) and imaging (echocardiography ± CMR) at 3 to 6 months" and "Diuretics (eg, loop diuretics ± MRA) if needed". Chronic management includes "Diuretics (eg, loop diuretics ± MRA)" alongside understanding the driver of pathology, palliative care consultation, and multidisciplinary input. The effusive constrictive pericarditis branch notes "↑ RA pressure despite pericardial effusion drainage LGE+ on CMR T2–STIR+ on CMR ± Effusion ± ↑ CRP" with "Pericardiocentesis". Surgical care is summarized as "Radical Pericardiectomy" to "Consider for chronic CP or subacute CP refractory to medical therapy" and to "Refer to PDC with experienced surgical center". The figure emphasizes that "Differentiating chronic vs subacute CP using CMR imaging guides therapy and can negate the need for pericardiectomy" and that "Aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy for subacute CP is the cornerstone of management; however, pericardiectomy remains the main therapy for chronic CP patients who are surgical candidates", noting "Pericardial thickness can be normal in 18% of cases" and that tapering "should only start if patient symptoms resolve, and C-reactive protein (CRP) normalizes".

### Pericardial segmentation: a proposed model to quantify disease burden [^113v2eXN]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

In endemic countries, with a high burden of HIV and tuberculosis (TB), TB pericarditis is by far the most common cause of constrictive pericarditis.

Constrictive haemodynamics is commonly documented postdrainage of large pericardial effusions (pericardiocentesis) in the setting of acute TB pericarditis, so-called effusive constrictive pericarditis (ECP). This form of constriction is frequently transient and reversible, typically resolving with anti-TB chemotherapy, with or without adjunctive steroid therapy, and only a subset of patients progresses to develop chronic irreversible constriction. The complex mechanisms driving progression to chronic pericardial constriction remain poorly understood, and better understanding of these processes could improve our ability to distinguish reversible from irreversible constrictive haemodynamics.

Newer developments in the field of CMR, specifically studies that correlate imaging findings with histology, offer important insights into the pericardial tissue characteristics that predict the potential reversibility of constriction physiology. Current hypotheses suggest that the combined intensity of pericardial inflammation, the extent of oedema and the degree of fibrous adhesion of pericardial layers onto the epicardium may help predict the risk of progressing to chronic constriction. Although pericardial inflammation and oedema often coexist in pericarditis, it is suggested that these are two independent processes with contrasting prognostic value. While the intensity of pericardial inflammation is a risk factor for continued tissue injury, remodelling and fibrosis, the presence and extent of pericardial oedema is protective and serves both as a marker of acuity of pathology and reversibility of constrictive haemodynamics. An individual patient's risk for developing non-reversible chronic constriction could potentially be estimated as a product of the intensity and extent of pericardial inflammation (risk factor) versus oedema (protective factor). Therefore, an accurate assessment of the distribution and extent of pericardial disease is required to assign risk and classify patients into the acute, intermediate or chronic inflammatory pericarditis categories.

### Pericardial diseases: international position statement on new concepts and Advances in multimodality cardiac imaging [^114FSmLf]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Pericardial diseases have gained renewed clinical interest, leading to a renaissance in the field. There have been many recent advances in pericardial diseases in both multimodality cardiac imaging of diagnoses, such as recurrent, transient constrictive and effusive-constrictive pericarditis, and targeted therapeutics, especially anti-interleukin (IL)-1 agents that affect the inflammasome as part of autoinflammatory pathophysiology. There remains a large educational gap for clinicians, leading to variability in evaluation and management of these patients. The latest pericardial imaging (American Society of Echocardiography, European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging) and clinical guidelines (European Society of Cardiology) are > 8–10 years of age and may not reflect current practice. Recent clinical trials involving anti-IL-1 agents in recurrent pericarditis, including anakinra (AIRTRIP), rilonacept (RHAPSODY), and goflikicept have demonstrated their efficacy. The present document represents an international position statement from world leaders in the pericardial field, focusing on novel concepts and emphasizing the role of multimodality cardiac imaging as well as new therapeutics in pericardial diseases.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^113rfwTp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a severe cardiac disorder which often manifests as a long-term sequela following acute or chronic pericarditis due to infections. A number of cardiotropic viruses, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections can cause CP. While rare in Western countries, tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericarditis in countries endemic to tuberculosis and HIV. Other important causes of CP are malignancy, rheumatological diseases, uraemia, radiotherapy and cardiac surgery, and in some cases the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Chronic effusive pericarditis and inflammation in any of these conditions may lead to formation of granulomatous tissue, fibrosis, calcification and thickening of the pericardium with adhesion to the heart. Typically, CP results in impaired cardiac function, most often associated with diastolic heart failure, and symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue, increased jugular venous pressure, ascites, pleural effusion and peripheral oedema. Although standard transthoracic echocardiography is the cornerstone, a multimodality imaging-based approach is often required to timely diagnose the condition and guide further therapeutic options.

### Pericardial segmentation: a proposed model to quantify disease burden [^1129Cy1U]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Research on constrictive pericardial disease has long been constrained by the reliance on constriction as a binary outcome. Defined by the Mayo criteria, constriction is an infrequent but devastating sequela of pericarditis. Because of its rarity, very large cohorts are needed to identify reliable predictors, making prospective studies challenging. A key pathological hallmark of chronic constriction is extensive adhesion between the parietal and visceral pericardium, the latter adhering to the epicardium and limiting diastolic ventricular expansion. Such adhesions can be visualised on CMR cine imaging, often supplemented with gridline tagging sequences. Quantifying the burden of adhesion, rather than relying solely on binary haemodynamic outcomes, therefore, represents a promising surrogate endpoint of constriction research. Important further questions — such as how much adhesion is required to produce constriction, or whether specific regions of pericardial constraint or tethering (eg, LV vs RV) are more critical to lead to constriction — require further study. A standardised segmentation model should provide the framework needed to address such questions.

Constrictive haemodynamics in acute inflammatory pericarditis are often transient and reversible. ECP, although traditionally regarded as an acute entity, more likely represents a spectrum that includes acute, subacute and chronic pericarditis. Along this continuum, the contribution of acute, reversible constriction from a non-compliant, oedematous pericardium gradually diminishes, while the role of chronic, irreversible scarring becomes more prominent. Importantly, the haemodynamic compromise observed across this spectrum may appear similar on echocardiography, which focuses on identifying the lesion itself and is largely insensitive to the underlying pathological mechanism. In contrast, CMR can qualitatively evaluate the pericardium for inflammation and oedema, providing sensitivity to the mechanism of constriction. Building on this, our pericardial segmentation model offers a way to translate these qualitative features into segment-by-segment quantification, distinguishing the relative contributions of acute and reversible versus chronic and non-reversible disease in patients presenting with ECP. Such quantification may aid prognostication by helping to identify patients who could benefit from adjunctive steroid therapy in acute pericarditis vs those with established, non-reversible constriction where early pericardiectomy may reduce surgical risk.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113dxueT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericardial effusion — advanced imaging roles: Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is a second-line investigation with advantages that include further delineation of effusion size and extent, characterizing pericardial fluid based on Hounsfield units, informing secondary causes such as malignancy, and guiding drainage, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is also a second-line investigation with the additional advantage of assessing for pericardial inflammation and constriction. Multimodality protocols indicate that CCT can distinguish mimickers, detect pericardial calcification or hemorrhage, detect, size, and characterize content of pericardial effusion, identify secondary causes and mimickers, evaluate pericardial thickness, and detect pericardial inflammation; CMR sequences can detect and size pericardial effusion, distinguish mimickers, evaluate for effusive-constrictive pericarditis and transient constrictive pericarditis, assess pericardial thickness and identify adhesions, evaluate for myocardial edema, and evaluate for pericardial malignancies.

### Effusive-constrictive tuberculous pericarditis in the setting of penetrating abdominal trauma [^114hvnfC]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous pericarditis is rare in developed nations and is most commonly associated with effusive-constrictive pericarditis. We present the case of a 33-year-old man with a self-inflicted mid-abdominal stab wound. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, revealing a grade IV pancreatic transection and injuries to the portal vein, right renal vein, inferior vena cava and the superior mesenteric vein. Repair of the vessels was performed and a pancreaticojejunostomy with a gastrojejunostomy was created for the pancreatic injury. The patient's hospital course was complicated by tuberculous effusive-constrictive pericarditis requiring emergent median sternotomy with opening of the pericardial sac and eventual expiration. The final cultures from the pericardial fluid demonstrated tuberculosis.

### Pathophysiology of the pericardium [^113L5T9M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Pericardial heart disease includes pericarditis, (an acute, subacute, or chronic fibrinous, noneffusive, or exudative process), and its complications, constriction, (an acute, subacute, or chronic adhesive or fibrocalcific response), and cardiac tamponade. The pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis readily explains their respective findings on clinical examination, Doppler echocardiography, and at cardiac catheterization. The primary abnormality of cardiac tamponade is pan-cyclic compression of the cardiac chambers by increased pericardial fluid requiring that cardiac chambers compete for a fixed intrapericardial volume. Features responsible for the pathophysiology include transmission of thoracic pressure through the pericardium and heightened ventricular interdependence. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium limits diastolic filling and causes dissociation of intracardiac and intrathoracic pressures, and heightened ventricular interdependence. Both conditions result in diastolic dysfunction, elevated and equal venous and ventricular diastolic pressure, respiratory variation in ventricular filling, and ultimately, reduced cardiac output.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^1142NXcB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In CP, pericardiectomy may be required in some cases to normalise end-diastolic pressures in cardiac chambers and cardiac output. In our patient, an early cardiac surgery with removal of adherences and release of the heart from the surrounding calcified/thickened pericardium led to immediate improvement of haemodynamics and symptoms and cardiac function recovery, with no evidence of residual constriction during long-term echocardiographic follow-up. However, it is also important to note that in a chronic effusive pericarditis, a residual constriction and chronic irreversible myocardial dysfunction may last even following a successful pericardiectomy, which highlights the importance of knowing the underlying aetiology.

Pericarditis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis, evident in 1% of cases of tuberculosis at autopsy. Although tuberculosis accounts for only 4% of pericarditis cases in high-income countries, it is by far the most common cause of CP in endemic areas in Africa and Asia, particularly where there is high prevalence of HIV infection. In Sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculosis accounts for up to 70% of pericarditis cases in the general population and more than 90% of cases among people living with HIV.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We attempted to identify all relevant trials regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).

We searched the following databases using the strategy described in Appendix 1: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (27 March 2017); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2017, Issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to 27 March 2017); Embase (1974 to 27 March 2017); and LILACS (1982 to 27 March 2017).

Searching other resources

We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal using 'tuberculosis' and 'pericard' as search terms on 27 March 2017.

We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and contacted researchers in the field of tuberculous pericarditis in March 2017.

In addition, we examined existing reviews of tuberculous pericarditis for relevant citations (Schrire 1967; Bhan 1980; Fowler 1991; Fowler 1992; Alzeer 1993; Senderovitz 1994; Fowler 1995; Cisneros 1996; Dooley 1997; Strang 1997; Mayosi 2002; Ntsekhe 2003; Mayosi 2005; Syed 2007; Imazio 2015; Zumla 2015).

Acute pericarditis — when to consider added imaging: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed in all cases of acute pericarditis to assess for effusion, tamponade physiology, and myocardial involvement as in myopericarditis. If the results of TTE are negative or equivocal in a patient suspected to have acute pericarditis with poor prognostic signs, including fever > 38°C, the most sensitive subsequent test is CMR, which shows edema and inflammation as well as features of constrictive physiology. Imaging with CT or CMR should be considered in limited clinical scenarios with complex clinical presentation or inconclusive echocardiographic findings, and the choice of CT or CMR should be based on the specific clinical question according to the strength of these modalities; scenarios include inconclusive echocardiographic findings and ongoing clinical concern, failure to respond promptly to anti-inflammatory therapy, atypical clinical presentation, search for a specific cause (i.e., malignancy or tuberculosis), suspicion of CP or effusive CP, associated trauma, and acute pericarditis in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, neoplasm, lung or chest infection, or pancreatitis.

### New development of cardiac tamponade on underlying effusive-constrictive pericarditis: an uncommon initial presentation of scleroderma [^113314j8]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 40-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension was admitted for weight loss, generalised weakness, joint pains and mottling of fingertips. The initial laboratory data revealed microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. Intravenous steroids were started for possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus based on admission assessment. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapharesis were subsequently added to the treatment plan to cover thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura while his autoimmune panel was pending. The echocardiogram study on day 2 revealed cardiac tamponade for which he underwent pericardiocentesis and right heart catheterisation. The atrial waveforms postpericardiocentesis demonstrated effusive-constrictive pericarditis. His clinical condition kept on deteriorating with reaccumulation of pericardial effusion and further complicated by hemoperitoneum and colonic obstruction. He had cardiorespiratory arrest on his fourth admission day and was not revived. Anti-Scl-70 antibody came back positive. Autopsy findings confirmed the presence of fibrinous pericarditis and hemoperitoneum.

### Cardiac tamponade [^1153YMBy]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis.

Discussion

The main findings of this cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary TB in Zambia and South Africa can be summarized as follows: 1) about 2-thirds of patients had early signs of cardiac involvement at the start of anti-TB treatment; 2) pericardial effusion and pericardial thickening were the most common echocardiographic manifestations; 3) constrictive pericarditis was detected in 12%, while any sign indicating constrictive hemodynamics was recorded in more than 40% of cases; and 4) early stages of pericardial involvement largely showed regression after completion of an anti-TB treatment, while constrictive pericarditis persisted throughout the course of anti-TB treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze pericardial changes in pulmonary TB patients in 2 different sub-Saharan African study sites at baseline and during follow-up using standardized TTE protocols.

In Southern Africa, pericardial TB is the second most common form of extrapulmonary TB, second only to pleural disease. Pericardial TB often develops through lymphatic or hematogenous spread from a primary infection, typically in the lungs, or from distant secondary infections. Subclinical immunosuppression, which is not necessarily related to HIV infection, but may be associated with conditions such as malnutrition, may facilitate the spread of TB bacilli. In our cohort, over one-third of patients were malnourished. Evidence of simultaneous pulmonary and pericardial TB is limited due to underdiagnosis and lack of autopsy studies. Pericardial TB is often regarded as a paucibacillary condition, with immune-mediated inflammation playing a central role in its pathologyClinical presentations of TB pericarditis include acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion (leading to tamponade in extreme cases), effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or constrictive pericarditis, which describe a four-stage evolution starting with acute pericarditis, stage 1, the "dry stage", the least common form seen. Stage 2 is effusive or effusive-constrictive pericarditis, the form most frequently seen, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Constrictive pericarditis with radiological and echocardiographic evidence of pericardial thickening and fibrinous fluid around the heart is stage 3. Finally, "pure" constrictive pericarditis with no residual fluid in the pericardium is stage 4.

### Constrictive pericarditis versus restrictive Cardiomyopathy? [^1178nFeT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

About one-half of the patients with congestive heart failure have preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although the etiology of HFpEF is most commonly related to long-standing hypertension and atherosclerosis, a significant number of suspected HFpEF patients have a restrictive cardiomyopathy or chronic pericardial disease. Recognizing these syndromes is important because early diagnosis may lead to instituting specific therapy that may prolong survival, improve quality of life, and/or recognize and treat an underlying systemic disorder. Advances in diagnostic imaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing today allow identification of the specific etiology in most cases. Novel pharmacological, immunologic, and surgical therapies are leading to improved quality of life and survival.

- **Pathophysiology**: Constrictive pericarditis is caused by fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to idiopathic reasons, prior cardiac surgery, postradiotherapy, postinfection (tuberculosis and non-tuberculous bacterial infection), connective tissue disease, malignancy, uremia, and sarcoidosis.
- **Disease course**: Chronic fibrous thickening of the pericardium due to various infectious and non-infectious causes result in constrictive pericarditis, which causes clinical manifestations of dyspnea, peripheral edema, chest pain, palpitation, abdominal distension, fever, fatigue, weight loss, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, Kussmaul's sign, and pericardial shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In-hospital mortality associated with constrictive pericarditis is 2.1%.

Effusive CP — CT, CMR, and added imaging guidance indicate that computed tomography (CT) can evaluate pericardial thickening and that a thickness > 3 mm is considered pathologic; although greater thickening with a pericardial effusion supports effusive CP, clinical diagnosis requires demonstration of concomitant constrictive physiology and may occur with only minimal thickening. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) similarly evaluates pericardial thickening, and increased ventricular interdependence results in flattening or inversion of the septum. For suspected effusive CP, echocardiography with a dedicated comprehensive diastolic evaluation is preferred in all patients, CT and CMR are complementary to echocardiography, and while diagnosis previously required hemodynamic or surgical confirmation, it is now often detected earlier with imaging techniques.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^111ncxMm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The normal pericardial sac contains up to 50 mL of fluid with anything greater being a pathologic effusion. The curvilinear pressure-volume relationship of the pericardial sac determines the hemodynamic consequences of a PE and is responsible for rapidly accumulating fluid that causes cardiac tamponade. There are numerous diseases and complications which cause PEs with the most common being idiopathic pericarditis, cancer, and hemorrhage. PE may be classified based on its onset (acute, subacute, or chronic when it has been present for greater than 3 months), distribution (circumferential or loculated), hemodynamic impact (none, cardiac tamponade, effusive-constrictive), and composition (exudates, transudate). PE is also distinguished by size as mild, moderate, and large based on echocardiographic assessment.

The pathophysiology of the development of PE has been described as resulting from any pathological process causing an inflammatory process with the possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Another mechanism for the formation of pericardial fluid may be decreased reabsorption due to increased systemic venous pressure as a result of congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension (transudate). The most common cause is often unknown as most of the PEs are idiopathic. Although the subxiphoid approach for surgical drainage has been our preferred method there are alternative approaches. The creation of a "pericardial window" can be done through a thoracotomy or video-assisted approach. The procedure is generally low risk with a low complication rate and rare mortality.

### Constrictive pericarditis: diagnosis, management and clinical outcomes [^116nQrWd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a form of diastolic heart failure that arises because an inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling. This disorder must be considered in the differential diagnosis for unexplained heart failure, particularly when the left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved. Risk factors for the development of CP include prior cardiac surgery and radiation therapy, but most cases are still deemed to be idiopathic. Making the diagnosis may be challenging and requires meticulous echocardiographic assessment, often supplemented by cross-sectional cardiac imaging and haemodynamic catheterisation. The key pathophysiological concepts, which serve as the basis for many of the diagnostic criteria, remain: (1) dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures and (2) enhanced ventricular interaction. Complete surgical pericardiectomy is the only effective treatment for chronic CP. A subset of patients with subacute inflammatory CP, often identified by cardiac MRI, may respond to anti-inflammatory treatments.

Constrictive pericarditis — medical and surgical management approach emphasizes that for patients with underlying pericardial inflammation as in transient constriction, anti-inflammatory therapy should be initiated before considering pericardiectomy; this approach may resolve the constrictive pathophysiology, or if pericardiectomy remains indicated, facilitates a more successful surgery on a less-inflamed pericardium. In tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, antitubercular therapy may resolve constrictive pathophysiology, and corticosteroids may enhance clinical improvement. In patients with chronic constrictive pericarditis and heart failure, diuretic therapy can treat volume overload but does not alter the natural history, and goal-directed heart failure therapy may be implemented, although evidence is limited. Surgical radical pericardiectomy is preferred, with resection of the entire pericardium — including anterior, diaphragmatic and posterior segments — on cardiopulmonary bypass, and should be performed at experienced tertiary surgical centers for optimal clinical outcomes.

Evaluation and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — evaluation starts with a thorough history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests with particular attention to sedimentation rate, CRP, and troponin if myocarditis is suspected; TTE remains the first-line imaging modality for assessing suspected pericarditis, TTE findings may include pericardial effusion (without or with tamponade), pericardial thickening, features of constrictive physiology, and/or myocardial involvement, TTE can be serially used to monitor for improvement or worsening of these abnormalities, and TTE's main limitation is the inability of tissue characterization to identify and grade pericardial inflammation.

### Anterior pericardiectomy for postinfective Constrictive pericarditis: intermediate-term outcomes [^111UvJyY]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posttubercular constrictive pericarditis is prevalent pericardial disease in developing countries. Pericardiectomy is the treatment of choice but considered a procedure of high morbidity and mortality.

Methods

From January 2003 to December 2013 we performed 130 pericardiectomies. The patients' mean age was 22.95 ± 12.55 years, and there were 92 (71%) male patients. All patients were symptomatic; 118 (91%) were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Almost all patients were diagnosed to be of tubercular origin: 14 (11%) were histopathologically proven, 77 (59%) had definitive history, 39 (30%) were suspected to be of tubercular origin, and 91 (70%) received prior antitubercular treatment.

Results

Anterior pericardiectomy was done without the use but with provision for cardiopulmonary bypass, which was required in 5 (3.8%) patients for repair of tear in right atrium. Following pericardiectomy central venous pressure dropped from 20.9 to 10.8 mm Hg. Early mortality was 10 (7.69%). Prolonged ventilation was required in 22 (16.92%) patients, 31 (23.84%) developed renal dysfunction, and there were 3 (3.12%) cases of new-onset atrial fibrillation. On analysis of univariate predictors for early mortality, low ejection fraction (p < 0.001) and preoperative atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001) were found to be significant. In a follow-up of 12 months, 85% patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II with mean ejection fraction of 52%. There was no recurrence of constriction from residual pericardium on 1-year follow-up.

Conclusions

Anterior pericardiectomy is sufficient in patients with constrictive pericarditis of infective etiology. Preoperative low ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, poor functional class, and constrictive effusive pericarditis results in poor surgical outcome.

### Constrictive pericarditis: a practical clinical approach [^11756sP2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) represents a form of severe diastolic heart failure (HF), secondary to a noncompliant pericardium. The true prevalence of CP is unknown but it is observed in 0.2–0.4% of patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or have had pericardial trauma or inflammation due to a variety of etiologies. Despite its poor prognosis if untreated, CP is a potentially curable disease and surgical pericardiectomy can now be performed at low perioperative mortality in tertiary centers with surgical expertise in pericardial diseases. Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for CP in patients presenting with predominant right-sided (HF), particularly when a history of cardiac surgery, pericarditis or pericardial effusion is present. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is usually the first diagnostic tool in the evaluation of HF and can reliably identify CP in most patients by characteristic real-time motion of the heart and hemodynamic features. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide incremental data for the diagnosis and management of CP and are especially helpful when clinical or echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization has been the gold-standard for the diagnosis of CP, but may not be necessary if non-invasive test(s) demonstrate diagnostic features of CP; it should then be reserved for selected cases or for assessment of concomitant coronary disease. Although most patients with CP require pericardiectomy, anti-inflammatory therapy may be curative in patients presenting with subacute symptoms, especially when evidence of marked ongoing inflammation is seen.

Differential diagnosis

Pericardial and pleural effusion is rarely seen in mild forms of liver cirrhosis, and the patient did not show evidence of failure of liver protein synthesis. Furthermore, absence of proteinuria ruled out nephrotic syndrome. An emergency echocardiogram showed an advanced stage of effusive-constrictive pericarditis. This was further confirmed by CMR scan and cardiac catheterisation. He did not have any previous cardiac surgery or radiation to the mediastinal region. Hence, the CP was by definition primary. The patient repeatedly underwent drainage of pleural effusion, ascites and pericardial effusion with cytological investigation, and no malignant cells in the pericardial fluid were found. Histological examination of a pericardial biopsy did not reveal the aetiology and importantly did not find evidence of malignancy. Similarly, extensive evaluation for a wide number of infectious causes including cardiotropic viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, parasites and fungi did not provide conclusive results. As he had worked in several tropical countries and lived in tuberculosis-endemic settings in South-East Asia over time, tuberculous pericarditis was suspected. In such a setting, constrictive, calcified pericarditis is highly suspicious for tuberculous aetiology. The finding of borderline enlarged mediastinal and abdominal glands was also compatible with tuberculosis. Although comprehensive work-up did not provide aetiological proof of tuberculosis, we concluded with a diagnosis of presumptive tuberculous pericarditis based on history of likely exposure in an endemic setting, compatible clinical features and lack of an alternative explanation. We treated him ex juvantibus with standard antituberculous treatment followed by surgery.

### Outcomes of clinically significant idiopathic pericardial effusion requiring intervention [^113iwVBR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of outcome data on patients with idiopathic pericardial effusion requiring intervention. All patients who had clinically significant pericardial effusion confirmed by echocardiography and requiring interventions between 1979 and 2000 were identified through the Echo-guided Pericardiocentesis Registry and Echocardiography and Surgical Databases. Clinical data and outcomes were obtained by review of medical records and surveys. The study population consisted of 92 patients (mean age 59 ± 15 years). Five patients were referred directly for pericardiectomy (3 had effusion in the context of chronic relapsing pericarditis, 2 had effusive constrictive disease), and 87 underwent echo-guided pericardiocentesis as their initial treatment. In 47 of these patients, primary management involved extended pericardial catheter drainage, which was associated with a trend to lower recurrence rates than in those without catheter drainage (p = 0.052). Three patients had transient right ventricular entry with no sequelae, and 7 patients (8%) later had surgical pericardiectomy because of the recurrence of effusion, 2 of whom were also found to have evidence of effusive constrictive disease during surgery. One patient had bleeding after pericardiectomy that required repeat thoracotomy. Mean follow-up of the cohort was 3.8 ± 4.3 years. For most patients with clinically significant idiopathic pericardial effusion requiring intervention, echo-guided pericardiocentesis was the definitive treatment. Pericardiectomy was necessary for patients in whom effusion occurred in the context of effusive constrictive disease, chronic relapsing pericarditis, or recurrent effusion despite pericardiocentesis. The prognosis for the cohort was favorable, and survival did not appear to differ from that of the general population (p = 0.372).

### Pericardial disease and pericardial tamponade [^115ezntf]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The pericardium serves many important functions, but it is not essential for life. Pericardial heart disease comprises only pericarditis and its complications, tamponade and constriction, and congenital lesions. However, the pericardium is affected by virtually every category of disease. The critical care physician is thus likely to encounter the patient with pericardial disease in a variety of settings, either as an isolated phenomenon or as a complication of a variety of systemic disorders, trauma, or certain drugs. Echocardiography is the primary tool for diagnosing and quantifying pericardial effusions, and in the context of the clinical presentation, a thorough understanding of M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler findings can help not only to identify patients with impending tamponade, but also to suggest a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. This article reviews the pathogenesis and diagnosis of pericardial heart disease, focusing on the diagnostic utility of echocardiography, with an emphasis on those areas of greatest interest to the intensivist.

### Constrictive pericarditis – a curable diastolic heart failure [^111VPde1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis can result from a stiff pericardium that prevents satisfactory diastolic filling. The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and other causes of heart failure, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, is important because pericardiectomy can cure constrictive pericarditis. Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is based on characteristic haemodynamic and anatomical features determined using echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, cardiac MRI, and CT. The Mayo Clinic echocardiography and cardiac catheterization haemodynamic diagnostic criteria for constrictive pericarditis are based on the unique features of ventricular interdependence and dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures seen when the pericardium is constricted. A complete pericardiectomy can restore satisfactory diastolic filling by removing the constrictive pericardium in patients with constrictive pericarditis. However, if inflammation of the pericardium is the predominant constrictive mechanism, anti-inflammatory therapy might alleviate this transient condition without a need for surgery. Early diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is, therefore, of paramount clinical importance. An improved understanding of how constrictive pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this diastolic heart failure. In this Review, we discuss the aetiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, with a specific emphasis on how to differentiate this disease from conditions with similar clinical presentations.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid and allow comprehensive characterisation of cause. Despite this advance, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic, and radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. Integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge but is facilitated by tissue doppler and colour M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### A 20-year experience with isolated pericardiectomy: analysis of indications and outcomes [^116EP7yM]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Outcome after pericardiectomy depends on many factors, but no large study has provided clarity on the effects of patient variables or cause of pericarditis on patient survival. We report early and late results from a 20-year experience with isolated pericardiectomy.

Methods

From January 1993 to December 2013, 938 patients underwent pericardiectomy at our institution. In order to establish a homogeneous population to analyze the impact of pericardiectomy, we excluded patients with prior chest radiation, malignancy, and concomitant valvular or coronary procedures. We identified a cohort of 521 who underwent isolated pericardiectomy; of these, 513 patients gave consent for research and comprise the cohort for this analysis; median age at operation was 57 years (range, 18–84 years) and 363 (71%) were men. Indications for pericardiectomy were effusive/chronic relapsing pericarditis in 158 (31%) and pericardial constriction in 355 (69%). Prior coronary artery bypass grafting had been performed in 84 patients (14%). Median preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 60% (range, 24%-80%), and 77% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV.

Results

Surgical approach was median sternotomy in 412 (80%), left thoracotomy in 71 (14%), and clamshell in 30 (5%). Extent of pericardial resection was radical in 414 (81%), subtotal in 71 (14%), and completion in 28 (5%). Cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 205 (40%). Overall mortality was 12/513 (2.3%); 3/158 (1.9%) for the effusive/chronic relapsing group versus 9/355 (2.5%) for the constriction group (P = 0.65). In the absence of multivariate predictors, which could not be identified, univariate predictors associated with increased risk of early death included lower left ventricular ejection fraction (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; p = 0.03) and preoperative renal insufficiency (HR, 9.9; P < .001). Median duration of follow-up was 29 months (maximum 20.5 years) and overall 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 80%, 60%, and 38%, respectively. Overall survival according to surgical indication was higher in the effusive/chronic relapsing group when compared with the constriction cohort (P < .001). Independent predictors associated with increased risk of overall mortality identified on multivariate analysis included older age (HR, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, [1.03, 1.07]; P < .001), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, [1.03, 2.2]; p = 0.02), diabetes (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, [1.2, 2.7]; p = 0.004), completion pericardiectomy (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, [1.2, 4.7]; p = 0.01), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, [1.5, 3.9]; p = 0.004). During the follow-up period, 80% of patients were free from NYHA functional class III/IV symptoms at 5 years and 78% at 10 years.

Conclusions

Whereas early mortality after isolated pericardiectomy is low irrespective of the indication for surgery, late follow-up demonstrates better outcomes after pericardiectomy for effusive/chronic relapsing pericarditis compared with pericardial constriction. Importantly, the majority of patients were free from significant heart failure symptoms during follow-up.

### Constrictive pericarditis after cardiac surgery [^111AL4oC]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis may develop as a midterm or late complication of cardiac surgery. Owing to limited incidence and scarce reports in the literature the pathophysiologic determinants of such conditions are scarcely known, although a number of mechanisms have been implicated. This disease often poses major diagnostic issues as its clinical picture at presentation is nonspecific, may develop at any moment during the postoperative follow-up, and transthoracic echocardiography may be not suggestive of the diagnosis. The present paper aims at critically revising the available literature on the topic, emphasizing the need to keep a high level of suspicion for all surgeons and physicians involved in the long-term care of cardiac surgery patients.

### Pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis: analysis of outcomes [^112Ti1rD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is caused by pericardial inflammation and fibrosis, leading to diastolic heart failure. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion because it often can mimic restrictive myocardial disease and cardiac tamponade and can be associated with severe tricuspid regurgitation and chronic liver disease. Patients who remain undiagnosed can experience a 90% mortality rate, and for those who undergo pericardiectomy, the survival rate varies significantly, depending on the underlying etiology and preoperative functional class of the patient. In this article, the authors review the pathophysiology, echocardiographic findings, management, and surgical outcomes of constrictive pericarditis to aid the cardiothoracic anesthesiologist in the perioperative management of this disorder.

### Hemodynamics of constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy [^1113NYhp]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) are indolent disabling diseases of diastolic function. The two conditions share common pathophysiologic features, resulting in similar and overlapping clinical presentations, echocardiographic findings, and hemodynamic characteristics. However, their clinical course differs, as CP is surgically curable whereas RCM is a chronic condition managed medically. Separating these two entities is based on delineation of anatomic and physiologic derangements employing multimodality hemodynamic interrogation by advanced imaging techniques (Echo-Doppler, CT, and especially MRI) combined with sophisticated invasive hemodynamics.

### COVID-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: a case report [^115MnNNj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

As the world community has experienced years of disease, the lingering effects of COVID-19 — the so-called 'long COVID-19' — have begun to appear. Persistent symptoms remained in subsets of patients — some were minimally debilitating, while others were crippling. Some of the acute cardiovascular consequences of the infection are chronic problems, such as COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this report is to describe another cardiac pathology associated with COVID-19: constrictive pericarditis. This additional chronic entity, constrictive pericarditis, can now be added to the growing list of cardiac COVID-19 cases. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of this condition, along with the findings and treatment with pericardiectomy, are described in this case report. We believe that this is the first report of this condition — COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy.

### Role of echocardiography in the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis [^115rRioR]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical recognition of constrictive pericarditis (CP) is important but challenging. In addition to Doppler echocardiography, newer echocardiographic techniques for deciphering myocardial deformation have facilitated the noninvasive recognition of CP and its differentiation from restrictive cardiomyopathy. In a patient with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction, echocardiographic demonstration of exaggerated interventricular interdependence, relatively preserved left ventricular longitudinal deformation, and attenuated circumferential deformation is diagnostic of CP. This review is a concise update on the pathophysiology and hemodynamic features of CP, the transmural and torsional mechanics of CP, and the merits and pitfalls of the various echocardiographic techniques used in the diagnosis of CP.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis have pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful. When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

### Constrictive pericarditis complicating cardiac transplantation [^111ZSup1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis is a disease characterized by progressive pericardial fibrosis. If left untreated it can lead to progressive heart failure and can be severely disabling. Medical management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in combination with colchicine is promising in the acute phase of the disease but for more chronic cases pericardiectomy offers the best chance for hemodynamic recovery. Constrictive pericarditis after cardiac transplantation is a rare phenomenon. Current literature suggests that early pericardiectomy may be the most effective treatment in this subset of patients as well.

Pericardiocentesis — indications, sequencing, and approach — states that "Pericardiocentesis is therapeutically performed in cases of impending or established cardiac tamponade, especially in urgent or emergency settings with echocardiography guidance, and diagnostically when there is concern for specific causes, such as bacterial, tuberculous, or malignant etiologies", while "In patients with an inflammatory pericardial effusion and no concern for tamponade, anti-inflammatory therapy should be pursued prior to pericardiocentesis". Approaches are outlined as "Anatomical approaches to pericardiocentesis include subxiphoid, apical, and parasternal. In an emergency, a subxiphoid or apical approach is preferred", with image guidance where "Echocardiography, fluoroscopy, and/or computed tomography may be utilized to guide the pericardiocentesis procedure", and escalation that "Surgical creation of a pericardial window is considered in select patients with recurrent large pericardial effusions and/or cardiac tamponade despite prior pericardiocentesis" and "In certain rare cases, radical pericardiectomy surgery may be indicated for recurrent pericardial effusions, even following the creation of a pericardial window, especially when there is concomitant medically refractory constrictive pericarditis or pericarditis".

### Long-term outcomes of pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis [^117LiirA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Constrictive pericarditis is caused by thickening of the pericardium. It causes diastolic dysfunction and at the end the filling of heart is impeded by the constricted pericardium surrounding the heart. The aetiology is idiopathic, prior cardiac surgery, postradiotherapy, postinfective, connective tissue disease-related, neoplastic, uremic, sarcoidosis, and miscellaneous. After occurrence of constriction; the symptoms related to fluid overload and reduced cardiac output are progressive in nature.

The study conducted by Ling et al. revealed that the majority of patients presented with congestive heart failure. With decreasing frequencies the patients had presented with chest pain, abdominal symptoms, cardiac tamponade, atrial arrhythmia and frank liver disease.

Definitive treatment for chronic constrictive pericarditis is pericardiectomy. In this paper we retrospectively examined the data of pericadiectomies of 47 cases that were operated between 1992 and 2014.

Pericarditis episode definitions and recurrence rates — "Acute pericarditis refers to the diagnosis with full resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks". "Recurrent pericarditis is diagnosed when there is a relapse of symptoms following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks after the initial flare, with completion of medical therapy". "Recurrence rates after an initial episode vary from 15% to 30% and further increase to 50% after a first recurrence".

Pericardial diseases center of excellence — indications and functions — are outlined, noting that a pericardial diseases center (PDC) offers a structured solution to complex pericardial disorders and is particularly effective in improving care and outcomes for patients with recurrent or refractory pericarditis or frequent follow‑ups while reducing emergency visits and hospitalizations. Indications for referral include recurrent, incessant or chronic pericarditis, suspected or confirmed constrictive pericarditis, large or complex pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage or window, and situations when advanced therapies such as biologics and pericardiectomy are being considered. PDCs also screen patients for clinical trials and monitor responses and adverse events of emerging treatments, and these centers should provide access to specialized resources including multimodality imaging (echocardiography, CMR, CCT), rheumatology, infectious diseases, genetics, cardiothoracic surgery consultation, and specialty pharmacies; advanced practice providers play major roles and clear communication pathways ensure timely referrals and follow‑ups.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac computed tomography (CCT) — CMR has become a valuable comprehensive second-line imaging modality in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and surveillance of pericarditis; CMR should be considered in patients with acute complicated, incessant, recurrent, or chronic pericarditis, especially when diagnostic uncertainties exist, in those who do not respond to standard first-line therapies and/or in whom escalation of therapies is planned, and in patients with suspected pericardial complications; main CMR findings include pericardial late gadolinium enhancement on phase-sensitivity inversion recovery sequence (ideally fat-suppressed) indicating neovascularization/inflammation, increased pericardial signal on T2-short tau inversion recovery indicating edema, pericardial thickening (> 3 mm) especially on black-blood spin echo sequence, and pericardial effusion; CCT is the preferred modality to assess pericardial calcifications in constrictive pericarditis.

### Uremic pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and constrictive pericarditis in end-stage renal disease: insights and pathophysiology [^114zx6yh]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

A rising prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has led to a rise in ESRD-related pericardial syndromes, calling for a better understanding of its pathophysiology, diagnoses, and management. Uremic pericarditis, the most common manifestation of uremic pericardial disease, is a contemporary problem that calls for intensive hemodialysis, anti-inflammatories, and often, drainage of large inflammatory pericardial effusions. Likewise, asymptomatic pericardial effusions can become large and impact the hemodynamics of patients on chronic hemodialysis. Constrictive pericarditis is also well documented in this population, ultimately resulting in pericardiectomy for definitive treatment. The management of pericardial diseases in ESRD patients involves internists, cardiologists, and nephrologists. Current guidelines lack clarity with respect to the management of pericardial processes in the ESRD population. Our review aims to describe the etiology, classification, clinical manifestations, diagnostic imaging tools, and treatment options of pericardial diseases in this population.

Pericardial function and mechanics — key roles and pressure–volume behavior are summarized as follows: The pericardium encompasses mechanical, membranous, metabolic, and ligamentous features and mechanically limits short-term cardiac distention to optimize pressure–volume relations of cardiac chambers and their output, mitigating respiratory/positional effects and enhancing compliance. The pressure–volume relationship is dynamic with small volume increases causing minimal intracavitary pressure change; above the upper limit of normal cardiac filling there is a sharp transition where further volume increases result in disproportionate pressure rises, reflecting limited reserve capacity and decreased compliance with ventricular interdependence. Despite these roles, absence of the pericardium does not alter cardiac function. Table 1 highlights specific functions, including mechanical (limits short-term cardiac distention, facilitates chamber coupling/interaction, maintains pressure–volume relations), membranous/serosal (lubricates, reduces friction; equalizes gravitational, hydrostatic, and inertial forces; mechanical barrier to infection), and ligamentous (limits displacement of the heart; neutralizes effects of respiration and body position; contributes to apparent compliance).

Pericarditis — clinical diagnostic evaluation and multimodality imaging define diagnostic likelihood and imaging roles. "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive presentation" plus "Plus ≥ 1 additional finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, and 2+ = definite diagnosis)" establishes diagnostic categorization; additional findings include "Pericardial friction rub", "ECG changes (diffuse ST-elevation, PR-depression)", "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (CRP, ESR)", "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (echo preferred, CMR, CCT)", and "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (CMR preferred, CCT)". Imaging roles are specified as "Echo: assess pericardial effusion and constrictive physiology", "CMR (if indicated): assess and grade pericardial thickness, inflammation, effusion and constrictive physiology", and "CCT (if indicated): assess pericardial thickness, calcification, constrictive physiology, pre-operative planning", with abbreviations defined (e.g., electrocardiogram [ECG], C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR], cardiac computed tomography [CCT], echocardiography [echo]).

### Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated constrictive pericarditis [^1152DmXD]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This report documents a rare case of COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis (CP) in the setting of a recent COVID-19 infection. A 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension and gout presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. His hospital course was complicated by a large pericardial effusion; an emergent bedside transthoracic echocardiography was concerning for cardiac tamponade, so pericardiocentesis was performed. A workup with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed changes consistent with a diagnosis of CP. Viral and idiopathic aetiologies are the most common cause of CP in the developed world, with COVID-19 now a proposed predisposing viral illness. The virus induces systemic inflammation and pericardial changes that can lead to CP physiology. Imaging modalities including echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance play an integral role in confirming the diagnosis.

### Hiding in plain sight; constrictive pericarditis [^114zZdGv]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a case of constrictive pericarditis that was especially difficult to diagnose. The patient presented with generalised oedema, dyspnoea and pleural effusions. History was significant for prior polysubstance abuse but was otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination revealed only jugular venous distention. CT demonstrated a normal pericardium with pleural effusions. Echocardiography showed mildly elevated right ventricular pressures with dyssynergic motion of the ventricular septum. No intervention was being carried out, but 1 month later further evaluation with a right and left heart catheterisation showed the classical square-root sign with equalisation of diastolic pressures in both ventricles as well as ventricular interdependence. Idiopathic constrictive pericarditis was thus diagnosed with a subsequent pericardial stripping which confirmed a thickened pericardium encasing the heart.

### Right ventricular diastolic disorders… [^116SrxjV]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The differential diagnoses of cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, and right ventricular infarction are often difficult because of the right ventricular diastolic dysfunction that frequently dominates the clinical picture in these disorders. In cardiac tamponade, key diagnostic signs are pulsus paradoxus, evidence of pericardial fluid by echocardiography or computed tomography, and equalization of diastolic pressures. In constrictive pericarditis, prominent findings include Kussmaul's sign, evidence of pericardial calcification, equalization of diastolic pressures, and the "square-root" sign. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may be distinguished from constrictive pericarditis by the absence of pericardial calcification and, in amyloidosis, by a speckled pattern on two-dimensional echocardiogram and abnormal technetium Tc 99m pyrophosphate uptake during radionuclide examination.

With effusive-constrictive pericarditis, hemodynamic signs of tamponade change to constriction with pericardial aspiration. In right ventricular infarction, constrictive-restrictive signs, as well as pulsus paradoxus, may be present.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis… [^116ZbWs4]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis and pericardial tamponade can be life-threatening. Observations Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with presence of 2 or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine; new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression; a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small; or a pericardial friction rub. In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations.

Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis. Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence. With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months. Corticosteroids are often used if pericarditis does not improve with NSAIDs and colchicine. In certain patients with multiple recurrences, which can occur for several years, interleukin 1 blockers have demonstrated efficacy and may be preferred to corticosteroids.

Treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine leads to a favorable prognosis in most patients, although 15% to 30% of patients develop recurrence. Patients with multiple recurrent pericarditis can have a disease duration of several years or more, are often treated with corticosteroids, and IL-1 blockers may be used for selected patients as steroid-sparing therapy.
