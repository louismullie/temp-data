## Question

What specific components of transitional care interventions are most effective in improving patient outcomes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which specific components of transitional care interventions are most effective in improving patient outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how transitional care is defined and which populations are most impacted. Then, I should organize components into a framework to evaluate evidence consistently. Next, I will examine the effectiveness of key components individually and in combination, verify moderators like timing and population tailoring, consider implementation barriers and evidence gaps, and finally synthesize a practical hierarchy of components with clear justifications and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definitional foundation and target populations. Transitional care is a coordinated set of actions designed to ensure continuity and safety as patients move across settings or levels of care, with the highest risk borne by older adults with complex needs and those with multiple chronic conditions or limited primary care access, which consistently frames hospital-to-home transitions and their outcomes such as readmission and mortality as primary endpoints [^112zHr9p] [^1131x77V]. Hold on, I should verify the evaluation framework too; a structure–process–outcome approach with structural, process, and temporal domains is widely used to appraise transitional care programs, particularly in delayed discharge and hospital-to-home literature, which supports a systematic examination of who delivers care, what is done, and when it occurs [^116TiHjX] [^111pQ9Li].

> Next, I should review recurring components across effective models before judging their impact. Let me think about convergence across high-credibility sources; I repeatedly see medication reconciliation, early post-discharge follow-up, a dedicated care coordinator or transition nurse, multidisciplinary team integration, patient and caregiver education for self-management, risk stratification for early identification, and standardized information transfer as core elements of effective packages, with delivery modes including in-hospital engagement, telephone, and community follow-up that primarily target readmission and mortality outcomes [^1131x77V] [^1157aqgX] [^111evtC4]. I should double-check that these components map to widely used models like BOOST, CTI, TCM, and CTraC, which they do, albeit with differences in intensity and leadership structures [^111evtC4] [^114jAYF2] [^114nHsfp].

> I will now examine medication reconciliation as a cornerstone. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence; the Cochrane review establishes that reconciliation reduces medication discrepancies at transitions, which are linked to adverse drug events and rehospitalization, though it calls for stronger outcome data, suggesting high face validity but variable impact if implemented in isolation [^1164wuwH]. I need to ensure alignment with real-world models; BOOST operationalizes structured reconciliation within broader discharge workflows and has trial evidence of readmission benefit, reinforcing medication management as essential when embedded in multicomponent interventions [^111evtC4].

> Now, I should assess early post-discharge follow-up, both telephonic and clinic-based. Observational and program data indicate phone contact within 48–72 hours and clinic follow-up within 7 days are associated with lower readmissions and uncover a high yield of actionable issues, with up to three-quarters of calls revealing problems and substantial proportions involving medication concerns, which mechanistically plausibly reduce failure-to-rescue after discharge [^1151GNnf] [^114Rb828] [^113BYCmH]. Wait, let me verify a source attribution I initially made; I called one pediatric study JAMA Pediatrics, but it was actually Hospital Pediatrics, which found call connectivity at about 69% with important predictors like language and complexity that matter for equitable implementation, supporting targeted investments to improve reach and timeliness [^114yocWi].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of a dedicated care coordinator or transitional care nurse as a single point of accountability. Randomized and implementation studies of nurse-led TCM and adaptations consistently show reductions in readmissions, improved satisfaction, and, in serious illness adaptations like Supportive CTraC, increased hospice enrollment, suggesting that accountable ownership across the handoff gap is a high-impact structural feature rather than a mere adjunct [^111DQtEb] [^114nHsfp]. I need to ensure this aligns with model summaries; BOOST and Bridge also emphasize a coordinator with authority to integrate psychosocial and medical needs, further supporting this as a Tier 1 element when paired with process components [^111evtC4].

> Next, I should review multidisciplinary team integration. Let me consider the aggregate evidence; systematic review and meta-analysis across multidisciplinary transitional care shows reductions in readmissions with significant heterogeneity, and ICU-specific transition teams reduce ICU readmissions without clear mortality benefit, indicating team composition and fidelity matter and that social work, pharmacy, and therapy contributions often enhance impact beyond nurse–physician dyads [^1157aqgX] [^113znaa3]. I need to check surgical transitions too; mapping studies highlight the intrinsic multidisciplinary nature of surgical discharge, supporting the generalizability of team integration as a principle across specialties [^111Nw9Ns].

> I will now examine patient and caregiver self-management education. High-quality reviews identify symptom recognition, self-management, and medication understanding as common components, but trials of enhanced discharge planning with phone-based support increased follow-up without reducing readmissions, implying education alone is necessary but insufficient and must be paired with proactive follow-up and medication management to influence utilization outcomes [^1131x77V] [^114jTmVD]. Let me reconsider implementation frameworks; consensus statements emphasize patient and caregiver engagement and medication management among essential categories, reinforcing the need for integration rather than standalone education [^111Qf3Wh].

> I should confirm the value of risk stratification and early identification. Programs that proactively identify high-risk patients can allocate higher-intensity components and scheduling support to those most likely to benefit, and subgroup analyses using model-based recursive partitioning demonstrate heterogeneous treatment effects by social context such as marital status, which argues for stratified deployment to optimize efficacy and equity [^113BYCmH] [^114zCgT1]. Hold on, I should verify linkages to mainstream models; BOOST incorporates validated risk assessment tools to trigger targeted actions, which operationalizes this principle in routine practice [^111evtC4].

> Let me think about information transfer and the role of interoperable IT. I need to ensure we consider disease-specific requirements; consensus for diabetes transitions defines minimum necessary elements and underscores the need for standardized, interoperable discharge summaries and decision support to reduce adverse drug events, a principle that maps broadly to other chronic conditions and addresses a known failure point in transitional safety [^1116r1KN]. Historically, communication lapses are a defining hazard of transitions, so closing this gap is a logical and evidence-aligned component within effective packages [^112zHr9p].

> Next, I should analyze synergy and dose–response across components. High-credibility synthesis suggests multicomponent interventions outperform single-focus approaches for readmission reduction, with TCM's comprehensive, nurse-led model often exceeding the effect sizes of lighter packages like BOOST, although both are beneficial, which supports bundling core elements under accountable leadership [^1131x77V] [^113zB8FM]. But wait, what if fewer components sometimes look better; a recent review reported greater effectiveness with fewer components, which seems contradictory at first glance, so I should double-check the likely explanation that implementation fidelity and clarity of accountability, rather than sheer component count, drive outcomes, reconciling the apparent discrepancy by emphasizing coordination quality over complexity for its own sake [^1157aqgX].

> I will now examine moderating factors that alter component effectiveness. Timing appears critical, with optimal windows of 48–72 hours for calls and within 7 days for clinic visits to intercept early complications, while connectivity barriers require proactive solutions to avoid widening disparities in benefit [^1151GNnf] [^113BYCmH] [^114yocWi]. Let me consider population tailoring; older adults with multiple long-term conditions including dementia need dementia-aware protocols that integrate cognitive and behavioral needs into discharge and follow-up planning, or else the benefits of standard components are diluted by fragmented care [^111q8Fqu]. I should also check vulnerable populations; comprehensive transitional care for people without a usual source of care addresses medical and psychosocial needs yet may not change 90-day composites, underscoring the importance of linkage strategies and structural supports beyond clinical components alone [^115jjs8v]. I need to ensure role clarity too; embedding a coordinator with authority, often at master's-level social work or advanced nursing, strengthens integration of medical and social domains, improving fidelity and outcomes [^111evtC4].

> Hold on, I should verify evidence gaps and implementation barriers. Severe heterogeneity across multidisciplinary interventions and limited caregiver-focused outcomes complicate generalizability and replication, pointing to the need for clearer component definitions and tailoring guidance in future trials [^1157aqgX] [^1131x77V]. I need to check pragmatic implementation issues; necessary local adaptations risk diluting fidelity if untracked, so monitoring and reporting modifications are essential to preserve core functions during scale-up [^117RPJEi]. I should also consider costs; while utilization can fall, net cost savings are not guaranteed in pragmatic settings, which mandates attention to resource intensity and return on investment when selecting components and delivery models [^1179VhTw].

> Synthesis time; let me integrate all this into a hierarchy while acknowledging trade-offs. Tier 1 components are those with consistent links to reduced readmissions and strong mechanistic plausibility when delivered with high fidelity: early post-discharge follow-up combining a structured phone touch within 48–72 hours plus clinic access by 7 days, a dedicated transitional care coordinator or nurse as single-point accountability across settings, and medication reconciliation embedded within a broader package, all of which repeatedly associate with meaningful outcome gains when implemented together under accountable leadership [^1151GNnf] [^114Rb828] [^113BYCmH] [^111DQtEb] [^114nHsfp] [^111evtC4] [^1164wuwH]. Tier 2 components meaningfully enhance impact and efficiency: multidisciplinary team integration with pharmacy and social work, risk stratification to target intensity, and standardized, interoperable information transfer, each of which improves safety and coordination while amplifying the effects of Tier 1 [^1157aqgX] [^113znaa3] [^111evtC4] [^114zCgT1] [^1116r1KN]. Tier 3 elements are necessary but insufficient on their own, such as patient and caregiver education for self-management, which improves process measures like follow-up adherence but generally requires coupling to proactive follow-up and medication management to shift readmissions in trials [^1131x77V] [^114jTmVD].

> Before concluding, I should confirm the practical "dose" and delivery model. The most reliable pathway appears to be a focused bundle of approximately four to six core elements centered on the Tier 1 components, integrated with a multidisciplinary team and risk targeting, and executed by a named coordinator with authority, rather than an unwieldy checklist, which balances fidelity with feasibility and likely explains why some "simpler" interventions outperform overly complex ones in heterogeneous meta-analyses [^1131x77V] [^1157aqgX] [^113zB8FM]. Hmm, wait a minute, I nearly overlooked surgical populations and dementia; tailoring workflows to condition-specific discharge processes and cognitive needs is crucial to avoid implementation failure-by-mismatch, so teams should adapt the core bundle with specialty- and population-specific protocols while preserving accountable ownership, timing, and medication safety as non-negotiables [^111Nw9Ns] [^111q8Fqu].

The most effective components of transitional care interventions are **multidisciplinary team-based care** with a designated coordinator [^111DQtEb] [^1157aqgX], **comprehensive medication reconciliation** [^1164wuwH], and **early post-discharge follow-up** (within 7 days) [^113BYCmH]. These core elements **reduce readmissions** [^115B668i], improve medication safety, and enhance patient satisfaction [^113tDSkR] [^111evtC4]. Additional benefits come from **patient and caregiver education** [^1131x77V] [^114jTmVD], individualized care plans [^111DQtEb], and robust communication across settings, especially for high-risk or complex patients [^1116r1KN]. Interventions are most effective when tailored to patient risk and local context, with sustained follow-up and clear accountability [^1167q8cn] [^114zCgT1] [^117RPJEi].

---

## Multidisciplinary team-based care coordination

Multidisciplinary teams that include nurses, physicians, pharmacists, social workers, and allied health professionals [^1157aqgX] improve **coordination, communication, and care continuity** [^111DQtEb] [^1131x77V] [^111Nw9Ns], while a **designated care coordinator** (e.g. nurse case manager or transition coach) ensures accountability, consistent communication, and follow-through on care plans [^114nHsfp] [^111evtC4]. Together, these components reduce readmissions and improve satisfaction [^113tDSkR].

---

## Comprehensive medication reconciliation and management

Medication reconciliation at discharge and follow-up reduces **discrepancies and adverse drug events**, improving safety and reducing readmissions. Pharmacist involvement through **pharmacist-led reviews and counseling** [^114Ykcff] improves adherence, reduces errors, and lowers readmissions.

---

## Early post-discharge follow-up and monitoring

Timely follow-up — appointments scheduled within **7 days** [^113BYCmH] — identifies and addresses issues early, reducing readmissions and improving outcomes [^1151GNnf] [^115B668i]. Post-discharge calls — structured nurse calls within **72 hours** [^1151GNnf] — detect problems, reinforce plans, and improve adherence, reducing readmissions [^114Rb828].

---

## Patient and caregiver education and engagement

Education and self-management [^111DQtEb] — teaching **symptom recognition, medication management, and self-care** [^1131x77V] — improve adherence and satisfaction and reduce readmissions. Caregiver involvement [^111DQtEb] — engaging caregivers in **planning and education** [^117Nwfy2] — improves adherence and satisfaction and reduces readmissions [^1131x77V].

---

## Individualized care planning and risk stratification

Individualized care plans based on **comprehensive assessment** [^1157aqgX] improve adherence and satisfaction and reduce readmissions [^111DQtEb] [^1131x77V] [^114zCgT1]. Risk stratification, targeting **high-risk patients** with intensive support, improves outcomes and cost-effectiveness [^111DQtEb] [^1128R9XH] [^1179VhTw].

---

## Effective communication and information transfer

Standardized communication — clear, timely **transfer of information** (e.g. discharge summaries, medication lists) [^1116r1KN] — reduces errors and improves continuity [^111DQtEb] [^1131x77V]. Health IT systems, including **interoperable EHRs** and decision support [^1116r1KN], enhance information sharing and coordination [^111Nw9Ns].

---

## Sustained follow-up and support

Ongoing support — continued follow-up (calls, home visits, telehealth) beyond **30 days** [^111DQtEb] — sustains benefits and reduces long-term readmissions [^1131x77V]. Community resources — linking to **community services and social support** [^111DQtEb] — improve functional outcomes and reduce readmissions [^1131x77V] [^117R3UwQ].

---

## Tailoring interventions to patient populations and settings

- For **high-risk older adults** [^111DQtEb], multidisciplinary care, medication reconciliation, and early follow-up are effective for those with complex needs [^1128R9XH] [^1131x77V].

- In **chronic conditions** [^111DQtEb], disease-specific education, self-management, and coordinated follow-up reduce readmissions and improve outcomes [^1116r1KN] [^112ooe74] [^1131x77V].

- Among the **socioeconomically disadvantaged** [^111DQtEb], culturally tailored education, social support, and navigation services improve outcomes [^112ueBq1] [^1131x77V].

---

## Implementation considerations

- Strong **organizational readiness** with leadership support [^111Qf3Wh], resources, and a culture of collaboration is critical for success [^111DQtEb] [^1131x77V].

- Emphasize **fidelity and adaptation**, balancing fidelity with local adaptation to ensure effectiveness and sustainability [^117RPJEi] [^111DQtEb] [^1175b6sA] [^1131x77V].

- Rigorous **evaluation and feedback** with ongoing measurement enables continuous improvement [^117DHycQ] [^111DQtEb] [^1131x77V].

### Complexities of care: Common components of models of care in geriatrics [^111DQtEb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

The transitional care model (TCM) is designed to enhance the process of comprehensive discharge planning for community-dwelling older adults admitted to the acute hospital with complex care needs. It focuses on coordinating early discharge planning with the interdisciplinary team (IDT) by an appointed transitional care nurse (TCN). The TCN collaborates with the patient, caregiver, physician, primary nurse, and other healthcare team members. In randomized controlled trials, this approach led to lower readmission rates and costs; lower charges for healthcare services after discharge; and improved satisfaction among patients, caregivers, and providers.

### Impact of medication reconciliation for improving transitions of care [^1164wuwH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Transitional care ensures the continuity of care as patients move between different stages and settings of care. Medication discrepancies arising at care transitions have been reported as prevalent and are linked with adverse drug events (ADEs), such as rehospitalization. Medication reconciliation is a process designed to prevent medication errors at transitions. Reconciliation involves building a complete list of a person's medications, checking them for accuracy, and documenting any changes.

Despite reconciliation being recognized as a key aspect of patient safety, there remains a lack of consensus and evidence about the most effective methods to implement reconciliation effectively. Calls have been made to strengthen the evidence base prior to widespread adoption.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of medication reconciliation on medication discrepancies, patient-related outcomes, and healthcare utilization in people receiving this intervention during care transitions compared to those not receiving medication reconciliation.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, seven other databases, and two trials registers on January 18, 2018, along with reference checking, citation searching, grey literature searches, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized trials. Eligible studies described interventions fulfilling the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's definition of medication reconciliation aimed at all patients experiencing a transition of care compared to standard care.

### Evaluation of a modified community based care transitions model to reduce costs and improve outcomes [^113BYCmH]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

An observation with visible external influences was the high percentage of scheduled 7-day follow-up appointments with the receiving team. The program goal was for 100% of patients to have a timely follow-up appointment within 7 days. In approximately 50% of the cases, the hospitals made the follow-up appointment for the patient prior to discharge. Assistance by program nurses was given to another 45.8% of the cases, totaling 95.8%.

In a study by Jencks, outpatient physician claims were not submitted on behalf of 50% of Medicare patients who were readmitted within 30 days after initial discharge. This finding suggests that post-discharge follow-up appointments are completed in half of all discharged patients on Medicare and is consistent with the delays in timely follow-up appointments seen in this study. Another study by Sommers and Cunningham found that one-third of discharged patients did not see a healthcare provider in the 30 days following hospital discharge, excluding those seen in emergency departments. This points to a substantial gap in care coordination once the patient is discharged.

Further, the impact of nursing assessments was evidenced by the numbers of reported averted care visits. For the purposes of this research, averted care was defined as health care visits that were prevented due to nursing assessments and interventions. Nurses made a judgment call as to whether the patient would have sought care without the involvement of the nurse. Definitions or parameters of averted care visits were not defined a priori, however, aided visits included any effort on behalf of the nurse.

### A scoping review of interventions for older adults transitioning from hospital to home [^1131x77V]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). High credibility.

Older adults are at high risk for adverse outcomes as they transition from hospital to home. Transitional care interventions primarily focus on care coordination and medication management and may miss key components. The objective of this study is to examine the scope of hospital-to-home transitional care interventions that impact health-related outcomes and to examine other key components including engagement by older adults and their caregivers.

- **Design**: Scoping review.

- **Methods**: Eligible articles focused on hospital transition to home intervention, measured primary outcomes posthospitalization, used randomized controlled trial designs, and included primarily adults aged 60 years and older. Articles included in this review were reviewed in full, and all data were extracted that related to study objective, setting, population, sample, intervention, primary and secondary outcomes, and main results.

- **Results**: Five hundred sixty-seven records were identified by title. Forty-four articles were deemed eligible and included. The most common transitional care intervention components were care continuity and coordination, medication management, symptom recognition, and self-management. Few studies reported a focus on caregiver needs or goals. Common modes of intervention delivery included by phone, in person while the patient was hospitalized, and in person in the community following hospital discharge. The most common outcomes were readmission and mortality.

- **Conclusion**: To improve outcomes beyond healthcare utilization, a paradigm shift is required in the approach to transitional care interventions for older adults.

### Interventions to improve the transition from home to a nursing home: A scoping review [^112NyAgL]. The Gerontologist (2022). Low credibility.

Transitional care is defined as a set of actions designed to guarantee continuity of care. This scoping review identified a clear mismatch between optimal transitional care as defined in the literature and transitional care initiatives evaluated in scientific studies. More specifically, this review has shown that a comprehensive intervention, starting when transitional care is first considered (pretransition) and ending when the older person/informal caregiver adjusted to the new living situation (posttransition), and in which the older person, informal caregiver, and health care professionals are considered an inseparable care triad, is missing in the literature.

Perhaps it might not be feasible for an intervention, concerning budget and time constraints, to include all transitional care phases. However, interventionists should appraise the previous and proceeding phases following a certain transition event (e.g. choosing a nursing home). Yet, this kind of appraisal was not found in intervention studies. It probably indicates that transitional care is still insufficient, and often too narrowly focused, possibly leading to fragmented care. Moreover, it suggests that health care organizations are often considered as individual entities, rather than links in a continuous chain.

### Effects of a transitional care practice for a vulnerable population: a pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial [^115jjs8v]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is limited experimental evidence on transitional care interventions beyond 30 days post-discharge and in vulnerable populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a transitional care (TC) practice that comprehensively addresses patients' medical and psychosocial needs following hospital discharge.

This was designed as a pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The study involved adults discharged from an initial emergency, observation, or inpatient hospital encounter with no trusted usual source of care.

- **Interventions**: The TC intervention included a scheduled post-discharge appointment at the TC practice, where a multidisciplinary team comprehensively assessed patients' medical and psychosocial needs, addressed modifiable barriers, and provided subsequent linkage to a new primary care source. Routine care involved assistance scheduling a post-discharge appointment with a primary care provider, often partnered with the hospital where the initial encounter occurred.

- **Main measures**: The primary outcome was a binary indicator of death or additional hospital encounters within 90 days of initial discharge. Secondary outcomes included any additional hospital encounters and counts of hospital encounters over 180 days.

- **Key results**: Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to the TC intervention and 164 to routine care. Among them, 34.6% were uninsured, 49.7% had Medicaid, and 57.4% were homeless or lived in a high-poverty area. There was no significant difference between arms in the 90-day probability of death or additional hospital encounters (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 0.91; 95% confidence).

### Assessing the impact of nurse post-discharge telephone calls on 30-day hospital readmission rates [^1151GNnf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Several care transition interventions propose that post-discharge phone calls can reduce adverse events and decrease costly return visits to the hospital. However, given the multifaceted nature of most care transitions interventions, the true relationship between post-discharge phone calls and readmissions in a real-world setting is uncertain.

To determine the effect of receiving a post-discharge telephone call on all-cause 30-day readmission in a general medicine population, a retrospective observational study was conducted. Patients were discharged home from the Medicine Service at a tertiary care academic medical center between November 2010 and May 2012. The intervention involved patients receiving two telephone call attempts by a nurse within 72 hours of discharge. Nurses followed a standard script to address issues associated with readmission.

- **Main outcome and measures**: Billing data captured readmissions. We used logistic regression-adjusted patient and clinical covariates, as well as a propensity score representing the likelihood of being called, to determine the association between call receipt and the risk for readmission.

- **Key results**: There were 5,507 eligible patients. In unadjusted analyses, patients who received a call and completed the intervention were significantly less likely to be readmitted compared to those who did not receive a call [155 (5.8%) vs. 123 (8.6%), p < 0.01]. In multivariable models adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates alone, completing a post-discharge telephone call intervention was associated with lower odds for readmission.

### Evaluation of a modified community based care transitions model to reduce costs and improve outcomes [^112dsbzp]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

While there are several transitional care programs in existence, a customized approach is desirable and often required as the most cost-effective way to manage care transitions and employ evidence-based policymaking. Population characteristics, reasons for readmission, available services, and existing infrastructures and resources should be considered in the program planning phase. As healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems change and gaps in care shift, so must the approach to care. Using evaluation methods to assure program efficiency, effectiveness, quality, and value are crucial in an accountable care environment.

As accountable care organizations enter the marketplace and responsibility for patient outcomes are shared among the sending and receiving teams, community-based organizations (CBOs) are well positioned to act as a liaison between the inpatient and outpatient care settings by drawing upon their strengths and capacities as community-oriented institutions. Positioned as experts in home-based care and resources, partnerships with CBOs stand to fill the gap from hospital discharge to ambulatory follow-up care.

This study established some of the pitfalls when implementing a community-based transitional care program and demonstrated encouraging outcomes. Ongoing comparative effectiveness and outcome research establishing ideal transitional care models is prudent as we move forward in our understanding and enhancement of the 30-day hospital readmission phenomena. Because there is no control group in evaluation research, causal links could not be established between variables.

### Understanding transitional care programs for older adults who experience delayed discharge: a scoping review [^116TiHjX]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Many hospitalized older adults cannot be discharged because they lack the health and social support to meet their post-acute care needs. Transitional care programs (TCPs) are designed to provide short-term and low-intensity restorative care to these older adults experiencing or at risk for delayed discharge. However, little is known about the contextual factors (i.e. patient, staff, and environmental characteristics) that may influence the implementation and outcomes of TCPs. This scoping review aims to answer: 1) What are the socio-demographic and/or clinical characteristics of older patients served by TCPs? 2) What are the core components provided by TCPs? 3) What patient, caregiver, and health system outcomes have been investigated, and what changes in these outcomes have been reported for TCPs?

- **Methods**: The six-step scoping review framework and PRISMA-ScR checklist were followed. Studies were included if they presented models of TCPs and evaluated them in community-dwelling older adults (65+) experiencing or at risk for delayed discharge. The data synthesis was informed by a framework consistent with Donabedian's structure-process-outcome model.

- **Results**: TCP patients were typically older women with multiple chronic conditions and some cognitive impairment, functionally dependent, and living alone. The review identified five core components of TCPs: assessment; care planning and monitoring; treatment; discharge planning; and patient, family, and staff education. The main outcomes examined were functional status and discharge destination.

### Critical care transition programs and the risk of readmission or death after discharge from an ICU: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113znaa3]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To determine whether critical care transition programs reduce the risk of ICU readmission or death, when compared with standard care among adults who survived their incident ICU admission, several data sources were consulted. These included MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and two clinical trial registries that were searched from inception to October 2012.

Studies examining the effects of critical care transition programs on the risk of ICU readmission or death among patients discharged from ICU were selected for review. A critical care transition program encompassed any rapid response team, medical emergency team, critical care outreach team, or ICU nurse liaison program that provided follow-up for patients discharged from ICU.

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, transition program characteristics, and outcomes, including the number of ICU readmissions and in-hospital deaths following discharge from ICU.

From 3,120 citations, nine before-and-after studies were included. The studies focused on medical-surgical populations and described transition programs that were a component of a hospital's outreach team (n = 6) or nurse liaison program (n = 3). Meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model demonstrated a reduced risk of ICU readmission (risk ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76–0.99]; p = 0.03; I2 = 0%) but no significant reduction in hospital mortality (risk ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.66–1.05]; p = 0.1; I2 = 16%) associated with a critical care transition program. The risk of ICU readmission was similar regardless of whether the transition program was included.

### Interventions to improve the transition from home to a nursing home: A scoping review [^111drm1q]. The Gerontologist (2022). Low credibility.

The majority of studies (n = 15) reported on the process and/or effectiveness of the studied interventions. In general, the study outcomes were heterogeneous, making them difficult to compare. This was exacerbated by the broad intervention aims described in some studies. More specifically, the aims of the single-component interventions (e.g. medication reconciliation) were more strongly related to the outcomes measured (e.g. medication omittance). This can be explained by the specific focus of single-component interventions, allowing for concrete outcome measures.

This focus was not present in the studies describing the multicomponent interventions, as they often had a broader aim (e.g. facilitating nursing home adjustment or skills and knowledge acquisition). More specifically, this meant that the aim of these multicomponent interventions (e.g. facilitating adjustment) could not directly be related to the outcome measured (e.g. burden). Therefore, it was difficult to compare the studies focusing on the same goals, as they measured different outcomes.

### How effective are programs at managing transition from hospital to home? A case study of the Australian Transition Care Program [^112rut9S]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Internationally, short hospital lengths of stay and a high demand for post-acute care have led to new models of care for older people that offer coordinated discharge, ongoing support, and often a focus on functional restoration. Transition care is a term that encompasses such services and is defined as a set of actions designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of healthcare as patients transfer between different levels of care and among a diverse range of providers, services, and settings.

- **Reform programs**: Enhance clinical integration and continuity of care by including innovative models for integrated service delivery. This includes the establishment of new "cross-border" roles for care coordinators to improve transitions across healthcare settings, and case managers such as community 'matrons'. It is probable that those most likely to gain from these interventions are older people at high risk of admission to hospital or residential aged care, including those with multiple medical problems, functional deficits, cognitive impairment, and social and emotional problems.

- **Systematic reviews**: Suggest that coordinated discharge planning for older people across hospital-community interfaces reduces hospital readmissions and brings about small reductions in hospital length of stay. Evidence on more complex hospital substitution programs is encouraging, with systematic reviews on home-based care, early discharge programs, and best place of care all suggesting that care can be delivered outside hospital and achieve comparable outcomes. However, cost efficiency remains an area for further research.

### The role of technology and the chronic care model [^116yGgWz]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Innovative technological approaches offer great promise for enhancing the quality of care and improving access. A chronic care model has been shown repeatedly to improve outcomes. The elements of the model include the health system, community, self-management support, decision support, clinical information systems, and delivery system redesign. Understanding opportunities to apply technology to the chronic care model is critically important as the rates of diabetes escalate and quality care becomes a priority for health systems.

### Nurse-led supportive coordinated transitional care (CTraC) program improves care for veterans with serious illness [^114nHsfp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

The Coordinated Transitional Care (CTraC) program is a telephone-based, nurse-driven initiative shown to decrease readmissions. This project aimed to implement and evaluate an adapted version of CTraC, termed Supportive CTraC, to enhance the quality of transitional and end-of-life care for veterans with serious illnesses.

We utilized the Replicating Effective Programs framework to guide adaptation and implementation. A registered nurse (RN) case manager (NCM) with expertise in geriatrics and palliative care collaborated closely with inpatient and outpatient care teams to coordinate care. Eligible patients had life-limiting diagnoses with significant functional impairment and were not enrolled in hospice. The NCM identified veterans at the VA Boston Healthcare System during an acute admission and delivered a protocolized intervention to define care needs and preferences, align care with patient values, optimize discharge plans, and provide ongoing, intensive phone-based case management. To assess efficacy, each Supportive CTraC enrollee was matched 1:1 to a contemporary comparison subject by age, risk of death or hospitalization, and discharge diagnosis. We used Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox-Proportional Hazards models to evaluate outcomes, which included palliative and hospice care use, acute care use, Massachusetts Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment documentation, and survival.

The NCM successfully enrolled 104 veterans with high protocol fidelity. Over 1.5 years of follow-up, Supportive CTraC enrollees were 61% more likely to enroll in hospice than the comparison group.

### Lost in transition: Challenges and opportunities for improving the quality of transitional care [^112zHr9p]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Transitional care is defined as a set of actions designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care as patients transfer between different locations or levels of care within the same location. This type of care primarily concerns the brief time interval that starts with preparing a patient to leave one setting and concludes when the patient is received in the next setting. Transitional care poses unique challenges that distinguish it from other care types. Many transitions are unplanned, result from unanticipated medical problems, occur in "real time" during nights and on weekends, involve clinicians who may not have an ongoing relationship with the patient, and happen so quickly that formal and informal support mechanisms cannot respond in a timely manner. This article describes the challenges involved in and potential solutions for improving the quality of transitional care.

### Study protocol for a hospital-to-home transitional care intervention for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and depressive symptoms: a pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial [^117RPJEi]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

The second challenge relates to the need to adapt the intervention to the local context. Interventions are frequently modified during the implementation process to address differences between the context in which the intervention was originally designed and tested, and the one into which it is ultimately implemented. Adaptations are also expected to address differences in individual patient needs, which will result in variation in the intervention components and dose to which participants are exposed. However, these adaptations carry the risk of variability in the delivery of the intervention's component features. This is an inherent limitation of pragmatic trials and a common challenge associated with transitional care evaluations.

Variation in the nature and scope of interventions across settings has led authors of multiple systematic reviews to qualify their conclusions about the efficacy of transitional care models. Close monitoring throughout the duration of the study will assist the investigators in determining any adaptations that need to be made to the intervention. The research team will track any modifications made to the CAST intervention during its implementation. This information will be used to guide future refinements and possibly prepare for future research that tests the intervention on a larger scale. Such an understanding will allow stakeholders to make more informed decisions about whether and how to modify the interventions when implementing them in contexts that differ from those in which they were originally developed and tested.

### Defining quality outcomes for complex-care patients transitioning across the continuum using a structured panel process [^117DHycQ]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there has been no previous research in the area of quality measures for care transitions involving complex-care patients across the continuum of care.

As a next step, further validation of these measures is recommended with other key stakeholders. This work will require: (1) testing of whether these measures actually measure the quality of care (vs. differences in case mix); (2) determining if there are sufficient numbers to enable stable estimates when measuring at the provider/hospital level; (3) determining the need for risk adjustment and, (4) ascertaining the level of measurement for the indicators. There is potential for these measures to be used as indicators of overall care quality related to care transitions involving complex-care patients across the continuum of care.

There is an increasing focus on moving a patient out of the hospital system to alleviate wait times and in an effort to provide patients with more appropriate care in the right settings, such as home-based care and community-based programs and services. However, in order to gain the confidence of patients and their caregivers in these movements across settings, it is essential that organizations be accountable for providing and monitoring high-quality transitions.

Having measures such as these can allow organizations to ascertain how well they are doing, make improvements where necessary, and be accountable to the patients whom they are transitioning. We acknowledge that this study has been conducted in the Canadian healthcare system.

### Do hospital-to-home transitions work for older adults with multiple long-term conditions including dementia? A realist review [^111q8Fqu]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

The Transitional Care Model (TCM) is the predominant theory providing a framework to improve outcomes for older adults with complex care needs as they move between healthcare settings. This model supports transitions for older adults; however, findings from this review add greater detail on how these processes work with multiple long-term conditions including dementia (MLTCiD). For example, the model advocates for comprehensive, holistic assessment of the patient's needs, which is widely supported in the literature. Our findings suggest that in practice, however, admission and discharge procedures prioritize the admission diagnosis and do not adequately account for dementia symptoms (e.g. cognitive decline, BPSD). As a result, care plans frequently fail to integrate dementia with the management of co-existing conditions, increasing the risk of fragmented care and unmet needs. This has been reflected in wider research, which suggests that hospital discharge procedures do not support the higher levels of coordination, communication, and consultation required in complex discharge planning, leaving service gaps for those with dementia.

Tailored interventions for older adults with MLTCiD were rarely implemented in the reviewed documents, despite their advantages in reducing hospital readmissions and carer burden. In the wider literature, most transitional care interventions have not focused on dementia; indeed, patients with dementia or complex care needs are often excluded from transition research. Furthermore, when interventions exist, they primarily focus on outcomes such as healthcare resource utilization rather than addressing the specific needs of those with dementia.

### Critical care transition programs and the risk of readmission or death after discharge from ICU [^112Za7b4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Critical care transition programs have been widely implemented to improve the safety of patient discharge from ICU, but have undergone limited evaluation. We sought to evaluate the implementation of a critical care transition program on patient readmission to ICU within 72 hours and mortality within 14 days.

The study used an interrupted time series analysis of 32,234 consecutive adult patients discharged alive from medical-surgical ICUs in eight hospitals across two cities between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2012. A multidisciplinary ICU provider team consisting of a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist evaluated each patient after ICU discharge in three hospitals in one city (study group), but not in the five hospitals in the other city (control group). Temporal changes were examined using multivariable, segmented linear regression models.

After implementing the program, there was an immediate non-significant decrease in the absolute proportion of patients readmitted to the ICU in the study group (-0.4%, 95% CI -1.7 to +1.0%) and a non-significant increase in the control group (+1.0%, 95% CI -0.3 to +2.2%). Subsequently, there were non-significant changes in the absolute proportion of patients readmitted to ICU in both the study (+0.1% per quarter; 95% CI, -0.1 to +0.2%) and control (-0.1% per quarter; 95% CI, -0.2 to +0.1%) groups over time. No significant changes were observed in mortality. The results were stable across patient subgroups.

### The development, implementation and evaluation of a transitional care programme to improve outcomes of frail older patients after hospitalisation [^1128R9XH]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Fragmented healthcare systems are poorly suited to treat the increasing number of older patients with multimorbidity. This study reports on the development, implementation, and evaluation of a regional transitional care programme aimed at improving the recovery rate of frail hospitalised older patients.

- **Methods**: The programme was drafted in co-creation with organisations representing older adults, care providers, and knowledge institutes. Conducting an action research project, the incidence of adverse outcomes within 3 months after hospital admission and long-term care expenses (LTCE) were compared between samples from 2010–11 (pre-programme) and 2012–13 (post-programme) in frail and non-frail patients. Hospitalised patients aged ≥ 70 years were included in four hospitals in the targeted region.

- **Results**: Developed innovations addressed (i) improved risk management, (ii) delivery of integrated, function-oriented care, (iii) specific geriatric interventions, and (iv) optimisation of transfers. The incidence of adverse outcomes was compared among 813 and 904 included patients, respectively, in the two samples. In frail patients, the incidence of adverse outcomes decreased from 49.2% (149/303) in the pre-programme sample to 35.5% (130/366) in the post-programme sample. The risk ratio (RR), adjusted for heterogeneity between hospitals, was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60–0.87). In non-frail patients, the incidence of adverse outcomes remained unchanged (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.76–1.36). LTCE were similar in the two samples.

- **Conclusions**: By involving stakeholders in designing and developing the programme, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of adverse outcomes among frail patients.

### The community in-reach rehabilitation and care transition (CIRACT) clinical and cost-effectiveness randomisation controlled trial in older people admitted to hospital as an acute medical emergency [^113zB8FM]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Readmission rates were a secondary, yet significant, outcome. Our findings contrast with recent studies evaluating similar transition care models. The systematic review by Shepperd et al. reported a 15% reduction in the 30-day readmission rate. The BOOST toolkit, which included components similar to our CIRACT service — such as risk assessment, medication review, discharge checklist, and a multidisciplinary team approach to discharge — showed modest reductions (2–6%) in the 30-day readmission rate. The Transitional Care Model (TCM), incorporating a multidisciplinary approach led by a transitional care nurse 'transition coach', also demonstrated a reduction in the 90-day readmission rate, ranging from 13% to 48%. This model involved following patients from the hospital to home, facilitating communication with outpatient providers, and performing home visits and telephone follow-ups during the post-discharge period.

### Expert panel consensus on the effectiveness and implementation of models to support posthospitalization care transitions for people with substance use disorders [^1176mMTG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Hospitals are increasingly offering treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) during medical admissions. However, there is a lack of consensus on the best approach to facilitating a successful transition to long-term medical and SUD care after hospitalization. We aimed to establish a hierarchy of existing SUD care transition models in two categories — effectiveness and implementation — using an expert consensus approach.

- **Methods**: We conducted a modified online Delphi study that convened 25 interdisciplinary clinicians with experience facilitating posthospitalization care transitions for patients with SUD. Panelists rated 10 prespecified posthospitalization care transition models according to six criteria concerning each model's anticipated effectiveness (e.g. linkage to care, treatment retention) and implementation (e.g. feasibility, acceptability). Ratings were made on a 9-point bidirectional scale. Group consensus was determined using the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry.

- **Results**: After three rounds of the Delphi process (96% retention across all three rounds), consensus was reached on all 60 rating criteria. Interdisciplinary addiction consult teams (ACTs) and in-reach from partnering outpatient clinics were rated highest for effectiveness. Interdisciplinary ACTs and bridge clinics were rated highest for implementation. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment; protocol implementation; and postdischarge outreach received the lowest ratings overall. Feasibility of implementation was perceived as the largest challenge for all highly rated models.

### Mapping the discharge process after surgery [^111Nw9Ns]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Care transition models are structured approaches used to ensure the smooth transfer of patients between healthcare settings or levels of care, but none currently are tailored to the surgical patient. Tailoring care transition models to the unique needs of surgical patients may lead to significant improvements in surgical outcomes and reduced care fragmentation. The first step to developing surgical care transition models is to understand the surgical discharge process.

The objective of this study is to map the surgical discharge process in a sample of US hospitals and identify key components and potential challenges specific to a patient's discharge after surgery.

This qualitative study followed a cognitive task analysis framework and was conducted between January 1, 2022, and April 1, 2023, in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. Observations (n = 16) of discharge from inpatient care following a surgical procedure were conducted in 2 separate VHA surgical units. Interviews (n = 13) were conducted among VHA healthcare professionals nationwide.

Exposure to postoperative hospital discharge revealed critical insights. **Main outcomes and measures**: Data were coded according to the principles of thematic analysis, and a swim lane process map was developed to represent the study findings.

Results showed that at the hospitals in this study, the discharge process for a surgical patient involved multidisciplinary coordination across the surgical team, nursing team, case managers, dieticians, social services, occupational and physical therapy, and pharmacy. Important components for a successful discharge include effective communication and collaboration among all these stakeholders.

### The impact of multidisciplinary transitional care interventions for complex care needs: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157aqgX]. The Gerontologist (2025). High credibility.

Several systematic reviews investigating the effects of transitional care interventions suggest that they reduce hospital readmission rates and enhance health-related outcomes. Historically, these interventions were often monodisciplinary and mainly focused on ensuring medication adherence or addressing medical care needs. However, with the increased complexity of patient follow-up care, a more comprehensive approach might be needed to encompass medical care, nursing care, and care provided by allied health professionals in the community. In recent years, such interventions have been developed and evaluated and are referred to as multidisciplinary transitional care interventions in this systematic review.

- **Composition of interventions**: Multidisciplinary transitional care interventions involve a range of hospital and community care professionals, including physicians, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, social workers, and speech and language therapists. However, the specific content of such interventions can differ widely, ranging from a discharge summary provided to patients leaving the hospital to interventions that employ dedicated multidisciplinary care teams that coordinate and provide tailored recovery trajectories, both in-hospital and after discharge.

- **Effectiveness of components**: A recent systematic review investigated if the number of components (e.g. a follow-up phone call or a medication review) of a transitional care intervention influenced its effectiveness on healthcare utilization. It revealed that, compared to usual care, interventions with fewer components were more effective.

### Implementation of transitional care planning is associated with reduced readmission rates in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease [^114QuNts]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing lower extremity bypasses (LEB) are at a high risk of developing post-discharge complications requiring readmission. Health systems have developed several strategies to mitigate this risk. One such measure is a comprehensive Transitional Care Program (TCP), which includes phone calls to patients after being discharged from the hospital. Our study aimed to assess short-term readmission, mortality, and amputation rates of patients who participated in TCP by completing at least one post-discharge follow-up phone call after undergoing LEB for revascularization of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was completed for patients who underwent LEB surgery between January 2010 and January 2020 to treat PAD at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. Immediate discharge follow-up was done via telephone calls using a standardized script. Patients were then divided into two groups: those who did not have a successful follow-up call (Group I) and those who had at least one successful follow-up call within seven days after discharge (Group II). Univariate analysis was used to compare preoperative demographics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes. The probability of readmission and risk factors contributing to it were computed using multiple stepwise forward regression analyses. Epidemiological analysis was done to evaluate the risk of readmission in the group receiving post-discharge follow-up calls.

- **Results**: A total of 457 patients underwent LEB from 2010 to 2020 and qualified for inclusion in the study.

### Post-hospitalization care transition strategies for patients with substance use disorders: A narrative review and taxonomy [^112ueBq1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Hospitalizations are important opportunities to engage individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) in treatment. For patients who engage with SUD treatment in the hospital setting, tailored supports during post-discharge transitions to longitudinal care settings may improve care linkages, retention, and treatment outcomes. We updated a recent systematic review search on post-hospitalization SUD care transitions through a structured review of published literature from January 2020 through June 2023. We added novel sources, including a gray literature search and key informant interviews, to develop a taxonomy of post-hospitalization care transition models for patients with SUD.

Our updated literature search generated 956 abstracts not included in the original systematic review. After selecting and reviewing 89 full-text articles, we added six new references to the 26 relevant articles from the original review. Our search of five gray literature sources yielded four additional references. Using a thematic analysis approach, we extracted themes from semi-structured interviews with 10 key informants. From these results, we constructed a taxonomy consisting of 10 unique SUD care transition models in three overarching domains:

- **Inpatient-focused**:
	- Training and protocol implementation
	- Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment
	- Hospital-based interdisciplinary consult team

- **Transitional**:
	- Continuity-enhanced interdisciplinary consult team
	- Peer navigation
	- Transitional care management

- **Outpatient-focused**:

Please refer to the original text for the completion of the list or further exploration of these models.

### Exploring differential response to an emergency department-based care transition intervention [^114zCgT1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

To identify multivariable subgroups of patients with differential responses to a nurse-delivered care transition intervention after an emergency department (ED) visit, this study conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using an emerging data-driven method.

- **Secondary analysis of RCT**: 512 individuals were enrolled in an RCT of a nurse-delivered care transition intervention after an ED visit. All 512 participants were included in a pre-specified subgroup analysis, and 451 of these had sufficient complete case data to be included in a model-based recursive (MoB) partitioning analysis.

- **Methods**: The primary outcome was having at least one ED visit in 30 days after the index ED visit. Two analytical methods explored the heterogeneity of treatment effects: data-driven model-based recursive partitioning (MoB) using 37 candidate baseline variables, and a contextual point of comparison with prespecified subgroups defined by ED super-user status (≥ 3 ED visits in previous 6 months or not), sex (male/female), and age, examined individually via treatment arm by subgroup interaction terms in logistic regression models. An internal validation of the MoB analysis was conducted via bootstrap resampling with an optimism-corrected c-statistic to provide a bias-corrected estimate.

- **Results**: MoB detected treatment effect heterogeneity in a single subgroup, marital status. Unmarried patients randomized to the intervention had a repeat ED use rate of 22% compared to 34% in the usual care group; married patients randomized to the intervention had a 27% ED return rate compared to 12% in the usual care group.

### Transitions of care in infection: a need of the hour [^111Qf3Wh]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Many of the barriers described can be overcome with a planned approach to the transition of care for patients across the healthcare system. The National Transitions of Care Coalition (NTOCC), a coalition of multiple healthcare entities, has developed a seven-step approach to essential intervention categories during transitions to provide the highest probability of a successful transfer. These categories include:

- **Leadership support**: Involves committing resources and support from the highest levels of the healthcare organization to reinforce the importance of effective transitions.
- **Multidisciplinary collaboration**: Engages various healthcare professionals to work in tandem, ensuring a holistic approach to patient care.
- **Early identification of patients**: Recognizes patients at risk for poor transitions of care early in their healthcare journey.
- **Transitional planning**: Involves coordinating care plans and ensuring patients are aware of their care plans during transitions.
- **Medication management**: Entails accurately reconciling medications to prevent errors during transitions.
- **Patient or care provider engagement**: Encourages active participation and communication between patients or their caregivers and healthcare providers.
- **Transfer of information**: Ensures accurate and timely exchange of clinical information during transitions of care.

These strategies are depicted in Figure 2, which outlines the effective categories of intervention for successful transitions of care.

### Effects of an enhanced discharge planning intervention for hospitalized older adults: A randomized trial [^114jTmVD]. The Gerontologist (2013). High credibility.

The purpose of the study was to identify the needs encountered by older adult patients after hospital discharge and assess the impact of a telephone transitional care intervention on stress, healthcare utilization, readmissions, and mortality.

- **Design and methods**: Older adult inpatients who met criteria for risk of post-discharge complications were randomized at discharge through the electronic medical record. Intervention group participants received the telephone-based Enhanced Discharge Planning Program intervention, which included biopsychosocial assessment and an individualized plan following program protocols to address identified transitional care needs. All patients received a follow-up call at 30 days post-discharge to assess psychosocial needs, patient and caregiver stress, and physician follow-up.

- **Results**: 83.3% of intervention group participants experienced significant barriers to care. For 73.3% of this group, problems did not emerge until after discharge. Intervention patients were more likely than usual care patients to have scheduled and completed physician visits by 30 days post-discharge. There were no differences between groups on patient or caregiver stress or hospital readmission.

- **Implications**: At-risk older adults may benefit from transitional care programs to ensure the delivery of care as ordered and address unmet needs. Although patients who received the intervention were more likely to communicate and follow up with their physicians, the absence of impact on readmission suggests that more intensive efforts may be indicated to affect this outcome.

### Evaluation of a modified community based care transitions model to reduce costs and improve outcomes [^117Nwfy2]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Most care participants were the patients themselves (19 or 79.2%), significant others (13 or 54.2%), family members (4 or 16.7%), or other caregivers (6 or 25%). On a scale of 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest), 8 patients rated their participation level a 4 (33.3%), 4 rated their participation level a 3 (16.6%), and 4 rated their participation level a 2 (16.7%). On the same scale, 6 caregivers rated their participation level a 4 (25%), 3 rated their participation level a 3 (12.5%), and 2 rated their participation level a 2 (8.3%).

Nine caregivers were reported as living in the home (39.1%). The percentage of time caregivers assisted in care ranged between 10–100%. Most, specifically 4 caregivers, were identified as giving 100% of their time. Eleven caregivers had daily contact with the patients (78.6%).

### Effectiveness of a health-social partnership program for discharged non-frail older adults: a pilot study [^117R3UwQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that some hospital-based transitional care or discharge planning programs provide a health-social team to support older adults immediately after discharge. However, the results showed that their health and social care needs remain unmet due to the fragmentation of services and the diversity in intervention objectives provided by the health care team and social workers. The World Health Organization World Alliance for Patient Safety reiterated that improving coordination and communication among different professions should be the first priority for providing quality of care to patients. Some developed countries, such as the United Kingdom and Sweden, have recognized the importance of the health-social partnership and integrated it into policy. However, results reported in the literature have shown that professionals in these countries are often unaware of their roles and responsibilities and the best evidence they can draw on when working with other disciplines. A recent review showed that although some studies used the term "collaborative care" in the transitional care program, they failed to develop a well-structured model to help different disciplines work together.

This study endeavors to build a community-based health-social partnership program and subject it to empirical testing to support non-frail older adults in living to their fullest with optimum quality of life in their own environment after hospital discharge. We hypothesize that a properly functioning health-social team that provides comprehensive assessment in a home-based environment…

### Defining minimum necessary communication during care transitions for patients on antihyperglycemic medication: Consensus of the Care Transitions Task Force of the IPRO Hypoglycemia Coalition [^1116r1KN]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Care models that have demonstrated reductions in preventable re-hospitalizations and adverse drug events have often accomplished this through resource-intensive efforts involving dedicated clinical specialists, coaches, and lay navigators. More widespread and sustainable improvements in patient care will likely require enhanced information sharing and clinical decision support features made possible through optimized, interoperable electronic health records. The DMDC List provides an initial framework for the development, testing, and refinement of resources that focus exclusively on care transitions involving patients treated for diabetes. Such resources may include discharge summary templates, patient intake checklists, quality assurance metrics, and others. The creation of well-formatted electronic discharge summaries reflecting the DMDC List elements will require additional effort, as each will need to be translated or cross-walked to corresponding clinical database fields and codes. However, the Task Force believes that the creation of the DMDC List is an important developmental step toward the creation of diabetes-specific resources targeting care transitions.

The DMDC List was developed with contributions from a multidisciplinary panel of experienced diabetes clinicians, and formal consensus was achieved through the application of a blinded iterative Delphi process with a high a priori threshold. One limitation of the DMDC List is that the associations between the individual requisite communication elements and adverse drug events are not currently known. Prospective studies are needed to validate these associations.

### Transitions of care in infection: A need of the hour [^114Ykcff]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

It is essential to identify the members of an effective transition team at the outset. This team should be interdisciplinary and include all clinicians who may be involved in managing the patient, such as pharmacy, primary or community care providers, case managers, at-home or long-term care personnel, and all others who interact with the transitioning patient. The interplay between the community and the hospital is a two-way pathway, so it is crucial for everyone involved to understand their role. Establishing a transition coach within several transition programs, such as the Care Transition Initiative and the Transitional Care Model, can support post-discharge patient engagement and self-management. This role may be best fulfilled by case managers, patient navigators, social workers, and transition nurses rather than nurses or clinical staff physicians and pharmacists within the hospital system.

Once the team is identified, the discharge team must develop a patient-centered transition process. This process should include consistent messaging to patients, care providers, and post-acute facility personnel. The information should be clear, concise, and in a language and format that is accessible to patients and subsequent sites of care. Ideally, the information should be a single concise packet, and the provision of contact numbers of critical staff must be included. Educate the patient and family members to practice self-care and medication management. In rural settings, ensure the necessary members of the transition team are familiar with local resources.

### Complexities of care: Common components of models of care in geriatrics [^111evtC4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

The Better Outcomes for Older Adults Through Safe Transitions (BOOST) model is a quality initiative project developed by the Society for Hospitalist Medicine with the intention to optimize the hospital discharge process and improve communication among healthcare providers. It targets hospitalized adults preparing for hospital discharge and transition of care. Implementation of this model includes tools for assessing risk of readmission, preparation for the transition of care, and a structured approach for medicine reconciliation. In a randomized controlled trial, BOOST was shown to lower the 30-day readmission rate.

- **Bridge model**: The Bridge model is a relationship-based and patient-centered approach to intervening with patients during discharge from acute hospital care. It serves adult patients with complex chronic health and social needs. It is driven by master's-level social workers who engage patients by getting to know their strengths and preferences through a needs assessment, integration of psychotherapeutic methods, and a standard approach to hospital-community-aging services network collaboration. The Bridge model has been shown to decrease readmission rates.

- **Care transitions intervention**: The Care Transitions Intervention (CTI) model targets older community-dwelling patients who are admitted to the hospital with complex care needs. An advance practice nurse serves as a "transition coach" to lead the four pillars of transitional care: medication self-management, use of dynamic patient-centered personal health records, timely follow-up with primary care, and recognition and response to health symptoms.

### Transitional care models in adolescent kidney transplant recipients-a systematic review [^117NXpAE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Adolescence is a time of significant change for patients, guardians, and clinicians. Pediatricians must ensure patients develop the necessary skills and knowledge required to transition and function as independent entities with autonomy over their own care. The transfer from pediatric to adult care carries an increased risk of graft-related complications attributable to a multitude of reasons, particularly non-adherence to immunosuppressive medicines and poor attendance at scheduled appointments. This systematic review was conducted to ascertain the transitional care models available to clinicians caring for kidney transplant recipients and to compare the approach in each respective case.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. OVID MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for studies outlining valid, replicable models pertaining to the transitional care of pediatric kidney transplant recipients between 1946 and Quarter 3 of 2021. The reference lists of selected articles were also examined for further eligible studies, and experts in the field were consulted for additional articles. Two investigators assessed all studies for eligibility and independently performed data extraction. Any discrepancies were settled by consensus.

- **Results**: A total of 1,121 abstracts were identified, which was reduced to 1,029 upon removal of duplicates. Of these, 51 articles were deemed appropriate for full-text review and critical appraisal.

### Association of a bundled hospital-at-home and 30-day postacute transitional care program with clinical outcomes and patient experiences [^113tDSkR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hospital-at-home (HaH) care provides acute hospital-level care in a patient's home as a substitute for traditional inpatient care. In September 2017, the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee recommended the implementation of an alternative payment model for a new model of HaH that bundles the acute episode with 30 days of postacute transitional care.

The objective was to report outcomes of this new payment model for HaH care.

Design, setting, and participants: This case-control study assessed HaH care patients with a control group of hospital inpatients recruited from emergency departments (EDs) and residences in New York City from November 18, 2014, to August 31, 2017. HaH patients were 18 years or older with fee-for-service Medicare and acute medical illness requiring inpatient-level care. Control patients met HaH eligibility but refused participation or were seen in the ED when a HaH admission could not be initiated.

Exposures: HaH care or inpatient care.

Main outcomes and measures: Primary outcomes were acute period length of stay (LOS), all-cause 30-day hospital readmissions and ED visits, admissions to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), referral to a certified home health care agency, and patient experiences with care. Analyses accounted for nonrandom selection using inverse probability weighting.

Results: Among the 507 patients enrolled (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [15.7] years; 68.6% women), data were available on all patients 30 days postdischarge. HaH patients (n = 295) were older than controls (n = 212) and more likely to have a preacute functional status.

### Interventions to improve the transition from home to a nursing home: A scoping review [^117L1uUn]. The Gerontologist (2022). Low credibility.

This review identified a mismatch between optimal transitional care and the focus/content of existing transitional care interventions designed to improve the transition from home to a nursing home. The majority of interventions either focused on a specific transition phase rather than the overall transition continuum or focused on specific stakeholders rather than all stakeholders involved. This limits a continuous partnership in which the needs of the older person and informal caregiver are paramount. However, common intervention components have been identified: education, relationships/communication, improving emotional well-being, personalized care, continuity of care, support provision, and ad hoc counseling. These components can be considered in building a comprehensive transitional care intervention that optimizes and defragmentizes the transitional care pathway from home to a nursing home.

### Understanding transitional care programs for older adults who experience delayed discharge: a scoping review [^111pQ9Li]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Many hospitalized older adults cannot be discharged because they lack the health and social support necessary to meet their post-acute care needs. Transitional care programs (TCPs) are designed to provide short-term and low-intensity restorative care to these older adults experiencing or at risk for delayed discharges. However, little is known about the contextual factors — such as patient, staff, and environmental characteristics — that may influence the implementation and outcomes of TCPs. This scoping review aims to answer the following questions: 1) What are the socio-demographic and/or clinical characteristics of older patients served by TCPs? 2) What are the core components provided by TCPs? 3) What patient, caregiver, and health system outcomes have been investigated, and what changes in these outcomes have been reported for TCPs?

- **Methods**: The six-step scoping review framework and PRISMA-ScR checklist were followed. Studies were included if they presented models of TCPs and evaluated them in community-dwelling older adults (65+) experiencing or at risk for delayed discharge. The data synthesis was informed by a framework consistent with Donabedian's structure-process-outcome model.

- **Results**: TCP patients were typically older women with multiple chronic conditions, some cognitive impairment, and functional dependence, often living alone. The review identified five core components of TCPs: assessment; care planning and monitoring; treatment; discharge planning; and patient, family, and staff education. The main outcomes examined were functional status and discharge destination.

### Study protocol for a hospital-to-home transitional care intervention for older adults with multiple chronic conditions and depressive symptoms: A pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial [^1175b6sA]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Transitional care interventions have been recommended to address adverse outcomes in community-living older adults with complex needs transitioning from hospital to home. The aim of transitional care is to ensure the coordination and continuity of health care when older adults move across care settings. Improvements in transitional care will simultaneously lead toward more integrated care by bringing together services, providers, and organizations from across care settings and sectors. This includes ensuring that services are coordinated and complement one another, and sharing information between providers accurately and promptly. The goal is to develop a seamless unified system to ensure continuity of care for older adults managing multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and depressive symptoms.

Although these transitional care interventions have been linked to several positive outcomes, including decreasing hospital readmissions, the effectiveness of these interventions for older adults with MCC and depressive symptoms is uncertain. Most trials assessing the impact of transitional care interventions have excluded older adults with MCC, omitted mental health considerations such as depressive symptoms, provided little information on cost and implementation strategies, and used weak study designs. Most of these studies have focused on acute care readmission rates as the primary measure of effect for many transitional care interventions, with limited attention to patient-relevant outcomes, such as health-related quality of life. Moreover, little is known about how, and within which contexts, care transition interventions are implemented.

### Randomized trial evaluating health system expenditures with transitional care services for adults with no usual source of care at discharge [^1179VhTw]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multidisciplinary transitional care services reduce readmissions for high-risk patients, but it is unclear if health system costs to offer these intensive services are offset by avoidance of higher downstream expenditures.

- **Objective**: To evaluate net costs for a health system offering transitional care services.

- **Design**: One-year pragmatic, randomized trial.

- **Participants**: Adults aged ≥ 18 without a usual source of follow-up care at the time of hospital discharge were enrolled through a high-volume, urban academic medical center in Chicago, IL, USA, from September 2015 through February 2016.

- **Interventions**: Eligible patients were silently randomized before discharge by an automated electronic health record algorithm allocating them in a 1:3 ratio to receive routine coordination of post-discharge care (RC) versus being offered intensive, multidisciplinary transitional care (TC) services.

- **Main measurements**: Health system costs were collected from facility administrative systems and transformed to standardized costs using Medicare reference files. Multivariable generalized linear models estimated proportional differences in net costs over one year.

- **Key results**: Study patients (489 TC; 164 RC) had a mean age of 44 years; 34% were uninsured, 55% had public insurance, and 49% self-identified as Black or Latinx. Over 90 days, cost differences between groups were not statistically significant. Over 180 days, the TC group had 41% lower ED/observation costs (adjusted cost ratio [aCR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97) and 50% lower inpatient costs (aCR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27–0.95).

### Improving patient-centered transitional care after complex abdominal surgery [^114jAYF2]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Poor-quality transitions of care from hospital to home contribute to high rates of readmission after complex abdominal surgery. The Coordinated Transitional Care (C-TraC) program improved readmission rates in medical patients, but evidence-based surgical transitional care protocols are lacking. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an adapted surgical C-TraC protocol.

- **Study design**: The intervention includes in-person enrollment of patients. Follow-up protocolized phone calls by specially trained surgical C-TraC nurses addressed medication management, clinic appointments, operation-specific concerns, and identification of red-flag symptoms. Enrollment criteria included pancreatectomy, gastrectomy, operative small bowel obstruction or perforation, ostomy, discharge with a drain, in-hospital complication, and clinician discretion. Engaged patients participated in the first phone call within 48 to 72 hours of discharge and continued every 3 to 4 days. Patients completed the program once they and the surgical C-TraC nurse agreed that no additional follow-up was needed or the patient was readmitted.

- **Results**: Two hundred and twelve patients were enrolled from October 2015 through April 2016, with a mean age of 56 years (range 19 to 89 years); 33% of patients were 65 years or older. Surgery sites included colon (46%), small bowel (16%), pancreas (12%), multivisceral (9%), liver (4.5%), retroperitoneum/soft tissue (4.5%), gastric (4%), biliary (2%), and appendix (1.5%). Refusal rate was 1% and engagement was 95%.

### Do hospital-to-home transitions work for older adults with multiple long-term conditions including dementia? A realist review [^114WUwYi]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Transitions of care refer to patient movement between healthcare settings or healthcare professionals (HCPs) to receive care. Health and social care services in the UK are often described as fragmented, with longstanding policy efforts to improve service integration. Older adults with multiple long-term conditions including dementia (MLTCiD) experience more transitions than those without dementia, which are more likely to involve fragmented care. Lapses in patient safety during transitions, such as poor communication and lost test results during information transfer, can delay appropriate treatment, increasing healthcare costs and service use. Dementia-related hospital costs exceed £3.3 billion each year, driven by unplanned admissions which have doubled in the last decade. Research suggests that this population has a high risk of readmission, most of which are thought to be preventable and result from failures in continuity of care.

Fragmented transitions can also lower the physical and psychological wellbeing of those with MLTCiD and unpaid carers (referred to as 'carers'). Guidelines and literature inadequately address the complexity of managing MLTCiD with a tendency for a single-disease focus (i.e. only one of 13 NICE guidance documents acknowledged the impact of dementia on care management). To support transitions of care with multiple long-term conditions, the use of evidence-based models such as the Transitional Care Model has been well-documented and adapted for people with dementia. The Transitional Care Model's core principles of coordination, communication, collaboration, and continuity of care were identified as key to significant improvements in care transitions.

### Protocol-driven allied health post-discharge transition clinic to reduce hospital readmissions in heart failure [^113oSwUD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

High-quality transitional care must include systematic communication between the hospital and post-discharge healthcare providers, patient-friendly medication reconciliation, verification that the patient has the ability to access medications after discharge, consideration of comorbidities, and education directed to patients and caregivers. Education is important and should include instructions that are easy to understand and a system to monitor for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, such as changes in daily weights, worsening shortness of breath, and swelling. It is probably best if this process is started in the inpatient setting, and then teaching can be reviewed and reinforced at subsequent visits. Post-hospital care may be further complicated if the patient is elderly or has cognitive issues, poor healthcare literacy, transportation limitations, or limited access to follow-up care.

For patients leaving the hospital with a primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF, arrangements for transitional care must be both routine and systematized; otherwise, the care does not occur. There is increasing evidence that equal consideration should be given to both cardiac and noncardiac contributors to readmission because HF usually exists within a spectrum of other diseases. Often, it is the comorbidities that drive morbidity, mortality, and hospital readmission rates in HF patients. There is also evidence that it is beneficial to receive follow-up care from a familiar provider.

Our goal for this project was to establish a routine and systematized avenue for patients to access appropriate post-discharge transitional care effectively.

### Understanding transitional care programs for older adults who experience delayed discharge: a scoping review [^111inWAa]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Staff delivering the intervention came from diverse disciplines, and the staff mix varied according to the specific treatments provided. Physiotherapists and nurses were the most frequently cited staff working in these programs. A review of intermediate models of care suggests that care should be delivered by an interdisciplinary team within an integrated health and social care system, where a single contact point optimizes service access, communication, and coordination. Hearing and vision specialists were notably absent from the teams. Given the increasing number of older adults and the age-related increased risk of dual sensory loss and its associated challenges, more screening and services are required.

The transitional care programs (TCPs) share goals similar to those of geriatric rehabilitation (GR) programs, including improving functional capacity, promoting activity, and preserving functional reserve and societal participation. We advocate integrating the core principles of GR, which also utilizes a reablement approach in the design of TCPs to enhance patient outcomes. This should be in addition to refining the staff complement and processes currently used in existing TCPs. The reablement approach not only focuses on improving functional abilities but also on maintaining abilities and independence. Accordingly, TCPs should entail the provision of person-centered care where patients and care partners are actively involved in goal setting and care planning, taking into account psychosocial and environmental factors.

### Effectiveness of patient navigation during transition to adult care: A randomized clinical trial [^1112ZWWU]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Transition to adult care is a challenging and complex process for youth and emerging adults with chronic health and/or mental health conditions. Patient navigation has been proposed to improve care during transition; however, previous studies have used single disease cohorts with a nonrandomized design.

- **Objective**: To compare the effectiveness of a patient navigator service in reducing emergency department (ED) use among adolescents and emerging adults with chronic health and/or mental health conditions undergoing transition to adult-oriented health care.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study employed a pragmatic, parallel-group, nonblinded randomized clinical trial design. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months after enrollment. The study was conducted in the Canadian province of Alberta, with a population of 4.3 million inhabitants and 3 tertiary care pediatric hospitals serving the entire population with universal health coverage. Participants included youth aged 16 to 21 years, followed up within a diverse array of chronic care clinics, expected to transition to adult care within 12 months, and residing in Alberta, Canada.

- **Interventions**: Participants were allocated 1:1 to either access a personalized navigator, an experienced social worker within the health services environment, or to receive usual care, for up to 24 months after randomization.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary measure was the all-cause ED visit rate while under observation.

- **Results**: A total of 335 participants were randomized over a period of 45 months, with 164 (49.0%) allocated to the intervention arm and 171 (51.0%) to usual care.

### Protocol-driven allied health post-discharge transition clinic to reduce hospital readmissions in heart failure [^112ooe74]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic medical condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Approximately 6.5 million individuals in the United States have HF, and the cost to care for these patients is estimated to be $39 billion annually. Most of this cost is incurred through rehospitalizations; a recent report estimated that primary diagnoses of HF account for over 1 million hospitalizations annually, and secondary diagnoses of HF account for another 3 million hospitalizations annually.

Readmission rates have become important surrogates for quality of hospital care for HF patients and are receiving greater scrutiny by policymakers and payers who are increasingly relying on pay-for-performance measures to determine compensation. Poor "handoff", or transition of care, has been an additional problem for these complex patients and has been associated with adverse events and low satisfaction with care.

Hospital readmissions for HF exacerbations are common, and many readmissions are known to be attributable to modifiable factors that can be addressed with high-quality postdischarge care; disease management approaches are currently endorsed in contemporary HF guidelines. However, despite the strength of these published studies, the first of which was published almost two decades ago, recent data show that 25% of hospitalized patients with HF are readmitted within 30 days of discharge and 50% are readmitted within 6 months. In addition, there are financial incentives for decreasing readmissions.

### Improving outcomes after hospitalization: A prospective observational multicenter evaluation of care coordination strategies for reducing 30-day readmissions to Maryland hospitals [^115B668i]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients frequently experience suboptimal transitions from the hospital to the community, which can increase the likelihood of readmission. It is not known which care coordination services can lead to improvements in readmission rates.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effects of two care coordination interventions on 30-day readmission rates.

- **Design**: Prospective multicenter observational study of hospitalized patients eligible for two care coordination services between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2015. Readmission rates were compared for patients who received each care coordination intervention versus those who did not, using multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression models.

- **Participants**: A total of 25,628 patients hospitalized in medicine, neurosciences, or surgical sciences units.

- **Interventions**: Patients discharged home and deemed to be at high risk for readmission were assigned a nurse Transition Guide (TG) for 30 days post-discharge. All other patients were assigned the Patient Access Line (PAL) intervention, which provided a post-discharge phone call from a registered nurse.

- **Setting**: Two large academic hospitals in Baltimore, MD.

- **Main Measures**: Thirty-day all-cause readmission to any Maryland hospital.

- **Key Results**: Among all patients, 14.2% (2409/16,993) of those referred for the PAL intervention and 22.8% (1973/8635) of those referred for the TG intervention were readmitted. PAL-referred patients who did not receive the intervention had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for readmission of 1.27 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.12).

### The impact of multidisciplinary transitional care interventions for complex care needs: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167q8cn]. The Gerontologist (2025). Low credibility.

Despite the positive outlook of our findings regarding readmissions, mortality reduction, and improved health-related outcomes, we observed severe heterogeneity in the effect sizes across studies, suggesting that some multidisciplinary transitional care interventions are more effective than others. This heterogeneity can be partially explained by the variability in the interventions' content and how the interventions were provided, which we could not assess because of a lack of statistical power.

In a recent comprehensive meta-synthesis, including 53 qualitative studies conducted globally, we examined the experiences and needs of patients, family members, and healthcare professionals during hospital-to-home transitions. We found that experiences and needs vary widely from one patient to another and that there is a crucial need for more tailored support and information provision. Future research should clarify how to tailor multidisciplinary transitional care interventions to specific environments, settings, and populations to optimize their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes.

### Factors correlated with successful pediatric post-discharge phone call attempt and connection [^114yocWi]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Postdischarge phone calls can identify discharge errors and gather information following hospital-to-home transitions. This study utilized the multisite Project IMPACT (Improving Pediatric Patient Centered Care Transitions) dataset to identify factors associated with postdischarge phone call attempt and connectivity.

This study included patients aged 0 to 18 years who were discharged from four sites between January 2014 and December 2017. Demographic and clinical factors were compared between subgroups where a postdischarge call was attempted versus not attempted, and where connectivity was achieved versus not achieved. Mixed model logistic regression was used to identify significant independent predictors of call attempt and connectivity.

Postdischarge calls were attempted for 5,528 of 7,725 discharges (71.6%), with successful connection for 3,801 of 5,528 calls (68.8%). Connection rates varied significantly among sites, ranging from 52% to 79% (P < .001). Age less than 30 days (P = 0.03; p = 0.01) and age 1 to 6 years (P = 0.04; p = 0.04) were independent positive predictors for both call attempt and connectivity. English as the preferred language (P < .001) and the chronic noncomplex clinical risk group (P = 0.02) were independent positive predictors for call attempt and connectivity, respectively. Conversely, readmission within 3 days (P = 0.004) and having a federal or state payor (P = 0.02) were negative independent predictors for call attempt and connectivity, respectively.

This study suggests that targeted interventions may improve postdischarge call attempt rates, such as investment in a reliable call system.

### Evaluation of a primary care-based post-discharge phone call program: Keeping the primary care practice at the center of post-hospitalization care transition [^114Rb828]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The post-hospitalization period is a precarious time for patients. Post-discharge nurse telephone call programs aiming to prevent unnecessary readmissions have had mixed results.

- **Objective**: Describe a primary care-based program to identify and address problems arising after hospital discharge.

- **Design**: A quality improvement program embedding registered nurses in a primary care practice to call patients within 72 hours of hospital discharge and route problems within the practice for real-time resolution.

- **Participants**: Adult patients with a primary care provider in the general internal medicine practice at the University of California, San Francisco, who were discharged home from the Medicine service.

- **Main measures**: Patients reached directly by phone had a 'full-scripted encounter;' those reached only by voicemail had a 'message-scripted encounter;' those not reached despite multiple attempts had a 'missed encounter'. Among patients with full-scripted encounters, we identified and cataloged problems arising after hospital discharge and measured the proportion of calls in which a problem was uncovered. For the different encounter types, we compared follow-up appointment attendance and 30-day readmission rates.

- **Key results**: Of 790 eligible discharges, 486 had a full-scripted, 229 a message-scripted, and 75 a missed encounter. Among the 486 full-scripted encounters, nurses uncovered at least one problem in 371 (76%) discharges, 25% of which (n = 94) included new symptoms, and 47% (n = 173) included medication issues. Discharges with full-scripted and message-scripted encounters yielded important insights into patient care post-discharge.
