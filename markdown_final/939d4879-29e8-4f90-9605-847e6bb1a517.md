## Question

How does etoh effect 5ht receptors

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ethanol (EtOH) affects serotonin (5-HT) receptors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the serotonergic receptor families and their core pharmacology. Then, I should verify which receptor subtypes have direct, acute interactions with ethanol versus indirect or chronic adaptations. Next, I will examine mechanistic links to dopamine reward circuitry and behavioral outcomes. After that, I should review genetic and pharmacogenetic evidence that modulates these effects. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications, including treatment response and psychedelic-assisted therapy, and close with limitations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the receptor landscape so I don't miss key players. The 5-HT system includes ionotropic 5-HT3 receptors and multiple GPCR families (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, 5-HT7), with 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 most consistently implicated in alcohol-related behaviors and treatment targets, so I should keep those front and center as I proceed [^11517t4L] [^115xoBnu] [^111sogMp].

> Now, I will examine direct, acute effects of ethanol on 5-HT3, because I need to ensure I'm not over-attributing indirect changes. Multiple lines of evidence indicate ethanol potentiates 5-HT3 receptor function, including in vitro and in vivo studies showing enhanced currents or facilitation of 5-HT3-mediated transmission, and intracranial self-administration work demonstrating that 5-HT3 antagonism attenuates ethanol reinforcement in the nucleus accumbens shell, supporting a causal role in reward [^114tupBE] [^11517t4L]. Wait, let me verify the clinical translation: genetic variants in HTR3A/HTR3B associate with alcohol dependence risk, and 5-HT3 antagonism with ondansetron shows pharmacogenetically moderated efficacy in alcoholics, reinforcing the clinical relevance of this axis [^114roFXV] [^116xCfoL] [^113xEutp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all 5-HT receptors being direct targets. For 5-HT1B, I initially thought ethanol might directly modulate the receptor, but I should double-check that. The stronger evidence is that 5-HT1B receptors regulate alcohol intake indirectly via modulation of neurotransmitter release (5-HT, GABA, glutamate, dopamine) within reward circuits, and human genetic linkage implicates HTR1B in antisocial alcoholism, suggesting a key regulatory node rather than a direct ethanol binding site [^115xoBnu] [^1142kPBA]. I should confirm receptor density data: postmortem studies in alcoholics do not show consistent primary changes in 5-HT1B density, which aligns with an indirect modulatory role rather than direct ethanol–receptor binding [^117RxcLi].

> Next, I should review 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, since these often show chronic adaptations and are relevant to emerging therapeutics. Postmortem and imaging studies suggest higher 5-HT2A binding in suicide and, in some analyses, in alcohol use disorder, though findings vary by region, ligand, and diagnostic composition, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization [^1112fhbJ] [^112DNPrT]. Let me consider functional implications: 5-HT2C activation generally suppresses mesolimbic dopamine and reduces drug reward, whereas 5-HT2A activation can facilitate dopamine in some contexts; this balance may help explain why classic psychedelics, which act at 5-HT2A/2B/2C, show anti-addictive properties despite 5-HT2A agonism, likely via network-level effects and 5-HT2C-mediated braking of reward [^111sogMp] [^1133z9pa] [^114rwSsN]. But wait, what if 5-HT2A alone increases risk? Indeed, selective 5-HT2A agonists can enhance reward in some paradigms, underscoring the importance of circuit-level integration of 5-HT2A vs 5-HT2C signaling [^114rwSsN].

> I will now examine 5-HT1A, because presynaptic versus postsynaptic effects can confound interpretation. Evidence suggests increased 5-HT1A binding in alcohol use disorder in some cohorts, particularly in suicides, and 5-HT1A signaling can inhibit pyramidal output and reduce impulsivity, though presynaptic autoreceptor effects can transiently reduce 5-HT release; thus, net behavioral effects depend on time course and regional expression [^115FPWwE] [^112h2tX4] [^1169tqxX]. Hold on, I should verify that these findings are diagnosis- and region-sensitive; indeed, effects are not uniform across studies and appear modulated by comorbidity and anatomy, so I must avoid blanket statements here [^112DNPrT].

> Let me consider the dopaminergic bridge, because ethanol's serotonergic effects often manifest via modulation of reward circuitry. Ethanol increases extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens, and part of this enhancement appears mediated by serotonergic mechanisms, including 5-HT3 facilitation and downstream dopamine release, while 5-HT2C activation can suppress dopamine firing and release, creating a dynamic balance [^11517t4L] [^1133z9pa]. I should confirm transporter-level interactions: ethanol inhibits monoamine clearance via OCT3 (not DAT/NET/SERT), which can augment dopamine and serotonin signals and may explain synergistic effects with cocaine; this provides a plausible mechanism for serotonergic-dopaminergic crosstalk under ethanol exposure [^1116iufQ] [^116PLfSs].

> Next, I should review genetic and pharmacogenetic modifiers that shape these receptor-mediated effects. Variants in HTR3A/HTR3B and SLC6A4 interactively increase risk for alcohol dependence, and functional HTR3B variants that enhance 5-HT3 responsiveness associate with greater addiction vulnerability, consistent with ethanol's potentiation of 5-HT3 [^114roFXV] [^114oaUgt]. Let me verify treatment moderation: alcoholics with the 5-HTTLPR LL genotype, particularly with rs1042173 TT, show superior response to ondansetron, and adding HTR3A/HTR3B markers further enriches the responder population, supporting a pharmacogenetic treatment strategy [^116xCfoL] [^113xEutp]. I should also note that TPH2 deficiency increases ethanol consumption in animals, reinforcing the concept that serotonergic tone constrains alcohol intake [^1122KLGU].

> I need to check chronic and developmental effects, because receptor adaptations may differ from acute actions. Chronic alcohol can downregulate 5-HT3A mRNA in ventral striatum in mice, while leaving other 5-HT receptor transcripts unchanged, suggesting receptor-specific plasticity; in humans, chronic alcohol use is associated with altered SERT density in affective brain regions, indicating remodeling of serotonergic transmission that could secondarily shift receptor signaling [^115i4cJX] [^116a5ptH]. Hold on, I should verify developmental data: adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure alters prefrontal dopamine regulation in adulthood, implying long-term serotonergic-dopaminergic circuit changes that may bias future receptor responsiveness and risk [^1122KLGU].

> Let me integrate clinical implications, and I should confirm I'm aligning mechanism with treatment. SSRIs have modest and heterogeneous effects on alcohol consumption, likely reflecting indirect 5-HT1A/1B modulation and limited engagement of the 5-HT3–dopamine interface; by contrast, 5-HT3 antagonism with ondansetron shows clearer efficacy in genetically defined subgroups, consistent with blockade of ethanol-facilitated 5-HT3 currents and downstream reward [^115LaDjY] [^116xCfoL]. But wait, what about psychedelics? Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy produces large, sustained reductions in drinking in a randomized trial, plausibly via 5-HT2A-mediated plasticity and 5-HT2C-mediated suppression of dopamine drive; however, mechanisms remain under study and clinical protocols are highly structured, so I should avoid overclaiming generalizability [^112WZm5R] [^111sogMp] [^111mtDvr].

> I should double-check limitations so we don't overinterpret. Much of the human receptor data are postmortem and cross-sectional, limiting causal inference; ligand properties, brain region, and diagnostic heterogeneity complicate comparisons; and animal models, while informative, may not fully recapitulate human receptor expression patterns and ethanol exposure contexts [^1128n1SC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied ethanol directly binds 5-HT1B or 5-HT2A; I should clarify that direct binding is not established for these targets, whereas direct potentiation of 5-HT3 is well supported, and other effects likely reflect network modulation and transporter interactions rather than orthosteric receptor binding [^114tupBE] [^1116iufQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise: ethanol acutely potentiates 5-HT3 receptors, thereby enhancing fast excitatory serotonergic transmission and facilitating dopamine release in reward circuits; concurrently, ethanol inhibits monoamine clearance via OCT3, augmenting monoamine signals and interacting with cocaine to amplify reward; over time, chronic exposure induces receptor-specific adaptations (e.g., 5-HT3A downregulation, altered SERT density) and engages 5-HT1B, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C circuits that modulate impulse control, stress, and reward; genetic variation in 5-HT3 and SERT genes modifies risk and predicts response to 5-HT3 antagonism, and psychedelic 5-HT2A/2C engagement shows promise but requires further mechanistic and implementation research [^114oaUgt] [^1116iufQ] [^115i4cJX] [^116a5ptH] [^112WZm5R].

Ethanol **directly potentiates 5-HT3 receptors** [^11517t4L] in the brain, increasing serotonin-mediated excitatory neurotransmission and dopamine release in reward circuits [^114oaUgt], which contributes to alcohol's reinforcing effects [^11517t4L]. It also **modulates 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors** [^115xoBnu], altering serotonin release and contributing to anxiety, impulsivity, and alcohol-seeking behaviors [^115xoBnu]. Chronic ethanol exposure leads to **adaptive changes in 5-HT receptor expression and function** [^114UkGMk], including downregulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and altered 5-HT1B signaling, which are linked to withdrawal, craving, and relapse [^notfound]. These receptor interactions underpin the serotonergic mechanisms of alcohol's acute effects and chronic dependence, and they inform pharmacotherapies targeting 5-HT receptors for AUD [^116xCfoL].

### Role of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) receptors in the regulation of ethanol intake in rodents [^115xoBnu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that the serotonergic system is important in mediating dependence on and craving for alcohol. Among serotonin receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) receptors have been associated with drug abuse including alcohol. In this review, the neurocircuitry involving 5-HT1B receptors in central reward brain regions related to alcohol intake are discussed in detail. Emphasis has been placed on the pharmacological manipulations of 5-HT1B receptor-mediated alcohol intake. Furthermore, 5-HT1B auto- and hetero-receptors regulate alcohol intake through the regulatory mechanism involving release of 5-HT, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and glutamate is evaluated. Thus, interactions between 5-HT1B receptors and these neurotransmitter systems are suggested to modulate alcohol-drinking behavior. This review on the role of 5-HT1B receptors in neurotransmitter release and consequent alcohol intake provides important information about the potential therapeutic role of 5-HT1B receptors for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Alcohol addiction and Alzheimer's disease: a molecular collision course [^1122KLGU]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects of alcohol on dopamine, serotonin, and other neurotransmitters

Alcohol exacerbates neurotransmitter imbalances by disrupting the dynamic equilibrium of the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems, thereby accelerating the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease. Experimental evidence demonstrates that chronic ethanol exposure significantly reduces dopamine release in the NAc, accompanied by an increased dopamine reuptake rate and enhanced D2 autoreceptor activity. At the receptor level, adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) has been shown to impair the ability of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) D1 receptors to regulate glutamatergic signaling in adulthood, while D2 receptor function remains unaffected. Genetic studies further indicate that reduced striatal D2 receptor availability in alcohol-dependent individuals is significantly correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms.

In the 5-HT system, the 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism has been found to influence drug response: individuals with the S/S genotype exhibit poorer anxiolytic responses to SSRIs, whereas those with the L/L genotype are more sensitive to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Animal studies show that Tph2-deficient mice, which have impaired central 5-HT synthesis, consume significantly more ethanol than wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of the 5-HT system in alcohol consumption behavior. Studies on prenatal alcohol exposure indicate that alcohol suppresses placental SERT mRNA expression while upregulating TPH1 protein levels, leading to abnormally elevated fetal circulating 5-HT concentrations.

Notably, different experimental conditions may yield conflicting results. In zebrafish models, short-term binge drinking (3 weeks) significantly enhances DAT activity, whereas long-term exposure leads to compensatory downregulation of DAT function. Additionally, sex differences have been observed in ethanol intake: female SERT-knockout (SERT-/-) rats consume significantly more alcohol than males, suggesting a sexually dimorphic regulation of the 5-HT system.

### Functional genetic variants that increase synaptic serotonin and 5-HT ₃ receptor sensitivity predict alcohol and drug dependence [^114oaUgt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The 5-HT3 receptor is rapidly potentiated by ethanol and mediates fast excitatory serotonin (5-HT) transmission that modulates dopamine release in the reward circuitry. The 5-HT transporter regulates synaptic 5-HT availability. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter and receptor may therefore influence addiction vulnerability. In this study, 360 treatment-seeking African American male patients with single and comorbid DSM-IV lifetime diagnoses of alcohol, cocaine and heroin dependence and 187 African American male controls were genotyped for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR functional polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) and 16 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across HTR3B (including the functional rs1176744 Tyr129Ser) and HTR3A, genes encoding 5-HT3 receptors. The HTR3B rs1176744 gain-of-function Ser129 allele predicted alcohol dependence (P = 0.002) and low 5-HTTLPR activity predicted cocaine/heroin dependence (P = 0.01). Both the HTR3B Ser129 allele (P = 0.014, odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 (1.1–2.6)) and low 5-HTTLPR activity (P = 0.011, OR = 2.5 (1.3–4.6)) were more common in men with alcohol+drug dependence compared with controls. Moreover, the HTR3B Ser129 allele and low 5-HTTLPR activity had an additive (but not an interactive) effect on alcohol+drug dependence (OR = 6.0 (2.1–16.6)) that accounted for 13% of the variance. One possible explanation of our findings is that increased synaptic 5-HT coupled with increased 5-HT3 receptor responsiveness may result in enhanced dopamine transmission in the reward pathway, a predictor of increased risk for addiction. Our results may have pharmacogenetic implications for 5-HT3 therapeutic antagonists such as ondansetron.

### The role of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing alcohol consumption [^115LaDjY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated an inverse relationship between serotonergic activity and alcohol consumption. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, citalopram, and fluvoxamine have subsequently been examined for their ability to reduce alcohol consumption in alcoholic subjects. Interindividual variability in response to SSRIs is large, with reductions in alcohol consumption ranging from 10% to more than 70%. Several factors, including gender, alcoholic subtype, and extent of drinking, appear to affect the treatment efficacy of the SSRIs. A significant challenge for researchers is to identify the subject variables that predict treatment response, providing a basis for guiding alcohol-dependent individuals to the treatment that is most likely to be effective for them. This article reviews the available clinical studies, discusses possible mechanisms of action for the SSRIs, and describes a model for predicting treatment responses in alcoholic subjects.

### The use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating alcoholic subtypes [^116eojcK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The usefulness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat alcohol dependence continues to be a subject of debate. Most recently, investigations have tried to predict whether a given patient will respond to SSRIs in terms of reducing excessive alcohol drinking. The subtyping of alcohol-dependent individuals has ranged from relatively simple classifications (e.g., presence of comorbid depression) to more complex classifications (e.g., potential to have abnormalities in serotonin [5-HT] neurotransmission). Although only a few studies have been completed, results thus far indicate that alcoholic subgroups are differentially responsive to 5-HT pharmacotherapy with respect to drinking-related outcomes. In addition, there are preliminary results encouraging the use of SSRIs in combination with other medications for treating alcohol dependence in patients with and without comorbid psychiatric disorders. Information from these studies is promising, suggesting the need for further investigation.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^115FPWwE]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

5-HT 1A receptors

We observed more 5-HT 1A binding in suicides, but only in cases that underwent psychological autopsy. We did not detect a difference in 5-HT 1A binding in MDD, but we found more 5-HT 1A binding associated with AUD. Several investigators, though not all, report higher 5-HT 1A binding in depressed suicides (for review see ref.). We previously reported, higher ³H-8-OH-DPAT binding in suicide that was anatomically restricted to ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as were the increases reported by others. Parsey et al.found that MDD patients whose depression did not remit had higher 5-HT 1A binding and also an over-representation of GG genotype, suggesting that genotype may also affect the level of receptor binding, symptom progression and treatment response. Negative reports did not examine binding in anatomically discrete areas or did not examine ventral prefrontal cortex –. The lack of agreement about elevated 5-HT 1A binding raises the possibility that the differences associated with suicide are anatomically discrete. The radioligand used may also affect receptor binding since antagonist but not agonist binding is decreased in MDD, suggesting binding differences may reflect the G-protein coupled or uncoupled state of the receptor. Lower 5-HT 1A receptor binding is reported in the cerebral cortex in alcoholics. Lastly, we did not find differences in 5-HT 1A binding when all cases and controls were examined together, greater 5-HT 1A binding in suicides was only found when restricting the analysis to only those cases diagnosed by psychological autopsy. We believe this demonstrates how cases without psychological autopsy can bias, obscure or otherwise influence the outcome of an analysis to the point of affecting the conclusion reached.

### Mechanisms and molecular targets surrounding the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelics [^111dCxKW]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychedelics, also known as classical hallucinogens, have been investigated for decades due to their potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders. The results from clinical trials have shown promise for the use of psychedelics to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as to promote substantial decreases in the use of nicotine and alcohol. While these studies provide compelling evidence for the powerful subjective experience and prolonged therapeutic adaptations, the underlying molecular reasons for these robust and clinically meaningful improvements are still poorly understood. Preclinical studies assessing the targets and circuitry of the post-acute effects of classical psychedelics are ongoing. Current literature is split between a serotonin 5-HT 2A receptor (5-HT 2A R)-dependent or -independent signaling pathway, as researchers are attempting to harness the mechanisms behind the sustained post-acute therapeutically relevant effects. A combination of molecular, behavioral, and genetic techniques in neuropharmacology has begun to show promise for elucidating these mechanisms. As the field progresses, increasing evidence points towards the importance of the subjective experience induced by psychedelic-assisted therapy, but without further cross validation between clinical and preclinical research, the why behind the experience and its translational validity may be lost.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^114TeysU]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Impaired serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is detectable in the brain of suicide decedents and in the cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid of nonfatal suicide attempters, major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). Biological findings in suicide include those related to comorbid diagnoses and those associated with the diathesis for suicide that explains why only a subgroup of people with MDD or AUD are at elevated risk for suicide. Despite the fact that suicide-associated conditions such as MDD and AUD are frequently co-morbid, little work has compared 5-HT receptor abnormalities in suicide, MDD, and AUD (see ref.for review).

Childhood adversity increases the risk of suicide, MDD, and AUD in adulthood. What mediates the effect of childhood adversity on the risk for these diagnoses is not well understood, but epigenetic and gene-environment interactions are reported –. We hypothesize that childhood adversity affects the serotonin system and contributes to increased risk for suicide, MDD or AUD in adulthood.

In vivo and in vitro imaging of the SERT and 5-HT receptor subtype binding in suicide and nonfatal suicide suggest there are serotonin system abnormalities; but there is less agreement about the direction of the findings, the specificity of the findings for each of these conditions, including which brain areas are involved –. Explanations for discrepant results include small effect sizes, variability in outcome measures, and biodemographic variability related to sex and age; other factors are the heterogeneity in suicide behavior and the effects from comorbid psychiatric disorders. Abnormalities in the serotonin system are more pronounced with more lethal suicidal behavior. In the present study, we sought to determine the effects of suicide on serotonin receptor binding and separate the effects of suicide from comorbid MDD, AUD, and early life adversity studying postmortem brain using quantitative autoradiography, in the hitherto largest published sample of postmortem suicides and controls.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^113m3Pd3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most common substance use disorder (SUD) in the US. Problematic alcohol use contributes significantly to disease burden worldwide and is associated with various adverse economic and social outcomes. Even more concerning, alcohol is often used with other substances, frequently with cocaine. This drug pairing, which often causes emergency hospitalization, is likely more toxic than each substance alone. There is currently no treatment for co-abuse of, and overdose with, alcohol and cocaine, further highlighting the hazards of their concurrent use and underscoring the need to understand its mechanistic basis. Furthering this understanding is necessary to discover new targets for therapeutic intervention in treating AUD, including co-abuse of alcohol and cocaine.

The popularity of co-abuse of alcohol and cocaine could result from an increased "high" compared with taking either drug alone, as well as from a prolongation of cocaine-induced euphoria, possibly because increases in dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) may be greatest when cocaine and alcohol are taken together. This is supported by several lines of evidence. For example, coadministration of ethanol with cocaine accelerates cocaine absorption, increasing the concentration of cocaine in brain extracellular fluid. Ethanol also enhances cocaine-induced increases of extracellular DA in the nucleus accumbens, a critical brain area in the reward pathway. Finally, preclinical self-administration and conditioned place preference (CPP) results, and clinical findings in humans, suggest that the rewarding properties of ethanol combined with cocaine are greater than those of each drug alone. Similar findings are reported across species, including planarians, rodents, non-human primates, and humans.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^112h2tX4]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In vivo PET imaging studies report higher 5-HT 1A binding in depressed MDD subjects and remitted MDD; others find less binding –. The different results may be due to the method of estimating binding. We observed more 5-HT 1A binding associated with childhood adversity in nonsuicides, and a rodent study of stress in infants finds increased gene expression.

We find more 5-HT 1A binding with AUD, as did Thompson et al.who found higher 5-HT 1A mRNA in BA9 in AUD but not AUD-suicides and not in BA24. Martinez and colleagues did not find any differences in 5-HT 1A density in humans with alcohol dependence. Taken together, the findings suggest brain region is important as is the potential for the presence of alcohol status to obscure effects of suicide. Genomic studies may be helpful for understanding 5HT 1A regulation in suicide, MDD and AUD.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^112zYzS3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Literature evidence supports the premise that ethanol inhibits DA, NE, and 5-HT clearance from extracellular fluid but does so in a manner independent of high-affinity, "uptake-1" transporters, DAT, NET, and SERT. This raises the possibility that ethanol's actions on monoamine uptake are mediated, at least in part, via OCT3, and provides a potential mechanism by which ethanol (via inhibition of OCT3) enhances cocaine-induced increases in extracellular monoamines, as well as cocaine's rewarding properties. Here we focus on DA because of its important role in reward pathways and provide novel evidence that ethanol acts in an OCT3-dependent manner to inhibit DA clearance and augment the rewarding properties of cocaine.

### Association, interaction, and replication analysis of genes encoding serotonin transporter and 5-HT ₃ receptor subunits A and B in alcohol dependence [^114roFXV]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

On the basis of the converging evidence showing regulation of drinking behavior by 5-HT3AB receptors and the serotonin transporter, we hypothesized that the interactive effects of genetic variations in the genes HTR3A, HTR3B, and SLC6A4 confer greater susceptibility to alcohol dependence (AD) than do their effects individually. We examined the associations of AD with 22 SNPs across HTR3A, HTR3B, and two functional variants in SLC6A4 in 500 AD and 280 healthy control individuals of European descent. We found that the alleles of the low-frequency SNPs rs33940208:T in HTR3A and rs2276305:A in HTR3B were inversely and nominally significantly associated with AD with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of 0.212 and 0.073, 0.616 (P = 0.004) and 0.261 and 0.088, 0.777 (P = 0.016), respectively. Further, our gene-by-gene interaction analysis revealed that two four-variant models that differed by only one SNP carried a risk for AD (empirical P < 1 × 10⁻⁶ for prediction accuracy of the two models based on 10⁶ permutations). Subsequent analysis of these two interaction models revealed an OR of 2.71 and 2.80, respectively, for AD (P < 0.001) in carriers of genotype combinations 5'-HTTLPR:LL/LS(SLC6A4)-rs1042173:TT/TG(SLC6A4)-rs1176744:AC(HTR3B)-rs3782025:AG(HTR3B) and 5'-HTTLPR:LL/LS(SLC6A4)-rs10160548:GT/TT(HTR3A)-rs1176744:AC(HTR3B)-rs3782025:AG(HTR3B). Combining all five genotypes resulted in an OR of 3.095 (P = 2.0 × 10(-4)) for AD. Inspired by these findings, we conducted the analysis in an independent sample, OZ-ALC-GWAS (N = 6699), obtained from the NIH dbGAP database, which confirmed the findings, not only for all three risk genotype combinations (Z = 4.384, P = 1.0 × 10(-5); Z = 3.155, P = 1.6 × 10(-3); and Z = 3.389, P = 7.0 × 10(-4), respectively), but also protective effects for rs33940208:T (χ (2) = 3.316, P = 0.0686) and rs2276305:A (χ (2) = 7.224, P = 0.007). These findings reveal significant interactive effects among variants in SLC6A4-HTR3A-HTR3B affecting AD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.

### Self-management with alcohol over lifespan: psychological mechanisms, neurobiological underpinnings, and risk assessment [^116775sY]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol in self-management

The proximal mechanisms for the multiple instrumentalizations and use for self-management may be found in the unique pharmacological profile of alcohol and its action in the brain. While the neuropharmacological research into alcohol effects mainly addressed the molecular pathways into AUD, it also revealed some mechanisms underlying the controlled use of alcohol related to lifespan and some of its specific instrumentalization goals (Table 1). However, this is not completely understood and awaits further investigation.

*Compared to adulthood.

Alcohol interacts with the neurotransmission of γ-butyric acid (GABA), which is the most abundant inhibitory transmitter in the brain. Alcohol enhances the activity of GABA at the GABA A -receptor. Acute alcohol application enhances presynaptic GABA release and increases GABAergic activity. Through its interaction with neocortical GABA A -receptors, alcohol can directly attenuate aversive memories. These effects are crucial for alcohol's action in the dampening of natural and acquired anxiety and stress states (Table 1).

### The reinforcing effects of ethanol within the nucleus accumbens shell involve activation of local GABA and serotonin receptors [^11517t4L]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Ethanol is reinforcing within the nucleus accumbens shell (NACsh), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ethanol can potentiate the function of the GABAA, GABAB, and serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptors. Therefore, the current study tested the hypothesis that activation of these receptors would be involved in the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh. An intracranial self-administration (ICSA) procedure was used to assess the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh of alcohol preferring (P) rats. The ICSA consisted of seven sessions: four sessions to establish 150 mg% ethanol self-infusion into the NACsh; sessions 5 and 6 with co-infusion of ethanol plus one concentration of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 or 100 µM), the GABAB antagonist SCH 50911 (50, 75 or 100 µM), or the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist zacopride (10 or 100 µM); and session 7 with 150 mg% ethanol alone. All groups self-infused ethanol into the NACsh and readily discriminated the active from inactive lever during the acquisition sessions. Co-infusion of 100 µM, but not 10 µM, bicuculline or zacopride significantly decreased active responses during sessions 5 and 6. Co-infusion of 75 µM, but not 50 or 100 µM, SCH 50911 significantly attenuated responses for ethanol. Overall, the results suggest that the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh may be modulated by activation of local GABAA, GABAB and 5-HT3 receptors.

### The genetics of alcohol dependence [^117WqD7z]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Alcohol dependence is a common, complex disorder, which affects millions of people worldwide and causes considerable burden in terms of interpersonal and societal costs. Family, twin, and adoption studies have convincingly demonstrated that genes play an important role in the development of alcohol dependence, with heritability estimates in the range of 50% to 60% for both men and women. A number of studies are under way to identify specific genes involved in the predisposition toward alcohol dependence, and there is reason to be enthusiastic about recent progress. Several associated susceptibility genes are reviewed here, including genes involved in alcohol metabolism, as well as genes involved in GABAergic, endogenous opioid, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic transmission. The next challenge will be to further characterize the risk associated with these susceptibility genes, examining how they may be related to comorbid disorders, developmental trajectories of risk, and potential moderation by environmental factors.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^116PLfSs]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

To examine the generality of our findings, we assessed the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol in wild-type, OCT3-/- and SERT-/- mice. We, and others, have shown OCT3 expression to be greater in SERT-/- mice than in wild-type mice, and that ethanol's inhibition of 5-HT clearance in hippocampus of SERT-/- mice is more robust than in SERT+/+ mice, consistent with a role of OCT3. Likewise, we found that the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol were more pronounced in SERT-/- mice. We replicated this finding, and extended it by showing that ethanol-induced LORR is less in OCT3-/- mice, consistent with OCT3 contributing to ethanol-induced LORR. Although we did not measure blood alcohol concentration in OCT3+/+ and OCT3-/- mice, differences in ethanol metabolism between the two genotypes are unlikely (see SI). Taken together with data presented here, it appears that LORR is related to level of OCT3 expression.

Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence for OCT3 as a novel and previously unsuspected player in the actions of ethanol to inhibit monoamine uptake. Here we identified OCT3 as an important mediator of the acute effects of ethanol to inhibit DA uptake and produce rewarding effects. These novel findings raise several avenues for exciting future studies, including investigations of (and SI for details) (1) the effect of chronic cocaine and ethanol use in combination or alone, (2) potential actions of cocaethylene, a psychoactive substance formed in the liver when cocaine and alcohol coexist in blood, at OCT3, as well as acetaldehyde, the main metabolite of ethanol, which is readily self-administered in rodents and could play a role in the rewarding properties of ethanol, (3) self-administration of ethanol, cocaine and their combination, since behavioral and neurochemical effects of most drugs of abuse, including ethanol and cocaine, differ depending on whether they are administered contingently vs. non-contingently (e.g.), (4) how ethanol interacts with OCT3 to inhibit substrate uptake. These efforts will build on the recently published structural basis for OCT3 inhibition.

### The function of serotonin within the liver [^11486fmP]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is known to regulate several key aspects of liver biology and these functions include hepatic blood flow, innervation and wound healing. Given the importance of these functions it is surprising that relatively little time has been dedicated to studying the precise function and mechanisms of serotonin within the liver. Here we describe what is known about serotonin and the liver and those receptor types that mediate the observed effects with an aim to stimulating new interest in the field of serotonin and liver biology.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^116a7nvq]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Concurrent cocaine and alcohol use is among the most frequent drug combination, and among the most dangerous in terms of deleterious outcomes. Cocaine increases extracellular monoamines by blocking dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (DAT, NET and SERT, respectively). Likewise, ethanol also increases extracellular monoamines, however evidence suggests that ethanol does so independently of DAT, NET and SERT. Organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3) is an emergent key player in the regulation of monoamine signaling. Using a battery of in vitro, in vivo electrochemical, and behavioral approaches, as well as wild-type and constitutive OCT3 knockout mice, we show that ethanol's actions to inhibit monoamine uptake are dependent on OCT3. These findings provide a novel mechanistic basis whereby ethanol enhances the neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine and encourage further research into OCT3 as a target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of ethanol and ethanol/cocaine use disorders.

### Pharmacogenetic approach at the serotonin transporter gene as a method of reducing the severity of alcohol drinking [^116xCfoL]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Severe drinking can cause serious morbidity and death. Because the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-HT function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron.

Method

The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5'-regulatory region of the 5-HTT gene (LL/LS/SS), with additional genotyping for another functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 3'-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants received either ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Results

Individuals with the LL genotype who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27%) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73%) in LL compared with LS/SS individuals. LL individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (9.65%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5'-HTTLPR and rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. LL/TT individuals in the ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined.

Conclusions

The authors propose a new pharmacogenetic approach using ondansetron to treat severe drinking and improve abstinence in alcoholics.

### Molecular properties important for inhaled anesthetic action on human 5-HT ₃ A receptors [^114tupBE]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Although inhaled anesthetics have diverse effects on 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3A) receptors, the mechanism accounting for this diversity is not understood. Studies have shown that modulation of 5-HT3A receptor currents by n-alcohols depends on molecular volume, suggesting that steric interactions between n-alcohols and their binding sites define their action on this receptor. Electrostatic interactions also play an important role in anesthetic action on other ligand-gated receptors. We aimed to determine the contribution of molecular volume and electrostatics in defining volatile anesthetic actions on 5-HT3A receptors. Human 5-HT3A receptors were expressed in, and recorded from, Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The effects of a range of volatile anesthetics, n-alcohols, and nonhalogenated alkanes on submaximal serotonin-evoked peak currents, and full serotonin concentration-response curves were defined. Volatile anesthetics and n-alcohols, but not alkanes, smaller than 0.120 nm3 enhanced submaximal serotonin-evoked peak currents whereas all larger agents reduced currents. Most compounds tested inhibited maximal serotonin-evoked peak currents to varying degrees. However, only agents smaller than 0.120 nm3 shifted the 5-HT3A receptor's serotonin concentration-response curve to the left, whereas larger anesthetics shifted them to the right. Modulation of human 5-HT3A-mediated currents by volatile anesthetics exhibits a dependence on molecular volume consistent with the n-alcohols, suggesting that both classes of agents may enhance 5-HT3A receptor function via the same mechanism. Furthermore, the enhancing but not inhibiting effects of anesthetic compounds on 5-HT3A receptor currents are modulated by electrostatic interactions.

### Determination of genotype combinations that can predict the outcome of the treatment of alcohol dependence using the 5-HT (3) antagonist ondansetron [^113xEutp]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors previously reported that the 5'-HTTLPR-LL and rs1042173-TT (SLC6A4-LL/TT) genotypes in the serotonin transporter gene predicted a significant reduction in the severity of alcohol consumption among alcoholics receiving the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron. In this study, they explored additional markers of ondansetron treatment response in alcoholics by examining polymorphisms in the HTR3A and HTR3B genes, which regulate directly the function and binding of 5-HT3 receptors to ondansetron.

Method

The authors genotyped one rare and 18 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HTR3A and HTR3B in the same sample that they genotyped for SLC6A4-LL/TT in the previous randomized, double-blind, 11-week clinical trial. Participants were 283 European Americans who received oral ondansetron (4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) or placebo along with weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Associations of individual and combined genotypes with treatment response on drinking outcomes were analyzed.

Results

Individuals carrying one or more of genotypes rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG in HTR3A and rs17614942-AC in HTR3B showed a significant overall mean difference between ondansetron and placebo in drinks per drinking day (22.50; effect size = 0.867), percentage of heavy drinking days (220.58%; effect size = 0.780), and percentage of days abstinent (18.18%; effect size = 0.683). Combining these HTR3A/HTR3B and SLC6A4-LL/TT genotypes increased the target cohort from approaching 20% (identified in the previous study) to 34%.

Conclusions

The authors present initial evidence suggesting that a combined fivemarker genotype panel can be used to predict the outcome of treatment of alcohol dependence with ondansetron. Additional, larger pharmacogenetic studies would help to validate these results.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^1112fhbJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

5-HT 2A receptors

We found higher 5-HT 2A binding in suicide, but only in cases with psychological autopsy. Other studies report higher, lowerand no differencein 5-HT 2A binding in suicide. Both higher and lower binding are also reported in MDD in vivo (see ref.for review). We detected more 5-HT 2A binding in AUD in the present study but not previously. No difference in 5-HT 2A binding was reported in AUD by others. Most studies did not separate effects of depression or alcoholism from suicide. Therefore, we extend previous observations by finding that 5-HT 2A binding is greater in suicide alcoholics and in suicides with ELA but is not increased with MDD. Another possible explanation for the discrepancies is the use of an agonist versus antagonist ligand; higher binding in suicide was detected using the agonist LSD, while the antagonist Ketanserin detected lower or no change in suicide. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy is the ligand specificity. It is known that ketanserin has affinity for tetrabenazine receptors, alpha 1 adrenergic receptors and histamine receptors. We blocked for these receptors during the incubations. Some of the findings in the literature, including our own, were obtained by incubation of tissue using ¹²⁵I-LSD. A problem with ¹²⁵I-labeled ligands is that differences in tissue thickness result in a darker image and higher measured receptor density. While this may pose less of a problem for small pieces of tissue, when sectioning entire hemispheres, inevitably there will be parts of the tissue that are thicker producing a darker image. We found a positive correlation between 5-HT 2A binding and aggression raising the possibility that increased 5-HT 2A binding in suicide is associated with the increased aggression commonly associated with suicide behavior. Alternatively, the discrepant findings may be due to childhood adversity exposure. This not only implies a relationship between the 5-HT 2A receptor and brain development and/or the development of AUD, but also demonstrates the importance of the diagnostic composition of the sample under study.

### Pharmacogenetic approaches to the treatment of alcohol addiction [^114fUZEx]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Addictive disorders are partly heritable, chronic, relapsing conditions that account for a tremendous disease burden. Currently available addiction pharmacotherapies are only moderately successful, continue to be viewed with considerable scepticism outside the scientific community and have not become widely adopted as treatments. More effective medical treatments are needed to transform addiction treatment and address currently unmet medical needs. Emerging evidence from alcoholism research suggests that no single advance can be expected to fundamentally change treatment outcomes. Rather, studies of opioid, corticotropin-releasing factor, GABA and serotonin systems suggest that incremental advances in treatment outcomes will result from an improved understanding of the genetic heterogeneity among patients with alcohol addiction, and the development of personalized treatments.

### Whole-hemisphere autoradiography of 5-HT ₁ B receptor densities in postmortem alcoholic brains [^117RxcLi]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

The 5-HT(1B) receptor has been associated with alcohol dependence, impulsive or alcohol-related aggressive behavior, and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the 5-HT(1B) receptor density differs in brain samples from anxiety-prone Cloninger type 1 alcoholics and socially hostile, predominantly male, type 2 alcoholics, and controls. Whole-hemispheric 5-HT(1B) receptor density was measured in eight regions of postmortem brains from 17 alcoholics and 10 nonalcoholic controls by autoradiography with tritiated GR-125743 and unlabeled ketanserin to prevent 5-HT(1D) binding. The 5-HT(1B) receptor density was not altered significantly in any of the studied regions. However, some correlations were observed in types 1 and 2 alcoholics only. The 5-HT(1B) receptor density decreased with age in type 1 alcoholics only. There was a significant positive correlation between 5-HT(1B) receptor and serotonin transporter densities in the head of caudate of type 1 alcoholics only. There was a significant positive correlation between 5-HT(1B) receptor density and dopaminergic terminal density, as estimated by vesicular monoamine transporter 2 measurement in the nucleus accumbens of type 2 alcoholics only. There were no significant correlations between 5-HT(1B) receptor and dopamine transporter or dopamine D2/D3 receptor densities in any of the subject groups. In conclusion, these results do not indicate primary changes in 5-HT(1B) receptor densities among these alcoholics, although the data must be considered as preliminary.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^114M3maZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings in the present study were: (1) SERT binding was lower in suicides independent of sex, but dependent on MDD diagnosis; higher SERT binding is associated with AUD; (2) 5-HT 1A binding was greater in suicides, independent of MDD, while AUD was associated with higher 5-HT 1A binding but only in suicides; (3) 5-HT 2A binding was greater in suicides only when accounting for the effects of MDD and AUD in the model. (4) Reported childhood adversity was associated with higher SERT, 5-HT 1A binding, and 5-HT 2A binding. These findings illustrate that the ability to detect differences in SERT, 5-HT 1A, and 5-HT 2A binding in the brain between cases with mood disorders and dying by suicide is dependent on Axis I diagnosis and reported childhood adversity, therein demonstrating the importance of clinical characterization of both cases and controls under investigation. Different findings in alcoholism from depression and suicide indicate distinct serotonin system pathophysiology.

### Sertraline [^115gj2p5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sertraline potentiates serotonergic activity in the central nervous system through inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Studies at clinically relevant doses have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.

Alcohol

In healthy subjects, the acute cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol were not potentiated by sertraline hydrochloride.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of sertraline on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects. At 2-fold the maximum recommended daily dose (~3-fold the steady-state exposure for sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline), the largest mean ΔΔQTc was 10 ms with upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval of 12 ms. The length of the QTc interval was also positively correlated with serum concentrations of sertraline and N- desmethylsertraline concentrations. These concentration-based analyses, however, indicated a lesser effect on QTc at maximally observed concentration than in the primary analysis [See Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7), Overdosage (10)].

### Cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms of alcohol-related aggression [^11398NNe]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

Alcohol-related violence is a serious and common social problem. Moreover, violent behaviour is much more common in alcohol-dependent individuals. Animal experiments and human studies have provided insights into the acute effect of alcohol on aggressive behaviour and into common factors underlying acute and chronic alcohol intake and aggression. These studies have shown that environmental factors, such as early-life stress, interact with genetic variations in serotonin-related genes that affect serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. This leads to increased amygdala activity and impaired prefrontal function that, together, predispose to both increased alcohol intake and impulsive aggression. In addition, acute and chronic alcohol intake can further impair executive control and thereby facilitate aggressive behaviour.

### Personalized treatment of alcohol dependence [^112BTiej]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Pharmacogenetic and adaptive treatment approaches can be used to personalize care for alcohol-dependent patients. Preliminary evidence shows that variation in the gene encoding the μ-opioid receptor moderates the response to naltrexone when used to treat alcohol dependence. Studies have also shown moderating effects of variation in the gene encoding the serotonin transporter on response to serotonergic treatment of alcohol dependence. Adaptive algorithms that modify alcohol treatment based on patients' progress have also shown promise. Initial response to outpatient treatment appears to be a particularly important in the selection of optimal continuing care interventions. In addition, stepped-care algorithms can reduce the cost and burden of treatment while maintaining good outcomes. Finally, matching treatment to specific problems present at intake or that emerge during treatment can also improve outcomes. Although all of these effects require replication and further refinement, the future of personalized care for alcohol dependence appears bright.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^111sogMp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Considerations of 5-HT 2C receptor activation to addiction liability: Behavioral studies

Numerous lines of evidence from multiple laboratories show that 5-HT 2C receptor activation attenuates self-administration of addictive substances and also attenuates ICSS of the brain's primary reward circuitry, and there are a number of excellent recent reviews on the topic of 5-HT 2C receptor agonists for addiction and mechanisms underlying their effects. Selective agonists of the 5-HT 2C receptor have generally been found to recapitulate the attenuating effects of indirect serotonin agonists on behavioral models of addiction, suggesting 5-HT 2C receptor activation is a key molecular mechanism by which serotonin exerts its anti-addictive effects. For example, the rate-suppressing effects of both the indirect serotonin receptor agonist fenfluramine and the 5-HT 2C receptor agonist Ro 60–0175 in an ICSS procedure are blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT 2C receptor selective antagonist SB 242084. Likewise, Ro 60–0175 blocks cocaine-seeking behavior in rats, an effect completely reversed by SB 242084. Acute VTA or systemic administration of a variety of relatively selective 5-HT 2C receptor agonists in rodents suppress the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine, the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine, cocaine self-administration, and reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine and cocaine-associated cues. These findings have been extended to other classes of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine.

### Neutral sphingomyelinase mediates the co-morbidity trias of alcohol abuse, major depression and bone defects [^115i4cJX]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

While alterations in neurotransmitter levels indicate an NSM control of monoaminergic signalling in reward and reinforcement related brain areas, synaptic throughput also requires receptor and transport mechanisms. Monoamine receptor conformation and function as well as transporter efficacy crucially depend on sphingolipid membrane domains. Therefore, we measured mRNA expression levels of major receptors and transporters involved in dopaminergic and serotonergic signalling in the ventral striatum (vStr) of mice. We found that chronic alcohol drinking decreased 5-HT 3A receptor mRNA expression, but did not affect expression of 5-HT 1A, 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2C (Fig. 7e–h) and DA D1 and D2 receptor mRNA in WT mice (Fig. 7k–l). Reduced NSM activity led to a reduction in D2 receptor mRNA expression. However, it also prevented the alcohol effects on 5-HT 3A -receptor mRNA, but enhanced mRNA expression of 5-HT 1A receptors. The expression of the DA transporter (DAT) and 5-HT transporter (SERT) were affected neither by alcohol nor by NSM deficiency (Fig. 7i, m). In contrast, enhancing sphingomyelinase activity resulted in a significant reduction of 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes of the ventral hippocampus (VH) and DH, but not in vStr of mice (Fig. 7j).

Sphingolipids form lipid rafts and signalling platforms at the synapse, which harbour monoamine and other receptor proteins. Thus, we investigated the vStr lipidome after voluntary alcohol or water consumption. Neither reduced NSM activity nor voluntary alcohol drinking yielded a significant effect on lipid landscape in the vStr (Figs. S23–26).

Although Nac DA responses to alcohol are enhanced in fro mice, reduced D2 receptor expression may balance NSM control of the incentive properties of alcohol. This may explain why the conditioned reinforcing effects are not altered in mice with reduced NSM activity.

Osteocalcin reduces alcohol consumption

Reduced NSM activity led to an increase in blood osteocalcin. In order to test whether the bone–brain signal interacts with alcohol consumption, we tested how increased osteocalcin would modulate alcohol consumption. In naïve mice, osteocalcin treatment for 28 days (0.03 µg/h, s.c.), using osmotic mini pumps, reduced alcohol consumption (Fig. 4b), but did not affect total fluid consumption (Fig. 4c).

### Alcohol and the brain: neuronal molecular targets, synapses, and circuits [^114UkGMk]. Neuron (2017). Low credibility.

Ethanol is one of the most commonly abused drugs. Although environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of alcohol use disorders, it is ethanol's actions in the brain that explain (1) acute ethanol-related behavioral changes, such as stimulant followed by depressant effects, and (2) chronic changes in behavior, including escalated use, tolerance, compulsive seeking, and dependence. Our knowledge of ethanol use and abuse thus relies on understanding its effects on the brain. Scientists have employed both bottom-up and top-down approaches, building from molecular targets to behavioral analyses and vice versa, respectively. This review highlights current progress in the field, focusing on recent and emerging molecular, cellular, and circuit effects of the drug that impact ethanol-related behaviors. The focus of the field is now on pinpointing which molecular effects in specific neurons within a brain region contribute to behavioral changes across the course of acute and chronic ethanol exposure.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^1156PZmW]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Reduced serotonergic neurotransmission has been a long-standing hypothesis in the etiology of suicide and mood disorders. The SERT is located on axons and axon terminals and are an indication of serotonergic innervation and intrasynaptic serotonin levels. Less SERT in depressed suicides therefore suggests less innervation or greater SERT internalization secondary to less intra-synaptic 5-HT. 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors in the PFC are located predominantly on cortical interneurons. We previously reported more 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor binding in the PFC of depressed suicides, but only when we corrected for the density of cortical interneurons. 5-HT 1A receptor activation results in hyperpolarization and a decrease in neuronal activity in PFCon pyramidal neurons and cortical interneurons.

The causes of receptor differences in suicide is unclear. Evidence for receptor up- and down- regulation comes from several sources. Serotonin receptor down regulation has long been suggested as a mechanism of action for antidepressant drugs (see refs. –). By the converse, in classic theories of receptor regulation, reduced 5-HT agonism or long term receptor blockade may lead to up-regulation of postsynaptic receptors, but the mechanisms of receptor regulation are complicated, differ by receptor and even by brain region for the same receptor and are not addressed in the current study (for reviews see refs. –).

An increase in 5-HT 1A receptors in PFC suggests an inhibition of excitatory output from cortical regions that mediate executive function and behavioral restraint. We hypothesize that reduced cortical activity may be a top-down cause of a reduction in restraint and increase in the risk for suicide behavior. Cognitive testing has been used to find that suicide attempters have worse inhibitory control in executive functioning skills; see ref.for review). Neuroimaging studies of brain structure report prefrontal deficits in suicide behavior including impaired decision making and social assessment. We now report altered 5-HT receptors in the same prefrontal cortex regions. Multimodal imaging studies of structure and connectivity in suicide attempters, such as those used in connectomic studies, support this model.

In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.

Alcohol

In healthy subjects, the acute cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol were not potentiated by sertraline hydrochloride.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of sertraline on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects. At 2-fold the maximum recommended daily dose (~3-fold the steady-state exposure for sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline), the largest mean ΔΔQTc was 10 ms with upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval of 12 ms. The length of the QTc interval was also positively correlated with serum concentrations of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline concentrations. These concentration-based analyses, however, indicated a lesser effect on QTc at maximally observed concentration than in the primary analysis [See Warnings and Precautions (5), Adverse Reactions (6), Drug Interactions (7), Overdosage (10)].

### 5-hydroxytryptophol as a marker for recent alcohol intake [^117TKtje]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the mechanism behind the alcohol-induced shift in serotonin metabolism, and the use of urinary 5-hydroxytryptophol (5-HTOL) as a biochemical marker of acute alcohol consumption.

Background

The serotonin metabolite 5-HTOL is a normal, minor constituent of urine and is excreted mainly in conjugated form with glucuronic acid. The formation of 5-HTOL increases dramatically after alcohol intake, due to a metabolic interaction, and the elevated urinary excretion remains for some time (> 5–15 hours depending on dose) after ethanol has been eliminated. This biochemical effect can be used for detection of recent alcohol intake.

Results

5-HTOL is determined by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques. A new ELISA method for 5-HTOL glucuronide provides a promising clinical assay. The most robust way to use the marker is by measuring the ratio of 5-HTOL to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, because this compensates for urine dilution and dietary intake of serotonin. 5-HTOL is a very sensitive and specific indicator of recent alcohol consumption and, as such, a valuable complement to self-report. In clinical use, 5-HTOL is effective for monitoring lapses into drinking during out-patient treatment and for objective evaluation of treatment efforts. Other applications include detection of high-risk patients in elective surgery, monitoring of disulfiram treatment and a method to rule out artefactual ethanol formation in forensic toxicology. 5-HTOL can also be used as a sensitive reference method for validation of self-report data in clinical alcohol research.

Conclusions

An elevated urinary 5-HTOL level can serve as a sensitive and reliable marker for recent alcohol intake with a number of clinical and forensic applications.

### GPCR and alcohol-related behaviors in genetically modified mice [^112jsNGs]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest class of cell surface signaling receptors and regulate major neurobiological processes. Accordingly, GPCRs represent primary targets for the treatment of brain disorders. Several human genetic polymorphisms affecting GPCRs have been associated to different components of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Moreover, GPCRs have been reported to contribute to several features of alcohol-related behaviors in animal models. Besides traditional pharmacological tools, genetic-based approaches mostly aimed at deleting GPCR genes provided substantial information on how key GPCRs drive alcohol-related behaviors. In this review, we summarize the alcohol phenotypes that ensue from genetic manipulation, in particular gene deletion, of key GPCRs in rodents. We focused on GPCRs that belong to fundamental neuronal systems that have been shown as potential targets for the development of AUD treatment. Data are reviewed with particular emphasis on alcohol reward, seeking, and consumption which are behaviors that capture essential aspects of AUD. Literature survey indicates that in most cases, there is still a gap in defining the intracellular transducers and the functional crosstalk of GPCRs as well as the neuronal populations in which their signaling regulates alcohol actions. Further, the implication of only a few orphan GPCRs has been so far investigated in animal models. Combining advanced pharmacological technologies with more specific genetically modified animals and behavioral preclinical models is likely necessary to deepen our understanding in how GPCR signaling contributes to AUD and for drug discovery.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^111dMuyp]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Serotonin neurotransmitter deficits are reported in suicide, major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). To compare pathophysiology in these disorders, we mapped brain serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT 1A, and 5-HT 2A receptor binding throughout prefrontal cortex and in anterior cingulate cortex postmortem. Cases and controls died suddenly minimizing agonal effects and had a postmortem interval ≤ 24 h to avoid compromised brain integrity. Neuropathology and toxicology confirmed absence of neuropathology and psychotropic medications. For most subjects (167 of 232), a DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis was made by psychological autopsy. Autoradiography was performed in right hemisphere coronal sections at a pre-genual level. Linear model analyses included sex and age with group and Brodmann area as interaction terms. SERT binding was lower in suicides (p = 0.004) independent of sex (females < males, p < 0.0001), however, the lower SERT binding was dependent on MDD diagnosis (p = 0.014). Higher SERT binding was associated with diagnosis of alcoholism (p = 0.012). 5-HT 1A binding was greater in suicides (p < 0.001), independent of MDD (p = 0.168). Alcoholism was associated with higher 5-HT 1A binding (p < 0.001) but only in suicides (p < 0.001). 5-HT 2A binding was greater in suicides (p < 0.001) only when including MDD (p = 0.117) and alcoholism (p = 0.148) in the model. Reported childhood adversity was associated with higher SERT and 5-HT 1A binding (p = 0.004) in nonsuicides and higher 5-HT 2A binding (p < 0.001). Low SERT and more 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A binding in the neocortex in depressed suicides is dependent on Axis I diagnosis and reported childhood adversity. Findings in alcoholism differed from those in depression and suicide indicating a distinct serotonin system pathophysiology.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: a systematic review [^115N2w6M]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Other drugs (mixed results)

Azacyclonol, once investigated as a potential antidepressant, was experimented on individuals who administered LSD and mescaline. Two studies showed no effect of blocking LSD's actions and one case report describes the same for mescaline. These results are in contrast to another study that reported the attenuated (pretreatment) or blocked (acute) effects of mescaline after azacyclonol treatment. The mechanism of action of azacyclonol is not well understood, and the mixed results from the described studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions and hypotheses.

Recreational drugs

Finally, two studies reported the effects of recreational drugs, including MDMA and alcohol consumption on LSD and alcohol on psilocybin. One study, which investigated the effects of alcohol, found that LSD and psilocybin (to a lesser extent) acted as antagonists to the subjective effects of alcohol, while their own psychedelic effects were mainly unaffected. It has been suggested that LSD may block the subjective effects of alcohol by interacting with 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 1C receptors, which are implicated in the formation of the ethanol cue. Evidence shows that agonists of these receptors produce responses similar to those of alcohol, whereas blockade of these receptors interferes with the discriminative stimulus properties of alcohol. In the second, a placebo-controlled study, LSD was co-administered with MDMA to investigate the benefits of a combination also known as 'candy-flipping'. While the particular combination did not yield significant changes as assessed by various instruments, it did result in longer-lasting drug effects (averaging 1.5 h longer, compared to LSD alone). Also, the combination led to higher plasma concentrations and an extended plasma elimination half-life for LSD, compared to LSD alone. The prolonged drug effects could be attributed to decreased CYP2D6 activity, an enzyme known to be inhibited by MDMA and involved in LSD metabolism.

### The role of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in alcohol craving experience [^1168e83y]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

The way in which genetic risk mediates the development of craving in alcohol dependence is still relatively unknown. The authors sought to clarify the extent to which alcohol craving could be predicted by a relevant polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene encoding the 5-HT transporter (5-HTTLPR). A sample of 101 alcohol-dependent patients admitted for alcohol treatment was recruited for the study. At admission, blood samples were taken for DNA extraction and alcohol craving information was collected with a composite measure. The 5-HTT polymorphism was genotyped. Alcohol dependent patients who were homozygous for the long allele (LL) self-reported higher scores of craving when compared to patients that were homozygous for the short allele (SS). However, the results were not statistically significant. Also, no significant associations were observed between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and other drinking variables. No 5-HTTLPR genotype effects were observed on alcohol craving experience in a sample of alcohol-dependent outpatients.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^1161jh6F]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Future work should examine SERT, 5HT 1A, and 5HT 2A binding in nonfatal suicide attempts in mood disorders and other diagnoses, and consider the effects of reported childhood adversity to determine the extent that any differences are part of these diagnostic entities or the diathesis for suicidal behavior. Indeed, there are several reports in the literature examining clinical similarities and differences between suicide attempters and completers –, and neurochemical similarities and differences –. The presence of differences in attempters to completers will suggest the differences are not only present antemortem, but will also be informative as to whether there is a continuum of differences in the brain in suicide and completers represent the most extreme form of the behavior. Future potential therapeutic approaches to the prevention of suicide, the treatment of MDD or AUD and reversing effects of childhood adversity, could then be developed to target these molecules.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^1128n1SC]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

In the present study we could compare effects across brain regions related to MDD, suicide, AUD, and childhood adversity and consider the impact of age and sex because we were able to draw upon the largest known collection of human postmortem cases with quantitative receptor autoradiography and psychological autopsy data. Our findings demonstrate the importance of clinical characterization of all cases, including the "controls". We and others have shown how lack of reproducible findings in postmortem studies of suicide can be attributed to effects of antemortem factors, PMI, toxicology, neuropathology, clinical diagnosis, brain region identification and even freezer storage time. The larger group size studied here, not only provided more statistical power for detecting differences, it accounted for potential receptor binding effects associated with comorbid diagnoses by using psychological autopsy to identify the presence of any comorbid illnesses and then including the diagnosis in the statistical model of the outcome measure. Effects detected in the sensitivity analysis, that were not detected in the analysis of the larger sample, which included cases that had not undergone psychological autopsy, further illustrates that undetected diagnoses can introduce bias in results that can obscure detection of differences between groups. The inclusion of alcoholics and subjects with other comorbid diagnoses provided the opportunity to begin to understand how additional illness burden can change the associated brain receptors, but a more clinically homogeneous sample increased the detectability of receptor differences. Regardless of the reliability and validity of the psychological autopsy procedure, it is not infallible, and the possibility remains that there are cases, for example suffering from an MDD episode at the time of death, that were not diagnosed or detected whether or not the psychological autopsy was performed, and these types of cases could affect the outcome. Postmortem studies have the inherent limitation of being cross-sectional and cannot address cause and effect relationships. Another limitation is not knowing the cellular sources giving rise to the receptors being measured as is coming through laser capture microdissection and cellular fractionation. Receptor binding is an endpoint measure and does nothing to address whether differences reflect changes in transcription, translation or posttranslational modification. Likewise, receptor expression is under genetic and epigenetic control and none of this is examined here, nor can it be.

### Percentage of heavy drinking days following psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy vs placebo in the treatment of adult patients with alcohol use disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^112WZm5R]. JAMA Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The past 2 decades have witnessed growing interest in the clinical potential of psilocybin and other classic psychedelics to treat neuropsychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders. Although the mechanisms of psychedelic-assisted treatments remain unclear, the action of these drugs at the serotonin 2A receptor and downstream effects on neurotransmission, intracellular signaling, epigenetics, and gene expression appear to enhance plasticity at multiple levels, including neuronal structure, neural networks, cognition, affect, and behavior. However, some clinically relevant effects may be independent of serotonin 2A receptor activation. Moreover, the direction and magnitude of change observed in a therapeutic context can be influenced by the subjective experience under the influence of the drug, and by contextual factors, including concomitant psychotherapy.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a particularly promising target for treatment with psychedelics. A meta-analysis of results from 6 randomized clinical trials published between 1966 and 1971, revealed that participants with alcohol dependence treated with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) demonstrated remission during follow-up nearly twice as often as those in comparator conditions to (odds ratio, 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36–2.84; z, 3.59; P < .001). Picking up on this line of research after a hiatus of more than 40 years, an open-label study published in 2015 demonstrated that moderately high doses of psilocybin (21 to 28 mg/70 kg) were well tolerated by participants with alcohol dependence, and large reductions in drinking were observed over a 32-week follow-up period.

Building on the proof-of-concept study, this multisite randomized clinical trial evaluated the efficacy of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of AUD. Here we report drinking outcomes for the double-blind phase of the trial.

### The relationship between dose and serotonin transporter occupancy of antidepressants-a systematic review [^116oGQHK]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

For this first systematic review of the evidence of the relationship between dose and SERT occupancy of antidepressants we identified 17 studies investigating 10 different SSRIs, SNRIs and serotonin modulators in a total of 294 participants, comprising 309 unique measurements of SERT occupancy with highly specific ligands. Overall, occupancy increased with higher dose but in a hyperbolic pattern: occupancy increased rapidly at lower doses and reached an apparent plateau at approximately 80%––at the usual minimum recommended dose––modeled by the Michaelis–Menten equation. Generally, the studies were small, only a few studies investigated the same antidepressant at the same dose and in the same RoI, and few studies reported information on relevant factors that may influence drug metabolization and hence bioavailability of antidepressants (e.g. use of potentially interacting drugs, smoking status, and alcohol consumption).

The Michaelis–Menten curves we reconstructed based on the findings in individual studies showed that overall, there was no substantial increase of SERT occupancy with SSRI and SNRI doses above the usual minimum recommended doses for depression. This finding is in accordance with one dose-escalation occupancy study of paroxetine using the β-CIT, a ligand not included in the present review, that found no increase in SERT occupancy, nor a clinical effect as a result of paroxetine dose escalation from 20 to 50 mg, despite observed increases in paroxetine serum concentration. It is also in agreement with the observation that there is a limited benefit associated with increasing doses of SSRIs above the lower range of the licensed dose in general, whether using a fixed dosing regimen, a flexible dosing regimen, or as a second-step strategy in patients not responding to standard dosing. Adverse events, in contrast, may have an ascending dose-response curve, presumably due to co-affinity to other receptors. There is no firm evidence that clinical efficacy, nor adverse effects are dependent on SERT occupancy; the studies included in the present review that measured the relationship between clinical effect and SERT occupancy did not find significant correlations.

### BNST specific mGlu5 receptor knockdown regulates sex-dependent expression of negative affect produced by adolescent ethanol exposure and adult stress [^113Ldu6H]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Preclinical models with high face validity are necessary to develop treatments for AUDs and comorbid disorders. Although many studies have found that reducing mGlu5 activity alleviates alcohol-induced negative affective states, these studies have focused on males and have not widely included models of dependence. The current findings indicate that AIE produces sexually divergent behavioral phenotypes in adulthood that are unmasked by stress and reflect the human condition. The underlying symptoms and mechanisms of these factors also appear to be sexually divergent, with mGlu5 receptors playing a large role in depression-related risks in female mice. Notably, these behavioral facets showed poor interdependency, which is further indicative of distinct mechanisms. Overall, these findings support the use of mGlu5 receptors as a treatment target to alleviate negative affective states that may precipitate problematic drinking behavior.

### Association and interaction analyses of 5-HT ₃ receptor and serotonin transporter genes with alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine dependence using the SAGE data [^115s75yT]. Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Previous studies have implicated genes encoding the 5-HT3AB receptors (HTR3A and HTR3B) and the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), both independently and interactively, in alcohol (AD), cocaine (CD), and nicotine dependence (ND). However, whether these genetic effects also exist in subjects with comorbidities remains largely unknown. We used 1,136 African-American (AA) and 2,428 European-American (EA) subjects from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) to determine associations between 88 genotyped or imputed variants within HTR3A, HTR3B, and SLC6A4 and three types of addictions, which were measured by DSM-IV diagnoses of AD, CD, and ND and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), an independent measure of ND commonly used in tobacco research. Individual SNP-based association analysis revealed a significant association of rs2066713 in SLC6A4 with FTND in AA (β = -1.39; P = 1.6E - 04). Haplotype-based association analysis found one major haplotype formed by SNPs rs3891484 and rs3758987 in HTR3B that was significantly associated with AD in the AA sample, and another major haplotype T-T-G, formed by SNPs rs7118530, rs12221649, and rs2085421 in HTR3A, which showed significant association with FTND in the EA sample. Considering the biologic roles of the three genes and their functional relations, we used the GPU-based Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR-GPU) program to test SNP-by-SNP interactions within the three genes and discovered two- to five-variant models that have significant impacts on AD, CD, ND, or FTND. Interestingly, most of the SNPs included in the genetic interaction model(s) for each addictive phenotype are either overlapped or in high linkage disequilibrium for both AA and EA samples, suggesting these detected variants in HTR3A, HTR3B, and SLC6A4 are interactively contributing to etiology of the three addictive phenotypes examined in this study.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^112frg68]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Lack of OCT3 Significantly Reduces Sensitivity to the Sedative/Hypnotic Effects of Ethanol

Greater sensitivity to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol is associated with a higher incidence of alcohol use disorder in humans. We therefore investigated the ability of ethanol (3.2 g/kg) to induce loss of righting reflex (LORR), a commonly used indicator of sedative/hypnotic effects in rodents, in wild-type (OCT3+/+ and SERT+/+), OCT3-/- and SERT-/- mice. We included SERT-/- mice as a comparator because we have previously shown that they have higher expression of OCT3 than SERT+/+ mice, which is associated with longer LORR, though the mechanism for this effect remains unknown. Replicating our previous findings, SERT-/- mice regained their righting reflex at a rate 14.34 times slower than SERT+/+ controls (χ 2 (1) = 9.99, p = 0.003, HR = 14.34, CI 95: 2.75, 74.78) indicating that these animals are significantly more sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of alcohol (Fig. 6). Consistent with increased expression of OCT3 playing a mechanistic role in this finding, OCT3-/- mice regained their righting reflex at a rate approximately 4.65 times faster than OCT3+/+ controls (χ 2 (1) = 6.64, p = 0.01, HR = 4.65, CI 95: 1.45, 14.96), indicating that mice lacking OCT3 are significantly less sensitive to the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol, and that the sedative effects of ethanol appear to be dependent on degree of OCT3 expression. There was no effect of genotype on LORR latency (χ 2 (3) = 0.87, p = 0.83; data not shown).

### Serotonin transporter distribution and density in the cerebral cortex of alcoholic and nonalcoholic comparison subjects: a whole-hemisphere autoradiography study [^116a5ptH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex and dysfunctions in serotonin turnover are two well-established factors associated with impulsive and sociopathic behaviors, but no firm neuroanatomical data have linked these pathophysiological findings. The aims of this study were to identify putative areas in the human brain that are rich in serotonin transporter sites, particularly within the medial prefrontal cortex, and to determine whether serotonin transporter density in this area is altered among alcoholic subjects.

Method

Serotonin transporter density was measured among 17 alcoholic and 10 nonalcoholic comparison subjects by postmortem whole-hemisphere autoradiography with [³H]citalopram.

Results

In the human cerebral cortex, serotonin transporter binding sites were concentrated in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. Substantially sparser serotonin transporter density (up to 35%) was observed in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex of alcoholic subjects in relation to nonalcoholic comparison subjects. After adjustment for age and postmortem delay, this finding remained statistically significant.

Conclusions

A lower serotonin transporter density among the alcoholic subjects was observed, specifically in the so-called "affect" region, suggesting an association between ethanol addiction and dysfunctional serotonergic neurotransmission in this area.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^1116iufQ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here we report the novel finding that ethanol acts at OCT3 to inhibit monoamine uptake. We base this on our findings that (1) ethanol inhibits fluorescent and radiolabeled substrate uptake in hOCT3 HEK293 cells at physiologically relevant concentrations; (2) in wild-type, but not in OCT3-/- mice, ethanol (a) inhibits DA clearance in striatum in vivo; (b) enhances the ability of cocaine to inhibit DA clearance in striatum in vivo; (c) augments CPP for cocaine; and (d) augments sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine; (3) sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol are less in OCT3-/- mice than wild-type mice; and (4) ethanol does not displace binding of well-established ligands that bind to the S1 site of DAT, NET or SERT nor does it interfere with uptake of substrates via each transporter at concentrations lower than 100 mM. Together with our published findings that cocaine does not interact with OCT3 at physiologically relevant concentrations (e.g. concentrations that produce maximal behavioral effects) these findings provide a novel mechanistic basis for the increased and prolonged subjective euphoria experienced by individuals who use cocaine and alcohol concurrently. By acting at different sites to inhibit monoamine uptake (i.e. ethanol at OCT3, cocaine at DAT, NET, and SERT), the ensuing increase in monoamines, and therefore conceivably the "high", is greater when ethanol and cocaine are taken concurrently than when they are taken separately.

Including all cases, and adjusting for sex and age, SERT binding was lower in suicides (F = 15.367, df = 1,9, p = 0.004). There was no interaction between suicide and Brodmann area (F = 0.828, df = 8,1665, p = 0.578) indicating the effect of suicide was comparable in all areas. Limiting the cases to only those with psychological autopsy, the effect of suicide remained significant (F = 11.464, df = 1,9, p = 0.008, Fig. 2a).

Major depressive disorder

There was lower SERT binding with MDD (F = 9.476, df = 1,13, p = 0.009), and the lower binding was found in all brain regions (region by depression interaction F = 0.378, df = 8,8, p = 0.878). In the model with suicide and MDD, the effect of suicide was not significant (F = 5.147, df = 1,9, p = 0.050) suggesting that lower SERT in suicide is attributable, at least in part, to the MDD diagnosis (Table 3, Fig. 2a).

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^112z9qLZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Because DAT, NET and SERT take up substrates other than their native neurotransmitters, we first investigated if ethanol had activity at these high-affinity "uptake-1" transporters to inhibit monoamine clearance. Evidence has been reported both for and against activity of ethanol at these transporters, with different observations likely influenced by use of different expression systems and different concentrations of ethanol. We found that ethanol, at concentrations as high as 1 M, did not compete against, [³H]WIN35,428 binding to DAT in striatal homogenates, or against [³H]nisoxetine and [³H]citalopram binding to NET and SERT, respectively, in hippocampal homogenates. In contrast, high affinity ligands for these transporters (GBR12909, reboxetine and citalopram,) displaced [3 H]WIN35,428, [3 H]nisoxetine and [3 H]citalopram to DAT, NET and SERT, respectively, with Ki values in the nM range. However, the pharmacology of monoamine transporters is complex and modulators may bind to ortho- and allosteric sites. Ethanol interacts with a binding site that is located on the extracellular loop 2 of the DAT. Hence, ligand-displacement assays carried out at equilibrium may not allow for identification of modulatory properties, or lack thereof. Consequently, we also performed functional assays to determine the effect of ethanol on DAT, NET, SERT and OCT3 with high temporal resolution. Ethanol at concentrations as high as 100 mM did not inhibit uptake of fluorescent substrate into hSERT HEK293 cells, and at this high concentration, only modestly inhibited uptake into hDAT and hNET HEK293 cells. In contrast, cocaine (10 µM) fully blocked substrate uptake in these cell lines. Combined with existing literature, our data support findings that ethanol does not perturb function of DAT, NET or SERT, with regards to inwardly-directed transport fluxes.

### Serotonin transporter availability correlates with alcohol intake in non-human primates [^1132A1rT]. Molecular Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A low level of alcohol intoxication upon initial exposure and impulsive aggressiveness predispose humans to alcoholism. In non-human primates, central serotonin transporter availability and turnover rate were associated with aggressive behavior and a low response to initial alcohol exposure. We assessed the respective effects of these factors on alcohol intake in a free choice paradigm. Serotonin transporter availability in the raphe area, the origin of central serotonergic projections, was measured with single-photon emission computed tomography and the radioligand [(123)I]beta-CIT in 11 rhesus monkeys with low and high central serotonin turnover. The amount of alcohol intake in the 3-month observation period was positively correlated with serotonin transporter availability (R = 0.76, P = 0.006), but not with aggressiveness (R = 0.19, P = 0.6) or alcohol response upon first exposure (R = -0.48, P = 0.2). In a linear multiple regression analysis with serotonin transporter availability, alcohol response, and aggressiveness as independent variables, 82% of the variance of alcohol intake was explained and serotonin transporter availability emerged as the only statistically significant factor (beta = 7.81, P = 0.006). These observations indicate that there may be a direct relationship between serotonin transporter availability and alcohol intake after controlling for aggression and alcohol response on first exposure.

### Restoring consciousness with pharmacologic therapy: mechanisms, targets, and future directions [^11365hue]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Serotonin plays an important role in promotion of wakefulness and regulation of the sleep wake cycle. Serotonin levels have been reported to be markedly increased in postmortem evaluation of patients with hepatic and uremic coma, while decreased serotonin synthesis and serotonin transporters have been reported in rats with traumatic brain injury. There are 14 different serotonin receptor subtypes, with varied localization and expression throughout the brain, that have been explored as therapeutic targets in a variety of disease states. Serotonin receptors have a role in modulation of 5-HT, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurotransmission depending on receptor subtype and location. High density of 5-HT 2A receptors has been identified in association cortical areas of the default mode network and thalamo-cortical system. Interestingly, various anesthetics have opposing effects on the 5-HT 3 receptor, which is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. Therefore, 5-HT 3 contributions to anesthesia induction may occur through indirect mechanisms.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^113dfyyf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Classic hallucinogens treat addiction

Literature from the 1950s through the 1970s, as well as modern reports, show that CH have positive effects on substance dependence. Thus, not only do CH appear to be non-addictive, several studies show that they reverse the addictive effects of other psychoactive drugs. CH have been used to alleviate neurotic symptoms by indigenous people for thousands of years, and the discovery of LSD and its psychoactive effects sparked considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of CH. Most work focused on the use of these compounds as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Between 1950 and the mid-1960s, more than 1000 quasi-clinical trials were completed, several dozen books were published, and six international conferences were held providing data on approximately 40,000 patients that had undergone "psychedelic" therapy sessions. In the context of the treatment of substance dependence, most studies focused on the use of LSD for the treatment of alcoholism (for reviews, see;). These studies examined both single, high-dose, and repeated low-dose designs, follow-up periods of several years, control groups, and a total subject pool of well in excessive of 1000 individuals. Between 50% and 70% of the subjects showed reduced drinking or sobriety and/or improved social or professional functioning. Such a treatment effect is exceptional compared to current Food and Drug Administration–approved medications for alcoholism (i.e. disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate). However, the relatively low number of participants in each study, lax designs, and suspect claims led many to question whether accurate conclusions could be made. Nevertheless, results from the six randomized trials of LSD for alcohol dependence that reported drinking outcomes recently underwent a meta-analysis that demonstrated consistent treatment effects supporting the efficacy of LSD.

### Stress-related neuropeptide systems as targets for treatment of alcohol addiction: a clinical perspective [^115pHizp]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol use is a major cause of disability and death globally. These negative consequences disproportionately affect people who develop alcohol addiction, a chronic relapsing condition characterized by increased motivation to use alcohol, choice of alcohol over healthy, natural rewards, and continued use despite negative consequences. Available pharmacotherapies for alcohol addiction are few, have effect sizes in need of improvement, and remain infrequently prescribed. Research aimed at developing novel therapeutics has in large part focused on attenuating pleasurable or "rewarding" properties of alcohol, but this targets processes that primarily play a role as initiation factors. As clinical alcohol addiction develops, long-term changes in brain function result in a shift of affective homeostasis, and rewarding alcohol effects become progressively reduced. Instead, increased stress sensitivity and negative affective states emerge in the absence of alcohol and create powerful incentives for relapse and continued use through negative reinforcement, or "relief". Based on research in animal models, several neuropeptide systems have been proposed to play an important role in this shift, suggesting that these systems could be targeted by novel medications. Two mechanisms in this category, antagonism at corticotropin-releasing factor type 1, and neurokinin 1/substance P receptors, have been subject to initial evaluation in humans. A third, kappa-opioid receptor antagonism, has been evaluated in nicotine addiction and could soon be tested for alcohol. This paper discusses findings with these mechanisms to date, and their prospects as future targets for novel medications.

Considerations of 5-HT 2C receptor activation to addiction liability: Neurochemistry studies

The most supported mechanism for the anti-addiction effects of 5-HT 2C activation is inhibition of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, which decreases psychostimulant-elicited dopamine release in the NAc (Manvich et al. 2012b;). Evidence suggests these effects are caused by 5-HT 2C receptor-mediated activation of GABA neurons in the VTA, which directly inhibit VTA dopamine neuron activity. Conversely, inactivation of 5-HT 2C receptors by antagonists or inverse agonists increases firing rates of VTA dopamine neurons, increasing dopamine levels in the NAc. Identifying the specific neural circuitry examined in such studies, however, is important, as these observations ostensibly conflict with the conclusions from a new report about 5-HT 2C receptor modulation of dopamine neurotransmission. Specifically, using slice electrophysiology, the authors report that 5-HT 2C receptors expressed on dopamine neurons stimulate a significant number of them. Collectively, the data suggest that the emergent effects of 5-HT 2C activation on dopamine neurotransmission depend on the relative activation of 5-HT 2C receptors on different cell types; for example, GABA neurons innervating dopamine neurons (resulting in dopamine neuron inhibition) relative to 5-HT 2C receptors expressed directly on dopamine neurons (resulting in dopamine neuron activation). In support of this, in mice that express 5-HT 2C receptors only on dopamine VTA neurons, 5-HT 2C activation enhances dopamine neuron activity to a greater degree than in wild-type mice, suggesting that 5-HT 2C receptors on other cell types have an inhibitory effect on dopamine neurotransmission.

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^1125nUGU]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Alcohol use disorder

There were cases with AUD in both nonsuicides (n = 53 with AUD) and suicides (n = 20 with AUD). The AUD diagnosis was associated with more SERT (Fig. 2b, Table 4; F = 8.135, df = 1,16, p = 0.012); the AUD interaction with brain region was not significant (F = 0.671, df = 8,10, p = 0.708) indicating the effect of AUD was comparable in all areas. In the same model, the suicide effect adjusted for AUD was not significant (F = 2.972, df = 1,10, p = 0.117), suggesting the AUD effect is in nonsuicides (Fig. 2b). Similarly, with MDD in the model, the diagnosis of MDD was also no longer significant (F = 3.418, df = 1,23, p = 0.078). This may reflect the lower rate of MDD in the alcoholics in our sample. In nonalcoholics, 34 of 40 suicides had MDD. In alcoholics, 14 of 58 had MDD.

Adversity

When childhood adversity was included in the model along with suicide, there were no SERT differences related to childhood adversity (F = 1.907, df = 1,9, p = 0.20, Table 5). The suicide effect of less SERT binding was significant (p = 0.006) and there was a suicide*adversity interaction (p = 0.007) with adversity associated with more SERT binding, but only in non-suicides (Fig. 2c). The interaction term with Brodmann area was significant with the difference localized to BA24.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^114rwSsN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

While it is well documented that serotonin attenuates the reinforcing effects of a variety of psychoactive drugs through suppression of dopamine neurotransmission, it is important to consider that there are 16 distinct serotonin receptors (not including splice variants or RNA-edited 5-HT 2C receptors) that are grouped into seven families: 5-HT 1–5-HT 7 receptors. Unique serotonin receptors can facilitate, inhibit, or have no effect on dopamine neurotransmission and on the reinforcing properties of a variety of psychoactive drugs. With particular relevance to the anti-addictive properties of CH, there are a number of reported observations of opposing effects between the 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 2A receptor subtypes, with 5-HT 2A receptors facilitating and 5-HT 2C receptors suppressing dopamine neurotransmission (;, 2006;). The divergent effects of 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C on dopamine neurotransmission are at first consideration peculiar, since 5-HT 2 receptor subtypes couple to the same G-proteins (e.g. Gα q/11/12/13) and activate the same intra-cellular signaling pathways (e.g. phospholipase C [PLC], mitogen-activated protein kinase, β-arrestin), with a few notable exceptions. However, the differences observed may also be due to differences in the relative expression of 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors across cell types and microcircuits that control unique aspects of neural function, a point discussed in greater detail in the 5-HT 2C sections below. Nonetheless, the differences between 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C modulation of dopamine neurotransmission provide a clear hypothesis for why CH, which do not provide a large spread between 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 2A receptor activation, do not induce craving. We argue that activation of 5-HT 2C receptors tempers the addictive liability of CH.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^11467em6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Caveat emptor

5-HT 2C receptors are expressed in several neural systems, including the frontal and cingulate cortices, that regulate impulsivity, approach, and reward behavior, and activation of these receptors impacts neural circuitry to modulate the effects of addictive drugs. Our hypothesis regarding 5-HT 2C modulation of Kv1.x channels could be extended to these other neural systems. However, to maintain scope, we have focused on the NAc shell. Despite the logic regarding 5-HT 2C receptors and Kv1.x channels, there are reports that 5-HT 2A receptor activation also decreases Kv1.x activity, specifically Kv1.5 channels in cardiac tissue and Kv1.2 channels in cortical pyramidal neurons. In this latter study, 5-HT blocked Kv1.2 currents in layer V pyramidal neurons; the authors concluded the effects were mediated by 5-HT 2A receptors because of their dense expression. Still, 5-HT 2C receptors are also expressed in the frontal cortex, and modulate excitatory activity there. We acknowledge and appreciate that the modulatory activity of 5-HT 2 receptor subtypes that affects behavior is complex. 5-HT 2 receptor subtypes may modulate activity of unique Kv1.x channels, and the discovery of 5-HT 2 receptor subtype expression patterns within discrete neural circuits will likely lead to further elucidation of their individual functions. For example, 5-HT 2A receptors are found in the NAc shell and core, but (like 5-HT 2C) the functions of 5-HT 2A receptors in subregions of the NAc are unclear. Additional studies are needed to cull the specific Kv1.x channel subtypes that may associate with 5-HT 2C to lead to suppression of addictive behaviors.

### The effects of compound stimulus extinction and inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake on the renewal of alcohol seeking [^111Tqqxq]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Experiment 2: does deepened extinction following atomoxetine treatment survive a change in context?

Subjects and apparatus. The subjects were 24 male Hooded Wistar rats weighing ~420 g at the beginning of the experiment. Rats were sourced and housed as described in Experiment 1. The apparatus and acclimation procedures were identical to those described in Experiment 1.

Magazine and lever-press acquisition

On the first training day, rats received a 30-min magazine training session, during which 10% ethanol was dispensed according to a random time 30-s schedule. The next day, rats underwent instrumental training. The levers were introduced and responses were reinforced with 10% ethanol according to a FR1 schedule. On subsequent days, response was reinforced according to an increasing variable ratio schedule (days 1–3 FR1; days 4–6 VR2; days 7–9 VR3). Sessions were 30 min in duration. No discrete stimuli were used in this experiment.

Extinction Phase 1

After acquisition, rats were placed in a distinct extinction context as described above, and received one 10-min session in which lever-press responding was recorded but not reinforced with ethanol.

Extinction Phase 2

The following day, 45 min before the training session rats were injected with atomoxetine (1.0 mg kg −1 intraperitoneal (i.p.), Tocris, Ellisville, MO, USA; dissolved in saline and administered in a volume of 1 mL kg −1) or an equivalent volume of saline. This dose was chosen on the basis of previous studies that found this dose to be effective in reducing spontaneous recovery of responding for food or cocaine. Rats then underwent a 10-min extinction session in the extinction context.

Tests. One week later, rats underwent two tests across 2 days, one in the acquisition and one in the extinction contexts in a counterbalanced order. The tests were the same as the initial extinction sessions; the levers were introduced and response was recorded for 10 min.

Sucrose reward

A separate group of 24 rats were trained to self-administer sucrose again to verify the generality of any effects. Training and testing procedures were identical to those described above, except that animals were not exposed to alcohol and were trained to self-administer a 20% sucrose solution.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^1116uVcG]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Ethanol concentration-dependently inhibits uptake of fluorescent substrate via hOCT3 at concentrations that do not interfere with hDAT, hNET and hSERT-mediated uptake in vitro

To further probe activity of ethanol at OCT3 versus "uptake-1" monoamine transporters, we measured its ability to inhibit uptake of fluorescent substrates in HEK293 cells expressing either the YFP tagged human isoforms of OCT3, DAT, NET or SERT. Uptake of the fluorescent compounds APP⁺ and ASP⁺ afford the temporal resolution to monitor instantaneous effects of test drugs on transporter activity, providing a direct readout of substrate transport that is mediated by electrochemical gradient-driven OCT3 and the secondary-active "uptake-1" transporters. Cells were superfused with fluorescent substrate (10 µM of APP⁺ for SERT, DAT and NET; 3 µM of ASP⁺ for OCT3) for 40 s to establish the initial uptake rate before cells were exposed to ethanol or well-established inhibitors of these transporters. As in previous studies, we used ASP⁺ to measure OCT3-mediated transport fluxes. Owing to the antagonistic properties of ASP⁺ at SERT, APP⁺ was used for SLC6 transporters, as it reliably labels DAT- and NET-expressing cells and behaves as a substrate of SERT. Ethanol concentration-dependently inhibited substrate uptake only in hOCT3 HEK293 cells (F (5, 22.62) = 16.99, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3A, B). Both the selective OCT3 blocker corticosterone (10 µM; t (5.16) = 12.37, CI 95: 24.81, 44.72, p < 0.0001) and ethanol (100 mM; t (9.99) = 7.78, CI 95: 18.28, 42.55, p < 0.0001), fully blocked uptake of ASP⁺, while 30 mM ethanol inhibited uptake by ~50% (t (10.29) = 3.31, CI 95: 0.99, 30.74, p = 0.04). In contrast, ethanol did not impact fluorescent substrate uptake in hSERT HEK293 cells (Fig. 3G, H), and only modestly inhibited uptake into hDAT (F (5, 16.58) = 53.95, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3C, D) and hNET (F (5, 15.52) = 162.40, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3E, F) HEK293 cells at the highest concentration tested (100 mM). As expected, the DAT, NET, SERT blocker cocaine (10 µM) blocked APP⁺ uptake into cells expressing these transporters (Fig. 3C–H). We have previously shown that cocaine does not block fluorescent substrate uptake in hOCT3 HEK293 cells, which further supports the interpretation that the combination affects transporters of multiple families, i.e. SLC22 (OCT3) and SLC6 (DAT, NET, and SERT).

### Support for allelic association of a polymorphic site in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene with risk for alcohol dependence [^1119HXi1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

An association between the 5-HTTLPR short variant polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene and risk for alcohol dependence has been reported from case-control studies that are, however, prone to chance findings related to artifacts of population structure. The authors sought additional evidence for this association from a family-based study.

Method

Ninety-two alcohol-dependent probands and their parents were tested for nonrandom transmission of alleles from heterozygous parents to affected probands.

Results

Preferential transmission of the short allele was found (65 of 102 transmissions from heterozygous parents).

Conclusions

The results suggest allelic association between a variant in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene and the risk for alcohol dependence. However, it remains to be seen whether the functional properties of this variant are directly responsible for the increased risk to alcohol dependence.

### Ethanol inhibits dopamine uptake via organic cation transporter 3: implications for ethanol and cocaine co-abuse [^115HKCF8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Naïve adult male and female OCT3+/+ and OCT3-/- mice bred on a C57BL/6 background were used for in vivo chronoamperometry, conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization studies. Male OCT3+/+, OCT3-/-, SERT+/+ and SERT-/- mice were used for loss of righting reflex (LORR) studies. All mice were from our in-house colonies. For details, see Supplementary Information (SI).

To assess binding of ethanol to the orthosteric site of DAT, NET and/or SERT we measured its ability to displace binding of [3 H]WIN35,428, [3 H]nisoxetine and [3 H]citalopram, respectively, from striatal (DAT) or hippocampal (NET, SERT) homogenates, compared with high-affinity ligands for DAT, NET and SERT (GBR12909, reboxetine and citalopram, respectively) using established methods (and SI).

To gain direct insight into ethanol's interference with OCT3-mediated uptake we measured inhibition of [³H]MPP⁺ (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) uptake into human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing the human (h) isoform of OCT3 (hOCT3), or mock transfected HEK293 cells, according to Janowsky et al. Additionally, we used HEK293 cells stably expressing the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) tagged (to the N-terminus) isoforms of either hOCT3, hDAT, hNET or hSERT, and measured the ability of ethanol, cocaine (DAT, NET, SERT blocker) or corticosterone (OCT3 blocker) to inhibit uptake of the fluorescent substrates 4-(4-diemethylamino-styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP + for OCT3) or 4-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1-methylpyridinium, (APP + for DAT, NET and SERT) according to established methods (see SI).

Pharmacological specificity of the (−)Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol interoceptive cue demonstrated by antagonist blockade.

The findings presented in Table 3 show only compounds that are CB 1 partial or full agonists substituted for (−)Δ 9 -THC in drug-discrimination testing, and this finding has been replicated across all species used for these experiments. In a more comprehensive analysis of cannabinoid compounds in (−)Δ 9 -THC-cued drug-discrimination experiments, we discovered that more than 35 botanical and synthetic psychoactive CB 1 agonists have been tested, and all have been shown to generalize to (−)Δ 9 -THC. In contrast, non-psychoactive cannabinoids that lack CB 1 agonist activity do not substitute for (−)Δ 9 -THC (Table 3 ;). Many CNS-active compounds have been profiled in (−)Δ 9 -THC-cued drug discrimination, including several types of substances of abuse, for example, serotonergic psychedelics, entactogens, catecholaminergic stimulants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioid agonists, nicotine, and ethanol. As reported in Table 3, CB 1 receptor partial and full agonists were the only compounds that substitute for (−)Δ 9 -THC. Drugs evoking CNS effects similar to (−)Δ 9 -THC, for example, sedation, euphoria, perceptual and sensory changes, and/or intoxication, through different pharmacological mechanisms did not generalize to the (−)Δ 9 -THC discriminative cue (Table 3).

### Medication treatment of different types of alcoholism [^113NwbgN]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Alcoholism remains a serious cause of morbidity and mortality despite progress through neurobiological research in identifying new pharmacological strategies for its treatment. Drugs that affect neural pathways that modulate the activity of the cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system have been shown to alter drinking behavior, presumably because this dopaminergic system is closely associated with rewarding behavior. Ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen are examples. Subtyping alcoholism in adults into an early-onset type, with chronic symptoms and a strong biological predisposition to the disease, and a late-onset type, typically brought on by psychosocial triggers and associated with mood symptoms, may help in the selection of optimal therapy. Emerging adults with binge drinking patterns also might be aided by selective treatments. Although preliminary work on the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism and its treatment has been promising, the assignment to treatment still depends on clinical assessment. Brief behavioral interventions that encourage the patient to set goals for a reduction in heavy drinking or abstinence also are part of optimal therapy.

### Nicotine decreases ethanol-induced dopamine signaling and increases self-administration via stress hormones [^111N2TDg]. Neuron (2013). Low credibility.

Tobacco smoking is a well-known risk factor for subsequent alcohol abuse, but the neural events underlying this risk remain largely unknown. Alcohol and nicotine reinforcement involve common neural circuitry, including the mesolimbic dopamine system. We demonstrate in rodents that pre-exposure to nicotine increases alcohol self-administration and decreases alcohol-induced dopamine responses. The blunted dopamine response was due to increased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto dopamine neurons. Blocking stress hormone receptors prior to nicotine exposure prevented all interactions with alcohol that we measured, including the increased inhibition onto dopamine neurons, the decreased dopamine responses, and the increased alcohol self-administration. These results indicate that nicotine recruits neuroendocrine systems to influence neurotransmission and behavior associated with alcohol reinforcement.

### Biobehavioral effects of baclofen in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, laboratory study [^111CWCNb]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

The central finding of this study, that is, baclofen affects alcohol-related subjective experiences, is of potential importance. Subjective response to alcohol plays an important role in shaping the pattern of alcohol drinking. This is a multidimensional construct; an exploratory factor analysis by Ray and colleagues revealed a three-factor model for subjective responses to alcohol: (1) stimulation and other pleasant effects; (2) sedation and other unpleasant effects; (3) alleviation of tension and negative mood; an additional factor (craving/motivation) was also identified in another study. The present study applied a diverse set of assessments trying to investigate different dimensions of subjective response to alcohol. Several factors such as genetics, level of drinking and stage of alcoholism contribute to the individual variability in response to alcohol; in the present study, we controlled for this heterogeneity by adding the baseline Self-Rating of Effects of Alcohol scoreas a covariate in the initial run of each model. Notably, this variable was not found to be a significant covariate in any of the analyses.

Subjective response to alcohol is a potential biobehavioral target and a marker of early efficacy in medication development for AUD. While decreasing the pleasant effects of alcohol and/or increasing its unpleasant effects have typically been considered the main mechanisms for reducing alcohol drinking, this dichotomous classification is too simplistic and unable to fully explain the effects of some medications. For example, responses like feeling 'intoxicated' do not fall in either category. Also, the desired direction of change in responses like feeling 'high' may not be clear-cut from a medication development perspective. In fact, the amplification of subjective responses to alcohol observed in this study is in line with a previously proposed notion that baclofen might act through alcohol mimicking properties, representing a substitution or complementarity therapy for alcohol use. Importantly, GABA B receptors, especially at the presynaptic sites, play a central role in responsiveness to alcohol by regulating the synaptic ethanol sensitivity on one hand, and modulating the release and effects of other key neurotransmitters in the brain on the other hand.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^113EPwpH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite the relative absence of addictive properties, observed in well-controlled preclinical studies and reported by human users, CH can dose-dependently elevate mood and produce a strong sense of well-being, depending on mental set and environmental setting. In fact, many people who have taken CH report that their experiences were of the most influential and positive of their lives. These positive psychological effects of CH, nonetheless, do not qualify them as without risk, especially when taken without precaution, careful planning, and supervision. CH produce profound alterations in cognition and sensory perception and can produce emotional lability, fear, anxiety, and/or panic, among other adverse psychological and physiological effects. Nonetheless, if CH can elevate mood and produce a sense of well-being, why are they non-addictive?

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^115A4XNU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

These studies suggest that selective activation of 5-HT 2A receptors may induce craving and/or relapse. Nevertheless, it will be critical to assess empirically the addictive or anti-addictive potential of highly selective 5-HT 2A agonists. A recent report shows that an analogue from the phenethylamine class of CH, (4-bromo-3,6-dimethoxybenzocyclobuten-1-yl)methylamine (TCB-2) that has high 5-HT 2A agonist potency reduces intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), but does not attenuate the potentiating effects of cocaine on ICSS. Its activity at 5-HT 2B and 5-HT 2C receptors, however, has not been reported to our knowledge. Finally, CH may be biased agonists that stabilize 5-HT 2A receptor active conformations that block craving. Certainly, additional studies are warranted.

There are solid grounds to believe that the anti-aggression and impulsivity effects of 5-HT are mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor signalling, with some contribution from postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors. Assessing the functional effects of 5-HT1A receptor manipulations is complicated, however, owing to the opposing influences of pre- and postsynaptic 1A receptor activation. Prior to a time-dependent 5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitisation by reuptake blockers, stimulation of these presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors reduces serotonin efflux, whereas postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor activation is an important (and often clinically desirable) consequence of increased serotonin efflux. Moreover, selective 5-HT1AR antagonists or full 5-HT1AR agonists are not available for human use (beyond the very low doses used in PET imaging), and so cannot be used to incisively inform on this matter. With these caveats, it can be relatively safely inferred that (postsynaptic) 5-HT1AR agonism appears to reduce aggressive and impulsive behaviours. Note, however, that many 5-HT1A receptor agonists are in fact, only partial agonists; thus, their impact on net 5-HT1AR signalling is dependent on basal 5-HT efflux and competition with the full agonist endogenous ligand, 5-HT itself.

It has been claimed that the 5-HT1AR is the most prevalent and well-distributed 5-HT receptor in the brain. Serotonin has a high affinity for this receptor subtype, serotonergic projections densely innervate 5-HT1AR-rich regions and 5-HT concentrations may be higher in 5-HT1AR-rich subcortical/limbic regions than in the 5-HT2AR-rich cortex during basal conditions, although seeand. These factors imply that manipulation of synaptic 5-HT concentrations will significantly impact on postsynaptic 5-HT1AR signalling and limbic functioning. With this in mind, it is telling that 5-HT lesions and depletion both tend to promote impulsivity and aggression, whereas stimulating serotonin function tends to reduce these behaviours. It is also relevant that the potent 5-HT releaser, MDMA, has marked pro-social, pro-empathy, anti-aggressive effects during the acute phase, perhaps via an inhibitory action on activity in limbic regions, and some of these effects in rodents' can be attenuated by pre-treatment with a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^1133z9pa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Other findings corroborate the view that 5-HT 2C receptor activation impacts reward circuitry via multiple mechanisms. Recent studies point to direct modulatory effects of 5-HT 2C receptor activation on dopamine signaling in the NAc as contributors to their anti-addiction properties, and these effects may have as much relevance for addiction treatment as the effects of 5-HT 2C receptors in the VTA. For example, 5-HT 2C receptors expressed in the NAc inhibit postsynaptic dopamine signaling by inhibiting phosphorylation of DARPP-32, independent of dopamine release. 5-HT 2C receptor knockout mice also provide evidence for 5-HT 2C negative modulation of dopamine neurotransmission in reward circuitry. 5-HT 2C knockout mice are more sensitive to the psychostimulant effects of amphetamine, cocaine, and GBR 12909 (another dopamine reuptake blocker) and also exhibit increased cocaine-stimulated release of dopamine in their NAc. Interestingly, the enhanced effects of cocaine on dopamine release in the NAc in 5-HT 2C knockout mice are not observed in the dorsal striatum. Similarly, amphetamine's effects on dopamine release in the dorsal striatum are not potentiated in 5-HT 2C knockout mice. This neural system-specific effect is recapitulated using 5-HT 2C -selective ligands. For example, 5-HT 2C agonists administered systemically attenuate cocaine-stimulated dopamine release in the NAc, but not the dorsal striatum in wild-type mice or in nonhuman primates. Also, systemic treatment with 5-HT 2C agonists alone reduces dopamine in the NAc, but not the dorsal striatum, and the converse effects are observed after treatment with 5-HT 2C antagonists or inverse agonists; that is, they increase dopamine release in the NAc, but again, they have minimal effects on dopamine release in the dorsal striatum. These data are confluent with the distribution of 5-HT 2C receptors across neural systems, as 5-HT 2C receptors are densely expressed in the NAc but not the dorsal striatum (Figure 1). These observations suggest that post-synaptic 5-HT 2C receptors in the NAc may contribute strongly to the effects of selective 5-HT 2C agonists, administered systemically, on dopamine release in reward circuitry, a hypothesis we build in the following sections. Overall, the data provide a mechanistic rationale for the efficacy of CH, as 5-HT 2C agonists, to temper the rewarding effects of addictive drugs. As a recent optogenetic study showed exquisitely that dopamine cell firing in the medial forebrain bundle, including the VTA — NAc tract, is sufficient to cause a transition to addiction, it is clear that 5-HT 2C agonists have promise as tools in the treatment of addiction.

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^111SA3Qc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Most germane to the psychoactive effects of CH is that they are blocked by 5-HT 2 antagonists in both rodents and humans. It should be noted, however, that there are exceptions wherein 5-HT 2 antagonism is insufficient to eliminate the discriminative stimulus properties of CH (e.g. psilocybin and LSD) in rodents. Clearly, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics across species play an important role, and may underlie observed discrepancies. Nevertheless, adding to support that 5-HT 2 receptors are the predominant mediators of CH psychoactive effects are the observations that 5-HT 2A knockout mice do not exhibit behaviors, such as the head-twitch response (HTR;), typically elicited by CH. Also, the DOI-elicited HTR is reduced in 5-HT 2C receptor knockout mice. Collectively, it can be said with confidence that 5-HT 2 receptors predominantly mediate the psychoactive effects of CH. Here, we focus on interrogating 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2B, and/or 5-HT 2C receptors as the elemental GPCRs that underlie their non-addictive nature.

### Efficacy of azasetron on postoperative chronic pain after pulmonary surgery: a randomized triple-blind controlled trial [^114o1GpX]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence from prior research has shown that a single dose of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron exhibits an analgesic effect in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Another 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, tropisetron, is effective in mitigating the pain symptoms of fibromyalgia and low back pain. A prospective, multicenter, double-blind, parallel trial showed that a 10-day course of 5 mg tropisetron significantly improved pain symptoms and painful tender points. Our previous study confirmed that tropisetron decreased postoperative inflammation and myocardial injury biomarkers after heart valves replacement surgery. These studies collectively suggest that 5-HT3-receptor antagonists possess an analgesic effect. Our study delved into the analgesic effects of azasetron on postoperative pain, and the findings revealed that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist azasetron successfully reduced the NRS score in the acute phase, but not in the chronic phase following pulmonary surgery. Our results confirmed the acute analgesic effect of azasetron postoperatively.

In our study, regression analysis was used for identification of relevant factors for postoperative pain six months after surgery. Our findings revealed that preoperative pain, smoking, drinking, and open surgery were risk factors for postoperative chronic pain six months post-surgery. Considering the preexisting pain could potentially influence the preventive effect of azasetron on postoperative chronic pain, a sensitive sub-group analysis was performed in patients without preexisting pain. The sub-group analysis results showed similar results and confirmed the absence of prophylactic effect of azasetron on postoperative chronic pain. Preoperative pain has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for postoperative chronic pain, as a preconditioned pain pathway by preoperative pain evokes an exaggerated proinflammatory response post-surgery. Furthermore, patients with a long-term smoking habit often have lung tissue inflammation, which can result in frequent postoperative coughing and "respiratory" pain. Smoking cessation induces greater sensitivity to pain than in both nonsmokers and non-deprived smokers. Alcohol dependence and chronic pain share common neural circuits, and long-term alcohol use results in peripheral neuropathy and abnormal emotional-affective brain regions related to pain. Lastly, open pulmonary surgery, involving longer skin cuts and more severe tissue damage and nerve injury, often results in enhanced pain. In essence, we identified these four risk factors, which are very common and easy to acquire, for predicting postoperative chronic pain.

### Interaction between serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 5-HT ₃ antagonists, and NK1 antagonists in cancer patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy: a case-control study [^113ukJho]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) could decrease the activity of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) antagonists against acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), possibly through serotonin accumulation for 5-HT3 receptors.

Patients and Methods

Chemonaive cancer patients receiving SSRI and antiemetic agents, including the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron and the neurokinin 1 (NK1) antagonist aprepitant for highly emetogenic chemotherapy (etoposide-platinum), were matched to control patients for the following variables: age, gender, primary tumor, past history of gestational emesis, chronic intake of benzodiazepines and/or corticosteroids, chronic alcohol intake, and aprepitant use. The primary evaluation criterion was the occurrence of acute vomiting during the first two cycles of treatment.

Results

Forty-four patients were eligible for this analysis. The proportion of patients, who experienced at least one episode of grade ≥ 1 acute vomiting in patients receiving SSRI, compared to patients who did not, was significantly higher (59.1 vs. 22.7%, respectively, p = 0.03, odds ratio 4.72, 95% confidence interval 1.13–22.88). Grade ≥ 2 acute vomiting was also significantly more frequent in patients receiving SSRI, even after the implementation of aprepitant to antiemetic prophylaxis (41.2 vs. 5.9%, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that SSRI decrease the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3 serotonin antagonist ondansetron, resulting in higher rates of acute vomiting in cancer patients despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis. Adding the NK1 antagonist aprepitant do not counterbalance the deleterious effect of SSRI, probably due to the synergistic effects of SSRI and NK1 antagonists on serotonin transmission.

### Serotonin and brain function: a tale of two receptors [^111Gwg3f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1 summarises findings that support various associations between 5-HT, signalling at its post-synaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and relevant psychological phenomena. A number of these associations require qualification, e.g. 5-HT2AR agonism can have opposite acute and longer-term effects. To account for this, we use the acronyms 'ST' and 'LT' for acute (short-term) and long-term outcomes respectively, where we feel disambiguation is required. Also, receptor signalling may increase plasticity in one region but decrease it in the other (e.g.). As this matter is most relevant in relation to molecular markers of plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex, we use the acronyms 'hip' and 'cx' to provide the necessary disambiguation. Regarding plasticity, we use 'general plasticity' (gP) to refer simply to an increased capability for change and 'regional plasticity' (rP) when we are specifically referring regional changes in molecular markers of plasticity such as trophic factors. It is important to stress that the effects of 5-HT2AR agonism are highly context sensitive (see Figure 2), e.g. the effects of 5-HT2AR signalling on mood and mental health are likely highly sensitive to the quality of the environment in which a 5-HT2AR-mediated experience occurs, and this rule may also apply for treatment with an SSRI perhaps due to increased 5-HT2A receptor signalling through increased synaptic 5-HT. For this reason, and due to the still developing evidence base for psychedelics for depression (e.g. see), we took the modest step of not describing the association between 5-HT2AR signalling and depression as 'strong' (+++). In fact, we describe all associations between 5-HT, mood and depression as resting on 'reasonable' (i.e. ++) evidence because we acknowledge that these associations are especially complex. Also, some aspects of cognition but not others may be enhanced by increased signalling at a specific receptor and this is not qualified in the table. The reader may therefore notice some contradictory associations, simply because the data are not straightforward in supporting one particular direction. Importantly, this table is not intended as an exhaustive nor comprehensive account of literature pertaining to brain serotonin function but rather as an overview of significant associations between 5-HT, its 1A and 2A receptors and specific psychological phenomena of interest. This table cannot be considered a substitute for a detailed reading of the surrounding text. To properly understand the relevant associations, a careful reading of the text and supporting references is encouraged. Key: to provide a qualitative index of the perceived strength of evidence for a given association, we use the symbols +, ++ and +++ to denote 'weak', 'reasonable' and 'strong' evidence. Moreover, strong associations are shown in bold font. The '↑' symbol denotes an increase in a particular factor and '↓' denotes a decrease. The '→' symbol denotes that one factor causes another.

### Naltrexone blocks alcohol-induced effects on kappa-opioid receptors in the plasma membrane [^111UywGW]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Social drinking, i.e. moderate consumption of alcohol (ethanol (EtOH)) gives a sensation of elatedness and relaxation. This is very different from the drive to binge drinking, to get intoxicated. While the euphoric effects of alcohol, primarily mediated through the mu-opioid receptor (MOP), have been well studied, much less is known about the effects mediated by the kappa-opioid receptor (KOP) that contribute to alcohol abuse. We have decided to assess at the cellular and molecular level actions of alcohol on KOP and its interactions with naltrexone (NTX), which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Recently, NTX has been advocated for the treatment of alcohol misuse as "one of the most underutilized interventions in medicine".

### Serotonin receptors and suicide, major depression, alcohol use disorder and reported early life adversity [^114NVE8G]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Subjects

The Division of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology at the New York State Psychiatric Institute was the source of the brain samples. The Institutional Review Boards of the appropriate Institutions approved all procedures. Subjects had postmortem intervals (PMI) of 24 h or less and died suddenly. The Coroner or Medical Examiner diagnosed suicides on the basis of evidence of intent and a self-inflicted fatal act. There were 232 cases total (Table 1): suicide decedents (n = 83) and nonsuicides (n = 149). The majority of the cases and controls used have been published elsewhere in smaller, focused studies.

Table 1
All Subject demographics

AUD alcohol use disorder (dependent/abuser), MVA motor vehicle accident; *Some AUD subjects were comorbid for MDD

The next-of-kin of 167 subjects (Table 2) agreed to a psychological autopsy interview. We fully implemented the psychological autopsy protocol only after the first 65 suicides and nonsuicides had been collected. Diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria and used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID-I and SCID-II), and the Brown-Goodwin Aggression History Scale. AUD diagnosis was based on the psychological autopsy and autopsy findings such as liver cirrhosis combined with a blood or brain alcohol level of > 0.15%. Medication use within three months of death were recorded and recent use was confirmed by toxicology. All diagnoses, or lack thereof for controls, were made at a consensus conference with experienced psychiatrists, psychologists and other researchers. In the 232 cases, 65 subjects did not have a psychological autopsy, but we were able to review charts and other medical examiner records and arrive at a consensus diagnosis.

Brain collection

After brain removal, the brainstem was separated by a transverse cut at the rostral margin of the superior colliculus. The cerebellum was removed by severing the peduncles. The brain was bisected and the right hemicerebrum was cut into 2cm-thick coronal slabs. The slabs were placed on a glass plate, frozen in liquid Freon 12 (DuPont), placed in labeled plastic bags and transferred to a −80 °C freezer. Cerebellar tissue was collected for genetics and brain toxicology. The left hemisphere was placed in formalin for neuropathology.

### The genetics of alcoholism [^113wxTC6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Heritability estimates for alcoholism range from 50% to 60%, pointing out the importance of genetic and environmental factors in its etiology. This review highlights recent advances in translational work investigating genetic influences on alcoholism. We focus on genetic research involving corticotropin-releasing factor, glutamatergic, and opioidergic systems. Variation in the CRF1 receptor gene has been shown to moderate stress-induced alcohol drinking (gene-environment interaction) in animals, and this finding was recently extended to humans. Also, the hyperglutamatergic state, first observed during withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure in animal models, is associated with aversive and dysphoric states in alcoholics. Pharmacogenetic studies of naltrexone efficacy are in the clinical stages, and recent studies confirmed a differential response dependent on the mu-opioid receptor genotype. Such advances will be essential for the effective treatment of alcoholism in the future.

### Ethanol withdrawal-induced adaptations in prefrontal corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1-expressing neurons regulate anxiety and conditioned rewarding effects of ethanol [^117URMix]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the loss of control over ethanol intake, negative emotional states in the absence of ethanol, and a compulsion to seek and consume ethanol, which is thought to heavily involve the prefrontal cortex. Individuals with an AUD have reduced prefrontal cortex volumes, and hypo-functionality of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contributes to a loss of control over limiting intake in humans with an AUD. Preclinical studies also implicate the mPFC in anxiety-like behaviors and excessive ethanol drinking. Identifying chronic ethanol-induced adaptations that persist into withdrawal and drive aberrant behavior will provide insight into neuronal mechanisms for more efficacious therapeutic intervention, which are currently limited for AUD.

Ethanol activates neuroendocrine stress systems, which become dysregulated following chronic exposure contributing to AUD. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a major brain stress signal and plays a critical role in AUD. CRF binds the cognate CRF receptor 1 (CRF1), CRF receptor 2 (CRF2), as well as CRF binding protein (CRF-BP). While the CRF system has been extensively studied in limbic brain regions, much less is known about its functional role in prefrontal circuits. The CRF-CRF1 system is prominently expressed in the mPFC, while CRF2 is limited. Specifically, CRF and CRF1 are predominantly expressed in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. Functionally, injection of CRF or CRF1 antagonists in the mPFC is anxiogenic and anxiolytic, respectively, deletion of forebrain CRF1 reduces anxiety, mPFC CRF-CRF1 underlies stress-induced executive dysfunction, mPFC CRF signaling impairs working memory, and mPFC CRF interneurons regulate behavioral selection during stress. Notably, withdrawal from chronic alcohol recruits mPFC GABAergic CRF neurons, and binge alcohol consumption decreases mPFC CRF-BP, which is also predominantly expressed in mPFC GABAergic neurons. Taken together, CRF1-expressing mPFC neurons (mPFC CRF1+) have the molecular components to respond to neurochemical stress signals, that are vulnerable to repeated ethanol exposure, and are also wired to mediate anxiety-like behaviors; therefore, mPFC CRF1+ neurons are poised to promote relapse to ethanol use during abstinence.

### Effect of psilocybin on marble burying in ICR mice: role of 5-HT1A receptors and implications for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113M4UMm]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

In the current study, we sought to re-examine the role of 5-HT2A receptors in the effect of psilocybin on marble burying and to explore the role of 5-HT1A receptors by studying 5-HT1A agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist effects in the MBT in conjunction with psilocybin. We also examined the effect of staggered psilocybin administration as compared to bolus injection and the persistence of the anti-marble-burying effect after 7 days.

### 5-HT (2B) receptors are required for serotonin-selective antidepressant actions [^116W7vGn]. Molecular Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The therapeutic effects induced by serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are initially triggered by blocking the serotonin transporter and rely on long-term adaptations of pre- and post-synaptic receptors. We show here that long-term behavioral and neurogenic SSRI effects are abolished after either genetic or pharmacological inactivation of 5-HT(2B) receptors. Conversely, direct agonist stimulation of 5-HT(2B) receptors induces an SSRI-like response in behavioral and neurogenic assays. Moreover, the observation that (i) this receptor is expressed by raphe serotonergic neurons, (ii) the SSRI-induced increase in hippocampal extracellular serotonin concentration is strongly reduced in the absence of functional 5-HT(2B) receptors and (iii) a selective 5-HT(2B) agonist mimics SSRI responses, supports a positive regulation of serotonergic neurons by 5-HT(2B) receptors. The 5-HT(2B) receptor appears, therefore, to positively modulate serotonergic activity and to be required for the therapeutic actions of SSRIs. Consequently, the 5-HT(2B) receptor should be considered as a new tractable target in the combat against depression.

### Interactions between metabolic, reward and cognitive processes in appetite control: implications for novel weight management therapies [^112ntcgd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

5-HT and cognition

5-HT plays in a role in modulating cognitive function, although the effects of global manipulations of 5-HT on memory and attention in healthy volunteers are generally small. Nevertheless, reducing 5-HT by acute depletion of the 5-HT precursor tryptophan produces reliable impairment of memory consolidation. There is also an extensive preclinical literature on the role of 5-HT receptors in cognition, in particular there has been a focus on 5-HT 1A receptors, 5-HT 3 receptors and, more recently, 5-HT 6 receptors. However, 5-HT 3 receptor and 5-HT 6 receptor antagonists (for example the 5-HT 6 receptor antagonist, idalopirdine), which showed promising results in preclinical studies and early Phase 2 clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease, subsequently failed in large Phase 3 trials. Few studies have investigated the role of 5-HT receptors in cognition in healthy humans and to date there is no consistent evidence for involvement of specific 5-HT receptor subtypes (for review see). However, we have recently reported the novel finding that the 5-HT 2C receptor agonist mCPP enhances recall of emotional words. Given that the effect of mCPP on recall was unlikely to be related to effects on anxiety, further investigation of the specific role of the 5-HT 2C receptor in memory function is warranted. An interesting possibility is that mCPP (and by implication the 5-HT 2C receptor agonist, lorcaserin, which is marketed for obesity) might act to decrease food intake via enhancement of meal memories.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: a systematic review [^1111oDdU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we observed DDIs at both pharmacodynamic and (likely) pharmacokinetic levels that may block or decrease the response to psychedelics, or alternatively potentiate and lengthen the duration of psychological and/or physical effects. While there is strong evidence of 5-HT 2A receptor involvement in the effects of psychedelics, some research included in this review suggests that other serotonin receptors, such as 5-HT 1A/B and dopamine receptors, along with altered serotonin levels, may also modulate psychological and/or physical effects. Additionally, a small number of studies reviewed indicated a potential role of the 5-HT 1 receptor subtype in modulating the effects of DMT. It appears that although different psychedelics may yield similar subjective effects, their pharmacological properties differ, resulting in potentially varying interaction effects when combined with other drugs. Overall, given the limited number of papers exploring DDIs associated with psychedelics and the resurgence of scientific and medical interest in these compounds, further research is needed to improve understanding of such interactions, and identify novel drug interactions and potentially serious adverse reactions not currently described in the literature.

### Synchrony between midbrain gene transcription and dopamine terminal regulation is modulated by chronic alcohol drinking [^111YCRp8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Evidence suggests that ongoing alcohol intake produces a hypodopaminergic state through increased activity of inhibitory presynaptic regulators, including increased rate of dopamine reuptake from the extracellular space through augmented DAT efficiency. but whether this effect is maintained throughout protracted abstinence from voluntary alcohol drinking remains untested. One pulse stimulations (350 µA, 4 ms, monophasic) were used to evoke dopamine release (Fig. 4A). Observed peak dopamine concentrations are a product of the amount of dopamine released and the rate of ongoing dopamine reuptake, parameters which can be dissociated using Michaelis-Menten modeling. Using this approach, we found no group difference in dopamine release evoked by a 350 µA stimulation (Fig. 4B). However, maximal rate of dopamine reuptake (V max) was increased in subjects with a history of chronic alcohol self-administration (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with a hypodopaminergic state –, which is consistently observed in the mesolimbic system of humans with AUD and thought to be critical to symptomatology –, and provide evidence that this state persists in prolonged abstinence.

### Considerations and cautions for the integration of psilocybin into routine clinical care: a consensus statement from the US national network of depression centers' task group on psychedelics and related compounds [^111mtDvr]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Psilocybin evidence and limitations — depression and other indications are summarized as follows: Psilocybin did not significantly outperform escitalopram when assessed using the primary outcome for depression (QIDS), whereas secondary outcome assessments mostly favoured psilocybin over escitalopram, underscoring the importance of psychometrics and symptom characterisation. Beyond major depressive disorder (MDD), psilocybin has shown safety and potential utility in alcohol use disorder (AUD), tobacco use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), migraine headaches, cluster headaches, bipolar depression, and anorexia nervosa; many studies are ongoing including investigations in comorbid MDD and AUD and work on dosing or psychotherapy protocols and co-administration with a serotonin 5HT2A receptor antagonist such as risperidone. Overall, evidence for therapeutic benefits suggests promise but key limitations include highly protocolised trials that may not generalise to non-research clinical settings, lack of diversity in which more than 80% of participants in psychedelic trials have been white individuals, and understudied mechanisms wherein pharmacology and psychotherapy are closely intertwined and not yet separable, with psychotherapeutic approaches plausibly contributing to observed efficacy.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111EY8bP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Box 1: Neuroscience of alcohol withdrawal — pathophysiology and therapeutic targets — emphasizes the role of γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABA-A) binding, states that during prolonged alcohol use there is an upregulation of N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptors (NMDA) and a downregulation of GABA-A, and notes that with a high glutaminergic (excitatory) state and a low GABAergic (inhibitory) state the typical signs of alcohol withdrawal include tremor, seizures, nausea and delirium. Therapeutically, benzodiazepines and certain anti-seizure medications with GABAergic activity (carbamazepine and valproic acid) can be used to abate symptoms by reversing the GABA-A deficiency, and adjuncts include alpha2-adrenergic agonists [AA2As] that can decrease the over activity of the excitatory norepinephrine glutamate or one with both mechanisms of action (phenobarbital).

### The serotonin 5-HTreceptor and the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens [^114uFZbF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Classic hallucinogens share pharmacology as serotonin 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2B, and 5-HT 2C receptor agonists. Unique among most other Schedule 1 drugs, they are generally non-addictive and can be effective tools in the treatment of addiction. Mechanisms underlying these attributes are largely unknown. However, many preclinical studies show that 5-HT 2C agonists counteract the addictive effects of drugs from several classes, suggesting this pharmacological property of classic hallucinogens may be significant. Drawing from a comprehensive analysis of preclinical behavior, neuroanatomy, and neurochemistry studies, this review builds rationale for this hypothesis, and also proposes a testable, neurobiological framework. 5-HT 2C agonists work, in part, by modulating dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens (NAc) reward pathway. We argue that activation of 5-HT 2C receptors on NAc shell, GABAergic, medium spiny neurons inhibits potassium Kv1.x channels, thereby enhancing inhibitory activity via intrinsic mechanisms. Together with experiments that show that addictive drugs, such as cocaine, potentiate Kv1.x channels, thereby suppressing NAc shell GABAergic activity, this hypothesis provides a mechanism by which classic hallucinogen-mediated stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors could thwart addiction. It also provides a potential reason for the non-addictive nature of classic hallucinogens.

### Direct serotonin release in humans shapes aversive learning and inhibition [^115Nw3cT]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As with most psychoactive substances, including SSRIs –, the SSRA fenfluramine may produce ancillary off-target pharmacological effects alongside its primary mechanism. While retaining neurotransmitter selectivity for the serotonergic system at low doses, fenfluramine has modest affinity for the 5-HTR subtypes and sigma-1 (σ 1) receptors. In the case of 5-HTR, these effects appear to be specific to 5-HT 2A/B/C R, while there is inconclusive evidence of the involvement of other receptors, such as 5-HT 4; however, the binding affinity of fenfluramine for 5-HT 2A/B/C R is at most < 1% of that of competitive endogenous 5-HT. Indeed, given the high concentration of 5-HT following exocytic release and the finite availability of 5-HT receptors, the resulting ancillary effects of 5-HTR agonism/antagonism may be negligible. Moreover, fenfluramine appears to be both a positive allosteric modulator and antagonist of σ 1 R; while endogenous neurosteroid sigma-1 agonists may be potentiated through positive allosteric modulation, leading to improvements in cognitive ability –, it is unclear to what extent this effect may be offset by the sigma-1 antagonist properties of fenfluramine in the healthy brain.

### 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists ameliorate fatigue: so much potential, so little knowledge! [^111xRbs6]. Gut (2005). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that 5-HT3 receptor blockade will benefit patients with fatigue. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism underlying this widespread clinically important symptom and therapies may be derived from targeting the 5-HT system.

### Interactions of alcohol and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist in healthy male volunteers [^116Twg6v]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing interest in developing pharmacological agents to reverse alcohol (ethanol) intoxication, akin to naloxone for opioids. GABAergic modulation offers a potential pathway for reversing alcohol effects, specifically by targeting extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors with a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist. We tested the hypothesis that iomazenil, a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, can counteract alcohol intoxication.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design, healthy male volunteers (n = 33) were administered intravenous alcohol (ethanol) or placebo, followed by intravenous iomazenil or placebo. Biphasic Alcohol Affects Scale, which assesses the stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol, was used as the primary outcome measure. For secondary measures, the Visual Analog Scale was used to assess "high", "drowsiness", "Buzzed", and "anxiety". In addition, all subjects were asked to rate the number of standard alcohol drinks they believed had been administered.

Results

Alcohol produced greater sedation and stimulation when compared to placebo. Iomazenil produced the expected effect of increased anxiety compared to the placebo. However, Iomazenil did not attenuate the sedative or stimulatory effects of alcohol intoxication. Similarly, iomazenil did not significantly change feelings of "High", "Drowsy", "Anxious", or "Buzzed" produced by alcohol.

Conclusions

Although GABA-A receptors are thought to mediate the subjective effects associated with ethanol intoxication, this study failed to demonstrate a significant attenuation of ethanol intoxication by the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, iomazenil. This study raises questions as to the role of particular GABA-A receptor subtypes in ethanol intoxication and the extent to which GABA-A receptor subtype function must be reduced to attenuate human ethanol intoxication.

### Linkage of antisocial alcoholism to the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor gene in 2 populations… [^1142kPBA]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background In mice, quantitative trait locus studies and behavioral evaluation of animals deleted for 5-HT1B have implicated this serotonin autoreceptor in alcohol consumption and aggressive behavior. We therefore investigated whether the 5-HT1B gene is linked to alcoholism with aggressive and impulsive behavior in the human, as represented by 2 psychiatric diagnoses: antisocial personality disorder and intermittent explosive disorder comorbid with alcoholism. Linkage was evaluated in sib pairs, and by using an association approach in which pedigree randomization corrects for nonindependence of observations on related subjects. Results. Analysis of the American Indian sample closely matched the findings in the Finns. Sib pair analysis showed positive evidence of linkage to antisocial alcoholism at both HTR1B G861C and D6S284, and neither locus showed evidence of linkage to nonantisocial alcoholism or to the combination of antisocial alcoholism and nonantisocial alcoholism. It is also possible that the association in the Finnish sample was caused by linkage disequilibrium between HTR1B G861C and some other gene within 6q13–15. At this time, 2 genes of interest are known to be located within the 6q13–15 region: cannabinoid receptor36 and serotonin 5-HT1E receptor. 37 On the basis of the data published by Hoehe et al36 and Lappalainen et al, 22HTR1B and the cannabinoid receptor gene appear to be separated by a considerable distance. For example, D6S26 was mapped 11 cM from cannabinoid receptor but only 3 cM from HTR1B. Also, HTR1E appears to be an unlikely site for functional variation causing predisposition to antisocial alcoholism.

First, Shimron-Abarbanell et al37 screened a large sample of whites for genetic variation within HTR1E and concluded that no common functional variation exists within this gene. Taken together, these results from 2 unrelated population samples strongly suggest that a genetic variant that predisposes to antisocial alcoholism resides close to the HTR1B coding sequence, and indicate that 5-HT1B receptors may be involved in the control of aggression and impulsivity in humans. Accepted for publication July 24, 1998.

### Irritable bowel syndrome… [^114xgprd]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the effects of treatments in people with irritable bowel syndrome. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL. Smooth Muscle Relaxants. One systematic review found limited evidence that smooth muscle relaxants improved symptoms compared with placebo. One subsequent RCT found no significant difference between alverine and placebo in improvement in abdominal pain, although the study may have lacked power to exclude a clinically important effect. One RCT identified by a systematic review found that mebeverine was less effective for symptoms than alosetron in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS, although there are concerns that alosetron may be associated with ischemic colitis. TRADE-OFF BETWEEN BENEFITS AND HARMS.

5HT4 Receptor Agonists One systematic review found that in women with constipation-predominant IBS, tegaserod improved symptoms compared with placebo. It found insufficient evidence about the effects of tegaserod in men. Tegaserod was more likely to cause diarrhea than placebo. Alosetron One systematic review found that alosetron improved symptoms in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS compared with placebo or mebeverine. However, alosetron is associated with adverse effects, particularly constipation, and has been restricted in some countries because of concerns that it may be associated with ischemic colitis. The systematic review provided insufficient evidence about the effects of alosetron in men. UNKNOWN EFFECTIVENESS 5HT3 Receptor Antagonists Other Than Alosetron We found no RCTs examining 5HT 3 receptor antagonists other than alosetron.

Fiber Supplementation Small RCTs provided insufficient evidence on the effects of fiber supplementation on the symptoms of IBS. Definition IBS is a chronic noninflammatory condition characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habit, and abdominal bloating, but with no identifiable structural or biochemical disorder. Symptom-based criteria, such as the Manning criteria.
