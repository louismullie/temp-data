## Question

Heart failure contributions to kidney failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how heart failure contributes to kidney failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bidirectional cardiorenal relationship and where heart failure fits within that framework. Then, I should verify the principal hemodynamic mechanisms, especially forward failure with reduced renal perfusion and backward failure with venous congestion. Next, I will examine neurohormonal activation and structural kidney changes that perpetuate injury. After that, I need to consider the clinical spectrum from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease and how we classify cardiorenal syndromes. Finally, I should review prognostic implications and therapeutic implications that modify the trajectory, including SGLT2 inhibitors and guideline-directed medical therapy, and close with practical clinical takeaways and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the overarching concept so I don't jump to conclusions: heart and kidney dysfunction are bidirectionally linked, and when heart failure is the primary insult, the resulting kidney injury is termed cardiorenal syndrome type 2, which is common and prognostically important, so I need to keep both directions in mind while focusing on HF→kidney here [^117JwpDc] [^116Xkd7K].

> Now, I will examine hemodynamic mechanisms, starting with forward failure and reduced renal perfusion. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect here, because even modest reductions in cardiac output can meaningfully decrease renal blood flow and GFR, and this hypoperfusion triggers tubulointerstitial hypoxia and structural injury over time, especially when sustained or recurrent [^111Vyi2M] [^113bvYcw].

> Next, I should review backward failure and venous congestion. Hold on, I should verify whether central venous pressure or renal venous pressure is the more proximal driver — evidence supports that elevated central venous pressure transmits to the kidney, raising intrarenal venous pressure, compressing vasa recta, and reducing effective perfusion pressure, which acutely lowers GFR and chronically leads to interstitial fibrosis and nephron loss, a process sometimes termed congestive nephropathy [^116MAqzV] [^1179P3Yw] [^116peYcc].

> I need to check the neurohormonal amplifiers next. Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system in heart failure constricts efferent arterioles, increases sodium retention, and promotes fibrosis, while natriuretic peptide signaling becomes dysregulated, impairing natriuresis and further worsening congestion and kidney injury, creating a vicious cycle that sustains and accelerates kidney dysfunction [^117JwpDc] [^117QDHmJ] [^113bvYcw].

> Let me consider structural kidney changes that evolve over time. Chronic hypoperfusion and venous congestion drive glomerular ischemia, endothelial injury, and interstitial fibrosis, with loss of nephrons and impaired renal functional reserve, and I should double-check that these changes can persist even after hemodynamic optimization, reflecting irreversible parenchymal injury in some patients [^113bvYcw] [^113XkRBk].

> I will now examine the clinical spectrum. In acute decompensated heart failure, worsening renal function occurs in roughly 10–40% and is often a functional, pseudo–worsening renal function driven by congestion rather than intrinsic tubular injury, though distinguishing pseudo-WRF from true AKI is crucial for prognosis and management, whereas in chronic heart failure, repeated episodes and persistent hemodynamic stress accelerate CKD progression, with CKD prevalence approaching 50% in HF cohorts and substantially higher in advanced HF [^1117i2iB] [^113bvYcw] [^116cDQXr].

> Hold on, I should verify the classification so I don't mislabel the phenotype. The accepted framework defines type 2 cardiorenal syndrome as chronic cardiac dysfunction leading to progressive CKD, which fits the scenario of HF driving kidney failure, and this classification helps align mechanistic understanding with therapeutic strategies [^116Xkd7K] [^117JwpDc].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications. Worsening renal function during HF hospitalization is consistently associated with higher mortality, longer length of stay, and more readmissions, and in chronic HF, the severity of kidney dysfunction tracks with mortality risk more robustly than short-term changes in eGFR, reinforcing the need to both prevent AKI and slow CKD progression in this population [^111YPgxS] [^117BtHTy] [^115F65Ap].

> Let me think about therapeutic modifiers that interrupt the cardiorenal spiral. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death and slow kidney function decline across EF phenotypes and a wide eGFR range, with benefits observed down to eGFR about 20 mL/min/1.73 m², and meta-analyses suggest the greatest absolute kidney benefit when started earlier and the greatest HF benefit at lower eGFR, which is clinically actionable [^1125TUUC] [^111AbGLR] [^115xgKFA] [^115wzXTV].

> I should confirm the role of guideline-directed medical therapy. RAAS blockade and MRAs can acutely reduce GFR yet improve long-term outcomes, and careful uptitration with close monitoring is warranted, while ARNIs may offer additional kidney protection via enhanced natriuretic peptide signaling and afferent vasodilation, and diuretic resistance — often a manifestation of venous congestion — requires proactive strategies to achieve decongestion without provoking further kidney injury [^1116zxqm] [^111HCFyZ] [^112XtZqt].

> But wait, what about risk stratification and monitoring? I need to ensure we don't overinterpret creatinine alone, because muscle mass, volume status, and hemodynamics confound creatinine-based eGFR, so integrating albuminuria, cystatin C, and serial eGFR trajectories improves risk assessment, and emerging hierarchical kidney endpoints that incorporate death, ESKD, large eGFR declines, and slope can better capture clinically meaningful kidney outcomes in HF trials and care pathways [^111Vyi2M] [^112QRGiW] [^113XkRBk].

> In summary, heart failure contributes to kidney failure through a triad of hemodynamic stress, neurohormonal activation, and structural remodeling, producing a bidirectional vicious cycle in which HF drives AKI and CKD, and CKD worsens HF. Recognizing this pathophysiology supports early decongestion, optimized GDMT including SGLT2 inhibitors, and vigilant monitoring to slow kidney function decline and improve survival [^117JwpDc] [^113bvYcw] [^1125TUUC].

---

Heart failure contributes to kidney failure through **hemodynamic congestion** (elevated central venous pressure reduces renal perfusion and glomerular filtration) [^1179P3Yw], **neurohormonal activation** (RAAS, SNS, and aldosterone drive vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis) [^116ita59], and **inflammation/oxidative stress** (endothelial dysfunction, microvascular injury, and tubular damage) [^111Vyi2M]. These mechanisms converge to cause **acute kidney injury** during decompensation and progressive CKD over time, with SGLT2 inhibitors and RAAS blockade mitigating decline and improving outcomes [^1125TUUC] [^1177x74G].

---

## Hemodynamic mechanisms

### Reduced renal perfusion

Forward failure from **reduced cardiac output** lowers renal blood flow, causing ischemia and tubular injury [^111Vyi2M]. Backward failure from **venous congestion** elevates central venous pressure, compresses renal veins, and decreases glomerular filtration [^1179P3Yw].

---

### Increased intrarenal resistance

Sympathetic activation increases **renal vascular resistance**, reducing perfusion and GFR [^1173BUsQ]. Endothelial dysfunction and microvascular rarefaction further impair perfusion and filtration [^notfound].

---

## Neurohormonal mechanisms

### Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

- **RAAS activation**: Reduced perfusion triggers RAAS, causing vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis [^116ita59].
- **Aldosterone effects**: Aldosterone promotes sodium retention, potassium loss, and myocardial/renal fibrosis, worsening both organs [^117QDHmJ].

---

### Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation

Increased **sympathetic tone** causes renal vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and reduced perfusion [^notfound]. Catecholamines also induce oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, accelerating injury [^notfound].

---

## Inflammatory and oxidative stress mechanisms

### Systemic inflammation

Elevated **proinflammatory cytokines** (TNF-α, IL-6) promote endothelial dysfunction, microvascular injury, and fibrosis [^notfound]. Chronic inflammation accelerates CKD progression and cardiac remodeling [^117Qezpc].

---

### Oxidative stress

Increased **reactive oxygen species** damage renal tubular cells, impair autoregulation, and promote fibrosis [^111Vyi2M]. Oxidative stress also worsens endothelial dysfunction and microvascular rarefaction [^115LEcWN].

---

## Structural renal changes

### Glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration

Initially, reduced perfusion triggers **hyperfiltration**, increasing glomerular pressure and injury [^111BjB1M]. Over time, this leads to glomerulosclerosis and nephron loss [^111Vyi2M].

---

### Tubulointerstitial fibrosis

Chronic hypoperfusion and inflammation drive **interstitial fibrosis**, tubular atrophy, and nephron loss [^notfound]. Fibrosis is a key driver of irreversible CKD progression [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and outcomes

### Acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI occurs in 27–40% of acute decompensated heart failure admissions and is linked to higher mortality and morbidity [^113pTimK]. Most cases reflect **functional decline** from congestion rather than intrinsic injury, but some progress to CKD [^1117i2iB].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

CKD is present in ~50% of chronic heart failure patients and worsens prognosis, increasing mortality and hospitalizations [^111Tg44c]. CKD prevalence rises with heart failure severity and is associated with higher mortality and hospitalization rates [^115F65Ap].

---

### Cardiorenal syndrome

Cardiorenal syndrome describes **bidirectional heart–kidney dysfunction**, with each organ worsening the other [^117JwpDc]. It is classified into five subtypes by acuity and primary organ, with type 2 (chronic heart failure causing CKD) being most common [^116Xkd7K].

---

## Therapeutic implications

### Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)

- **RAAS inhibition**: ACE inhibitors/ARBs and MRAs reduce renal fibrosis and slow CKD progression, though monitoring for hyperkalemia is required [^117QDHmJ] [^115r2dVh].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Reduce HF hospitalizations, slow eGFR decline, and lower kidney failure risk across EF spectra [^1125TUUC] [^115xgKFA].
- **ARNI**: Sacubitril/valsartan improves cardiovascular and renal outcomes in HFrEF [^1118urSy].

---

### Diuretic resistance and congestion management

Diuretic resistance is common and worsens renal function; strategies include higher doses, combination loops/thiazides, and careful monitoring [^111YPgxS]. Persistent congestion independently predicts **worsening renal function** and adverse outcomes [^1179P3Yw].

---

Heart failure drives kidney failure through **hemodynamic stress, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation**, causing AKI and progressive CKD; early recognition and GDMT — especially SGLT2 inhibitors and RAAS blockade — can slow decline and improve outcomes [^117JwpDc] [^1125TUUC].

The bidirectional cardio-renal interplay

There is broad evidence of a close interconnection between kidney and heart disease: the term cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) has been defined to underline bidirectionality of heart-kidney interplay, with acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ leading to acute or chronic dysfunction of the other, conferring relevant morbidity and mortality. Since combined heart and kidney abnormalities can differ in their clinical presentation and time frame (acute vs chronic), a subdivision of CRS in five subtypes has been adopted. A detailed discussion of pathophysiological mechanisms potentially responsible for CRS is beyond the scope of this article as such information can be found elsewhere. It is worth mentioning that hemodynamic and neurohormonal abnormalities are putatively key players in the detrimental crosstalk between the failing heart and the failing kidney. Briefly, HF-associated low cardiac output, effective hypovolemia, and excess of vasoconstrictive mediators lead to chronic renal hypoperfusion and decrease in eGFR, favoring CKD initiation and/or progression. Conversely, sodium and water retention and chronic RAAS activation in CKD exacerbate hypertension and increase cardiac pre- and after-load. These hemodynamic abnormalities — together with CKD-associated uremic toxins retention and chronic inflammation — sustain pathological cardiac remodeling and the onset and worsening of cardiac dysfunction, completing a vicious cycle injurious to both organs. The parallel pathways leading to cardiac and renal disease in the context of T2D are illustrated in Fig. 2.

### Management of heart failure in advancing CKD: core curriculum 2018 [^113CAHNZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure and chronic kidney disease have increasing incidence and prevalence owing in part to the aging population and increasing rates of hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiovascular and kidney disease risk factors. The presence of one condition also has a strong influence on the other, leading to greater risks for hospitalization, morbidity, and death, as well as very high health care costs. Despite the frequent coexistence of heart failure and chronic kidney disease, many of the pivotal randomized trials that guide the management of heart failure have excluded patients with more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. In this Core Curriculum article, management of a challenging, yet not unusual, case of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in a patient with stage 4 chronic kidney disease provides an opportunity to review the relevant literature and highlight gaps in our knowledge.

Noncardiovascular history — chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for ≥ 3 mo, and staging is based on GFR thresholds: CKD stage 1 requires GFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² and evidence of proteinuria; CKD stage 2 is GFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m²; CKD stage 3 is GFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m²; CKD stage 4 is GFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m²; and CKD stage 5 is GFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m² or patient requires chronic dialysis treatment.

### Heart failure in patients with kidney disease [^116Tpye6]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the population of CKD patients with concurrent HF continues to grow. The accurate diagnosis of HF is challenging in patients with CKD in part due to a lack of validated imaging and biomarkers specifically in this population. The pathophysiology between the heart and the kidneys is complex and bidirectional. Patients with CKD have greater prevalence of traditional HF risk factors as well as unique kidney-specific risk factors including malnutrition, acid-base alterations, uraemic toxins, bone mineral changes, anemia and myocardial stunning. These risk factors also contribute to the decline of kidney function seen in patients with subclinical and clinical HF. More targeted HF therapies may improve outcomes in patients with kidney disease as current HF therapies are underutilised in this population. Further work is also needed to develop novel HF therapies for the CKD population.

### The kidney in heart failure: an update [^111euAiZ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Heart and kidney are closely related in the clinical syndrome of heart failure (HF). It is now sufficiently clear that renal dysfunction occurs frequently in all phenotypes of HF, and when present, it is associated with higher mortality and morbidity. While the pathophysiology is multifactorial, the most important factors are a reduced renal perfusion and venous congestion. Recent interest has focused on worsening renal function (WRF), a situation strongly related to mortality, but seemingly only when HF status deteriorates. Unfortunately, to date clinicians are unable to identify specifically those patients with a grim prognosis following WRF. Although much has been learned on cardiorenal interaction in HF, still more questions have been left unanswered. The coming decade should provide us with more dedicated epidemiologic, mechanistic, and controlled trials in HF patients with reduced renal function. An updated classification of the cardiorenal syndrome that incorporates recent evidence and points towards areas of interest and uncertainties, and areas where progress is needed could facilitate this process. Ultimately, this should lead to preventive and treatment strategies that can preserve renal function and associated outcome in patients with HF.

### Challenges of cardio-kidney composite outcomes in large-scale clinical trials [^1118urSy]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic cardiovascular or metabolic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and heart failure, often have comorbid kidney disease. Long-term outcomes are worse in the setting of both cardiac and kidney disease compared with either disease in isolation. In addition, the clinical presentations of certain acute cardiovascular events (such as heart failure) and worsening kidney function overlap and may be challenging to distinguish. Recently, certain novel treatments have demonstrated beneficial effects on both cardiac and kidney outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have exhibited concordant risk reduction and clinically important benefits in chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes, diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple atherosclerotic vascular disease risk factors, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with and without diabetes. Primary trial results have revealed that sacubitril-valsartan therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and post hoc analyses suggest favorable kidney effects. A concordant pattern of kidney benefit with sacubitril-valsartan has also been observed in chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Given the complex interplay between cardiac and kidney disease and the possibility that treatments may show concordant cardio-kidney benefits, there has been recent interest in formally acknowledging, defining, and using composite cardio-kidney outcomes in future cardiovascular trials. This review describes potential challenges in use of such outcomes that should be considered and addressed before their incorporation into such trials.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The cardiorenal syndromes develop along an interlinked pathophysiological trajectory (Figure). In the type 2 syndrome, the presence of long‐term cardiac dysfunction and the associated chronic adaptations to reduced cardiac output and flow rate and raised venous pressure lead to chronic renal hypoperfusion. In response, there is a chronic compensatory activation of both the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system. Angiotensin promotes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood volume resulting from aldosterone‐triggered sodium and water retention. Excess aldosterone can stimulate maladaptive interstitial fibrosis and contribute to the development and progression of CVD and CKD. Differences in rebound after acute decompensation in patients with chronic HF are likely due to the status of the renal parenchyma and the overall function of remnant intact or hyperfiltering nephrons — there is a discrepancy between current GFR measurement or estimation and the effective GFR achievable (also called renal functional reserve), which is not routinely measured in patients. Chronic cardiorenal syndromes in individuals with HF with preserved ejection fraction involve the sequelae of systemic inflammation, elevated central venous pressure, and endothelial, diastolic, and right ventricular dysfunction.

Figure 1
Flow diagram showing interplay of cardiovascular and renal systems in chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.

RAAS indicates renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Reduction in renal blood flow, if sufficiently severe, will result in a decreasing GFR. Renal function decline leads to cardiac function decreases driven by progressive cardiac sodium and water overload, calcium and potassium abnormalities, and CKD‐related anemia. Development of chronicity can occur in the setting in which acute kidney injury, induced by acute HF, accelerates cardiovascular pathophysiology via inflammatory pathway activation. In a renal ultrasonography study in patients with chronic HF (n = 68), individuals with a renal Doppler pulsatile index above median had a worsening of CKD stage after 6 months as compared with those with lower pulsatile index. Pulsatile index — an indicator of downstream renal artery resistance and stiffness — was an independent predictor of change in eGFR. The results suggest that renal pulse pressure rises in chronic HF because of increased arterial stiffness, resulting in an increase in renal vascular resistance and a decrease in renal blood flow and GFR.

### Chronic kidney disease, heart failure and neprilysin inhibition [^117M3ohv]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and this often manifests clinically like heart failure. Conversely, patients with heart failure frequently have reduced kidney function. The links between the kidneys and cardiovascular system are being elucidated, with blood pressure being a key risk factor. Patients with heart failure have benefitted from many trials which have now established a strong evidence based on which to base management. However, patients with advanced kidney disease have often been excluded from these trials. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that the benefits of such treatments are modified by the presence or absence of kidney disease, but more direct evidence among patients with advanced kidney disease is required. Neprilysin inhibition is the most recent treatment to be shown to improve outcomes among patients with heart failure. The UK HARP-III trial assessed whether neprilysin inhibition improved kidney function in the short- to medium-term and its effects on cardiovascular biomarkers. Although no effect (compared to irbesartan control) was found on kidney function, allocation to neprilysin inhibition (sacubitril/valsartan) did reduce cardiac biomarkers more than irbesartan, suggesting that this treatment might improve cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Larger clinical outcomes trials are needed to test this hypothesis.

### Evaluation and management of kidney dysfunction in advanced heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113XkRBk]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Early identification of kidney dysfunction in patients with advanced heart failure is crucial for timely interventions. In addition to elevations in serum creatinine, kidney dysfunction encompasses inadequate maintenance of sodium and volume homeostasis, retention of uremic solutes, and disrupted endocrine functions. Hemodynamic derangements and maladaptive neurohormonal upregulations contribute to fluctuations in kidney indices and electrolytes that may recover with guideline-directed medical therapy. Quantifying the extent of underlying irreversible intrinsic kidney disease is crucial in predicting whether optimization of congestion and guideline-directed medical therapy can stabilize kidney function. This scientific statement focuses on clinical management of patients experiencing kidney dysfunction through the trajectory of advanced heart failure, with specific focus on (1) the conceptual framework for appropriate evaluation of kidney dysfunction within the context of clinical trajectories in advanced heart failure, including in the consideration of advanced heart failure therapies; (2) preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative approaches to evaluation and management of kidney disease for advanced surgical therapies (durable left ventricular assist device/heart transplantation) and kidney replacement therapies; and (3) the key concepts in palliative care and decision-making processes unique to individuals with concomitant advanced heart failure and kidney disease.

PATIENT CARE

The interlinked pathophysiology between the heart and the kidneys in the cardiorenal syndromes requires a holistic, comprehensive approach to management. There is a need for both primary and secondary prevention of adverse outcomes in patients with CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, and HF. CKD and chronic HF deteriorate progressively and need to be managed proactively. In addition, the risk of evolution of an acute condition to chronicity requires prompt identification of at‐risk patients and implementation of preventative measures. It is crucial that leading risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, and important comorbidities such as anemia, are managed. Patient–physician communication is an important part of care. Care planning includes management decisions around the often high symptom burden, which includes fatigue, chronic pain, and depression.

Optimal management first requires screening and early disease recognition. Patients with HF, as well as those with earlier forms of CKD who have proteinuria but preserved GFR, need to be identified in routine clinical care. However, the rate of screening of at‐risk populations by routine testing (eg, by annual UACR assessment) is low (35%–57%) in primary care, highlighting the need for increased awareness of the cardiorenal nexus in the primary care setting. The UACR is now positioned as an important trigger for lower systolic blood pressure targets of 120 mm Hg or below according to the 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline. Once identified, the complexity of the chronic cardiorenal syndromes requires a collaborative approach to management, involving a multidisciplinary team that includes a primary care physician, cardiologist, nephrologist, and endocrinologist. Guidance from a dietitian can aid patients with following a heart‐ and kidney‐healthy diet. Continuity of care between hospital and out‐of‐hospital follow‐up needs to be ensured. Transitions of care and adherence to medications are significant strategies in disease prevention and mitigation of progression of disease.

### Cardiovascular disease and subsequent kidney disease… [^1122r2iv]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Secondarily, kidney function decline was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction of at least 15 mL/min per 1.73 m², and development of kidney disease was defined by an eGFR reduction of at least 15 mL/min per

1.73 m² in which the baseline eGFR was at least 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² and the final eGFR was below these levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between CVD and outcomes. All sensitivity analyses were based on models defining kidney function decline by a serum creatinine level rise of at least 0. 4 mg/dL. To evaluate the effect of competing outcomes between kidney function decline and all-cause mortality, we used a Cox proportional hazards model to assess whether baseline CVD affected the composite outcome of a serum creatinine level increase of at least 0. 4 mg/dL and time to death after adjustment for the covariates already listed.

Our study demonstrates that CVD is associated with subsequent kidney function decline and development of kidney disease. This association persisted after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics and remained robust in multiple analyses using serum creatinine level and eGFR to assess kidney function. Although several studies9, 12, 16 have evaluated epidemiological risk factors for progression of kidney disease, to our knowledge, this is the first community-based study that has demonstrated that CVD is independently associated with kidney function decline and with development of kidney disease. There are several possible explanations for the increased risk of kidney function decline and development of kidney disease in individuals with CVD. First, the presence of baseline CVD may identify individuals with greater duration and severity of shared CVD and kidney disease risk factors, particularly DM and hypertension.

Second, atherosclerotic disease may also affect the renal vasculature, causing disease of small or large vessels and resulting in CKD. In summary, the present study demonstrates that CVD is independently associated with kidney function decline and with development of kidney disease. Further studies using other markers for kidney damage, such as proteinuria level, will be needed to confirm this association. This study identifies a population that may benefit from increased CVD risk factor surveillance and intervention, heightened awareness of the risk factors associated with kidney disease, and greater attention to and treatment for sequelae of kidney disease.

### Kidney function trajectories before and after hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^111eFEez]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with HFrEF, kidney function decline may precede a HF hospitalization or death by up to 1 year. These data suggest that incorporating eGFR slopes into clinical decision-making could help identify patients at higher risk for HF hospitalizations in the mid-term, potentially enabling early intervention.

### Cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic health: an actionable vision for heart failure prevention [^1148sLVX]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The substantial and growing prevalence of heart failure, which remains the leading cause of preventable hospitalisation worldwide, has brought heart failure prevention into sharp focus. Although this condition has historically been characterised by impaired cardiac function, mounting evidence has underscored its complex and multisystem pathobiology. Epidemiological studies have indicated that other forms of cardiovascular disease, along with kidney and metabolic dysfunction, frequently and increasingly contribute to heart failure onset. Clinical trials have additionally demonstrated the power of several new pharmacotherapies to simultaneously modify cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic (CKM) health. This convergence of epidemiology and therapy highlights deeply interconnected mechanisms of disease, identifying CKM diseases-and their pathophysiological and sociostructural antecedents-as important but often under-recognised targets for heart failure prevention. Herein, we illustrate that positioning heart failure prevention within the broader context of CKM health provides an actionable framework for patients, health-care professionals, health systems, communities, and policy makers.

### Prevalence of anemia and effects on mortality in patients with heart failure [^111pQ8zP]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with chronic kidney disease, the adverse cardiovascular effects of anemia have been well established. New data are emerging to suggest anemia may represent an important treatable cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. To improve the understanding of the problem of anemia in heart failure, it is important to assess the factors that influence the prevalence of anemia and to assess the consistency of the association of anemia and mortality in various populations of patients with heart failure.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted by performing detailed searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, searching the bibliographies of the articles retrieved during the database search, and conferring with heart-failure experts involved in clinical trials. Twenty-eight publications from 26 studies that evaluated anemia prevalence with or without effects on mortality in patients with heart failure were identified. The definition of anemia used in each study was tabulated along with pertinent patient characteristics, the prevalence of anemia, and the association between anemia and mortality.

Results

Anemia is common among patients with heart failure. The prevalence of anemia increases with increasing severity of heart failure, declining renal function, and increasing age. Anemia is consistently associated with poorer survival in all patient populations, but there are substantial differences in the patient populations and definition of anemia.

Conclusions

To clarify the prognostic relationship of anemia in patients with heart failure, a standard definition of anemia should be adopted accounting for the menopausal status of women. Age, severity of heart failure, evaluation of kidney function, important comorbidities, and use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors should be included, and correctable causes of anemia should be excluded. Inclusion of these factors should allow better definition of the relationship between anemia and prognosis in patients with heart failure.

### Cardiorenal syndrome: classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117JwpDc]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiorenal syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disorders involving both the heart and kidneys in which acute or chronic dysfunction in 1 organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. It represents the confluence of heart-kidney interactions across several interfaces. These include the hemodynamic cross-talk between the failing heart and the response of the kidneys and vice versa, as well as alterations in neurohormonal markers and inflammatory molecular signatures characteristic of its clinical phenotypes. The mission of this scientific statement is to describe the epidemiology and pathogenesis of cardiorenal syndrome in the context of the continuously evolving nature of its clinicopathological description over the past decade. It also describes diagnostic and therapeutic strategies applicable to cardiorenal syndrome, summarizes cardiac-kidney interactions in special populations such as patients with diabetes mellitus and kidney transplant recipients, and emphasizes the role of palliative care in patients with cardiorenal syndrome. Finally, it outlines the need for a cardiorenal education track that will guide future cardiorenal trials and integrate the clinical and research needs of this important field in the future.

### Heart failure and kidney dysfunction: epidemiology, mechanisms and management [^113bvYcw]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a major health-care problem and the prognosis of affected patients is poor. HF often coexists with a number of comorbidities of which declining renal function is of particular importance. A loss of glomerular filtration rate, as in acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), independently predicts mortality and accelerates the overall progression of cardiovascular disease and HF. Importantly, cardiac and renal diseases interact in a complex bidirectional and interdependent manner in both acute and chronic settings. From a pathophysiological perspective, cardiac and renal diseases share a number of common pathways, including inflammatory and direct, cellular immune-mediated mechanisms; stress-mediated and (neuro)hormonal responses; metabolic and nutritional changes including bone and mineral disorder, altered haemodynamic and acid-base or fluid status; and the development of anaemia. In an effort to better understand the important crosstalk between the two organs, classifications such as the cardio-renal syndromes were developed. This classification might lead to a more precise understanding of the complex interdependent pathophysiology of cardiac and renal diseases. In light of exceptionally high mortality associated with coexisting HF and kidney disease, this Review describes important crosstalk between the heart and kidney, with a focus on HF and kidney disease in the acute and chronic settings. Underlying molecular and cellular pathomechanisms in HF, AKI and CKD are discussed in addition to current and future therapeutic approaches.

### Can chronic kidney disease lead to chronic heart failure, and does worsening chronic heart failure lead to chronic kidney disease progression [^113QdZPQ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The objective of this review is to discuss if chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to chronic heart failure (CHF), and does worsening CHF lead to CKD progression and how a new medication class can modify the risk of both outcomes.

Recent Findings

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are similarly effective on cardiovascular (CV) - and kidney-related outcomes in the presence of CV and CKD.

Summary

SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the risk of CHF events and CKD progression, and may have synergistic effects in patients with cardiorenal syndrome.

### Renal-cardiac crosstalk in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure [^111SW4rQ]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a significant global health issue, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The prevalence of CKD is still rising, driven by an aging population and an increasing incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and other risk factors such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Global health surveys and studies by the World Health Organization show that CKD affects ≈10% to 15% of adults. The GBD study (Global Burden of Disease) reports that over 850 million people are currently living with some form of CKD, making it more prevalent than cancer and CVD combined.

The prevalence of CKD varies across different regions, reflecting variations in access to health care, genetics, and risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. For instance, high-income countries, such as the United States, report a CKD prevalence of around 14% to 16%. East Asia and South Asia have similarly high rates, partly driven by the rising incidence of diabetes in these regions. In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America report a lower prevalence but higher rates of progression to the end stage of kidney disease, primarily due to limited access to health care and treatment.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelinesclassify CKD into 5 stages by evaluating kidney function by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and detecting kidney damage by albuminuria: CKD can progress from a stage with normal kidney filtration function but the presence of kidney damage (CDK stage 1) to a stage with mildly, moderately, or severely reduced kidney function (CKD stages 1–3). In stage 5 (GFR < 15 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), patients need dialysis (CKD5D) or a kidney transplant for survival (Figure 1).

### Kidney function trajectories and right heart failure following LVAD implantation [^116peYcc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Right heart failure (RHF) following durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation remains a frequent and harmful complication, affecting an estimated 20% to 40% of recipients. Kidney dysfunction before LVAD implantation is associated with higher risk of subsequent RHF, and measures of baseline kidney function are used in several RHF prediction models. Additionally, impaired kidney function at baseline is associated with higher mortality risk after LVAD placement. Kidney function trajectories demonstrating worsening function or lack of improvement following LVAD implantation portend worse outcomes.

Right heart dysfunction and kidney dysfunction are pathophysiologically intertwined. Much remains unknown about these relationships in the setting of durable mechanical circulatory support, but extrapolation from other disease processes provides insight. Elevated right‐sided cardiac filling pressures can cause kidney dysfunction through direct hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic mechanisms. Transmission of high venous pressures to the kidney experimentally can cause rapid interstitial pressure increase resulting in decreased filtration. Over time, elevated venous pressures can cause irreversible kidney damage (termed congestive nephropathy) through neurohormonal activation, endothelial damage, inflammation, and oxidative damage.

Kidney dysfunction may contribute directly to development and worsening of right heart dysfunction as well. However, most research has focused on the effects of right heart dysfunction on kidney function, on the cross‐sectional relationship between right heart dysfunction and kidney dysfunction, or on the effects of kidney dysfunction on left ventricular function. The most apparent mechanism for kidney dysfunction to affect right heart function is through intravascular volume expansion resulting from sodium retention, increasing ventricular preload. Dysregulation of the neuro‐hormonal axis, with sympathetic nervous and renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system activation, may directly mediate the deleterious effects of kidney dysfunction on the right heart. Additionally, kidney dysfunction can contribute to pulmonary vascular dysfunction and remodeling, increasing right ventricular (RV) afterload and in the long run decreasing function. This pulmonary vascular dysfunction may occur through decreased nitric oxide signaling and increased endothelin‐1 levels due to kidney dysfunction.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^1129RvBd]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin reduced the key efficacy outcomes of time-to-first–HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death and first and recurrent HF hospitalizations, and slowed the rate of kidney function decline, in patients with and without CKD and across a broad kidney function spectrum. Moreover, in patients with and without CKD, empagliflozin reduced a kidney composite outcome that incorporated clinically meaningful and sustained deterioration in kidney function, chronic dialysis, and kidney transplant; treatment with the drug reduced the proportion of CKD patients with anemia. These efficacy benefits and the consistent safety profile with the overall trial population support the clinical use of empagliflozin in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction across the broad spectrum of kidney function, including those with severe kidney function impairment down to an eGFR of 20 ml/min/1.73 m² and irrespective of the degree of albuminuria.

### Kidney status and events preceding death in heart failure: a real-world nationwide study [^112vtUdD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Our subgroup analyses provide valuable insights into the factors associated with higher odds of experiencing adverse kidney events. The odds of adverse kidney events were significantly higher for patients who died at a younger age compared to those aged 80 years and above. This discrepancy may stem from clinicians being more inclined to initiate kidney replacement therapy in younger patients. However, the kidney burden appears to be greater for younger patients, whereas older patients may have other contributing factors for their death, such as sepsis and infections. Additionally, our analyses revealed that male sex was associated with higher odds of adverse kidney events preceding death in patients with HF. This finding aligns with previous studies suggesting that male sex may be a risk factor for kidney dysfunction in cardiovascular disease. Finally, the association between higher degrees of frailty and adverse kidney events preceding death in patients with HF underscores the importance of considering overall health status in HF management.

Clinical perspectives

The high frequency of adverse kidney events in patients with HF underscores the importance of monitoring and managing kidney function in this vulnerable population. To enhance patient care, future research should focus on exploring the underlying mechanisms linking HF and kidney dysfunction, identifying risk factors for kidney death, and developing targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of kidney complications on HF prognosis.

### Renal-cardiac crosstalk in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure [^114Fwkbo]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Increased Risk of HF in Patients With CKD

Around half of patients with HF also suffer from CKD. Conversely, patients with CKD present more often with HF compared with those without CKD and display new-onset HF in the range of 17% to 21%, with the age-adjusted incidence rate of new-onset HF being more than doubled in patients with CKD3 or higher compared with patients without CKD. Overall, ≈44% to 57% of patients with CKD on hemodialysis have HF. Beyond copresentation, CKD and HF mutually influence disease outcomes. Mortality risk was more than doubled in patients with HF with CKD compared with those without CKD, and severe kidney impairment was a predictor of mortality in HF. Conversely, HF also increases the risk of CKD development and progression.

Whereas, overall, patients with HFrEF have a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (≈two-thirds of cases), patients with HFpEF are mostly older and show a lower prevalence of cardiac ischemia (≈25%) but a higher coexistence of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, CKD, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Patients hospitalized with new-onset HF present more frequently with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction) than reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which was a bit more pronounced in patients with CKD (66% [58%] versus 25% [35%]) compared with those without CKD (57% [54%] versus 34% [38%]; values presented as crude or adjusted percentages, respectively, after adjustment for age, sex, race, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and MI)(Figure 3 B). HFpEF was found to be even more prevalent in hospitalized patients with new-onset HF with severe CKD compared with those with mild CKD (CKD5D: 70% versus CKD1–2: 54%). Similar findings of increased presentation of HFpEF over HFrEF in CKD were reported when analyzing incident HF in 3557 patients with mild to severe CKD from the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency) cohort, as well as upon analysis of a cohort of 214 patients with CKD on chronic hemodialysis from 5 hemodialysis units presenting with HF. In the latter study, most hemodialysis patients with HF presented with HFpEF (61% versus HFmEF: 12%; HFrEF: 9%; and other HF: 18%). The association of incident HF with mortality rates was higher in patients with CKD with HFrEF compared with HFpEF (HFrEF: hazard ratio, 2.73 [95% CI, 2.24–3.33] versus HFpEF: hazard ratio, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.65–2.40]; P = 0.0002) though without significant differences in HF association with progression to CKD5D.

### Cardiorenal syndrome: new developments in the understanding and pharmacologic management [^112a2nTH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiorenal syndromes (CRSs) with bidirectional heart-kidney signaling are increasingly being recognized for their association with increased morbidity and mortality. In acute CRS, recognition of the importance of worsening kidney function complicating management of acute decompensated heart failure has led to the examination of this specific outcome in the context of acute heart failure clinical trials. In particular, the role of fluid overload and venous congestion has focused interest in the most effective use of diuretic therapy to relieve symptoms of heart failure while at the same time preserving kidney function. Additionally, many novel vasoactive therapies have been studied in recent years with the hopes of augmenting cardiac function, improving symptoms and patient outcomes, while maintaining or improving kidney function. Similarly, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic CRS have led to reanalysis of kidney outcomes in pivotal trials in chronic congestive heart failure, and newer trials are including changes in kidney function as well as kidney injury biomarkers as prospectively monitored and adjudicated outcomes. This paper provides an overview of some new developments in the pharmacologic management of acute and chronic CRS, examines several reports that illustrate a key management principle for each subtype, and discusses opportunities for future research.

### The association between congestive heart failure and chronic renal disease [^116bvNYa]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent findings on the relationship between congestive heart failure and renal failure are summarized in this review.

Recent Findings

Congestive heart failure is found in about one-quarter of cases of chronic kidney disease. The most common cause of congestive heart failure is ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases greatly as the patient's renal function deteriorates, and, at end-stage renal disease, can reach 65–70%. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this. The opposite is also true: treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure. There is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol in patients on dialysis, and of simvastatin and eplerenone in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs doubles the rate of hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia has been found in one-third to half the cases of congestive heart failure, and may be caused not only by chronic kidney disease but by the congestive heart failure itself. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition. Control of the anemia and aggressive use of the recommended medication for congestive heart failure may improve the cardiac function, patient function and exercise capacity, stabilize the renal function, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anemia therefore appear to act together in a vicious circle in which each condition causes or exacerbates the other. Both congestive heart failure and anemia are often undertreated. Cooperation between nephrologists and other physicians in the treatment of patients with anemic congestive heart failure may improve the quality of care and the subsequent prognosis for both congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Adequate and early detection and aggressive treatment of congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease and the associated anemia may markedly slow the progression of both diseases.

### Ferric carboxymaltose in iron-deficient patients with hospitalized heart failure and reduced kidney function [^111JE8pr]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reduced kidney function is common among patients with heart failure, with some reported prevalence rates of > 60%. Kidney impairment is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalization for heart failure rates and reduced patient survival. – Both conditions predispose patients to iron deficiency, with many patients affected by all three conditions simultaneously, frequently termed cardiorenal iron deficiency syndrome. – In stable, chronic heart failure, the prevalence of iron deficiency approaches 30%–50% and even higher in the setting of acute heart failure (70%–80%).

Iron deficiency independently predicts poor outcomes in heart failure and kidney disease. In the setting of heart failure, iron deficiency is associated with reduced exercise capacity, lower quality of life, higher rates of hospitalization for heart failure, and shortened survival.– Iron repletion with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose has been shown to improve symptoms and functional health in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency. –

AFFIRM-AHF (A Randomised, Double-blind Placebo Controlled Trial Comparing the Effect of Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose on Hospitalisations and Mortality in Iron Deficient Subjects Admitted for Acute Heart Failure) was the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of ferric carboxymaltose in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure with concomitant iron deficiency. Patients randomized to ferric carboxymaltose initiated at hospital discharge had lower rates of the primary end point of hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death (rate ratio [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 1.01; P = 0.06) and experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01).

It is unclear whether the benefits of ferric carboxymaltose extend to patients with heart failure and impaired kidney function and whether the magnitude of any such benefits is consistent across different levels of kidney function. This subgroup analysis aims to further characterize the effect of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with acute heart failure with iron deficiency and coexisting kidney impairment.

### The cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure [^111BjB1M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The frequently occurring condition of renal failure in heart failure (HF) has been termed the cardiorenal syndrome. However, the importance of renal insufficiency in HF has only been embraced in the last decade, and therefore, the pathophysiology of cardiorenal failure is still poorly understood. The main driving force of renal failure in HF is probably hemodynamic derangement, with both reduced renal perfusion and increased venous pressure as the most important driving forces. Different cardiorenal connectors may modulate this relationship. Furthermore, renal failure is not only limited to reduced filtration but also includes glomerular hypertension and tubulointerstitial hypoxia, leading to loss of glomerular integrity and tubular damage. Recognition of these key pathophysiologic pathways in the concept of the cardiorenal syndrome is needed to value the interrelationship and incremental contribution of different risk markers and possible new treatments to improve renal function and outcome in this complex and bidirectional interplay between the heart and the kidney.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^112nuh5L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

With the beneficial potential of new medications comes a renewed focus on the cardiorenal nexus. The underlying pathophysiology of the cardiorenal nexus remains to be further elucidated. Capturing the underlying pathophysiology will enable physicians to choose the appropriate treatment earlier. Broader recognition of the cardiorenal nexus will emphasize the need to evaluate and manage CKD in patients who are primarily being treated for CVD issues and vice versa. Paying attention to underlying cardiorenal syndromes will enable primary care physicians and endocrinologists to take a comprehensive approach to the care of their patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Development of a combined heatmap system that visually presents cardiorenal syndrome risk in the electronic medical record based on CVD and CKD severity, and how this risk is affected by type 2 diabetes, would aid earlier identification and treatment of high‐risk patients. Further research into the mechanisms of action of potentially disease‐modifying medications, and the role that these medications may have when used in combination, will improve treatment algorithms. Further research on health economics and outcomes will drive improvements in long‐term continuity of care.

### Renal-cardiac crosstalk in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure [^112AWxSM]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a global health issue with a high socioeconomic impact. Beyond a progressive decline of kidney function, patients with CKD are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death. HF in CKD can manifest both as HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction, with the latter further increasing in relative importance in the more advanced stages of CKD. Typical cardiac remodeling characteristics in uremic cardiomyopathy include left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac electrical dysregulation, capillary rarefaction, and microvascular dysfunction, which are triggered by increased cardiac preload, cardiac afterload, and preload and afterload-independent factors. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiac remodeling in CKD are multifactorial and include neurohormonal activation (with increased activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system, and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling), cardiac steroid activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, innate immune activation, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, disturbances in cardiac metabolism and calcium homeostasis, macrovascular and microvascular dysfunction, increased cellular profibrotic responses, the accumulation of uremic retention solutes, and mineral and bone disorders also contribute to cardiovascular disease and HF in CKD. Here, we review the current knowledge of HF in CKD, including the clinical characteristics and pathophysiological mechanisms revealed in animal studies. We also elaborate on the detrimental impact of comorbidities of CKD on HF using hypertension as an example and discuss the clinical characteristics of hypertensive heart disease and the genetic predisposition. Overall, this review aims to increase the understanding of HF in CKD to support future research and clinical translational approaches for improved diagnosis and therapy of this vulnerable patient population.

### Initiation of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin to prevent kidney and heart failure outcomes guided by HbA1c, albuminuria, and predicted risk of kidney failure [^115kTGRg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are developed and approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control. Following regulatory requirements to establish cardiovascular (CV) safety of new anti-diabetic treatments, the CV safety of SGLT2 inhibitors was assessed in large clinical trials. These trials demonstrated that these agents markedly reduce the risk of kidney and heart failure outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. Subsequent trials also demonstrated the efficacy and safety of these agents to prevent kidney and heart failure outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or heart failure without type 2 diabetes. Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic CV disease, CKD, or heart failure as second-line treatment on top of metformin. Despite the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without type 2 diabetes, the initiation of these agents in clinical practice is slow and treatment is centered around isolated risk marker improvement such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or albuminuria.

Analyses from CV and kidney outcome trials have demonstrated that the relative benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent across many patient subgroups including those with or without type 2 diabetes, severity of kidney disease or the presence of heart failure. The absolute benefits however, are greater as baseline risk increases, such as in those with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or high albuminuria. This suggests that a treatment approach guided by the individual risk of each participant, as determined by the presence of kidney or CV risk markers, would be more efficient for preventing clinical outcomes compared to a treatment strategy based on HbA1c or albuminuria alone.

In this study, we first assessed if a treatment strategy to initiate the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin using the multivariable predicted risk of kidney outcome based on clinical risk markers is more efficient for preventing clinical outcomes compared to a strategy based on HbA1c or albuminuria alone. Secondly, we assessed whether the addition of novel biomarkers to predict kidney outcome further improve the efficiency of guiding SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. Because of shared pathophysiology between diabetic kidney disease and heart failure, we hypothesized that the kidney risk model would also stratify patients at risk for a clinically relevant heart failure event and therefore also report the effects of canagliflozin on heart failure outcome by baseline kidney risk.

### DAPA-CKD: the beginning of a new era in renal protection [^114cKBNE]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

The DAPA-CKD trial proves that the kidney benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are independent of glucose-lowering, and emphasizes the urgency to adopt these therapies in patients with appropriate indications. These observations in a dedicated CKD cohort complement the results of the DAPA-HF (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Worsening Heart Failure or Cardiovascular Death in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure) and EMPEROR-reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction) trials, which also included people with and without diabetes, demonstrating efficacy and safety in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. These dedicated heart failure trials further highlight that ambient hyperglycemia is not necessary to derive benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors. In light of these observations, what is known about the mechanisms responsible for SGLT2 inhibitors and kidney protection beyond the glucose independence (Figure 1)? Whereas previous experimental and human mechanistic studies have provided a great deal of insight into the benefits in the setting of diabetes, less is known about those without diabetes. To date, we know that effects on GFR are similar regardless of diabetes status, suggesting that natriuresis-related intraglomerular effects leading to a decline in glomerular hypertension do not depend on ambient hyperglycemia. Similarly, effects on hemoconcentration, which may contribute to HHF benefits, are also seen in nondiabetic cohorts. Interestingly, in nondiabetic, non-CKD patients, empagliflozin did not improve renal oxygenation — a pathway linked with protection in people with DKD. Further elucidation of factors responsible for renal benefit is warranted to understand whether these therapies might be beneficial in patients with other conditions, for example, kidney transplant recipients and in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Bioimpedance indices of fluid overload and cardiorenal outcomes in heart failure and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review [^116bMo25]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Heart failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly coexist but are often considered separately in research and clinical practice. The burden of heart failure increases with advancing CKD; the estimated prevalence of clinical heart failure is around 40% in patients requiring dialysis. – Structural heart disease based on echocardiography is, perhaps, twice as common, with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) the more frequent phenotype in CKD than heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This interrelationship may be explained, in part, by shared risk factors but also by bidirectional etiological mechanisms. Heart failure increases the risk of CKD due to impaired perfusion of the kidneys and neurohormonal activation, and there are a number of pathophysiological changes associated with advancing CKD that contribute to heart failure. These include chronic hypertension and fluid overload as well as the possibility of direct uremia-related cardiotoxicity. Fluid overload is a common manifestation in both disease states and has clinical and prognostic implications. Treatment of both diseases has progressed with the advent of sodium-glucose cotrans-porter-2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; both drug classes have diuretic mechanisms, and large trials have demonstrated benefits for cardiovascular risk and CKD progression. –

Fluid overload is traditionally assessed nonquantitatively by clinical examination. Bedside medical devices to standardize and more precisely quantify fluid status in both heart failure and CKD have been developed using ultrasound and bioimpedance technology. Both methods can be employed with relatively little training and allow rapid clinic-based measurements. Ultrasound modalities include lung ultrasonography – and, less commonly, vascular ultrasound of the inferior vena cava and internal jugular veins. Bioimpedance methods include both bioimpedance analysis (BIA) (single-, multifrequency and bioimpedance vector analysis [BIVA]) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), both of which have been demonstrated to be highly reproducible and have been validated against gold-standard techniquesmore extensively than ultrasound approaches. Bioimpedance is a noninvasive measure of resistance and reactance of body tissues quantified by application of an electrical current via electrodes attached to the skin from which fluid compartment volumes and body composition can be estimated. Fig. 1 summarizes the 4 main bioimpedance approaches, including their analysis methods, commonly reported parameters and key advantages/disadvantages.

### Ultrafiltration for decompensated heart failure: renal implications [^113nKszV]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

The negative prognostic impact of worsening renal function in patients with decompensated heart failure has been widely recognised. As diuretics are thought to contribute to deterioration of kidney function in this setting, attempts have been made to either spare or suppress the diuretic-related pathophysiological mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. In this regard, extracorporeal ultrafiltration represents a novel therapy for patients with heart failure, lacking the adverse impacts of diuretics on kidney function (eg, activation of tubuloglomerular feedback). Consequently, besides its other positive clinical outcomes, there has been much hope for ultrafiltration therapy to play a protective role against negative effects of diuretics in patients with decompensated heart failure. However, the potential biological advantage has not been confirmed by clinical studies; currently available data from recent clinical trials have so far failed to demonstrate such expected positive results possibly due to counterbalance of the potential negative effects and other not well-known mechanisms. This paper briefly reviews the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms as well as existing evidence in this area and emphasises on the need for further studies specifically designed to explore the impact of ultrafiltration on kidney function in patients with decompensated heart failure.

### Decline in glomerular filtration rate as an endpoint in heart failure clinical trials: challenges and solutions [^112yjei2]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease are tightly interconnected, with common mechanisms that underlie the development and progression of both diseases, recently articulated into the framework of the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. CKD and heart failure commonly coexist in the same individual, with increasing evidence for common therapies in both disease states. It is valuable for patients, clinicians, and regulatory agencies to understand how to best assess CKD progression in patients with heart failure for evaluation of individual patients and as part of an endpoint for outcome trials. Given the relatively short duration of most heart failure outcome trials, early measures of CKD progression prior to the occurrence of clinical events of kidney replacement therapy would be desirable. Such surrogate measures include slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline either computed as annualized mean change in GFR (GFR slope) or time to substantial declines in GFR by specified threshold percentages (40% or 50% GFR decline). Regulatory agencies accept these endpoints for full drug approval which has enabled progress in design and conduct of trials for CKD progression. Application of these endpoints in heart failure outcome trials has the potential for similar progress. However, an immediate reduction in GFR is common following initiation of several of the guideline directed therapy for heart failure. Understanding how to best interpret an immediate GFR reduction vs long term kidney benefit is critical to optimal assessment of endpoint in an outcome trial and in the use of these medications for management of patients with heart failure. Here, the intersection of heart failure and CKD is described, how GFR and its change over time are assessed in both individual patients and in interventional trials, the evidence supporting use of GFR changes as endpoints in CKD progression trials, and the challenges and possible solutions for the use of GFR as endpoint in heart failure outcome trials and for care of individual patients, guided by case studies to inform the discussion.

### Renal-cardiac crosstalk in the pathogenesis and progression of heart failure [^116QFDdb]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Because albuminuria and GFR are key in classifying CKD, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines also assess its severity using the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The combination of GFR and albuminuria based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines is used to determine the severity of CKD and guide clinical decision-making (Figure 1). Patients with lower GFR and higher albuminuria levels face a greater risk of progressing to the end stage of kidney disease but also show increased cardiovascular complications and increased mortality.

Of note, both reduced GFR and increased albuminuria increase the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death independent of traditional risk factors – (Figure 2). While CVD is responsible for mortality in 21.7% to 26.0% of the general population, this is increased to 33.3% to 37.1% in patients with CKD stage 3 and to 39.9% in patients with CKD stage 4. Patients on hemodialysis revealed CVD mortality rates that were 10× to 20× higher compared with the general population or even up to ≈400 times higher for patients aged 25 to 34 years. Overall, CVD presents in 63.4%, 66.6%, and 75.3% of patients with CKD whose kidney dysfunction is, respectively, mild (CKD stages 1 and 2), moderate (CKD stage 3), and severe or even complete (CKD stages 4 and 5D) compared with 37.5% in individuals with healthy kidney function(Figure 3 A).

### TWEAK-Fn14 as a common pathway in the heart and the kidneys in cardiorenal syndrome [^117MiJpJ]. The Journal of Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a complex relationship between cardiac and renal disease, often referred to as the cardiorenal syndrome. Heart failure adversely affects kidney function, and both acute and chronic kidney disease are associated with structural and functional changes to the myocardium. The pathological mechanisms and contributing interactions that surround this relationship remain poorly understood, limiting the opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), are abundantly expressed in injured kidneys and heart. The TWEAK-Fn14 axis promotes responses that drive tissue injury such as inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis, while restraining the expression of tissue protective factors such as the anti-aging factor Klotho and the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). High levels of TWEAK induce cardiac remodeling, and promote inflammation, tubular and podocyte injury and death, fibroblast proliferation, and, ultimately, renal fibrosis. Accordingly, targeting the TWEAK-Fn14 axis is protective in experimental kidney and heart disease. TWEAK has also emerged as a biomarker of kidney damage and cardiovascular outcomes and has been successfully targeted in clinical trials. In this review, we update our current knowledge of the roles of the TWEAK-Fn14 axis in cardiovascular and kidney disease and its potential contribution to the cardiorenal syndrome. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^111H5fgr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The cardiorenal nexus encompasses a bidirectional relationship between the heart and the kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of one can lead to acute or chronic dysfunction of the other. The term "cardiorenal syndrome" has become established to capture the nexus of heart and kidney dysfunction.,

The cardiorenal syndrome can be subdivided into 5 types to allow characterization by initiating organ and acuity or chronicity. Types 1 and 3 describe the acute onset setting, and types 2 and 4 describe the chronic setting. Type 5 cardiorenal syndrome is characterized by the simultaneous injury or dysfunction of the heart and kidney due to acute or chronic systemic disorders such as sepsis or amyloidosis. Although this subdivision helps facilitate diagnosis and therapy, the syndrome types can co‐occur, and an acute condition can progress to chronicity if not identified and managed early.

There are a renewed focus and optimism around the cardiorenal nexus and its management, brought about by the beneficial potential of recent treatment advances. However, broader understanding and recognition of the cardiorenal nexus and its underlying chronic syndromes are needed to support early recognition and a holistic, comprehensive management approach. We present a narrative review that focuses on chronic cardiorenal syndromes type 2 and type 4, providing an overview of their epidemiology, outcomes, pathophysiology, and the most recent advances in patient care. This narrative review was developed with the help of nonsystematic, targeted literature searches in PubMed, and its reporting is aligned with the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles principles.

### Assessing and managing frailty in advanced heart failure: an International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement [^111v61ad]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Intersection of comorbidities, frailty, and advanced heart failure — Comorbidities likely impact the development and trajectory of frailty in advanced heart failure (HF), with accumulation of deficits across organ systems causing dysregulated homeostasis and loss of physiological reserve. Many comorbid conditions (chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus) are proinflammatory and linked to muscle composition changes, sarcopenia, and insulin resistance. The adverse effects of advanced HF, aging, and comorbidities on physical functioning and other clinical outcomes are cumulative and potentially synergistic, and the relative contributions of comorbidities versus HF to frailty mechanisms are not well-understood and are beyond the scope of this paper.

### Nonthyroidal illness and the cardiorenal syndrome [^112znhqq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

The cardiorenal syndrome represents a final common pathway for renal and congestive heart failure and heralds a poor prognosis. Factors that link the failing heart and the failing kidneys — the so-called cardiorenal connectors — are, therefore, of clinical and therapeutic interest. Alterations in the levels and function of thyroid hormones that fit the spectrum of nonthyroidal illnesses could be considered to be cardiorenal connectors as both renal failure and heart failure progress with the development of nonthyroidal illness. In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests that nonthyroidal illness can induce deterioration in the function of the heart and the kidneys via multiple pathways. As a consequence, these reciprocal associations could result in a vicious cycle of deterioration that likely contributes to increased mortality. In this Review, we describe the evidence for a pathophysiological role of nonthyroidal illness in the cardiorenal syndrome. We also discuss the available data from studies that have investigated the efficacy of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with renal failure and the rationale for interventional trials to examine the effects of normalization of the thyroid hormone profile in patients with renal failure and congestive heart failure.

### Evaluation of kidney function throughout the heart failure trajectory – A position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^1116zxqm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Appropriate interpretation of changes in markers of kidney function is essential during the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. Historically, kidney function was primarily assessed by serum creatinine and the calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate. An increase in serum creatinine, also termed worsening renal function, commonly occurs in patients with heart failure, especially during acute heart failure episodes. Even though worsening renal function is associated with worse outcome on a population level, the interpretation of such changes within the appropriate clinical context helps to correctly assess risk and determine further treatment strategies. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly recognized that assessment of kidney function is more than just glomerular filtration rate alone. As such, a better evaluation of sodium and water handling by the renal tubules allows to determine the efficiency of loop diuretics (loop diuretic response and efficiency). Also, though neurohumoral blockers may induce modest deteriorations in glomerular filtration rate, their use is associated with improved long-term outcome. Therefore, a better understanding of the role of cardio-renal interactions in heart failure in symptom development, disease progression and prognosis is essential. Indeed, perhaps even misinterpretation of kidney function is a leading cause of not attaining decongestion in acute heart failure and insufficient dosing of guideline-directed medical therapy in general. This position paper of the Heart Failure Association Working Group on Cardio-Renal Dysfunction aims at improving insights into the interpretation of renal function assessment in the different heart failure states, with the goal of improving heart failure care.

### Acute decompensated heart failure and the cardiorenal syndrome [^111YPgxS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure is one of the leading causes of hospitalizations in the United States. Concomitant and significant renal dysfunction is common in patients with heart failure. Increasingly, the syndrome of heart failure is one of cardiorenal failure, in which concomitant cardiac and renal dysfunctions exist, with each accelerating the progression of the other. One fourth of patients hospitalized for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure will experience significant worsening of renal function, which is associated with worse outcomes. It remains unclear whether worsening renal function specifically contributes to poor outcomes or whether it is merely a marker of advanced cardiac and renal dysfunction. Diuretic resistance, with or without worsening renal function, is also common in acute decompensated heart failure, although the definition of diuretic resistance, its prevalence, and prognostic implications are less well defined. The term cardiorenal syndrome has been variably associated with cardiorenal failure, worsening renal function, and diuretic resistance but is more comprehensively defined as a state of advanced cardiorenal dysregulation manifest by one or all of these specific features. The pathophysiology of the cardiorenal syndrome is poorly understood and likely involves interrelated hemodynamic and neurohormonal mechanisms. When conventional therapy for acute decompensated heart failure fails, mechanical fluid removal via ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, or hemodialysis may be needed for refractory volume overload. While ultrafiltration can address diuretic resistance, whether ultrafiltration prevents worsening renal function or improves outcomes in patients with cardiorenal syndrome remains unclear. Evidence regarding the potential renal-preserving effects of nesiritide is mixed, and further studies on the efficacy and safety of different doses of nesiritide in heart failure therapy are warranted. Newer therapeutic agents, including vasopressin antagonists and adenosine antagonists, hold promise for the future, and clinical trials of these agents are underway.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease: from pathophysiology to treatment [^111DrWqz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent subtype of heart failure. It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, a less understood pathophysiology, and multifactorial etiologies. A frequent comorbidity of HFpEF is chronic kidney disease (CKD). The cardiorenal phenotype in HFpEF is growing in prevalence and represents a high-risk clinical population. HFpEF and CKD are interconnected through complex, bidirectional processes involving systemic inflammation, neurohormonal activation, hemodynamic changes, and iron deficiency. These overlapping processes, along with common risk factors, exacerbate disease presentation and progression, contributing to significantly worse outcomes, including higher rates of hospitalization, mortality, and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Historically, treatment options for HFpEF have been limited, but recent studies have identified agents with both cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, non-steroidal MRAs, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, offer a new hope for improving outcomes in the HFpEF cardiorenal population. However, challenges related to diagnosis, volume and potassium management, and barriers such as underdiagnosis and undertreatment still remain. An integrative, multidisciplinary approach is essential for effectively managing patients with both HFpEF and CKD.

### Kidney function trajectories before and after hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1179P3Yw]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal congestion is a key factor affecting kidney function among patients with HF. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have shown that increased central and renal venous pressures, along with maladaptive sodium and fluid overload, reduce renal blood flow, elevate renal interstitial pressures, and lead to declines in glomerular filtration rate as well as overall kidney function. Additionally, reduced renal blood flow may restrict the delivery of diuretics to the kidney, while declining glomerular filtration limits the tubular transport of sodium, resulting in diuretic resistance. Furthermore, worsening congestion may impair oral diuretic absorption due to gastrointestinal oedema or gut hypoperfusion, requiring diuretic dosage intensification and subsequently accelerating kidney function decline. In this study, the association between a steeper eGFR decline and NYHA class-based functional deterioration supports the hypothesis that worsening kidney function may reflect subclinical congestion. These data highlight that eGFR slope may serve as a more sensitive early warning signal than clinical status, which is often subjectively reported and less granular in routine practice. Furthermore, to explore the potential pathophysiological link between kidney function decline and HF hospitalization, we adjusted our models for NYHA class as a proxy for congestion. This led to a partial attenuation of the association between eGFR slope and HF events, particularly during the year prior to HF events, whereas the slope remained stable in patients without HF events. These findings suggest that clinical deterioration possibly due to congestion may partly mediate the relationship between kidney function decline and subsequent HF events. However, the persistent slope after adjustment for NYHA class suggests additional underlying mechanisms beyond NYHA class.

3 CONCLUSION

Diseases of the heart and kidney share similar risk factors and disease drivers, which amplify the iterative and integrated clinical cycle of HF unmasking or exacerbating the presence or progression of CKD, and vice versa. For maximally effective treatment of individuals with co‐existing HF and CKD, healthcare professionals should develop a treatment plan that targets the shared risk factors and drivers of these diseases, based on background discussions regarding lifestyle modifications.

### A hierarchical kidney outcome using win statistics in patients with heart failure from the DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials [^112QRGiW]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

In patients with heart failure, kidney function is a powerful independent predictor of future heart failure hospitalization and death, irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) –. The natural history of heart failure is characterized by progressive worsening of the syndrome over time and this usually includes worsening of kidney function. Kidney function also influences whether life-saving pharmacological treatments, including renin–angiotensin system blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), can be initiated and continued in patients with heart failure and it determines eligibility for transplantation and mechanical circulatory support –. It is therefore important to understand the effect that new therapies for heart failure have on kidney function; an aspiration with any treatment for heart failure is to at least preserve and, ideally, improve kidney function.

Unfortunately, few trials in patients with heart failure have been large enough and long enough to accrue a sufficient number of 'hard' kidney endpoints to allow a statistically robust evaluation of these outcomes using conventional statistical approaches, for example, time-to-first-occurrence of death, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or a large decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) –. The rate of decline over time (slope) in eGFR has been used as an alternative means of evaluating the effect of treatment on kidney function; however –, while statistically more powerful, this measure does not incorporate death or initiation of renal replacement therapy and the clinical relevance of small changes in eGFR slope have been questioned.

The use of hierarchical composite endpoints analyzed with win statistics may solve some of these problems by integrating death, relatively infrequent major kidney events (for example, ESKD), the occurrence of large changes in eGFR that are somewhat more frequent, and changes in the eGFR slope, with each of these components ordered in a hierarchy reflecting their clinical importance –. The hierarchical composite outcome created by this approach consists of components, all of which reflect the progression of kidney disease, and this endpoint is both clinically relevant and statistically powerful.

In this post hoc study, we evaluated the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney function in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, and heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, using a hierarchical composite kidney outcome, analyzed using win statistics.

### The role of the kidney in heart failure [^115XvJvA]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction is common in patients with heart failure and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cardiac and renal dysfunction may worsen each other through multiple mechanisms such as fluid overload and increased venous pressure, hypo-perfusion, neurohormonal and inflammatory activation, and concomitant treatment. The interaction between cardiac and renal dysfunction may be critical for disease progression and prognosis. Renal dysfunction is conventionally defined by a reduced glomerular filtration rate, calculated from serum creatinine levels. This definition has limitations as serum creatinine is dependent on age, gender, muscle mass, volume status, and renal haemodynamics. Changes in serum creatinine related to treatment with diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are not necessarily associated with worse outcomes. New biomarkers might be of additional value to detect an early deterioration in renal function and to improve the prognostic assessment, but they need further validation. Thus, the evaluation of renal function in patients with heart failure is important as it may reflect their haemodynamic status and provide a better prognostic assessment. The prevention of renal dysfunction with new therapies might also improve outcomes although strong evidence is still lacking.

### Mechanisms of the cardiorenal syndromes [^1133VMyS]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

The kidney and heart have essential roles in maintaining blood volume homeostasis and in the regulation of systemic blood pressure. Acute or chronic dysfunction in either the heart or kidneys can induce dysfunction in the other organ, resulting in the so-called cardiorenal syndromes, which are classified into five different types. Abrupt worsening of cardiac function predisposes an individual to acute kidney injury from renal hypoperfusion or renal congestion. Progressive, sometimes permanent, chronic kidney impairment can result from chronic renal hypoperfusion or congestion. Heart failure is common in patients with acute kidney injury. Chronic kidney disease predisposes individuals to atherosclerotic, arteriosclerotic and cardiomyopathic disease. Finally, both cardiac and renal disease can also occur secondary to systemic conditions, such as diabetes or autoimmune disease. This Review examines the mechanisms presiding over the first four types of cardiorenal syndromes. These mechanisms provide a template that accounts for the heart-kidney interactions that occur in patients whose concomitant cardiac and renal conditions result from a third cause.

### Altered hemodynamics and end-organ damage in heart failure: impact on the lung and kidney [^116MAqzV]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is characterized by pathologic hemodynamic derangements, including elevated cardiac filling pressures ("backward" failure), which may or may not coexist with reduced cardiac output ("forward" failure). Even when normal during unstressed conditions such as rest, hemodynamics classically become abnormal during stressors such as exercise in patients with heart failure. This has important upstream and downstream effects on multiple organ systems, particularly with respect to the lungs and kidneys. Hemodynamic abnormalities in heart failure are affected by processes that extend well beyond the cardiac myocyte, including important roles for pericardial constraint, ventricular interaction, and altered venous capacity. Hemodynamic perturbations have widespread effects across multiple heart failure phenotypes, ranging from reduced to preserved ejection fraction, acute to chronic disease, and cardiogenic shock to preserved perfusion states. In the lung, hemodynamic derangements lead to the development of abnormalities in ventilatory control and efficiency, pulmonary congestion, capillary stress failure, and eventually pulmonary vascular disease. In the kidney, hemodynamic perturbations lead to sodium and water retention and worsening renal function. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which altered hemodynamics in heart failure affect the lungs and kidneys is needed in order to design novel strategies to improve clinical outcomes.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients [^112W5u4D]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Topic 5: Chronic kidney disease after heart transplantation — definition, incidence, contributors, and CNI effects are summarized as follows: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function that are present for > 3 months. Using a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) threshold of 30 mL/min/1.73 m², the incidence of CKD has been reported to be 1.9%, 10.9%, and 21%, at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively in adult non-renal transplant recipients. Pretransplant renal impairment related to heart failure, acute kidney injury from hypotension, vasoconstrictor use and cardiopulmonary bypass, hypertension, diabetes, and nephrotoxic medications contribute to the development of CKD. The acute toxicities of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy (e.g., vasoconstriction, toxic tubulopathy, and in some cases thrombotic microangiopathy) can lead to worsening renal function, and in the longer term CNI can induce irreversible changes and progressive renal disease; hence, CNI is a major, but not the sole, cause of post-transplant CKD.

### Aldosterone and aldosterone modulation in cardio-kidney diseases [^117QDHmJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and excess aldosterone exert detrimental effects on the heart and the kidneys via contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction in the myocardium, vasculature, and the kidneys. These effects are purported to be through genomic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated, nongenomic MR-dependent, and nongenomic non-MR dependent actions. Steroidal and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) counteract the effects of aldosterone in heart failure (HF) and in chronic kidney disease (CKD), blocking, at least partially, both genomic and nongenomic MR-mediated effects. Because both hyperkalemia and excess aldosterone are associated with progression of CKD and HF, and MRA therapy is associated with elevations in aldosterone levels, patients on MRA therapy may remain at a high residual risk for poor outcomes even on MRA therapy. Although observational studies and trials suggest compensatory neurohormonal activation in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, its potential association with worse outcomes and clinical significance is complex and context-dependent. Further studies are needed to better clarify the clinical implications of these biological effects in patients with cardio-kidney diseases. Partial agonists of the MR and directly attenuating aldosterone production using selective aldosterone synthase inhibitors is an emerging approach for patients with HF, CKD, and uncontrolled and resistant arterial hypertension that requires prospective trials. This review sought to describe the role of aldosterone in HF and CKD and the role of steroidal and nonsteroidal MRA, partial agonists of the MR, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors in cardio-kidney diseases.

### Cardio-renal syndromes: report from the consensus conference of the acute dialysis quality initiative [^113pTimK]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Results

The Steering Committee assembled an expert panel, which was divided into five smaller working groups: (i) definition and classification, (ii) epidemiology, (iii) diagnostic biomarkers, (iv) prevention, and (v) treatment.

Definition and classification

Need for consensus definition

We unanimously agreed that a consensus definition was needed to highlight the coexistence of cardiac and renal disorders and to identify the time course of heart–kidney interaction and the primacy of the organ leading to the syndrome. The goal of this definition would be to facilitate epidemiological studies, identify target populations for intervention, develop diagnostic tools, prevent and manage different syndromes.

Principles of definition and classification

We chose a broad term, using the plural (cardio-renal syndromes, CRS), to indicate the presence of multiple syndromes. We chose subtypes to recognize primary organ dysfunction (cardiac vs. renal) and acute vs. chronic time frame. We considered structural and/or functional abnormalities of both organs necessary. We added an additional subtype to capture systemic conditions affecting both organs simultaneously. We chose definitions to include accepted criteria published by national and international societies.

Consensus definition and classification of cardio-renal syndromes

We considered definitions from the literature and used a specific publicationas template. We defined the broad term 'cardio-renal syndromes' as 'disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other'. We identified five subtypes of the syndromes (Table 1). Their pathophysiological mechanisms are described in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Pathophysiology and definitions of the five subtypes of cardio-renal syndrome (modified by Ronco et al.).

Table 1
Cardio-renal syndromes: classification, definitions, and work group statements

We chose the term CRS to indicate the bidirectional nature of the various syndromes and to recognize that this term was already established in the medical lexicon, despite lack of formal definition.

Acute cardio-renal syndrome (type 1)

Acute worsening of heart function leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction. This is a syndrome of worsening renal function (WRF) complicating acute heart failure (AHF) and/or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Between 27 and 40% of patients hospitalized for acute de-compensated heart failure (ADHF) appear to develop acute kidney injury (AKI), and fall into this clinical entity. These patients experience higher mortality and morbidity, and increased length of hospitalization.

### The interplay between heart failure and chronic kidney disease [^1173BUsQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue defined by the 2024 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines as abnormalities of kidney structure or function that are present for at least 3 months with implications for health, classified based on the two dimensions of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) category (G1–G5) and albuminuria (urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio [UACR]) category (A1–A3).CKD can often co‐exist with heart failure (HF), a heterogeneous clinical syndrome defined on the basis of signs and symptoms of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities that result in reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at either periods of rest or stress.HF can be classified based on ejection fraction (EF): HF with preserved EF (HFpEF; ≥ 50%), HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; < 40%) and HF with mid‐range/mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF; 40%–49%).

HF and CKD are two independent yet related, long‐term conditions with a bidirectional relationship: an individual with HF as the primary disease can experience secondary CKD, and vice versa, as these diseases share common risk factors and systemic disorders. Given the interconnected relationship, the distinction of which organ disease is primary and which is secondary can be challenging for healthcare professionals. Currently, there is no global consensus on the definitions or criteria for diagnosis of HF in individuals with CKD. Therefore, a greater understanding of the interplay between heart and kidney diseases is key for the development of maximally effective treatment plans, including detection, prevention, diagnosis and management of these co‐existing diseases. The heart and kidney have complementary physiological roles, explaining why diseases of one of these organs often affect the other.

Cardiovascular homeostasis relies on the interplay between the heart and kidneys in regulating the sympathetic nervous system. Due to these interconnecting roles, it is of no surprise that one disease has major effects on the development and/or progression of the other disease. For example, an individual with HF may experience a reduced GFR (a key kidney disease marker) due to an impaired cardiac output, high venous pressure and activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and sympathetic nervous system. In turn, a reduced GFR caused by HF can worsen fluid retention, increasing vascular congestion and thereby encourage the continuous detrimental relationship between HF and kidney impairment.

### EGFR trajectory in LVAD recipients with right heart failure: status quo or a steady decline? [^1135WG6D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Two outcomes particularly dreaded after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation are development of right heart failure (RHF) and worsening kidney function. Yet for better or worse, right heart function and kidney function are innately intertwined (Figure). Increased venous return, left ventricular (LV) unloading, changes in systemic afterload, intraoperative factors, the effects of chronic heart failure (HF) on right ventricular function, and conformational changes in how ventricles twist as a result of LVAD being sewn into LV can all contribute to the development of postoperative RHF. Chronic kidney disease itself may contribute to the development of RHF via reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), tubular dysfunction, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system activation, and possibly other mechanisms such as uremic toxin build‐up and higher FGF‐23 levels. RHF may adversely affect kidney function predominantly through elevated systemic venous pressure, which leads to a cascade of downstream effects all culminating in reduced GFR and reduced diuretic efficiency, with cardiac underfilling likely playing a more minor role.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to SGLT-2 inhibitors, CCS 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for HF, and the composite endpoint of significant decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or death due to kidney disease in adult patients with HF and LVEF ≤ 40%.

### Kidney function trajectories before and after hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^113v1VLR]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. These included (i) excluding eGFR values within 2 weeks before and after the HF event to minimize the influence of acute, reversible fluctuations; (ii) defining exposure strictly as non-fatal HF hospitalization; and (iii) restricting the HF hospitalization analysis to patients who survived the entire follow-up, thereby mitigating the impact of competing risks and enhancing the reliability of post-event slope estimates. While confounding is not controlled at the time of the HF event, we observed consistent patterns across all models, suggesting that the associations are not artefacts of modelling strategy or driven by transient changes in kidney function during acute events. Nonetheless, several limitations of the data set must be acknowledged. Follow-up duration before and after the event varied across individuals, and post-event slopes may be affected by selective survival, particularly in patients with early death. Additionally, our modelling approach does not incorporate time-updated covariates, which may limit the ability to fully disentangle the intrinsic relationship between kidney function trajectories and outcomes. Future studies leveraging more complex longitudinal models including multivariable, time-updated frameworks could more precisely capture these dynamic interactions. Still, the consistency of results across all sensitivity analyses reinforces the plausibility and potential clinical relevance of the observed associations.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^111AbGLR]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and first and recurrent hospitalizations for HF, slowed the progressive decline in kidney function, and reduced the risk of serious kidney events in patients with and without diabetes. Importantly, in EMPEROR-Reduced, patients were eligible for enrollment with an eGFR as low as 20 ml/min/1.73 m² and more than half of the patients had prevalent CKD at baseline. Thus, the trial afforded the opportunity of investigating the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin on cardiac and kidney outcomes according to CKD and across a wide range of kidney function; these findings were a prespecified analysis of EMPEROR-Reduced.

### Renal kinetics in acute heart failure [^1117i2iB]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worsening renal function (WRF) is a common comorbidity in acute heart failure (AHF), since 10%–40% of these patients develop WRF during hospitalisation. While most recent studies have indicated that venous congestion or an increase in the central venous pressure is the main pathophysiology of WRF, other conditions, such as concurrent infection, neurohormonal activation or heart failure medical treatments, could also cause significant changes in renal function. By using implantable haemodynamic monitors, studies have suggested that venous congestion often occurs many days prior to the patient experiencing heart failure-related events. This fact supports a recent finding where a considerable number of patients with WRF were first diagnosed at admission for heart failure. This early presentation has a distinctive pathophysiological pathway and prognostic impact on heart failure.

In addition, in contrast to 'true WRF', in which intrinsic renal injury does occur, most of the cases of WRF in AHF are considered 'pseudo-WRF', relating to a transient functional decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. Pseudo-WRF is believed to have a considerably faster recovery rate and better prognostic impact compared with 'true-WRF'.

The characteristics of WRF regarding the severity or the time point of renal dysfunction development, and renal kinetics of WRF concerning the rate of kidney function recovery will, therefore, provide insight into the differential diagnosis of the pathophysiological mechanisms of cardiorenal interaction. It should be acknowledged that most studies evaluating cardiorenal syndrome have been focusing on the incidence and risk factors of WRF in AHF, and the evidence base for renal reversal is still lacking. Thus, we performed a prospective study to determine the features of renal dysfunction and renal kinetics of WRF in AHF.

2.4 SGLT2is

SGLT2is have been widely tested and proven efficacious for the treatment of HF across the EF spectrum, and CKD across a range of disease severities, and have shown clinically meaningful reductions in adverse heart and kidney outcomes. A meta‐analysis of 13 phase 3 randomized SGLT2i trials (N = 90 413 participants) showed that in four CKD trials, SGLT2is reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 40% compared with placebo, with no heterogeneity observed across trials. In addition, SGLT2is reduced the risk of kidney failure, with a relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of 0.67 (0.59–0.77), with similar effects observed in people with and without T2D. Across all 13 studies, SGLT2is reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (RR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.70–0.84]) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF by 23% (RR 0.77 [95% CI: 0.74–0.81]). SGLT2is also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 14% (RR 0.86 [95% CI: 0.81–0.92]).

Additionally, a meta‐analysis of 10 trials involving 71 553 individuals in a high‐risk cardiac disease study group, with or without diabetes, found that cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF was lower in the SGLT2i group (n = 3165/39 053 [8.10%]) compared with the placebo group (n = 3756/32 500 [11.56%]).

While SGLT2is can lower HbA1c in individuals with a high GFR, their impact on glycaemic control diminishes in those with a GFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Interestingly, the benefit of an SGLT2i is independent of glycaemic control and is mediated predominantly through haemodynamic and metabolic factors.

In people without prevalent heart disease (n = 14 462), the presence of CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) was an independent risk factor for incident HF and incident coronary heart disease (adjusted risk difference per 1000 person‐years, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–3.3; and 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–3.4, respectively), relative to participants without CKD (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), in an analysis of 3 population‐based studies (Jackson Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis). Mean time to first HF event was 8.2 years and to first coronary heart disease event 7.5 years. In a UK primary care database study of patients with prevalent type 2 diabetes and newly diagnosed CKD (n = 30 222), relative to patients with no CKD progression, those with fast deterioration (eGFR slope decline > 3 mL/min/1.73 m²) were at significantly increased risk of HF and myocardial infarction (aHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.27–1.76; and aHR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01–1.91, respectively; median follow‐up: 4.3 years).

### Chronic kidney disease detection, staging and treatment in cardiovascular disease prevention [^116fj5ia]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, nearly 10% of the population has chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined as a glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio greater than 30mg/g (3mg/mmol). Persons with CKD have a substantially high risk of cardiovascular disease. Indeed, most persons with CKD are far more likely to develop a cardiovascular event than to progress to end-stage kidney disease. Although early detection and staging of CKD could help prevent its cardiovascular consequences, current rates of testing for CKD are very low, even among high-risk populations such as persons with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we first describe the need to test for both estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria among persons at high risk of CKD in order to properly stage CKD and enhance cardiovascular risk stratification. We then discuss how detection and staging for CKD could help prioritise patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure who could derive the largest benefit from cardiovascular preventive interventions. In addition, we discuss the central role of CKD detection and staging in the initiation of cardiorenal preventive therapies, such as the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, which have shown overwhelming evidence of cardiorenal protection. We conclude by discussing strategies to overcome historical barriers to CKD detection and treatment.

### Efficacy of dapagliflozin on renal function and outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: results of DAPA-HF [^116cDQXr]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Impaired renal function is common in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and up to 50% have chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL·min –1 ·1.73 m –2.CKD is associated with conditions that lead to the development of heart failure, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, and common comorbidities in heart failure such as diabetes and anemia, as well. Once heart failure develops, renal function declines and this is associated with a poorer prognosis. In part, this may be because the use of many of the therapies known to improve morbidity and mortality in HFrEF is restricted by kidney function and may even be impossible in patients with very low eGFR. Yet, paradoxically, it is patients with CKD who potentially derive the greatest absolute benefit from treatment with pharmacotherapy because of their higher event rates.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have recently been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. – In addition, they slow the rate of decline in kidney function in these patients and reduce renal morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney dysfunction. In the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure), the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure (HF) in patients who had HFrEF with and without type 2 diabetes. In this study, we explored whether the effect of dapagliflozin varied according to baseline renal function. We also examined the effect of dapagliflozin on kidney function and renal outcomes.

### Cardiac and kidney benefits of empagliflozin in heart failure across the spectrum of kidney function: insights from EMPEROR-reduced [^115xgKFA]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In EMPEROR-Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction), empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization and total HF hospitalizations, and slowed the progressive decline in kidney function in patients with HF and a reduced ejection fraction, with and without diabetes. We aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis, patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or albumin-to-creatine ratio > 300 mg/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were: (1) a composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (2) total HF hospitalizations; and (3) eGFR slope. The direct impact on kidney events was investigated by a prespecified composite kidney outcome (defined as a sustained profound decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis, or transplant). The median follow-up was 16 months.

Results

Of 3730 patients who were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, 1978 (53%) had CKD. Empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome and total HF hospitalizations in patients with and without CKD: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.93) and HR = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58–0.90), respectively (interaction P = 0.63). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.11 (0.23–1.98) ml/min/1.73 m²/yr in patients with CKD and by 2.41 (1.49–3.32) ml/min/1.73 m²/yr in patients without CKD. The risk of the composite kidney outcome was reduced similarly in patients with and without CKD: HR = 0.53 (95% CI, 0.31–0.91) and HR = 0.46 (95% CI, 0.22–0.99), respectively. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and key secondary outcomes was consistent across a broad range of baseline kidney function, measured by clinically relevant eGFR subgroups or by albuminuria, including patients with eGFR as low as 20 ml/min/1.73 m². Empagliflozin was well tolerated in CKD patients.

Conclusions

In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on the key efficacy outcomes and slowed the rate of kidney function decline in patients with and without CKD, and regardless of the severity of kidney impairment at baseline.

### Application of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Failure Society of America heart failure staging guidelines in adults with chronic kidney disease [^114vzGun]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior work has suggested that clinically relevant thresholds of cardiac biomarkers should be several‐fold higher in CKD than in the general population. Renal vein and artery samples measuring NT‐proBNP have shown that BNP (B‐type natriuretic peptide) is partially cleared by the kidneys, and there were alterations in BNP and NT‐proBNP ratios with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, but full interpretation was limited due to the small number of individuals with reduced eGFR. The effect of renal clearance on serum troponin levels is not known, but troponin levels are elevated in up to 80% of asymptomatic individuals with CKD and end‐stage kidney disease. Despite the poorly understood mechanisms, we know asymptomatic people with CKD have higher circulating concentrations of these markers, leading to the possibility that the kidneys rather than the cardiac pathology may lead to higher HF staging using the 2022 guidelines. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the 2013 and 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF staging systems can be accurately applied to a CKD population to diagnose HF as well as to predict future clinical outcomes.

We evaluated a large cohort of adults with CKD participating in the CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study, applying both the 2013 and updated 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF stages. Our aims were to compare the prevalence of HF stages using the most recent 2022 guidelines versus the 2013 guidelines, evaluate the HF hospitalization and all‐cause death rates in a CKD population based on HF stage using both guidelines and CKD stage, and identify risk factors for HF stage progression in adults with CKD over time.

### The interplay between heart failure and chronic kidney disease [^111Tg44c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF) are two globally prevalent, independent, long-term conditions, which often coexist in an individual and display a bidirectional yet interconnected relationship. The presence of CKD often leads to the development of HF and vice versa, which propagates the worsening of each disease, reflecting an intertwined disease cycle. Both HF and CKD share common risk factors, such as increasing age, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and smoking. Data show that approximately half of all people with HF also have CKD, which impacts patient burden and quality of life due to a significantly greater risk of hospitalization and death, compared with those that have either CKD or HF. To maximize treatment effectiveness in individuals with both HF and CKD, healthcare professionals should recognize that these two diseases are systemic conditions, representing organ-specific manifestations of similar underlying processes. It is also essential to understand the role of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in managing these conditions. Lifestyle modifications should also be recommended. This review discusses factors contributing to the interplay between HF and CKD and the key role of healthcare professionals in providing appropriate treatment for the co-existing diseases.

### Cardiovascular and non-renal complications of chronic kidney disease: managing risk [^1177x74G]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) currently affects approximately 850million people globally and is continuing to increase in prevalence as well as in importance as a cause of death. The excess mortality related to CKD is mostly caused by an increase in cardiovascular disease. This includes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as many promoters of atherosclerosis, such as blood pressure, lipid levels and hypercoagulation, are increased in people with CKD. Diabetes is a leading cause of CKD contributing to the risk of CVD, and obesity is also increasingly prevalent. Management of these risk factors is therefore very important in CKD, and to reduce risk of CKD progression. Heart failure is also more prevalent in CKD and, again, many risk factors are shared. The concept of foundational pillars in the management of heart failure has been adapted to the treatment of CKD, with many organ-protective interventions, such renin-angiotensin system blockade, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism, reducing the risk for mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but also for progression of CKD. Atrial fibrillation is also more common with CKD and affects the management of the former. In this review these non-renal complications of CKD are discussed, along with how the risk of these complications should be managed. Many new opportunities have demonstrated heart and kidney organ protection, but implementation is a challenge.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^114G71U3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In the type 4 syndrome, CKD‐related anemia, electrolyte imbalances, increases in uremic toxins, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress lead to cardiac and vascular dysfunction. With progressively declining kidney function, phosphate retention increases, and phosphate homeostasis is disrupted despite elevated levels of FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23) and parathyroid hormone. The increase in FGF23 levels and hyperphosphatemia trigger pathways that promote hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular calcification, contributing to CVD progression. Progression of CKD is often due to underlying diabetes and/or hypertension. Chronic renal dysfunction is linked with disruption of erythropoietin signaling and red blood cell turnover, leading to anemia, which is an important comorbidity of CKD and HF. Cachexia is common in individuals with chronic cardiorenal syndromes and may augment the pathophysiological interaction between the heart and kidneys via immune, neuroendocrine, and proinflammatory pathways.

Right HF and hemodynamic dysfunction from pulmonary hypertension may also lead to the development of chronic cardiorenal syndromes as well as contribute to the progression of CKD. In patients with end‐stage CKD on hemodialysis, the arteriovenous fistula required for access can cause excessive pulmonary blood flow, leading to preload increase on the right heart and pulmonary hypertension.

Type 2 diabetes is a common underlying causal factor in HF and CKD. In addition to its link with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic vascular disease, type 2 diabetes is also associated with glomerular hyperfiltration and volume expansion, and tubuloglomerular feedback disruptions. The vascular theory of type 2 diabetes describes dysregulation of vasoactive factors and inactivation of tubuloglomerular feedback in type 2 diabetes, which lead to dilation of the renal afferent arteriole and constriction of the efferent arterioles, thereby resulting in glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^115MwQm5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Learning from other disease definitions — staging and categorical thresholds are used across conditions: an epidemiology-based stages system defines disease from at risk to subclinical to clinical, and finally, recovery, disability, or death. Atrial fibrillation categorizes patients as paroxysmal (≤ 48 hours), persistent (> 7 days or cardioversion), long standing (> 1 year), and permanent; clinicians also use the CHA2DS2-VASc risk score to determine potential stroke risk and guide management. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is classified based on albuminuria and the estimated glomerular filtration rate.

### Cardiorenal syndrome in acute decompensated heart failure [^111BDnx2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction is highly prevalent in patients with heart failure. Furthermore, worsening renal function in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the so-called cardiorenal syndrome, impacts short and long-term morbidity and mortality. In recent years, more evidence has surfaced from clinical trials and heart failure registries that a complex cross-talk between the kidney and heart in patients with ADHF exists. Meanwhile, management of patients presenting with ADHF and concomitant renal dysfunction continues to be challenging. Therefore, understanding the interaction of the heart and kidneys is pivotal in tailoring therapy of these patients. We have extensively reviewed the pathophysiology of ADHF, the role of neurohoromones as well as other biomarkers and predictors of mortality in these patients based on the current evidence. Moreover, we have discussed the current and future pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies for treatment of this deadly disease. The strength of the evidence is limited, however, due to a paucity of randomized controlled trials in this patient population. What is evident from current national statistics; however, are the poor results in treating the congestion of ADHF. In this regard, the role of secondary hyperaldosteronism is discussed in the diuretic section as well as diuretic resistance in ADHF. In conclusion, since renal function is the single most important prognostic factor in the outcome of patients with ADHF, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the cardiorenal syndrome is needed to target therapy and ultimately improve the mortality of patients with ADHF.

### Kidney dysfunction in heart failure: core curriculum 2025 [^112XtZqt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with kidney dysfunction is represented by several maladaptive bidirectional pathways wherein acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ drives acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. Suboptimal decongestion, diuretic resistance, and low use rates of guideline-directed medical therapy in individuals with kidney dysfunction and HF contribute to poor cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Recent developments with the early identification and treatment of diuretic resistance may help mitigate the harmful effects of persistent congestion in individuals with HF. Several classes of guideline-directed medical therapies in HF have been shown to reduce death, hospitalizations for HF, and kidney function decline and improve quality of life. A combination of efficient and personalized strategies to achieve decongestion while optimizing the implementation of evidence-based therapies that modify the trajectory of HF are essential in tandem to reduce adverse outcomes and premature death in this high-risk patient population.

### Kidney and heart failure outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitor use [^1125TUUC]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure affect many people worldwide. Despite the availability of pharmacological treatments, both diseases remain associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. After observations that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors - originally developed as glucose-lowering agents - improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, dedicated trials were initiated to evaluate the cardiovascular and kidney protective effects in patients with CKD or heart failure. The results of these clinical trials and subsequent detailed analyses have shown that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are consistent across many patient subgroups, including those with and without type 2 diabetes, at different stages of CKD, and in patients with heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. In addition, post-hoc analyses revealed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of anaemia and hyperkalaemia in patients with CKD. With respect to their safety, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well tolerated. More specifically, no increased risk of hypoglycaemia has been observed in patients with CKD or heart failure without diabetes and they do not increase the risk of acute kidney injury. SGLT2 inhibitors therefore provide clinicians with an exciting new treatment option for patients with CKD and heart failure.

### Cardiorenal syndrome: a cardiologist's perspective of pathophysiology [^117Se4Xb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The cardiorenal syndrome has recently been defined as "disorders of the heart and kidney whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other". The syndrome is extremely common and independently associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, no pharmacological therapy has been shown to improve its outcomes. Unfortunately, the mechanisms that initiate the development of renal dysfunction in heart failure are still debated. This review tries to clarify some of the misunderstanding regarding the principle hemodynamic factors that drive the kidneys to retain salt and water.

### Impact of baseline kidney function on the effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney and heart failure outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115wzXTV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine whether the magnitude of the cardiorenal benefits of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) varies with baseline kidney function.

Methods

We searched randomized, placebo-controlled trials testing the effects of SGLT2is on renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Efficacy outcomes, stratified by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories, included renal disease progression, a composite heart failure (HF) outcome and mortality.

Results

Thirteen trials testing SGLT2is in 90402 participants with available eGFR data were included. The risk of bias was judged as low for all trials. SGLT2is reduced the relative risks of renal disease progression by 27% to 57% and of HF outcomes by 13% to 32% across different eGFR categories, with an overall low heterogeneity. Meta-regression analyses showed a significant direct relationship between baseline eGFR and the magnitude of SGLT2is' renal protection (P = 0.003). The greatest risk reduction was in participants with an eGFR of 90 ml/min/1.73 m² or higher (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.32–0.58) and the smallest was in those with an eGFR of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62–0.86, P < .001). Conversely, for HF, the greatest risk reduction was in those with an eGFR of less than 30ml/min/1.73 m² (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.96) and the smallest was in those with an eGFR of 90ml/min/1.73 m² or higher (HR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.56–1.34).

Conclusions

SGLT2is reduce the risk of renal and HF outcomes for all eGFR categories. The greatest benefits in terms of kidney protection may be achieved by early initiation of SGLT2is in people with preserved eGFR. The greatest risk reduction for HF outcomes is observed in people with lower eGFR values.

### Therapeutic strategies for heart failure in cardiorenal syndromes [^1126vG1Q]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiorenal syndromes are disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or long-term dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or long-term dysfunction of the other. The management of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors may influence, in a beneficial or harmful way, kidney function and progression of kidney injury. In this review, we assess therapeutic strategies and discuss treatment options for the management of patients with heart failure with decreased kidney function and highlight the need for future high-quality studies in patients with coexisting heart and kidney disease.

### Kidney outcomes after heart failure hospitalization-JAMA networkjamanetwork.com › JAMA cardiology… [^115F65Ap]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the incidence of clinically relevant kidney outcomes among older adults after heart failure hospitalization. Findings In this cohort study including 85 298 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for HF, by 1 year after HF hospitalization, 6% of individuals progressed to dialysis; 63% were discharged with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m², and risk of adverse kidney outcomes increased steeply with lower discharge estimated glomerular filtration rate. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, older adults with HF had substantial risk of kidney complications, with an estimated 6% progressing to dialysis in the year after HF hospitalization. These findings emphasize the need for health care approaches prioritizing kidney health in this high-risk population. In addition, 34% had died of any cause, 65% were readmitted for any cause, and 30% were readmitted for HF.

The 1-year cumulative incidence of kidney outcomes increased significantly with worse eGFR category. Incidences of other clinical outcomes by discharge eGFR category are displayed in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. Baseline LVEF did not modify the covariate-adjusted association between lower discharge eGFR and kidney outcomes. However, decrements in eGFR were associated with a modestly higher rate of all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, and HF readmission when LVEF was 40% or less compared with 41% to 49% and 50% or more. In this nationwide GWTG-HF analysis, kidney disease was highly prevalent among older adults hospitalized for HF in the US, with 63% of Medicare beneficiaries discharged with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m².

Risk of adverse kidney outcomes increased steeply with lower discharge eGFR, with 6% of Medicare beneficiaries progressing to dialysis and 7% progressing to dialysis or ESKD within 1 year after HF hospitalization, without significant differences by LVEF category. The 1-year risk of AKI was also noteworthy at 11% of individuals in the lowest eGFR category. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of prioritizing kidney health as part of comprehensive approaches to HF care.

### When cardiac failure, kidney dysfunction, and kidney injury intersect in acute conditions: the case of cardiorenal syndrome [^116hwqzW]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and describe diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers of renal function and renal injury in the cardiorenal syndrome complicating acutely decompensated heart failure.

Data Sources

PubMed search and review of relevant medical literature.

Study Selection

Two reviewers screened and selected studies in English with diagnostic or prognostic assessment of biomarkers of renal injury.

Data Extraction

Narrative review of the medical literature.

Data Synthesis

Cardiorenal syndrome has a complex pathophysiology and has a generally poor prognosis in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. Among the methods to recognize risk for cardiorenal syndrome may be the use of circulating or urinary biomarkers, which may allow for more accurate early diagnosis and risk stratification; use of biomarkers may provide important pathophysiologic understanding beyond risk prediction. However, different phenotypes of patients with acute renal dysfunction may be present, which has ramifications with respect to response to treatment strategies. Addition of biomarkers of renal injury may provide additional prognostic value to biomarkers of renal or cardiac function, but more data are needed.

Conclusions

Biomarkers reflecting renal function and injury are likely to better phenotype subgroups of patients with cardiorenal syndrome and to provide unique prognostic information. Future studies are needed relative to strategies using such biomarkers to guide care of affected patients.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^1176wVZZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The cardiorenal nexus encompasses a bidirectional relationship between the heart and the kidneys. Chronic abnormalities in cardiac function can lead to progressive kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease can lead to progressively decreasing cardiac function and increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. About 15% of US adults have chronic kidney disease, 2% have heart failure, and 9% have cardiovascular disease. Prevalence rates of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and associated morbidities such as type 2 diabetes are expected to increase with an aging population. Observational studies provide evidence for the cardiorenal nexus. Follow-up data from placebo arms of clinical trials in chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease show higher rates of renal and cardiovascular outcome events in patient subgroups with type 2 diabetes than in those without type 2 diabetes. The cardiorenal syndromes develop along an interlinked pathophysiological trajectory that requires a holistic, collaborative approach involving a multidisciplinary team. There is now a compendium of treatment options. Greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the cardiorenal nexus will support optimization of the management of these interlinked disease states.

### Prevalence and prognostic impact of kidney disease on heart failure patients [^115J22pD]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure is a serious condition with high mortality despite all modern treatment. Many factors contribute to the poor outcome in heart failure. Kidney dysfunction occurs in acute and chronic heart failure, and is associated with reduced survival. Over the years, our knowledge of the interaction between the heart and the kidney has increased, and parts of the pathophysiological background for the cardiorenal syndrome have been established. The heart and kidney function are closely linked together by haemodynamics, neurohormones and the sympathetic nervous system.

The cardiorenal syndrome is complex as heart failure and kidney disease share common risk factors and potentiate each other and other cardiovascular diseases. Most of the previous studies examining the prognostic value of kidney function in heart failure patients have been hampered mainly by inclusion of highly selected randomised controlled trial patients or small sample sizes, and have not been able to examine the whole spectrum of kidney dysfunction. In earlier large studies, the diagnoses of kidney disease have mainly been based on diagnostic codes, or defined only by a certain level of creatinine. Most previous studies have examined short-term prognosis, whereas long-term follow-up has been uncommon. Moreover, descriptions of the prognostic value of kidney dysfunction in important subgroups have been lacking.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of different degrees of kidney dysfunction and to examine their association with short-term and long-term outcome in a large unselected contemporary heart failure population and some of its subgroups. We also wanted to examine to what extent different cardiac conditions and their severity contribute to the prognostic value of kidney dysfunction in heart failure patients.

### Cardiorenal syndrome [^116Xkd7K]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The term cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) increasingly has been used without a consistent or well-accepted definition. To include the vast array of interrelated derangements, and to stress the bidirectional nature of heart-kidney interactions, we present a new classification of the CRS with 5 subtypes that reflect the pathophysiology, the time-frame, and the nature of concomitant cardiac and renal dysfunction. CRS can be generally defined as a pathophysiologic disorder of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of 1 organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other. Type 1 CRS reflects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function (e.g., acute cardiogenic shock or decompensated congestive heart failure) leading to acute kidney injury. Type 2 CRS comprises chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g., chronic congestive heart failure) causing progressive chronic kidney disease. Type 3 CRS consists of an abrupt worsening of renal function (e.g., acute kidney ischemia or glomerulonephritis) causing acute cardiac dysfunction (e.g., heart failure, arrhythmia, ischemia). Type 4 CRS describes a state of chronic kidney disease (e.g., chronic glomerular disease) contributing to decreased cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy, and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Type 5 CRS reflects a systemic condition (e.g., sepsis) causing both cardiac and renal dysfunction. Biomarkers can contribute to an early diagnosis of CRS and to a timely therapeutic intervention. The use of this classification can help physicians characterize groups of patients, provides the rationale for specific management strategies, and allows the design of future clinical trials with more accurate selection and stratification of the population under investigation.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115r2dVh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — definition, risk, assessment, and therapy thresholds are summarized. CKD is defined as reduced kidney function for at least 3 months duration, with markers including albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) or other markers of kidney damage. CKD and HFpEF often coexist, and CKD is a risk factor for incident HFpEF, with a prevalence of ~50% in individuals with HF, and CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and up to a 3-fold increase in mortality in HFpEF. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides are usually higher in individuals with CKD as compared with those without, making usual cutoffs less specific for the diagnosis of HF. Assessment notes serum creatinine may be falsely reduced due to loss of muscle mass or volume expansion/hemodilution, resulting in a falsely increased eGFR, and other useful markers include the presence of albuminuria, evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increasing creatinine with diuresis as a result of hemoconcentration to identify the true degree of CKD. Collaboration and comanagement by nephrology and cardiology should be considered, and agents that reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2is, and the nonsteroidal, selective MRAs, finerenone; trials have included individuals with eGFRs as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m² for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, 25 mL/min/1.73 m² for finerenone, and 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for SGLT2is. In HFpEF, the PARAGON-HF trial demonstrated less decline in renal function with the ARNI compared with the ARB, and EMPEROR-Preserved also noted less decline in renal function with the SGLT2i empagliflozin vs placebo. Based on these findings, the use of an SGLT2i (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²) is beneficial in slowing the decline of kidney function in individuals with HFpEF and CKD above and beyond other therapies, and when using RAAS blockers and/or SGLT2is, monitoring kidney function and serum potassium is useful 1 to 2 weeks after initiation.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112KF8BY]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and has a prevalence that is expected to rise with the growing ageing population. HFpEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Specific HFpEF risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and atrial fibrillation. Haemodynamic contributions to HFpEF include changes in left ventricular structure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, left atrial myopathy, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, and vascular dysfunction. Inflammation, fibrosis, impaired nitric oxide signalling, sarcomere dysfunction, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects contribute to the cellular and molecular changes observed in HFpEF. HFpEF impacts multiple organ systems beyond the heart, including the skeletal muscle, peripheral vasculature, lungs, kidneys and brain. The diagnosis of HFpEF can be made in individuals with signs and symptoms of heart failure with abnormality in natriuretic peptide levels or evidence of cardiopulmonary congestion, facilitated by the use of HFpEF risk scores and additional imaging and testing with the exclusion of HFpEF mimics. Management includes initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and management of comorbidities. Given the significant impact of HFpEF on quality of life, future research efforts should include a particular focus on how patients can live better with this disease.

### Drugs that slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease: are renoprotective effects attenuated in heart failure? [^111rfppN]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the occurrence of end-stage kidney disease in large-scale trials of patients with heart failure, and contrasting mechanisms of progressive of kidney disease in Type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure. ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme; SGLT2, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2.

What might explain differences in the results with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with Type 2 diabetes vs. those with heart failure? One possibility is that cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations are 15–20 times more common than renal events in patients with heart failure, and the occurrence of a major heart failure event might represent a competing risk for the occurrence of a major renal event. At least theoretically, the prevention of heart failure events might increase the likelihood that physicians would identify the occurrence of a marked worsening of kidney function as a renal event (rather than a heart failure event), thus making patients in the active treatment arm more vulnerable to the apparent occurrence of attributable renal events and potentially biasing the estimates for any effect of treatment on renal events toward the null. However, it should be noted that, in large-scale trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, a heightened ratio of heart failure events to end-stage kidney disease is also observed and worsening heart failure events are prevented by active treatment, and yet, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, mineralo-corticoid receptor antagonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors exert a striking renoprotective effect in diabetic patients.

### Cardiorenal syndrome revisited [^115LEcWN]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiorenal syndromes have been categorized into 5 clinical subtypes based on which organ is perceived to be the primary precipitant of the vicious and interrelated cycle of declining function in both organs. This clinical classification has broadened interest in cardiorenal interactions, but it is merely descriptive, does not rely on or inform predominant pathophysiology, and has produced little change in either practice or the research agenda. In contrast, recent scientific work identifies common pathophysiological pathways for several categories of cardiorenal syndromes, suggesting a unifying pathogenesis. Fibrosis is a common consequence of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related endothelial dysfunction in aging, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, ischemia, and organ injury. It is a common feature in heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, we suggest that fibrosis may be not only a marker but also the primary driver of pathophysiology in several cardiorenal syndromes. Interstitial fibrosis in the heart, large arteries, and kidneys may play a key role in the pathophysiology of the cardiorenal syndrome continuum. Focusing on fibrosis as a disease mediator might enable the identification of fibrosis-related biotargets that could potentially be modulated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or other novel antifibrotic agents in development. This conceptual approach may be an effective new strategy for the prevention and treatment of fibrosis within the cardiorenal syndrome continuum.

### Effect of renal function on prognosis in chronic heart failure [^117BtHTy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with increased mortality in heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to identify whether worsened or improved renal function during mid-term follow-up is associated with worsened outcomes in patients with chronic HF. A total of 892 participants from a multicenter cohort study of chronic HF were followed over 3.1 ± 1.9 years of enrollment. Worsened and improved renal functions were tested with multivariate models as independent predictors of HF hospitalization and mortality. Although 12% of subjects experienced a ≥ 25% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 17% experienced a ≥ 25% increase in eGFR, and there was stability of kidney function observed in the cohort as a whole. The quartile with the worst RD at any point in time had increased risk of HF hospitalization and mortality. Worsened eGFR was associated with HF outcomes in the unadjusted (hazard ratio = 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 2.81, p = 0.035), but not the adjusted analysis. Improvement in eGFR was not associated with outcome (p = 0.453). In chronic HF, the severity of RD predicts risk of poor outcome better than changes in renal function during mid-term follow-up. This suggests that in patients with appropriately treated chronic HF, worsening renal function in itself does not yield useful prognostic information and may not reflect poor outcome.

### Cardiorenal syndrome – current understanding and future perspectives [^117JAMsW]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Combined cardiac and renal dysfunction has gained considerable attention. Hypotheses about its pathogenesis have been formulated, albeit based on a relatively small body of experimental studies, and a clinical classification system has been proposed. Cardiorenal syndrome, as presently defined, comprises a heterogeneous group of acute and chronic clinical conditions, in which the failure of one organ (heart or kidney) initiates or aggravates failure of the other. This conceptual framework, however, has two major drawbacks: the first is that, despite worldwide interest, universally accepted definitions of cardiorenal syndrome are lacking and characterization of heart and kidney failure is not uniform. This lack of consistency hampers experimental studies on mechanisms of the disease. The second is that, although progress has been made in developing hypotheses for the pathogenesis of cardiorenal syndrome, these initiatives are at an impasse. No hierarchy has been identified in the myriad of haemodynamic and non-haemodynamic factors mediating cardiorenal syndrome. This Review discusses current understanding of cardiorenal syndrome and provides a roadmap for further studies in this field. Ultimately, discussion of the definition and characterization issues and of the lack of organization among pathogenetic factors is hoped to contribute to further advancement of this complex field.

### Impaired renal autoregulation and pressure-natriuresis: any role in the development of heart failure in normotensive and angiotensin II-dependent hypertensive rats? [^115xKyky]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a global pandemic, affecting almost 30 million people worldwide, most frequently in developed countries; the yearly increase in the number of new patients is estimated at 1.1 million. Paradoxically, the increase in the prevalence of HF is attributed, at least in part, to improved treatment of acute coronary syndromes and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases. Remarkably, the progress in the treatment obtained with early coronary reperfusion by primary percutaneous intervention has decreased the mortality rate but not the morbidity. Somewhat surprisingly, the number of surviving patients who ultimately develop HF has augmented. HF is a clinical syndrome showing progressive aggravation. The prognosis of the patients remains poor, particularly when HF is accompanied by kidney dysfunction ("cardiorenal syndrome"), and it is generally accepted that, particularly in patients with this syndrome, there is an urgent need for new treatment strategies. This requires better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism(s) underlying the progression of HF.

### Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and heart disease… [^112ACvR8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and heart disease are connected.
- Find out why and how you can prevent or manage all three. About CKD, diabetes, and heart disease The relationship between CKD, diabetes, and heart disease is one example of the ways our organs are connected. When one organ isn't working properly, it can put stress on other organs, causing them to stop working properly as well. Your body uses a hormone called insulin that moves sugars from the blood and into your body's cells for energy. If someone has diabetes, they either don't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin well. If someone has CKD, their kidneys don't filter out toxins and waste from their blood as well as they should. Heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common condition, coronary artery disease, leads to changes in blood flow to the heart. This can cause a heart attack. Make the connection So how are these three conditions connected.

Risk factors for each condition are similar and include:

- High blood sugar.
- High blood pressure.
- Family history.
- Obesity.
- Unhealthy diet.
- Physical inactivity. High blood sugar can slowly damage the kidneys. Over time, they may stop filtering blood as well as they should, leading to CKD. Approximately 1 in 3 U. S. adults with diabetes has CKD. When the kidneys don't work well, it puts stress on the heart. When someone has CKD, their heart needs to pump harder to get blood to the kidneys. This can lead to heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Change in blood pressure is also a CKD complication that can lead to heart disease. Protect your heart if you have CKD Over time, CKD often gets worse and can lead to kidney failure. People with kidney failure will need regular dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Heart disease is the most common cause of death for someone on dialysis.

When your kidneys don't function properly, the heart has to work harder to circulate blood. This may lead to high blood pressure and possibly heart disease. Manage your weight and blood sugar by changing your diet and activity routine. For extra help, you can work with a dietitian to create an eating plan that works for you and your kidneys.

### Renal biomarkers in heart Failure: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Vyi2M]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a growing healthcare issue contributing to significant morbidity, mortality, and cost of care. By the year 2030, it is estimated that more than 8 million American adults will be affected by HF. Renal dysfunction is a common accompaniment and an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. Renal dysfunction in HF can present as acute kidney injury, worsening renal function (WRF), or as a gradual decline leading to chronic kidney disease. It has been noted that even minor variations in cardiac output can significantly affect renal perfusion by decreasing renal blood flow and increasing renal venous pressure. These hemodynamic changes, in turn, activate neuro-hormonal, sympathetic, oxidative, and inflammatory pathways leading to altered glomerular structure and function, tubulointerstitial damage, injury, and permanent loss of nephrons. In addition, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions used in these patients can adversely affect renal function. Conversely, renal disease and the resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalances, anemia, and proteinuria contribute to the development and progression of HF. Hence, early identification of renal dysfunction can aid in risk stratification and prognostication of patients with HF.

Appreciation for renal biomarkers in HF has grown remarkably in the last decade, yet very few have been adopted in routine clinical practice. Serum creatinine, a breakdown product of skeletal muscle creatinine phosphate, is freely filtered through the glomerulus enabling glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation. While serum creatinine is commonly used to assess renal function, several factors such as active tubular secretion, high interindividual variation in creatinine phosphate production, and an exponential relationship with renal function make its GFR estimation unreliable. On the contrary, cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor produced by all nucleated cells, is freely filtered through the glomerulus without any active secretion and is unaltered by age, sex, or body mass, thereby allowing a more sensitive and fairly accurate measurement of GFR. Beyond its role in GFR estimation, cystatin C has also been associated with adverse cardiovascular events in various patient populations.

### Cardiorenal nexus: a review with focus on combined chronic heart and kidney failure, and insights from recent clinical trials [^116x2evQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The cardiorenal nexus encompasses a bidirectional relationship between the heart and the kidneys. Chronic abnormalities in cardiac function can lead to progressive kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease can lead to progressively decreasing cardiac function and increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. About 15% of US adults have chronic kidney disease, 2% have heart failure, and 9% have cardiovascular disease. Prevalence rates of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and associated morbidities such as type 2 diabetes are expected to increase with an aging population. Observational studies provide evidence for the cardiorenal nexus. Follow‐up data from placebo arms of clinical trials in chronic kidney disease or cardiovascular disease show higher rates of renal and cardiovascular outcome events in patient subgroups with type 2 diabetes than in those without type 2 diabetes. The cardiorenal syndromes develop along an interlinked pathophysiological trajectory that requires a holistic, collaborative approach involving a multidisciplinary team. There is now a compendium of treatment options. Greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the cardiorenal nexus will support optimization of the management of these interlinked disease states.

### Updates in the management of heart failure for the chronic kidney disease patient [^116J16uo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Heart failure is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Heart failure therapies proven to benefit the general population may have different risk-benefit profiles in patients with concurrent CKD, plausibly because of the unique pathophysiology of heart failure in this population. The present review highlights recent advances in heart failure treatment as they apply to patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

Several recent publications have shown possible benefits of established heart failure therapies to improve clinical outcomes in patients with CKD; while others conclude neutral or even harmful effects of heart failure therapies in CKD patients. Novel heart failure therapies show promise to improve outcomes in the general population and should be evaluated in future studies to further elucidate the efficacy and safety of these novel therapies specifically in patients with CKD.

Summary

Knowledge of heart failure treatment to improve clinical outcomes in the CKD population remains limited. Future studies should focus on patients with CKD to evaluate the generalizability of heart failure therapies to this patient population.

### Renal dysfunction in heart Failure: the role of cardiac afferent fibers [^117P5GSj]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Dynamic interactions among the heart, kidneys, vasculature, and autonomic nervous system intricately regulate blood volume, vascular tone, and cardiac output. These relationships are bidirectional such that acute or chronic disease in one system can strongly influence dysfunction of another. Cardiorenal syndromes are a heterogenous set of disorders classified by the primary underlying disease process and acuity to guide therapeutic strategies. In cardiorenal syndrome type 2 (CRS2), underlying primary chronic cardiac disease such as congestive heart failure (CHF) leads to chronic kidney dysfunction and is strongly associated with greater hazard of all-cause mortality in direct proportional to the degree of decline in renal function. Conventionally, CRS2 has been attributed to impaired blood flow secondary to cardiac disease, resulting in renal hypoperfusion. In discordance with this, studies have demonstrated that renal function can decline in patients who are normotensive or those with no impairment in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. As a result, other mechanisms such as renal venous hypertension secondary to elevated central venous pressure, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, impaired natriuresis, and endothelial dysfunction have been implicated in the development of CRS2.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in heart failure: current management, unmet needs, and therapeutic prospects [^112qyjzF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition to the recently published CREDENCE trial, several other trials dedicated to investigating renal and cardiovascular outcomes with SGLT inhibitors, which may shed light on the extent to which the renal effects of SGLT‐2 inhibitors contribute to the cardiovascular benefits these drugs appear to provide, are ongoing. These trials include, but are not restricted to, DAPA‐CKD (A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease; primary composite end point: time to first occurrence of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, reaching end‐stage renal disease or cardiovascular/renal death) and EMPA‐KIDNEY (A Multicentre International Randomized Parallel Group Double‐blind Placebo‐controlled Clinical Trial of Empagliflozin Once Daily to Assess Cardio‐renal Outcomes in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease; primary composite end point: time to first occurrence of kidney disease progression [defined as end‐stage kidney disease, a sustained decline in eGFR to < 10 mL/min per 1.73 m², renal death, or a sustained decline of ≥ 40% in eGFR from randomization] or cardiovascular/renal death).

### Drugs that slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease: are renoprotective effects attenuated in heart failure? [^111HCFyZ]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

This conceptual model suggests thatin a congested kidney in which efferent arteriolar vasoconstrictive support mechanisms are paralyzed by conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin systemafferent arteriolar tone may be a critical determinant of glomerular function. Indeed, as a result of its ability to potentiate the action of endogenous natriuretic peptides to cause afferent arteriolar vasodilation, neprilysin inhibition enhances glomerular function in heart failure. This may explain the effect of sacubitril/valsartan (when compared with conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system) to reduce the risk of major adverse kidney outcomes in patients with heart failure, even though the drug acts to increase albuminuria.

These observations, taken together, lead to three important conclusions. First, end-stage kidney disease is a distinctly uncommon event in trials of patients with chronic heart failure trials. When the four SGLT2-inhibitor trials in heart failure are combined, there were > 1800 cardiovascular deaths, but only 120 occurrences of end-stage kidney disease. The contribution of renal events to major health outcomes would be even smaller if nonfatal hospitalizations for heart failure were included in the analysis of major heart failure outcomes. Second, many drugs that reduce cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure are accompanied by worsening glomerular function, which does not negate the benefits of treatment. Third, the simultaneous occurrence of renal hypoperfusion and congestion — rather than intraglomerular hypertension — may be the primary factor that drives the development of end-stage kidney disease in patients with heart failure.

### Standardized definitions of changes in kidney function in trials of heart failure: JACC expert panel from the HF-ARC [^114aoiuv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Perturbations in kidney function are frequently encountered in heart failure (HF) across its spectrum in both chronic and acute settings with distinct implications for patient management and prognosis. Lack of consensus on the threshold for clinically meaningful changes in kidney function has led to heterogeneity in the clinical characteristics and background therapies of individuals enrolled in clinical trials, and in multiple aspects of trial design. A meaningful and collaborative interaction among the disciplines of cardiology and nephrology, clinical trialists, industry sponsors, and regulatory agencies is vital to the development of standardized definitions of changes in kidney function across HF settings. To achieve this critically important objective, the Heart Failure Collaboratory assembled experts in HF and nephrology, including key stakeholders in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and industry, with the goal of developing initial recommendations for improved standardization of design and conduct of clinical trials in HF. Recommendations included how and when to measure baseline and changes in kidney function, discouraging the use of the term "acute kidney injury", and the consideration of urinary markers in the assessment of kidney function.

### Risk factors for chronic kidney disease… [^111BQifF]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Approximately 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has chronic kidney disease.
- About 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure has CKD.
- Adults with heart failure also have a higher risk of CKD. Risk factors Diabetes CKD is common in people with diabetes. Approximately 1 in 3 adults with diabetes has CKD. Each kidney is made up of millions of tiny filters called nephrons. High blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels in the kidneys and nephrons so they don't work well. High blood pressure Approximately 1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure has CKD. High blood pressure can make blood vessels narrower, reducing blood flow. Over time, blood vessels throughout the body weaken, including in the kidneys. Damaged blood vessels in the kidneys may no longer work properly. When this happens, the kidneys can't remove all wastes and extra fluid from your body. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure even more.

Keep Reading: Chronic Kidney Disease and High Blood Pressure. Heart disease Adults with heart failure have a higher risk of CKD because of reduced blood flow to the kidneys. Having CKD is also a risk factor for heart disease. Keep Reading: Chronic Kidney Disease, and Diabetes, and Heart Disease Family history of CKD CKD runs in families. You may be more likely to get kidney disease if you have a close relative with CKD. Obesity Having overweight or obesity raises your risk for high blood pressure and diabetes, the two biggest causes of CKD. This means that having overweight or obesity puts you at greater risk for CKD.

### Hydrogen sulfide attenuates renin Angiotensin and aldosterone pathological signaling to preserve kidney Function and improve exercise Tolerance in heart failure [^1172Aw5e]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a heterogeneous disease resulting from a number of common pathological stimuli including, but not limited to, long-standing hypertension, profound inflammation, and overactivation of neurohumoral pathways. HF is a major public health problem in the United States, with a prevalence of 7 million people, and it is projected to affect more than 9 million people by 2030. Due to its heterogeneous nature, the consequences of HF are not limited to cardiac pathology. Noncardiac comorbidities such as renal dysfunction and vascular dysfunction frequently accompany HF and further decrease patients' quality of life and clinical outcomes. For example, HF patients with renal dysfunction have greater chance for readmission, longer hospital stay, and worse prognosis, and vascular injury has been linked to reduced exercise capacity, leading to decreased quality of life.

Neurohumoral dysregulation is a hallmark feature in many cardiovascular diseases including heart failure. Specifically, overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) exacerbates HF symptoms and contributes to the development of comorbidities. In fact, efficacious first-line medications for HF such as beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) target the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the RAAS overactivity. However, these medications are imperfect and have several limitations. For example, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and ARBs are receptor antagonists designed to compete with endogenous ligands without altering or decreasing the levels of endogenous ligands, which potentially limits their vascular protective effects. Distinct from receptor antagonists, ACE inhibitors reduce the endogenous production of angiotensin II (Ang II), but its use is contraindicated in patients with certain cardiorenal syndromes due to unwanted side effects. Current treatments inadequately manage the diverse population of HF patients in a manner that effectively extends longevity and quality of life. Therefore, examination of novel pharmacotherapies that have the ability to protect multiple organ systems in heart failure is warranted.
