## Question

A patient with obstructive BPH previously had subjective urinary retention and currently has asymptomatic urinary retention, resulting in bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and subsequent chronic renal failure. The reversibility of this is uncertain at this time. He was informed that this is a chronic problem that will only get worse with time. What are his treatment options?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for a patient with obstructive BPH who progressed from subjective urinary retention to current asymptomatic urinary retention with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and chronic renal failure, with uncertain reversibility, and was told the condition will worsen over time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about urgency and absolute indications for intervention. Then, I should verify immediate stabilization steps to protect renal function. Next, I will review definitive surgical options by prostate size and patient risk. After that, I need to consider what role, if any, medical therapy has as a bridge. Finally, I will address minimally invasive alternatives, patient-specific modifiers, and how to counsel about renal recovery uncertainty with appropriate follow-up plans, anchoring each step to guideline-grade references [^112ZMJ5o] [^115vsMSx] [^111XaLZg] [^111oa5FL].

> Let me first confirm the clinical severity and indications: obstructive BPH with retention plus bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and chronic renal insufficiency represents decompensated outlet obstruction and meets absolute indications for surgical intervention because both renal insufficiency and refractory retention attributable to BPH are listed triggers for surgery; I need to ensure I'm not overstating this, but the AUA specifically names "renal insufficiency secondary to BPH" and "refractory urinary retention secondary to BPH" as indications, which this patient fulfills, so surgery is not optional but indicated to prevent further renal decline [^112ZMJ5o] [^116pYjr5].

> Wait, before jumping to the operating room, immediate stabilization is required; I should verify that prompt bladder drainage (urethral or suprapubic catheter) is indicated to relieve retention and back pressure while optimizing electrolytes and volume status with nephrology co-management, and I should check whether starting an alpha-blocker around catheterization improves chances of a trial without catheter and can help bladder recovery; data and guidelines support alpha-blockers for moderate–severe LUTS and use around acute retention, though here the presence of hydronephrosis and renal insufficiency still mandates definitive deobstruction even if a trial without catheter succeeds [^115R4YN8] [^116VJAZ4] [^115qGmtt].

> Hold on, let's not conflate symptomatic therapy with deobstruction: I initially thought combination medical therapy might be an alternative to avoid surgery, but I need to check the time-to-effect and whether it reverses threat to the upper tracts; 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors shrink prostate volume 20–30% over 6–12 months and are recommended with alpha-blockers for larger prostates to reduce progression risk, yet this is far too slow for a patient with hydronephrosis and chronic renal insufficiency where anatomic deobstruction is required now; so medical therapy here is adjunctive or bridging, not definitive, which aligns with EAU and AUA guidance and with evidence that surgery produces greater deobstructive effect and symptom gains than medication [^115vsMSx] [^112P9cEV] [^112kMwGY] [^113vpnXo].

> Next, I should review definitive surgical options and match them to likely gland size and patient factors; let me consider that bilateral hydronephrosis often accompanies very large glands, although I should confirm size by imaging rather than assume; for prostates over roughly 80 mL, simple prostatectomy (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) is recommended in centers with expertise, while HoLEP provides size-independent enucleation with robust deobstruction, and TURP remains a core option in appropriately sized glands; for patients at higher bleeding risk or on anticoagulation, GreenLight PVP is a reasonable alternative based on AUA and CUA guidance; overall, contemporary comparative data show durable improvements across modalities with lasers and enucleation achieving strong deobstructive outcomes [^111XaLZg] [^114txRKe] [^115Sri2T] [^113sEc1S] [^115XCuyY].

> But wait, what about minimally invasive alternatives like prostatic artery embolization or Aquablation; I should double-check their role here; PAE can improve LUTS but is inferior to TURP for severe obstruction and is not the choice when renal function is threatened, and Aquablation has emerging data but limited long-term outcomes and is not validated for decompensated obstructive uropathy with upper tract dilation; thus, these are not first-line in the renal failure scenario [^112KbExK] [^111TBZ7W].

> I will now examine patient-specific modifiers that might steer procedural choice; if the patient has significant anticoagulation or bleeding risk, PVP offers favorable hemostasis; if prostate size is very large, simple prostatectomy or HoLEP may provide the most complete debulking; I need to ensure informed consent covers sexual function trade-offs, including high rates of retrograde ejaculation across procedures and technique-dependent risks for erectile dysfunction, and I should verify that counseling addresses these outcomes explicitly [^116Kkxd6] [^111XaLZg] [^116QufvG].

> Let me outline a practical, staged plan to keep this organized: first, decompress the bladder with catheter drainage, optimize renal and metabolic status with nephrology, and obtain imaging to document prostate size and reassess hydronephrosis; second, initiate an alpha-blocker to facilitate bladder recovery while planning definitive surgery; third, proceed to definitive deobstruction tailored to size and risk — HoLEP or TURP for small-to-medium glands, simple prostatectomy or HoLEP for very large glands, and PVP when bleeding risk predominates; finally, after surgery, I should confirm renal trajectory with serial creatinine and a follow-up renal ultrasound to assess hydronephrosis resolution, and only consider ongoing medical therapy if there is concern for detrusor underactivity or for long-term progression prevention, with shared decision-making [^112ZMJ5o] [^115R4YN8] [^111XaLZg] [^114txRKe].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify expectations around renal reversibility; chronic renal failure from longstanding obstruction may only partially recover, and earlier definitive deobstruction maximizes the chance of improvement, though the extent is patient-specific; I need to ensure the patient understands that surgery is to stop further decline and allow potential recovery, not a guarantee of normal renal function, which is why prompt action under guideline-based indications is emphasized and why post-operative monitoring of renal function and hydronephrosis is essential [^112ZMJ5o] [^111oa5FL].

> Let me reconsider the role of ongoing or adjunctive medications after deobstruction; if storage symptoms persist, guideline-supported combinations such as alpha-blocker plus antimuscarinic or beta-3 agonist can be considered cautiously once obstruction is relieved, and a PDE5 inhibitor can be paired with an alpha-blocker in men prioritizing erectile function, but I should confirm that any residual obstruction is addressed first to avoid worsening retention [^114rwigs] [^113TLT49] [^116axiqu].

> Finally, I should confirm that counseling is comprehensive: explain the absolute indication for surgery given renal insufficiency and retention, the rationale for immediate bladder drainage and timely definitive deobstruction, procedural options matched to anatomy and comorbidity, risks including ejaculatory changes and potential erectile effects, the uncertain but possible renal recovery, and the follow-up plan; this shared decision-making approach is explicitly recommended by the AUA for BPH management and helps align expectations in complex cases like this [^111oa5FL] [^112ZMJ5o].

---

For BPH with chronic retention, hydroureteronephrosis, and CKD, **surgical intervention is indicated** to relieve obstruction and prevent further renal decline [^112ZMJ5o] [^115R4YN8]. **TURP** is the standard option [^114txRKe], with HoLEP or PVP for large prostates or bleeding risk [^113sEc1S], and simple prostatectomy for very large glands [^111XaLZg]. Medical therapy (alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs) is adjunctive and not definitive; minimally invasive options (PAE, Rezum, UroLift) are not appropriate in this setting. If surgery is contraindicated, **long-term catheterization** is the fallback. Early surgery offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility is uncertain.

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is **adjunctive only** and does not relieve the underlying obstruction.

- **Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin, alfuzosin)**: Rapid symptom relief but do not reduce prostate size or prevent progression [^112KBL92] [^116VJAZ4].

- **5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs, e.g. finasteride, dutasteride)**: Reduce prostate size and lower risk of AUR and surgery, but take months to work and are less effective in severe obstruction [^112kMwGY] [^115R4YN8].

- **Combination therapy**: Alpha-blocker plus 5-ARI for moderate-to-severe LUTS with enlarged prostate, but not definitive in chronic retention with renal impairment [^116LbmK9] [^115vsMSx].

- **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil)**: Modest symptom benefit, mainly for concomitant erectile dysfunction [^112GjLSV] [^116axiqu].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

Minimally invasive options are **not appropriate** for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Prostatic arterial embolization (PAE)**: Not recommended for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Water vapor thermal therapy (Rezum)**: Not suitable for chronic retention with renal impairment.

- **Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift)**: Not indicated for chronic retention with renal impairment.

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is the **definitive treatment** for chronic retention with renal impairment [^112ZMJ5o].

| **Surgical option** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TURP | Standard for moderate-to-severe LUTS and chronic retention | Effective symptom relief; improved renal function | Bleeding; TUR syndrome; retrograde ejaculation [^114txRKe] |
| HoLEP | Large prostates (> 80 mL) | Effective; low bleeding; short catheter time | Steep learning curve; specialized equipment |
| PVP (GreenLight laser) | Bleeding risk or anticoagulation | Low bleeding; short catheter time | Limited tissue for pathology; retreatment risk [^113sEc1S] |
| Simple prostatectomy | Very large prostates (> 100 mL) | Effective for large glands | Invasive; longer recovery |

---

## Catheterization

If surgery is contraindicated, **long-term catheterization** (indwelling or intermittent) decompresses the bladder and helps prevent further renal decline but carries risks of infection and discomfort.

---

## Reversibility of renal impairment

Renal recovery depends on obstruction duration, severity, and baseline renal function. **Early surgery** offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility remains uncertain.

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Patients should be counseled about the **progressive nature** of BPH, the risks of untreated obstruction, and the benefits and risks of each option, with shared decision-making guiding care [^111oa5FL] [^1145BJDE].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up with **renal function tests, imaging, and symptom assessment** is essential to track progression and treatment response [^113tjqza].

---

Surgical intervention is the **definitive treatment** for BPH with chronic retention, hydroureteronephrosis, and CKD; medical therapy is adjunctive, and minimally invasive options are not appropriate. Early surgery offers the best chance to stabilize or improve renal function, though reversibility is uncertain.

### Patient's adherence on pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is different: is combination therapy better than monotherapy [^111Byvd3]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) is caused by a very common histopathological condition in aging men; benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Clinical manifestations of BPH include lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), signs, and sequelae of bladder outlet obstruction caused by BPE. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe LUTS is high, increasing from 22% among 50–59-year-old men to 45% among those in the seventh decade of life. However, only 19% of men suffering from BPH-associated LUTS seek medical treatment and only 10.2% receive pharmacological treatment.

Pharmacological therapy for BPH-associated LUTS aims at improving the patient's quality of life by relieving urinary symptoms and, to a certain extent, by preventing the development of BPH-related complications. International guidelines agree that patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS are initially best managed with pharmacological therapy.

Five classes of drugs are usually prescribed for the treatment of BPH-associated LUTS: alpha blockers (AB), 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, antimuscarinics/beta3 agonists, and phytotherapeutics. Combination therapy (CT) with ABs and 5ARIs has been shown to be beneficial in terms of symptom control and disease progression.

Although pharmacological treatment of BPH is considered a success story among urologists, daily practice suggests that several patient needs remain unmet. Whether this is due to drug limitations, inappropriate patient management, or low patient adherence to drug therapy remains unclear.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114ffU2t]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia are the most common urological problem among men, affecting about a third of men over age 50. Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, with around 100,000 procedures carried out annually in the United States. Of all surgical treatments, monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in which the enlarged prostate tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode, has been the preferred method since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms (based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)), and health-related quality of life, with long-term efficacy compared with drugs or other minimally invasive treatments. However, monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because of the likelihood of severe complications such as massive bleeding or transurethral resection syndrome. Therefore, minimally invasive surgical techniques need to be developed with outcomes similar to those of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side effects.

Since the 2000s, new energy systems for surgical interventions treating benign prostatic hyperplasia have quickly become popular, including systems that use bipolar energy and various laser systems such as the holmium laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, thulium laser, and diode laser. The trend in surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia has shifted from monopolar TURP to laser treatments and bipolar TURP over the past 10 years. Bipolar energy can be

### Update on AUA guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114qQbtX]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this revision was to update the 2003 version of the American Urological Association's (AUA) guideline on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Materials and methods: From MEDLINE® searches of English language publications (January 1999 through February 2008), using relevant MeSH terms, articles concerning the management of the index patient — a male aged ≥ 45 years who is consulting a healthcare provider for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) — were identified. A qualitative analysis of the evidence was performed. Selected studies were stratified by design, comparator, follow-up interval, and intensity of intervention. Meta-analyses (quantitative synthesis) of outcomes from randomized controlled trials were planned. Guideline statements were drafted by an appointed expert panel based on the evidence.

Results: The studies varied regarding patient selection, randomization, blinding mechanism, run-in periods, patient demographics, comorbidities, prostate characteristics and symptoms, drug doses, other intervention characteristics, comparators, rigor and intervals of follow-up, trial duration and timing, suspected lack of applicability to US practice, and techniques of outcomes measurement. These variations affected the quality of the evidence reviewed, making formal meta-analysis impractical or futile. Instead, the panel and extractors reviewed the data in a systematic fashion without statistical rigor. Diagnosis and treatment algorithms were adopted from the 2005 International Consultation of Urologic Diseases, while guideline statements concerning pharmacotherapies were extracted from the studies.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Rapid evidence review [^115R4YN8]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia affect 25% of U.S. men, nearly one-half of whom have at least moderate symptoms. Sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus increase the risk of symptoms. Evaluation focuses on determining the severity of symptoms and therapy to improve symptoms. Rectal examination has limited accuracy in evaluating prostate size. Transrectal ultrasonography is preferred to verify size when starting 5-alpha reductase therapy or considering surgery. Serum prostate-specific antigen testing is not recommended in the routine evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms, and shared decision-making should be used for cancer screening decisions. The International Prostate Symptom Score is the best way to track symptoms.

Self-management methods include limiting evening fluid intake, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, toilet and bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, and mindfulness techniques, which can improve symptoms. Although saw palmetto is not effective, the herbal treatments Pygeum africanum and beta-sitosterol may be effective. Primary medical treatment involves alpha blockers or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Alpha blockers offer rapid benefits and can be used for acute urinary retention. Combining alpha blockers and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors is not beneficial. For uncontrolled symptoms, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors should be started if the prostate volume is 30 mL or greater by ultrasonography. 5-Alpha reductase inhibitors take up to one year to be fully beneficial and are more effective when taken with alpha blockers.

### Sexual function in patients treated for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116QufvG]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

What is the effect of different treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on sexual function or dysfunction? With increasing age, sexual dysfunction and BPH become more prevalent. Some treatments for BPH can affect sexual function. Different surgical treatments have varying effects on sexual function, depending on how much the internal involuntary sphincter is affected. This variation is also true for medical therapies, with each class of drug having a unique impact on sexual function.

In the past, many articles suggested a causal relation between BPH and sexual dysfunction, but a recent report by H. Leliefeld and colleagues (BJU International 2002; 89: 208–13) confirms that the relation is coincidental. Prospectively, these investigators examined patients at baseline and again nine months after various treatments for BPH using questionnaires on voiding symptoms, related complications, and sexual function. Notably, 84% of patients reported no change in sexual function. All treatments showed both improvement in 3–14% and deterioration in 0–16% of patients, respectively. As expected, age was the most important determinant of sexual function. Additionally, severe irritative symptoms or the presence of urological comorbidities, such as bladder stones, increased the rate of sexual dysfunction. In this study, most patients underwent surgical therapy or watchful waiting, while fewer had medical therapy. There were too few patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures to comment on their effect on sexual function. Thus, the relation between treatment of BPH and sexual function remains a complex and nuanced issue.

### Transurethral resection of the prostate provides more favorable clinical outcomes compared with conservative medical treatment in patients with urinary retention caused by benign prostatic obstruction [^116bx6wU]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects approximately 210 million men globally and is a major cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) in aging men. LUTSs negatively affect patients' quality of life and cost the US healthcare system more than $4 billion each year. One study estimated that 50% and 75% of men have histological evidence of BPH by the age of 50 and 80 years, respectively, with approximately 50% of them having clinically significant symptoms. The sequelae of BPH include decreased urinary flow and advancing voiding and storage symptoms; these may eventually result in acute or chronic urinary retention (UR).

Although men with acute UR caused by BPH have an increased chance of returning to normal voiding if treatment with α-1 blockers is started at the time of catheter insertion, 24%–42% of patients elect to receive surgical intervention instead. According to the updated guidelines, surgical intervention is an appropriate treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe LUTSs and for patients who have developed acute UR or other BPH-related complications. Surgical treatment is often effective and prevents the need for indwelling or intermittent catheterization in the future. However, in a previous study, 79% of patients received α1-blockers before catheter removal, and most of them could void successfully without requiring an indwelling catheter.

To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have compared long-term treatment outcomes between transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and medical treatment in patients with BPO who experience.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia: Maintaining symptom control and reducing complications [^116BiCBt]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The average patient with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or LUTS/BPH, has a remaining life expectancy of 15 to 20 years. Therefore, both short-term and long-term outcomes are significant in managing LUTS/BPH. Sustained symptom control, improved quality of life (QOL), control of disease progression (e.g. prevention or reduction of bladder wall hypertrophy [BWH] and increased bladder mass), reduction of the risk of serious complications, and minimizing the need to switch to other medical therapy or surgery are crucial in treatment.

Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, have been shown to provide effective and rapid relief of symptoms and sustained improvement in QOL in the long term, up to six years. Long-term obstruction may induce changes in the bladder wall, like BWH, potentially leading to irreversible bladder damage and serious complications. Preliminary data suggest that alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists can prevent the development of BWH in rabbits and reduce existing BWH in patients with obstructed LUTS/BPH.

Pooled analyses and indirect comparisons of clinical studies up to one year indicate that alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and the need for surgery to at least the same extent as the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride. Additionally, monotherapy with an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist reduces the risk of long-term clinical progression. The combination with finasteride may offer more benefits for patients at an advanced stage of the condition.

### Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for lower urinary tract symptoms consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112GjLSV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland that may cause bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) are the mainstay of medical treatment. Recently, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) that have been used mainly to treat erectile dysfunction were introduced to treat male LUTS.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PDEIs compared to placebo and other standard care drugs (ABs and 5-ARIs) in men with LUTS consistent with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We conducted a systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and clinical trials registries of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (updated 2 August 2018). We performed citation tracking and hand-searching of abstracts and conference proceedings. We also contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered for inclusion in this systematic review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PDEIs versus placebo, ABs, or 5-ARIs for at least four weeks in men with BPH-LUTS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently screened the literature and extracted data. Primary outcomes were effects on urinary symptoms as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS-total; score ranging from 0 to 35, with higher values reflecting more symptoms) and urinary bother as assessed by the Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPH).

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111wi7wJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate that can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these symptoms.

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications, or surgical interventions, (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes was extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical, or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures, such as peak urine flow rate. The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4- [text ends].

### New innovative therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Any advance [^112yRGFE]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common human neoplasm and the most frequent tumor requiring surgical treatment in men. Not surprisingly, interest centers on understanding prostatic growth during aging and on various medical or interventional treatments.

Recent publications describe the interaction of various 5alpha-reductase inhibitors on the two 5alpha-reductase isoforms, type 1 and 2, providing potential new insight into the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Chronic inflammation increases growth patterns of fibromuscular tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia similar to wound healing. A paracrine loop for chronic inflammation with overexpression of interleukin has been identified, which is crucial for understanding prostatic enlargement.

Herbal drug treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms seems to be more effective than previously thought. Recent publications indicate its effectiveness is well beyond placebo effects. Alpha-blockers play an important role in treating lower urinary tract symptoms, with alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists preventing cell proliferation and apoptotic imbalances in prostatic tissue. However, the effect of alpha-blockers may be limited by severe bladder outlet obstruction, with patients at increased risk of treatment failure.

Laser prostatectomy and microwave thermotherapy are under consideration as alternative treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The efficacy of urodynamically proven de-obstruction is still being evaluated.

### Treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115nzPEP]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be a sign of aging rather than a consequence of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) or benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Medical or invasive treatments should address the bothersome symptoms and the quality of life of patients. Alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are most frequently used in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) medical treatments, whereas Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) remains the "gold standard" for surgical treatments. Several minimally invasive treatments are emerging with promising outcomes.

### The overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis [^11394Myz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the relationship, diagnosis, and treatment of the overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms experienced by men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis, recent studies have shown that men can suffer from both conditions. Approximately 5–20% of men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia experience prostatitis-like symptoms, while over one-third of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia have had a prostatitis diagnosis in the past. Differentiation between these two symptom-based medical conditions can be difficult due to overlapping symptoms. However, pain clearly identifies those patients with chronic prostatitis. Treatment for men with co-occurring benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis may include alpha-blockers, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapies such as saw palmetto and bee pollen extract, with evidence showing the benefits of alpha-blocker therapy.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis are common causes of lower urinary tract symptoms and frequently co-occur in older men. The best treatment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis is alpha-blockers.

### Future concepts in the medical therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112Mor4o]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The standard medical therapy for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia continues to involve the use of alpha-blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Ongoing studies demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of these two classes of therapeutic approaches. Although there have been no new Food and Drug Administration-approved medical therapies for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia over the past year, interest in and the use of phytotherapeutic agents continues to increase. In this review, we will discuss the developments that have occurred over the past year in the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and present ongoing efforts at our center to obtain a better understanding of and manipulate the apoptotic pathway as it pertains to the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Personalized medicine for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116PK3qr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia affects more than 50% of men by age 60 years and accounts for millions of dollars in health care expenditure for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary obstruction. Despite the widespread use of medical therapy, there is no universal treatment for all men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. At least 30% of patients do not respond to medical management, and a subset requires surgery. Significant advances have been made in understanding the natural history and development of the prostate, including elucidating the role of the enzyme 5α-reductase type 2. Advances in genomics and biomarker discovery offer the potential for a more targeted approach to therapy.

This study reviews the understanding of benign prostatic hyperplasia progression, as well as the key genes and signaling pathways implicated in the process, such as 5α-reductase. There is also an exploration of the potential of biomarker screening and gene-specific therapies as tools to risk-stratify patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and identify those with symptomatic or medically resistant forms.

A PubMed® literature search and past peer-reviewed literature on prostate development, lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostatic hyperplasia pathogenesis, targeted therapy, biomarkers, epigenetics, 5α-reductase type 2, and personalized medicine was performed. An additional Google Scholar™ search was conducted to broaden the scope of the review. Relevant reviews and original research articles were examined.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and discomfort, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist. They can also identify which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single-agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men [^113tjqza]. The Journal of Urology (2013). High credibility.

The 6th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases met from June 24–28, 2005, in Paris, France, to review new developments in benign prostatic disease.

A series of committees were tasked with producing recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in older men. Each committee based its recommendations on a thorough assessment of the available literature according to the International Consultation on Incontinence level of evidence and grading system, adapted from the Oxford system.

The Consultation endorsed the appropriate use of the terminology "lower urinary tract symptoms", "benign prostatic hyperplasia", "benign prostate enlargement", and "benign prostatic obstruction". It recommended abandoning terms such as "clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia" or "the benign prostatic hyperplasia patient" and urged authorities to endorse the new nomenclature. The diagnostic evaluation describes recommended and optional tests and generally emphasizes the impact (bother) of lower urinary tract symptoms on individual patients when determining investigation and treatment.

The importance of symptom assessment, impact on quality of life, physical examination, and urinalysis is emphasized. The frequency volume chart is recommended when nocturia is a bothersome symptom to exclude nocturnal polyuria. The recommendations are summarized in two algorithms: one for basic management and another for specialized management of persistent bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Comparative effectiveness of newer medications for lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dm3JA]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Context**: Alpha-blockers (ABs) and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have an established role in treating male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recently, newer drugs have shown promise for this indication.

- **Objective**: To assess the comparative effectiveness and adverse effects (AEs) of newer drugs to treat LUTS attributed to BPH through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Evidence acquisition**: The Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Ovid Embase bibliographic databases (through June 2016) were hand searched for references of relevant studies. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials published in English of newer ABs, antimuscarinics, a beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, or combination therapy with one of these medications as an active comparator. Observational studies of the same agents with a duration ≥ 1 year that reported AEs were also included.

- **Evidence synthesis**: We synthesized evidence from 43 randomized controlled trials as well as five observational studies. Based on improvement of mean International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life scores, the effectiveness of the newer ABs was not different from the older ABs (moderate strength of evidence [SOE]), but had more AEs (low SOE). Antimuscarinics/AB combination therapy had similar outcomes as AB monotherapy (all moderate SOE), but often had more AEs. Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors alone or in combination with ABs had similar or inferior outcomes compared to ABs alone. Evidence was insufficient.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116iVXHU]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Two reviewers (S-WH, C-ST) independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility, followed by assessment of the full articles against eligibility criteria. We developed and pilot-tested a data extraction form using 10 randomly included studies, refining it accordingly. Two reviewers (S-WH, C-ST) extracted and cross-checked the data independently. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool to appraise study quality. Any unresolved discrepancies in data extraction or appraisal were evaluated by a third reviewer (C-YT), who acted as an arbiter. We further applied the GRADE approach (grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation) to assess evidence quality for the primary outcomes, considered critical in clinical decision making.

We attempted to contact some authors about missing data, and several responded. When standard deviation data were missing, or only pre-treatment values were available, we calculated standard deviations using formulas from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions or derived them from figure data in the articles. If the authors reported only medians, we used medians as means and interquartile ranges divided by 1.35 as standard deviations.

### Patient's adherence on pharmacological therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is different: is combination therapy better than monotherapy [^113YLWLk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

From the initial cohort of about 6.5 million individuals, men aged ≥ 40 years old were 1,447,074. Among these, only 28,273 received prescriptions for 12 months for BPH-associated LUTS. This group was followed (median follow-up of 4 years, IQR 2–5.3) and represented our study cohort.

General characteristics of the group revealed that alpha-blocker monotherapy (AB) was the most frequently prescribed drug class (87.1%), followed by 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) at 8.1%, and combination therapy (CT) at 4.7%, which was prescribed more often to older patients.

- **Drug adherence**:
	- Patients who received prescriptions for ≥ 6 months were 97,407 and decreased to 61,298 (63%) at 10 months and to 28,273 (29%) at 12 months. Patients who continued taking their drugs for up to 12 months were 35% for ABs, 18% for 5ARIs, and 9% for CT. These rates decreased to 15%, 8%, and 3% at 60 months.

In men who received drug prescriptions for at least 12 months, the 5-year adherence was 42%. Patients who remained under pharmacological therapy for the entire follow-up period (median 4 years) represented 13% of those identified in the index period. Patients under CT showed a higher discontinuation rate throughout the follow-up.

### The progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia: Examining the evidence and determining the risk [^113F8Bod]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is often associated with enlargement of the prostate gland, lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased urinary flow, and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, if the symptoms associated with BPH are left untreated, serious complications, such as acute urinary retention, may ensue. Evidence is emerging from long-term clinical studies to suggest that BPH is a progressive disease, with some patients progressing much more rapidly than others.

- **Objective**: This article aims to explore the natural history of BPH progression from a molecular, pathological, and clinical perspective, with emphasis on the key clinical evidence to support the progressive nature of this disease. How our increased understanding of the disease and of the risk factors for BPH progression might be applied to improve management practices are also discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Strategies to identify patients most at risk and guidelines directed towards long-term management, in addition to short-term treatment, may be useful in helping to prevent BPH progression.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115XCuyY]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

The strength of our study lies in the simultaneous comparison of nine different surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia using a network meta-analysis. We evaluated the short to mid-term effects of different treatments by comparing Qmax and IPSS values at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgical intervention. Importantly, we included randomized controlled trials without language restrictions to minimize bias.

Our network meta-analysis also had several limitations.

- **Complication rates**: Complications were rare, and some trials reported zero events, leading to less precise estimations of pooled odds ratios. Nevertheless, heterogeneity was low and tended to favor new methods in pairwise comparisons.

- **Functional outcomes assessment**: Functional outcomes were assessed blindly in only 14% of trials, potentially introducing bias in favor of the new methods. Moreover, heterogeneity was high in many comparisons of primary outcomes. Factors such as initial prostate volume, the degree of urodynamic obstruction, and surgeon experience could contribute to the high heterogeneity of functional outcomes.

- **Postoperative symptoms analysis**: We did not analyze early postoperative urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or post-micturition pain. While these symptoms impact short-term patient satisfaction, they generally improve with drug treatment within two to three months after surgical treatment.

- **Technique differentiation**: We did not distinguish between vapo-enucleation and enucleation, due to non-standardized definitions and techniques. As a result, differences in outcomes between vapo-enucleation and enucleation, or different enucleation methods, require further investigation.

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^116pYjr5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for the management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system, such as the International Prostate Symptom Score, to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions.

- **Pharmacotherapy options**: α-blockers are recommended as the first-choice option, while 5α-reductase inhibitors are suggested for patients with a prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction.
- **Combination therapies**: These include α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β3-agonists, which are effective options.
- **Surgical referral**: This is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer, or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy.

In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

### EAU guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116WaV8z]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to establish guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of BPH. A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions, recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up categorized as mandatory, recommended, or optional. In addition, indications and outcomes for the different therapeutic options were reviewed.

A digital rectal examination is mandatory in the assessment for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests include the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. All other tests are optional. The aim of the treatment is to improve patients' quality of life, depending on the severity of BPH symptoms.

- **Watchful waiting policy**: Recommended for patients with mild symptoms.
- **Medical treatment**: Advised for patients with mild to moderate symptoms.
- **Surgery**: Recommended for patients who fail medication or conservative management and have moderate to severe symptoms, and/or complications of BPH which require surgery.

Regarding non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is considered the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or who no longer respond favorably to medication. Finally, recommendations for follow-up tests and a suggested follow-up time schedule after BPH treatment are provided.

Recommendations for assessment, possible therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are made.

### Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride [^112kMwGY]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) affects 32–52% of men aged 51–60 years and 77–99% of men aged ≥ 81 years. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as poor stream and hesitancy, are common in patients with BPH. Progression of BPH may result in acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for surgical procedures that partially remove the prostate.

In order to relieve BPH-related symptoms, alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists, known as alpha-blockers, can be used. Previous studies suggest that the combination of alpha-blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) can be beneficial in the treatment of BPH associated with LUTS. The greatest efficacy for this combination treatment was shown in patients with a large prostate size, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of > 1.5 ng/ml, and moderate to severe symptoms based on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). They experienced significant symptom relief and a decreased risk of AUR and surgery compared to patients treated with monotherapy.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is the main mediator of prostate growth. As a class, 5-ARIs aim to reduce the size of the prostate by blocking the activity of 5-alpha reductase enzymes in converting testosterone to DHT. The currently available 5-ARI agents in the United States and European market (dutasteride and finasteride) have been shown to reduce prostate volume by 20–30%. Long-term use of 5-ARI agents results in symptomatic improvements and a reduction of the risk for AUR and prostate surgery. Dutasteride blocks both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha reductase enzymes.

### New therapeutic targets to prevent benign prostatic enlargement and symptomatic progression to benign prostatic obstruction-ICI-RS 2023 [^115qFrZ7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) can affect lower urinary tract function due to its potential progression to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Treatment options include surgical removal of the obstruction or using therapeutics designed to slow growth or reduce tissue stress imposed by muscular stromal components. Inflammation and development of fibrosis can also raise intrinsic tissue stress within the gland, further impacting obstruction. Persistent outflow tract obstruction can affect emission and ejaculation.

This review summarizes an ICI-RS think tank considering novel drug treatments that might address BPO caused by the progressive development of BPE, as well as manage decompensation changes to bladder function.

Topics included recent advances in understanding pathological changes occurring to the prostate and other lower urinary tract tissues during progressive development of BPE, and how prevention or reversal might benefit from the identification of novel drug targets. These include the contractile properties of prostatic tissues, the impact of BPE on bladder function, the deposition of intramural fibrotic tissue with protracted BPO, and the role of inflammation in the development of BPE and its progression to BPO. In particular, therapeutic options for treating BPE/BPO, new therapeutic targets, what they treat, and their advantages over existing medications were discussed.

Several new drug targets were identified, including soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), among others.

### Prostatic arterial embolization for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112KbExK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

A variety of minimally invasive surgical approaches are available as alternatives to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prostatic arterial embolization (PAE) is a relatively new, minimally invasive treatment approach.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PAE compared to other procedures for treatment of LUTS in men with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, including The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. We also searched trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, up until 25 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as well as non-randomized studies (NRS, limited to prospective cohort studies with comparison groups) enrolling men over the age of 40 with LUTS attributed to BPH undergoing PAE versus TURP or other surgical interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified studies for inclusion or exclusion and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used GRADE guidance to rate the certainty of evidence of RCTs and NRSs.

- **Main results**: We found data to inform two comparisons: PAE versus TURP (six RCTs).

### Long-term results of medical treatment in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116LbmK9]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

In real-life clinical practice, we determined the incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related surgery in patients with BPH who received alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker (alpha-blocker) and/or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor combination treatment.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study enrolled 341 patients with BPH who were prescribed an alpha-blocker and/or a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor as their first treatment from January 1997 to June 1999. Using follow-up data from a 6 to 8-year period, we calculated the incidence of AUR and BPH-related surgery in the alpha-blocker-only group and in the combination group.

- **Results**: Of the 341 patients, 192 were in the alpha-blocker group and 149 were in the combination group. Of these, 17.7% in the alpha-blocker group and 12.1% in the combination group experienced AUR (P < 0.05). BPH-related surgery was performed in 10.9% of the alpha-blocker-only group and 6.0% of the combination group (P < 0.05). The incidence of AUR and BPH-related surgery was reduced by 32.3% and 48.9% when the prostate volume was larger than 35 g and by 49.4% and 60.6% when the prostate-specific antigen level was greater than 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, in the combination group compared with the corresponding values in the alpha-blocker group.

- **Conclusions**: Real-life clinical practice showed that long-term combination treatment with alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors reduced the risk of BPH progression, such as AUR or BPH-related surgery, compared with alpha-blocker-only treatment.

### Bladder outlet obstruction relief and symptom improvement following medical and surgical therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review [^113vpnXo]. European Urology (2024). High credibility.

Symptomatic benefit and urodynamic obstruction relief represent relevant outcomes of therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). We summarized evidence from studies concurrently assessing variations in terms of symptoms severity and invasive urodynamic measures of obstruction following medical and surgical therapies for LUTS/BPH.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in June 2023.

- **Key findings and limitations**: We identified 29 publications: 14 studies (872 patients) addressing medical therapies and 15 studies (851 patients) addressing surgical therapies. The mean percentage total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) improvements ranged from -2.5% to 56.3% following medical therapies and from 35.1% to 82.1% following surgical therapies. The corresponding mean percentage Bladder Outlet Obstruction Index (BOOI) improvements ranged from 7.8% to 53.5% for medical therapies and from 22.4% to 138.6% for surgical therapies. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) provided IPSS improvements in the higher range and the greatest BOOI reduction.

- **Conclusions and clinical implications**: Globally, based on available evidence, more pronounced symptomatic benefits are observed following treatments providing greater deobstructive effect. In detail, patients undergoing surgery exhibit greater IPSS and BOOI improvements than those receiving medical therapy.

### Relative impact of male urinary conditions on overall quality of life [^1131zFnu]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: The BPH Registry is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, observational disease registry designed to examine patient characteristics and outcomes, as well as physician management practices for U.S. men with BPH treated conservatively (i.e. watchful waiting or medical therapy) by urologists or primary care physicians.

The registry database includes baseline information on 6,924 men who were enrolled by physicians at 402 geographically diverse sites from January 2024 to February 2025. A full description of the registry design has been previously published. In brief, men with BPH/LUTS were eligible for enrollment if they provided consent and were presently/recently treated with approved prescription medications for BPH, untreated, or were taking botanical products.

Exclusion criteria included lower urinary tract disease or carcinoma; carcinoma of the prostate, bladder, or kidney; previous prostate surgery or minimally invasive procedure; isolated bladder neck disease or urethral stenosis/strictures; gross hematuria; acute urinary retention; neurologic disease affecting urinary function; active kidney or liver disease; and the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs or antiandrogens.

BPH management could change during enrollment in the registry. Investigators also collected information on disease history, clinical history, and laboratory test results.

- **Measurements**: At baseline, participants were asked to complete questionnaires evaluating the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

### The evaluation of nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the analysis of the curative effect after medical or placebo therapy for nocturia: a randomized placebo-controlled study [^116yjjhX]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Nocturia is perceived as a single symptom among all lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) by most men. It is highly prevalent and often the most bothersome component. This has led to significant morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. Scholars have pointed out that this bothersome symptom is related to causing arousal from sleep, and two or more voids per night are usually considered to lead to a decreased health-related quality of life. Nocturia could result from numerous other diseases and conditions, including both urological and non-urological diseases. However, the various causes are not differentiated or excluded in men with LUTS/BPH, and none of the individual α1-adrenoceptor antagonists without subtype selectivity have shown obvious benefits.

Medical therapy has not shown a significant reduction in the frequency of nocturia so far. There are not equal amounts of studies showing positive or negative results on nocturia. For all of these reasons, nocturia is often multifactorial in etiology, and many medical conditions are associated with it. Therefore, we aim to explore nocturia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and analyze the curative effect after medical therapy for nocturia.

### Acute urinary retention in men: 21-year trends in incidence, subsequent benign prostatic hyperplasia-related treatment and mortality: A Danish population-based cohort study [^115qGmtt]. The Prostate (2023). Low credibility.

The shift from surgical to medical first-line treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was only transiently followed by an increase in the incidence of acute urinary retention (AUR). The use of BPH-related surgery after AUR stabilized at 10%–20% following a considerable decline following the implementation of the trial without catheter policy. The high mortality observed in men with AUR was related to deaths attributable to malignancies, urogenital disease, infections, and preexisting comorbidity.

### Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1113E3NF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in aging men that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and prevent disease-related complications. Naftopidil is an alpha-blocker (AB) with a high affinity for the A1d receptor, which may have advantages in treating LUTS in this setting. This review updates a Cochrane Review first published in 2009, incorporating several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported since then.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of naftopidil for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, LILAC, and Web of Science), trial registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings. There were no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status, with searches conducted up to 31 May 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all parallel RCTs and cross-over design trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently classified and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary outcomes were urological symptom scores, quality of life (QoL), and treatment withdrawals for any reason; secondary outcomes included treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, acute urinary retention, surgical intervention for BPH, and cardiovascular events.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia: AUA guideline part I-initial work-up and medical management [^112P9cEV]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a histologic diagnosis describing the proliferation of smooth muscle and epithelial cells within the prostatic transition zone. The prevalence and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men are progressive and impact the health and welfare of society. This revised guideline provides a useful reference on effective evidence-based management of male LUTS/BPH. See the accompanying algorithm for a summary of the procedures detailed in the guideline.

The Minnesota Evidence Review Team searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and AHRQ databases to identify eligible English language studies published between January 2008 and April 2019, then updated through December 2020. Search terms included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords for pharmacological therapies, drug classes, and terms related to LUTS or BPH. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, information is provided as clinical principles and expert opinions.

Nineteen guideline statements pertinent to evaluation, work-up, and medical management were developed. Appropriate levels of evidence and supporting text were created to direct both primary care and urologic providers towards streamlined and suitable practices.

### Aquablation of the prostate for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111TBZ7W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

New, minimally invasive surgeries have emerged as alternatives to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Aquablation is a novel, minimally invasive, water-based therapy that combines image guidance and robotics for the removal of prostatic tissue.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of Aquablation for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases (the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS), trials registries, other sources of grey literature, and conference proceedings published up to 11 February 2019, with no restrictions on the language or status of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, as well as non-randomized observational prospective studies with comparison groups in which participants with BPH who underwent Aquablation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion at each stage and undertook data extraction and 'Risk of bias' and GRADE assessments of the certainty of the evidence. We considered review outcomes measured up to and including 12 months after randomization as short-term and beyond 12 months as long-term.

- **Main results**: We included one RCT with 184 participants comparing Aquablation to TURP. The mean age and International Prostate Symptom Score were analyzed, but the data appears truncated.

### Minimally invasive treatments for benign prostatic enlargement: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^115tS9HD]. BMJ (2008). High credibility.

Benign prostatic enlargement is the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequent urination and slow stream, which are highly prevalent among older men. Endoscopic removal of the inner part of the gland by transurethral resection of the prostate has long been considered the most effective treatment, with about 20,000 procedures carried out in 2007 in the United Kingdom. This procedure has known disadvantages, including blood loss and physiological stress, which affect recovery in some men, along with the need for high levels of technical skill and a three to five day stay in hospital. These factors have encouraged the development of alternative treatments, including drugs, minimally invasive surgical techniques, and different forms of endoscopic prostatectomy, with the intention of achieving the same degree of symptomatic improvement but with less morbidity and lower cost. Minimally invasive techniques aim to reduce prostate volume by delayed tissue necrosis using relatively low levels of thermal energy, thereby reducing the risk of treatment-related morbidity.

We conducted a systematic review to summarize evidence of benefit and risk for seven promising minimally invasive technologies compared with transurethral resection, using data from randomised controlled trials.

### Effect of dutasteride on clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia in asymptomatic men with enlarged prostate: A post hoc analysis of the REDUCE study [^117Rk74t]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia commonly causes lower urinary tract symptoms among men as they age. The treatment of this progressive condition is often adjusted for prostate size. Progression of prostatic hyperplasia is defined as an aggregate measure of worsening lower urinary tract symptoms, acute urinary retention, and need for prostate surgery. Pivotal phase III trials, such as Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) and Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (ComBAT), showed that combination medical therapy with a 5α reductase inhibitor and α blocker can halt the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia among men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms, with the greatest benefit noted in men with enlarged prostates.

An important aspect of both of these trials, as well as other studies showing the preventive benefits of 5α reductase inhibitors, is that they have excluded men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms at screening (MTOPS excluded International Prostate Severity Scale (IPSS) scores ≤ 7). However, the REDUCE study examined the effect of dutasteride in asymptomatic men or those with mild symptoms, providing valuable insight into its preventative potential for a wider male population. For men with prostate sizes > 30 mL, the relative risk for disease progression and acute urinary retention were significantly higher, emphasizing the importance of prostate size in determining treatment strategy. For instance, the relative risks for progression for prostate sizes > 30 mL were 4.2 (95% confidence interval: 2.2 to 8.2) and 2.3 (1.1 to 4.7), respectively, while the unadjusted relative risk of acute urinary retention for prostate size > 30 mL was noteworthy.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115ywDbp]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition that increases in prevalence with age. A comprehensive history should include the onset, duration, and severity of lower urinary tract symptoms, as well as medication use, to rule out other causes of symptoms. The physical examination includes a digital rectal examination and assessment for bladder distention or neurologic impairment. Recommended tests include serum prostate-specific antigen measurement and urinalysis to help identify infection, genitourinary cancer, or calculi as an alternative cause of lower urinary tract symptoms. BPH severity is assessed using validated, self-administered symptom questionnaires, such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index or International Prostate Symptom Score. Mild or nonbothersome symptoms do not require treatment. Bothersome symptoms are managed with lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery. Alpha blockers are first-line medications for BPH. Surgical referral is indicated if BPH-related complications develop, medical therapy fails, or the patient chooses it. Dietary supplements, such as saw palmetto, pygeum, cernilton, and beta sitosterols, and acupuncture are not recommended for the management of BPH.

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^1145BJDE]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributable to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common, affecting approximately 33% of Medicare beneficiaries. As the most common condition contributing to non-neurogenic LUTS in men, BPH is also the focus of frequently updated medical and surgical management guidelines that directly influence provider decision-making and patient care. The burden of LUTS/BPH is expected to increase both in the US and worldwide due to shifting demographics and a static urologic workforce. To meet this demand, there is an urgent need to develop and refine efficient strategies to assess, triage, and enhance the care of patients through standardized outcome measures and optimized care coordination, including remote assessment.

Measuring outcomes provides a way to track progress, adjust treatments, monitor quality of care, and help patients achieve optimal outcomes. For decades, the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) has been the patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure used in men with BPH, as recommended in the "Surgical Management" guidelines updated as recently as 2023. The AUA-SI, however, has several limitations that leave room for improvement. First, the AUA-SI omits urinary incontinence and pain, which in the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) cohort, were present in 51% and 17% of treatment-seeking men, respectively, despite exclusion of men with infection or urinary pain as a primary complaint.

### Surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction: An analysis and meta-synthesis of available guidelines [^112SW85h]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms supposed secondary to benign prostatic obstruction (LUTS/BPO) are among the most prevalent conditions in older males. Surgical treatment is usually recommended if pharmacotherapy fails, is not well tolerated, or when BPO-related complications arise. Surgical options can also be used at an earlier stage following a thorough joint decision has been made. As established surgical therapies have drawbacks and the threshold for surgical treatment seems to have become much lower with the implementation of minimally invasive treatments (MITs), LUTS/BPO surgery has become an economically significant area. Consequently, novel therapeutic devices and procedures are being developed at an unprecedented rate.

The rapid adoption of new surgical techniques is influenced by a range of factors, including patient demand, competitive healthcare dynamics, and regulatory pathways that are often less stringent than those applied to pharmaceuticals. Consequently, some interventions may enter clinical use before a comprehensive evidence base is available. A comprehensive understanding of the array of procedures, including their benefits and risks, safety profiles, and ideal indications, is essential for successful, individualized treatment. However, for physicians not deeply specialized in the field, staying abreast of these developments can be challenging. Clinical guidelines provide critical support in this context.

Nonetheless, guidelines are not without their limitations. The required level of evidence for recommending novel treatments is not uniformly defined.

### Minimally invasive procedures as an alternative to medical management for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117XMsn9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Data are reviewed relating to the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive transurethral microwave thermotherapy and medical management in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Recent evidence is summarized, indicating more pronounced long-term beneficial effects of microwave treatment. Alpha-blockade, however, offers the advantage of more rapid action than microwave treatment. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant alpha-blocker therapy can accelerate symptom and flow rate improvement in patients receiving microwave treatment. Compared with medical management, microwave treatment possesses greater versatility, allowing patients with severe baseline symptoms and small prostate sizes to be treated with a high probability of success.

### Landmarks in BPH — from aetiology to medical and surgical management [^113uWcTV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease, but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

### New medical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and future perspectives [^1156pU8K]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Historically, the standard medical treatment for LUTS in men with BPH included α1-antagonists, 5α-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapy. These agents remain the mainstay of BPH treatment today. Nonetheless, even with full dose treatment, some patients remain symptomatic or may experience BPH progression, defined as the onset of acute urinary retention (AUR), urinary infection (UI), or the need for BPH-related surgery. Additionally, the drugs routinely used in the management of LUTS carry potential adverse effects (AE), which may lead to non-compliance in patients.

Therefore, research is progressing to expand and optimize medical strategies in the management of BPH-related LUTS. Selective α1-antagonists, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, and anticholinergics have been tested and are part of our armamentarium for managing male LUTS. Practicing urologists should be well-acquainted with these agents, their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects.

Furthermore, our understanding of bladder and prostatic molecular anatomy is constantly growing, and new biomolecular targets are being identified and explored as potential candidates in BPH management. This systematic review aims to summarize the evidence regarding the new medical therapies currently available for BPH-related LUTS and to provide an overview of research and agents that may soon enter our everyday clinical practice.

### Prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease [^113gUSZM]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed the evidence that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive condition and that men at risk for BPH can be identified, treated, and protected to a meaningful extent regardless of symptom status.

- **Materials and methods**: The MEDLINE database was searched in four areas of interest relating to BPH, including: 1) progression of clinical manifestations with age, especially in regard to baseline symptom status; 2) the incidence of complications due to disease progression; 3) the use of predictive factors that may help identify men at risk for disease progression; and 4) the prevention of BPH with medical therapy.

- **Results**: Tissue changes in the prostate (BPH) are inevitable consequences of aging. However, BPH disease, which we define as a life-altering urinary condition requiring medical intervention, is predictable and preventable. BPH disease progression is associated with increasing prostate volume, decreasing urinary flow, and symptomatic deterioration, often to the point of major lifestyle interference and serious complications, such as acute urinary retention and the need for surgery. The risk of BPH disease progression was found to be directly related to prostate volume and its surrogate marker, serum prostate-specific antigen, after prostate cancer is excluded. Other factors, such as baseline symptoms and flow rate, were found to be less relevant compared to prostate-specific antigen.

### Eliciting preferences for drug treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112BzD8D]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

There are two main medical preparations available for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Choosing between an alpha-blocker and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor involves trade-offs between their attributes or characteristics. This study investigates the relative importance and trade-offs between the attributes of the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride and alpha-blockers in community-dwelling men using a validated technique.

A discrete choice experiment was administered to 211 men older than 40 years who were randomly selected from the general United Kingdom population. The attributes investigated in the discrete choice experiment included time to symptom improvement, sexual and nonsexual side effects, the risks of acute urinary retention (AUR) and surgery, cost, and prostate size decrease. Using regression analysis, the study estimated the relative importance of these attributes, the trade-offs that men are willing to make between these attributes, and the willingness to pay for each attribute.

All attributes were important to respondents. The most important attribute was side effects, with impotence being the least preferred side effect, followed by decreased libido and dizziness. Respondents were willing to wait 13, 2, and 8 months longer for symptom improvement in exchange for decreased prostate size, and reduced risks of AUR and surgery, respectively. Men reporting moderate symptoms were less concerned about sexual side effects, time to symptom improvement, and the risk of AUR compared with men reporting mild symptoms.

### The prostaglandin pathway is activated in patients who fail medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms [^1112tvXk]. The Prostate (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about how benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) develops and why patients respond differently to medical therapy designed to reduce lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial randomized men with symptoms of BPH and followed response to medical therapy for up to six years. Treatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α-blocker) reduced the risk of clinical progression, while men treated with combination therapy showed a 66% decrease in risk of progressive disease. However, medical therapies for BPH/LUTS are not effective in many patients. The reasons for nonresponse or loss of therapeutic response in the remaining patients over time are unknown. A better understanding of why patients fail to respond to medical therapy may have a major impact on developing new approaches for the medical treatment of BPH/LUTS. Prostaglandins (PG) act on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), where PGE 2 and PGF 2 elicit smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, we measured PG levels in the prostate tissue of BPH/LUTS patients to assess the possibility that this signaling pathway might explain the failure of medical therapy in BPH/LUTS patients.

- **Method**: Surgical BPH (S-BPH) was defined as benign prostatic tissue collected from the transition zone (TZ) of patients who failed medical therapy and underwent surgical intervention to relieve LUTS. Control tissue was termed Incidental BPH (I-BPH). I-BPH was TZ obtained from men undergoing radical prostatectomy for low-volume, low-grade prostate conditions.

### Lower urinary tract symptom: still too much focus on the prostate [^115FLN7v]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms have historically been managed in a prostate-centric fashion. Population studies highlighting the prevalence and significance of storage symptoms, including nocturia, have led to a shift in the way men with lower urinary tract symptoms are assessed and managed. This review examines recent guidelines and publications that have addressed this change in approach.

- **Recent findings**: A new β-3 adrenoreceptor agonist has demonstrated significant improvement in storage symptoms and appears to be well tolerated.

- **Summary**: We support a continued move towards a patient-focused management approach using the guidelines.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms in men [^112KBL92]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a highly prevalent and costly condition that affects older men worldwide. Many affected men develop lower urinary tract symptoms, which can negatively impact their quality of life. In the past, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was the mainstay of treatment. However, several efficacious drug treatments have been developed, transforming BPH from an acute surgical condition to a chronic medical condition. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that α adrenoceptor antagonists can significantly ameliorate lower urinary tract symptoms.

Moreover, 5α reductase inhibitors, alone or in combination with an α adrenoceptor antagonist, can reverse the natural course of BPH, reducing the risk of urinary retention and the need for surgical intervention. Newer medical regimens, including the use of antimuscarinic agents and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, have shown promise in men with predominantly storage symptoms and concomitant erectile dysfunction, respectively. For men who do not adequately respond to conservative measures or pharmacotherapy, minimally invasive surgical techniques such as transurethral needle ablation, microwave thermotherapy, and prostatic urethral lift may be beneficial, although they lack the durability of TURP. Various laser procedures have also been introduced, and their improved hemostatic properties reduce many of the complications associated with traditional surgery.
