rest of problem but all of it was related to oral mucosa, and they said she recently had
Hematopoietic cell transplantation what is best treatment
a. antibiotic b. Antifungal mouthwash c. Corticosteroids mouth wash

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mouthwash therapy is best for a post–hematopoietic cell transplant patient with gingival inflammation and multiple oral ulcers, choosing among antibiotics, antifungal, or corticosteroid rinses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely etiologies in this immunocompromised context. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for oral chronic graft-versus-host disease and related inflammatory oral lesions. Next, I will examine the evidence for each rinse option and its role in this scenario. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-aware recommendation and confirm adjunctive measures and follow-up needs [^116kn6RQ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely diagnoses. Post-transplant oral mucosal disease often reflects chronic graft-versus-host disease, which frequently manifests with gingival inflammation, desquamative gingivitis, and painful erosive or ulcerative lesions; topical corticosteroids are first-line for oral cGVHD when disease is limited to the mouth or as an adjunct to systemic therapy, so I should keep cGVHD high on the list [^116F14Ku] [^1129H4tf]. Wait, let me verify the differential: aphthous-like ulcers, drug-induced stomatitis, and secondary infections can mimic or complicate cGVHD, but in the absence of red flags for infection and given the gingival involvement, cGVHD remains the leading consideration here [^notfound].

> Next, I should review guideline direction before jumping to a specific rinse. The MASCC/ISOO cGVHD statement explicitly recommends topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy for oral cGVHD, with selection of rinse versus gel based on lesion distribution and severity; for ulcerative/erosive disease, ultra-potent agents are preferred, and budesonide rinses are reasonable when minimizing systemic absorption is a priority [^1129H4tf]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: calcineurin inhibitors are second-line when steroids are insufficient, but they are not the initial choice here [^116kn6RQ].

> I will now examine the corticosteroid rinse option. High-quality guidance supports dexamethasone 0.1–0.5 mg/mL rinses (for example, 5–10 mL swished for 1–2 minutes then expectorated, up to several times daily), with prednisolone or budesonide alternatives as per availability and tolerance; this aligns with transplant and oncology supportive care practices that routinely use steroid rinses for immunotherapy- or mTOR inhibitor–associated stomatitis as well, reinforcing topical steroid efficacy in inflammatory oral lesions in immunocompromised hosts [^113uQsbr] [^112DFVGT] [^116wgKxD]. Let me double-check the strength of evidence: randomized and prospective data show steroid rinses reduce incidence and severity of mTOR inhibitor–associated stomatitis, and meta-analytic data support anti-inflammatory mouthwashes reducing mucositis burden, which strengthens the case for steroid rinses in this setting [^115bot7L] [^116ujeC6].

> Now, I need to check the role of antifungal rinses. Secondary candidiasis is common in cGVHD with hyposalivation and after topical steroids, so nystatin or other topical antifungals are often used as prophylaxis or treatment, but they are adjunctive rather than primary therapy for the inflammatory lesions themselves; importantly, they should be timed after steroid rinses to avoid washout and to reduce steroid exposure to the antifungal agent [^114dfdgu] [^1139qTob]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought an antifungal rinse might be first-line because of the immunocompromised state, but that would treat infection, not the underlying inflammatory cGVHD mucositis; I should correct that and position antifungals as supportive only when indicated by clinical or culture evidence of candidiasis or as prophylaxis with steroid rinses [^114dfdgu].

> Let me consider antibiotic rinses. Tetracycline or other antibiotic mouthwashes can be used for recurrent aphthous ulcers and may offer analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but they do not address the T-cell–mediated pathophysiology of cGVHD and are not recommended as first-line for cGVHD mucositis; they may be considered for aphthous-like disease or when infection risk is high, yet here the clinical picture fits cGVHD better than isolated aphthae [^115zppZ3] [^1129H4tf]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline elevates antibiotics to first-line for cGVHD oral disease; I do not see such recommendations, reinforcing that antibiotics are not the best initial therapy in this case [^1129H4tf].

> I should confirm safety and practicalities. Topical steroid rinses have minimal systemic absorption but can predispose to oral candidiasis, so concurrent antifungal prophylaxis and careful oral hygiene are prudent; patients should be counseled on technique, frequency, and the need to spit, not swallow, the rinse, and clinicians should monitor for response and adverse effects over time [^112DFVGT] [^114dfdgu]. Let me reconsider dosing frequency: for active ulcerative disease, multiple daily rinses are reasonable initially, with taper as symptoms improve, consistent with cGVHD guidance and oncology supportive care protocols [^113uQsbr] [^112DFVGT].

> Putting this together, the best initial treatment is a corticosteroid-containing mouthwash, with dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL rinse as a practical first choice used several times daily, while reserving antifungal rinses for prophylaxis or treatment of candidiasis and avoiding antibiotics unless there is a compelling infectious indication; this aligns with cGVHD-first-line guidance and broader supportive care evidence in transplant and oncology populations [^1129H4tf] [^113uQsbr] [^116ujeC6]. I should double-check that no competing option supersedes this in the provided evidence; none do for this clinical scenario, confirming the recommendation [^116F14Ku].

> Final answer: C. Corticosteroid mouthwash, with dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL rinse as a representative regimen, is the best initial therapy for gingival inflammation and oral ulcers after hematopoietic cell transplantation, given the high likelihood of oral cGVHD and the first-line role of topical corticosteroids in this setting [^1129H4tf] [^113uQsbr].

---

The best treatment for oral mucosal inflammation and ulcers after hematopoietic cell transplantation is a **topical corticosteroid mouthwash** (e.g. dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL, 10 mL swish for 1–2 minutes, then spit, four times daily) [^1139qTob] [^1129H4tf] as first-line therapy for oral chronic GVHD and inflammatory mucositis [^116F14Ku]. Antifungal mouthwash is used only if **candidiasis is confirmed or strongly suspected** [^114dfdgu], and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a **bacterial superinfection** [^1129H4tf]. Supportive care includes bland rinses, topical analgesics, and strict oral hygiene; monitor for secondary infection and adjust therapy based on response [^112Dn5qu].

---

## Pathophysiology of oral mucosal inflammation and ulcers post-HCT

Oral mucosal inflammation and ulcers after HCT arise from **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Acute mucositis**: chemotherapy/radiation-induced epithelial injury with inflammation, pain, and secondary infection risk [^116tHioB].

- **Chronic GVHD**: immune-mediated inflammation, fibrosis, and xerostomia causing pain, dysphagia, and secondary infections [^116kn6RQ].

- **Secondary infections**: candidiasis, HSV, and bacterial superinfections are common due to immunosuppression [^notfound].

---

## Evidence-based treatment options

### Topical corticosteroid mouthwash

- **First-line therapy**: topical corticosteroids are recommended for oral cGVHD and inflammatory mucositis [^1129H4tf] [^116F14Ku] [^1146DYwT].

- **Clinical evidence**: dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL (10 mL, swish 1–2 minutes, then spit, four times daily) reduces pain, inflammation, and ulcer size [^1139qTob].

- **Safety**: minimal systemic absorption; monitor for oral candidiasis and use antifungal prophylaxis as needed [^1129H4tf] [^114dfdgu].

---

### Antifungal mouthwash

Use antifungal mouthwash (e.g. nystatin, clotrimazole, fluconazole) when **candidiasis is confirmed or strongly suspected** [^114dfdgu]. It is effective for candidiasis but does not treat inflammatory mucositis or GVHD [^1129H4tf].

---

### Antibiotic mouthwash

Antibiotic mouthwash is reserved for **bacterial superinfection**; it is not first-line for sterile inflammatory mucositis or GVHD [^1129H4tf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical corticosteroid mouthwash | - Oral cGVHD <br/> - Inflammatory mucositis | First-line therapy [^1129H4tf] [^116F14Ku] |
| Antifungal mouthwash | Confirmed or suspected candidiasis | Use as indicated [^114dfdgu] |
| Antibiotic mouthwash | Bacterial superinfection | Use as indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Supportive care and adjunctive therapies

- **Bland rinses**: saline or bicarbonate rinses reduce discomfort and maintain oral hygiene [^112Dn5qu].

- **Topical analgesics**: lidocaine or doxepin rinses provide pain relief and improve oral intake [^117DeahA].

- **Oral hygiene**: soft toothbrush, non-alcoholic mouthwash, and regular dental follow-up are essential [^1139qTob].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Topical corticosteroids**: risk of secondary candidiasis; monitor and treat promptly [^114dfdgu].

- **Antifungal mouthwash**: minimal risks; monitor for allergic reactions.

- **Antibiotic mouthwash**: risk of resistance, dysgeusia, and gastrointestinal upset; use selectively.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly assess **pain, oral intake, and lesion response** to guide therapy adjustments [^116kn6RQ]. Maintain vigilance for secondary infections and treat promptly [^114dfdgu]. Provide ongoing patient education on oral hygiene, dietary modifications, and symptom management [^112Dn5qu].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Topical corticosteroid mouthwash is the **preferred initial treatment** for oral mucosal inflammation and ulcers after HCT, with antifungal and antibiotic mouthwashes reserved for confirmed infections or bacterial superinfection. This approach balances efficacy, safety, and guideline support, with supportive care to optimize comfort and healing.

### Aphthous ulcers (recurrent) [^115zppZ3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter, that heal after 5–14 days without scarring. The causes are unknown, but risks of recurrence may decrease if the person gives up smoking. Local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 1 cm in diameter, and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), carbenoxolone mouthwash, chlorhexidine (and similar agents), corticosteroids (topical), and tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash.

### Oral ulcerations in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient [^114Wkhij]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best initial management of the patient?
A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose
C. "Miracle Mouthwash" (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus
D. Biopsy
E. Observation

Answers:

A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage – Correct. Topical corticosteroids provide relief of mIAS, specifically reducing associated pain and lesion duration. However, the causative agent of the oral ulcerations must also be addressed. Since post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy is still required, decreasing sirolimus dose or switching to a different GVHD prophylactic agent is most appropriate. Our patient's oral ulcerations resolved following sirolimus discontinuation recommended by her hematologist.
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose – Incorrect. Analgesics may be useful adjuvants in some cases; however, analgesics do not address the underlying etiology of the mucosal lesions in this patient.
C. "Miracle Mouthwash" (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus – Incorrect. This solution has been shown to be ineffective in improving the frequency or severity of sirolimus ulcerations as it provides only brief symptomatic relief. Additionally, it would be inappropriate to discontinue transplant GVHD prophylaxis without consulting the prescribing hematologist.
D. Biopsy – Incorrect. mIAS is a clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is not warranted, and there is a paucity of literature regarding specific histopathologic features of mIAS. One in vitro study demonstrated increased epithelial surface disruption, vacuole formation, and early dysplastic changes when oral mucosa was incubated in everolimus compared to control media.
E. Observation – Incorrect. The patient has pain affecting oral intake and quality of life; therefore, intervention is necessary. Use of topical corticosteroids and management of sirolimus therapy address both symptoms and etiology of the lesions. On literature review, permanent resolution of mIAS does not occur while the inciting dose of sirolimus is continued.

### US expert Delphi consensus on the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan [^116wgKxD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

There is currently no Dato-DXd-specific data regarding the use of dexamethasone or steroid-containing mouthwashes. One expert expressed hesitation in recommending a steroid-containing mouthwash without clinical data. Despite similar ulcerative presentation, everolimus and Dato-DXd likely trigger stomatitis through distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms. Experts who have more experience with Dato-DXd acknowledged this data gap during the consensus meeting. Despite this, they agreed that the benefits of dexamethasone/steroid-containing mouthwashes outweigh the risks for patients receiving Dato-DXd. Thus, a consensus was reached to strongly suggest that patients use a steroid-containing mouthwash by swishing and spitting three to four times daily to prevent and manage stomatitis, with dexamethasone being the preferred corticosteroid. Prospective empirical evidence is needed to confirm clinical management strategies, and the optimal dosing regimen of dexamethasone mouthwash for Dato-DXd patients is being evaluated.

Some experts reported success with using "magic mouthwash" to treat patients. These mouthwashes contain different combinations of steroids, antihistamines, analgesics, antibiotics, and antifungals. However, "magic mouthwashes" vary between institutions, and their formulations are not standardized. This makes it challenging to derive clinically useful information presenting a barrier to recommending "magic mouthwashes" in formal guidelines.

Consensus was achieved amongst experts for the use of steroid-containing mouth rinses. Despite not being currently included in guidelines for the treatment of oral mucositis secondary to cancer therapy, steroid-containing mouth rinses have been proven effective and safe in patients with oral mucositis on other cancer therapies. Future and/or ongoing studies are expected to better inform this practice moving forward.

Rationale for the use of steroid-containing mouthwash and cryotherapy for stomatitis prophylaxis

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society for Oral Oncology evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend a range of measures for the management of stomatitis. A basic oral care plan, incorporating patient education and multi-agent combination oral care, is still considered best practice. A previous study investigating the use of professional oral care to prevent stomatitis in patients receiving everolimus and exemestane found that professional oral care reduced the incidence and severity of stomatitis. In addition, the use of supplementary interventions such as oral cryotherapy are recommended for certain patients with stomatitis.

Prior to clinical trials assessing the use of steroid-containing mouthwash in the management or prophylaxis of drug-induced stomatitis in patients with cancer, information around the use of steroid treatment for stomatitis was limited to those used to treat aphthous ulcers. The efficacy of topical corticosteroids in treating recurrent aphthous ulcers and stomatitis is potentially due to decreased lymphocyte production and the underlying inflammatory response. The SWISH study was a US-based, phase II, open-label trial that assessed the use of dexamethasone mouthwash (0.5 mg/5 mL oral solution) to prevent stomatitis in patients with HR+/HER2− BC who received everolimus and exemestane. Compared with patients who received everolimus plus exemestane in the multicenter, phase III BOLERO-2 study, the use of dexamethasone mouthwash reduced the proportion of any-grade and grade ≥ 2 stomatitis by 61% and 91%, respectively, after 8 weeks.

### Anti-inflammatory mouthwashes for the prevention of oral mucositis in cancer therapy: an integrative review and meta-analysis [^116ujeC6]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Mucositis is severely painful and often reported as one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer therapy; it is a significant threat to quality of life as well as life itself. Anti-inflammatory agents may modulate physiologic mechanisms that perpetuate mucositis and be useful in prevention efforts. Because systemic anti-inflammatory agents are not appropriate for many patients, locally acting agents (mouthwashes) may be more feasible for use. This review and meta-analysis evaluates the role that anti-inflammatory mouthwashes have in preventing or reducing oral mucositis associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies evaluating the efficacy of anti-inflammatory mouthwashes to prevent therapy-associated mucositis. Meta-analysis was conducted to determine efficacy in preventing any mucositis and dose-limiting mucositis.

Results

Eight peer-reviewed publications were identified; corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory mouthwashes are effective in reducing overall incidence of mucositis and are associated with lower severity of mucositis. Meta-analysis reveals significant reduction in symptomatic mucositis incidence (OR 6.00, 95% CI 4.39–8.20, p < 0.0001) and reduction of dose-limiting mucositis (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.07–4.28, p = 0.032).

Conclusion

Mouthwashes containing anti-inflammatory agents are a potential effective means to prevent or reduce mucositis associated with cancer therapy. There are limited adverse effects from these agents, and adherence is high, indicating safety and feasibility of use. Anti-inflammatory mouthwashes should be considered for supportive care in persons at risk for mucositis and must be further evaluated to investigate efficacy across multiple chemotherapy agents, adverse effects, and impacts on symptoms, pain, and quality of life.

These guidelines reflect those that were in place in the clinical development program from December 5, 2022, and are continually being updated with the emergence of new safety data. a For example, Dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL oral solution (10 mL, 4 times per day, swish for 1–2 minutes then spit out). Similar mouthwash regimens using an alternative steroid can be used as advocated by institutional/local guidelines. Oral nystatin suspension or other topical antifungal agents can be used ≤ 15 minutes after the steroid-containing mouthwash as advocated by institutional/local guidelines. b In the absence of a steroid-containing mouthwash, daily use of an inert, bland mouthwash is acceptable. For example, non-alcoholic and/or bicarbonate-containing mouthwash (4–6 times per day). c Doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%. Abbreviations: Dato-DXd, datopotamab deruxtecan.

### Aphthous ulcers (recurrent) [^115AZoga]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 10 mm in diameter that heal after 7 to 10 days without scarring. The causes are unknown but local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 10 mm in diameter and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected topical treatments for recurrent idiopathic aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), corticosteroids (topical), tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash, and topical antiseptic agents (chlorhexidine and similar agents).

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^116vYTCK]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Prophylactic, monitoring, and management strategies for OM/S associated with Dato-DXd therapy. Abbreviation: Dato-DXd, datopotamab deruxtecan.

We recommend early implementation of an oral care plan on day 1, before the first infusion of Dato-DXd (Figure 1), including use of prophylactic nonalcoholic corticosteroid-­containing mouthwash for patients prescribed Dato-DXd, to prevent development of OM/S or lessen severity. The clinical trial protocols recommended starting this mouthwash (eg, dexamethasone oral solution 0.1 mg/mL or an alternative corticosteroid-containing mouthwash advocated by institutional/local guidelines) with Dato-DXd and continuing throughout treatment. Oral thrush is a common side effect of dexamethasone mouthwash. Thus, according to clinical trial protocols, nystatin oral suspension or other topical antifungal agents may be considered ≥ 15 minutes after the corticosteroid-containing mouthwash, according to clinician preference and based on institutional/local guidelines. If a dexamethasone mouthwash (0.1 mg/mL) is unavailable, the clinical trial protocols suggest providers consider a dexamethasone mouthwash compounded at the pharmacy. If that too is unavailable, consider an alternative corticosteroid-based mouthwash available at the pharmacy. If none of the above are available, consider a bland, nonsteroid, nonalcoholic, and/or bicarbonate-­containing mouthwash prophylactically 4–6 times daily. Our clinical decision-making is supported by evidence that prophylactic use of a nonalcoholic dexamethasone oral solution can reduce the incidence and severity of OM/S related to other anticancer agents. An additional prophylactic mouthwash to consider is a salt water and/or bicarbonate rinse before the dexamethasone mouthwash. The at-home formula is a mix of 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate and 1 teaspoon of salt in 4 cups of water.

Prophylaxis and management of Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis

Current clinical recommendations for prophylaxis of Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis

The current prophylaxis guidelines for Dato-DXd-induced stomatitis, based on clinical trial experience, are summarized in Figure 2 (Step 1). These guidelines have evolved with ongoing clinical trial experience, and the history of updates to these guidelines have been reported separately. Prior to starting Dato-DXd treatment, current recommendations are for patients to initiate a prophylactic daily oral care plan with education about the importance of oral hygiene and hydration, and strongly recommend prophylactic utilization of a steroid-containing mouthwash. Oral care plan recommendations include the following: gentle brushing of teeth after meals and before bed using a soft toothbrush and bland fluoride-containing toothpaste, flossing daily unless it causes pain or bleeding, and use of a steroid-containing mouthwash daily (if available) while on treatment with Dato-DXd. For example, dexamethasone oral solution 0.1 mg/mL (10 mL, 4 times daily, swish for 1–2 minutes then spit out), or a similar mouthwash regimen using an alternative steroid advocated by institutional/local clinical practice guidelines is highly recommended; an oral nystatin suspension, or other topical antifungal agents, may be considered ≥ 15 minutes after the steroid-containing mouthwash. The recommendation for care in countries with limited access to steroid-containing mouthwash is to use a bland non-alcoholic and/or bicarbonate-containing mouthwash (4–6 times per day). Additionally, prophylactic cryotherapy (ice chips or ice water held in the mouth throughout the infusion) can be considered.

### Patient-reported side effects, concerns and adherence to corticosteroid treatment for asthma, and comparison with physician estimates of side-effect prevalence: a UK-wide, cross-sectional study [^1141TXCJ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Implications for future research, policy and practice

Our findings are immediately relevant to asthma-treating clinicians and the design of interventions to promote adherence to corticosteroids. Eliciting and addressing patients' concerns about their oral and inhaled corticosteroids may be an economical and clinically relevant way to facilitate adherence to prescriptions for OCS and ICS and thereby improve asthma control. This approach has previously been piloted in telephone-based medicines support intervention in which a pharmacist telephoned patients to elicit and address perceptual barriers and practical problems within 10 days of receiving new medicine. Patients receiving the intervention had fewer concerns, fewer medication problems and higher reported adherence than standard care controls. Randomised controlled trials to explore the efficacy of this approach in long-term illnesses are ongoing.

Clinicians should encourage patients to report new symptoms that they attribute to corticosteroids so that the likely cause, duration and possible treatment can be discussed. Common local side effects of ICS may be treated or prevented. For example, sore throat can be soothed by drinking fluids, gargling with warm salty water, lozenges or anaesthetic throat sprays, and oral thrush could be treated with mouthwashes or prevented by the use of a spacer device and mouth rinses with water. In cases in which it is not possible to prevent or treat side effects, clinicians could provide patients with accurate information about the risk of side effects, explore the likely causes of symptoms, and provide information on what to do if the patient experiences them, while emphasising the need for continued adherence. Given that there are differences between different inhalers with regard to their side-effect profiles, switching to a different type of ICS may be beneficial. Good basics in asthma management, such as effective management of comorbidities, ensuring that the patient learns and uses a good inhaler technique and gains control of symptoms with better adherence, would all reduce the need for the use of OCS.

Further studies are required to explore the direction of relationships between concerns about corticosteroids, experience of side effects and adherence, and to explore differences between patient and clinician perceptions of corticosteroids using clinician–patient dyads.

Conclusions

This preliminary study identified a higher-than-expected frequency of side effects from ICS and OCS, and indicated that there may be disconnects between patient experiences of side effects and awareness of side effects among clinicians. Side effects were associated with strong concerns about corticosteroids, which, in turn, were associated with non-adherence. These findings have implications for the design of interventions to support patients, improve treatment experiences and enhance asthma control.

### Evaluation of miracle mouthwash plus hydrocortisone versus prednisolone mouth rinses as prophylaxis for everolimus-associated stomatitis: a randomized phase II study [^115bot7L]. The Oncologist (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS) is a frequent adverse event (AE) associated with mTOR inhibitor therapy and can impact treatment adherence. The objectives are to evaluate two steroid-based mouthrinses for preventing/ameliorating mIAS in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated with everolimus.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, randomized phase II study enrolled 100 postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive MBC within the US Oncology Network who were initiating therapy with an aromatase inhibitor + everolimus (AIE; 10mg/day). Patients were randomized to prophylactic therapy with one of two oral rinses (Arm 1: Miracle Mouthwash [MMW] 480mL recipe: 320mL oral Benadryl [diphenhydramine; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA], 2g tetracycline, 80mg hydrocortisone, 40mL nystatin suspension, water; or Arm 2: prednisolone [P] 15mg/5mL oral solution, 1.8% alcohol). Patients were instructed to swish/expectorate 10mL of the assigned rinse for 1–2minutes four times daily starting with day 1 of AIE treatment, for the first 12weeks.

Results

A total of 100 patients received treatment (49 MMW; 51 P). The incidence of stomatitis/oral AEs during the first 12weeks was 35% (n = 17/49) and 37% (19/51) in the MMW and P arms, respectively. The incidence of grade 2 oral AEs was 14% (7/49) and 12% (6/51) with MMW or P, respectively. There were two grade 3 oral AEs (MMW arm) and no grade 4 events. There was one everolimus dose reduction (MMW) and six dose delays (four MMW, two P) and one dose reduction + delay (MMW) during the first 12weeks of treatment. No patients stopped steroid mouthwash therapy because of rinse-related toxicity.

Conclusion

Prophylactic use of steroid-containing oral rinses can prevent/ameliorate mIAS in patients with MBC treated with AIE. MMW+hydrocortisone is an affordable option, as is dexamethasone oral rinse.

Implications For Practice

This prospective phase-II study showed that two steroid-containing mouthrinses substantially reduced incidences of all-grade and grade ≥ 2 stomatitis and related oral adverse events (AEs), and the number of everolimus dose-delays and/or dose-reduction in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients receiving everolimus treatment plus an aromatase inhibitor. Both oral rinses were well tolerated and demonstrated similar efficacy. Prophylactic use of steroid mouth rinse provides a cost-effective option that substantially decreases the incidence and severity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor-associated stomatitis and related oral AEs as well as the need for dose modification in MBC patients undergoing treatment with an mTOR inhibitor.

### Inavolisib (Itovebi) [^115An9PK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Before initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG), HbA1Clevels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, or in patients who experience hyperglycemia after initiating treatment with ITOVEBI, monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels once every 3 days for the first week (Day 1 to 7), then once every week for the next 3 weeks (Day 8 to 28), then once every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks, then once every 4 weeks thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1Cevery 3 months and as clinically indicated.

Manage hyperglycemia with anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. During treatment with anti-hyperglycemic medication, continue monitoring fasting glucose levels. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

Consider consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of hyperglycemia, and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, ITOVEBI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2	Stomatitis

Severe stomatitis can occur in patients treated with ITOVEBI.

Stomatitis occurred in 51% of patients treated with ITOVEBI in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant, including Grade 3 events in 6% of patients. The median time to first onset was 13 days (range: 1 to 610 days).

Stomatitis led to interruption of ITOVEBI in 10%, to dose reduction in 3.7%, and to discontinuation of ITOVEBI in 0.6% of patients.

In patients who received ITOVEBI in combination with palbociclib and fulvestrant, 38% used a mouthwash containing corticosteroid for management or prophylaxis of stomatitis.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue ITOVEBI based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^117DeahA]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

If OM/S is suspected, start by ruling out other causes (eg, oral thrush, herpetic lesions) and treat accordingly (eg, oral nystatin for oral thrush). If OM/S is confirmed, the clinical trial protocols suggested increasing the frequency of bland mouth rinses up to every hour, if necessary and applicable, and provide adequate topical pain management (eg, doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%). In addition to continuing prophylactic dexamethasone mouthwash or alternative, to temporarily help with oral pain so patients can eat and drink more comfortably, we consider prescribing a lidocaine-based mouthwash, such as one consisting of diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and aluminum-magnesium hydroxide to be used 15–20 minutes before eating meals. We also may consider a topical clobetasol gel dabbed on mouth sores to be applied twice daily until improved and 3 times weekly until resolution. The mouth sores should be dried with gauze before applying the clobetasol gel. If severe OM/S occurs (grade ≥ 3), and it cannot be resolved topically or with dose holds or reductions, we also had significant success with using a short course of oral corticosteroids, as per institutional guidelines. We recommend patients drink smoothies, shakes, and other cold beverages to keep well hydrated and/or supplemental caloric drinks to help with oral AEs. We also counsel our patients to avoid crunchy, spicy, hot, and citrus/acidic foods. Additionally, patients should be educated to avoid tobacco and alcohol consumption.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^111LkANZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Oral Mucosal Toxicities

Oral Mucosal Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitor-Associated Stomatitis

Oral mucositis is the most frequent dose-limiting toxicity observed with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus). It is characterized by aphthous-like lesions which are very different from the ones induced by chemo- and radiotherapy. These single or multiple well-circumscribed, round, superficial, painful ulcers are solely localized in the non-keratinized mucosa and occasionally surrounded by an erythematous halo. mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis occurs in about 30% of patients treated with monotherapy, mostly within the first 8 weeks of treatment; 5% are grade ≥ 3 toxicities. In addition, although usually self-limited, lesions can be very painful.

Early patient education is critical to prevent repeated trauma and avoid aggressive treatment modalities to the oral mucosa. Close follow-up by an odontologist is also essential. Early management consists of the promotion of good oral hygiene, including mouth washing with normal saline, sterile water, or sodium bicarbonate. A wide range of treatments can also be used, including low-level laser therapy, also known as soft laser therapy, pain management, and morphine mouthwash, but the first line of therapy should include topical corticosteroids. The SWISH trial demonstrated the efficacy of topical corticosteroids in post-menopausal women treated with everolimus and exemestane who prophylactically used dexamethasone-based mouthwash starting on the first day of treatment. After 8 weeks, the incidence of grade ≥ 2 stomatitis was only 2% compared with 33% in the historical BOLERO-2 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2) study (p < 0.0001), with no grade 3 toxicity.

### The effect of budesonide mouthwash on oral chronic graft versus host disease [^115SDhNr]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

Oral chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) is common and a major cause of morbidity and loss of quality of life in long term survivors. Cyclosporine with prednisone remains the first line therapy for oral manifestations of cGVHD. However, even with routine administration of systemic agents, many patients with oral manifestations of cGVHD do not have resolution of their disease and may benefit from incorporation of local therapy. Budesonide is a highly potent steroid which has minimal systemic side effects and being used for oral cGVHD. We designed a retrospective study to compare treatment results of patients with oral cGVHD who received topical budesonide in addition to systemic therapy that consists of combined prednisone and cyclosporine (Group A, n = 12), with the treatment results of patients who were administered the same systemic therapy alone (Group B, n = 11) to determine whether budesonide mouthwash had any advantage on response rates. Three mg topical budesonide/10 mL saline was used 3–4 times a day for up to 6 months in group A. Diagnosis, clinical staging, and treatment response scoring for cGVHD were performed according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria. At the baseline examination, there were no statistically significant differences in terms of median oral cGVHD examination scores between two groups. After treatment, there was statistically significant decrease in median oral cGVHD examination scores compared to baseline (P < 0.001 and 0.021), and significant differences were found between two groups (P < 0.032). Overall response rate was 83% and 36% for group A and B, respectively (P = 0.036). However, no statistically significant differences were found between median pain scores of two groups before and after treatment (P = 0.740 and P = 0.091). No major systemic side effects and oral candidiasis were observed in two groups of patients. We concluded that topical budesonide might be added to systemic therapy to obtain better response rates in patients with oral cGHVD.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan (Datroway) [^1145g2Ls]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Stomatitis

DATROWAY can cause stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], stomatitis occurred in 63% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including 8% of patients with Grade 3 events and one patient with a Grade 4 reaction. The median time to first onset of stomatitis was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 months to 18.6 months). Stomatitis led to dosage interruption in 6% of patients, dosage reductions in 11% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 0.5% of patients.

In patients who received DATROWAY in TROPION-Breast01, 39% used a mouthwash containing corticosteroid for management or prophylaxis of stomatitis/oral mucositis at any time during the treatment.

Advise patients to use a steroid-containing mouthwash for prophylaxis and treatment of stomatitis. Instruct the patient to hold ice chips or ice water in the mouth throughout the infusion of DATROWAY.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. If stomatitis occurs, increase the frequency of mouthwash and administer other topical treatments as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue DATROWAY [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd [see Description (11)], is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^111B7WbW]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Current clinical recommendations for managing Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis

Current management guidelines for Dato-DXd-induced stomatitis are summarized in Figure 2 (Step 3). These include increased use of a bland non-alcoholic and/or bicarbonate-containing mouthwash (up to every hour) and suitable pain management based on local/institutional clinical practice guidelines (eg, doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%). If any oral pain, inflammation, and/or ulceration is experienced, then a steroid-containing mouth rinse 4 times daily (eg, dexamethasone 0.1 mg/mL, 10.0 mL, swish for 1–2 minutes then spit out, or local alternative) should be considered if not already in use. An oral nystatin suspension or topical antifungal agent may also be considered ≥ 15 minutes post steroid-containing rinse. If events are severe or persist, it is recommended to refer to a dentist, oral surgeon, or dermatologist based on local practice patterns.

The guidelines for grade 1 stomatitis events are to maintain the dose of Dato-DXd and optimize the aforementioned prophylactic and supportive medications. Grade 2 guidelines involve considering a dose delay or reduction if clinically indicated and optimizing prophylactic and supportive medications as above. For grade 3 events, if prophylaxis and supportive medications have not yet been optimized, guidance is to delay the dose until resolved to grade ≤ 1 or baseline, optimize medications, and then maintain the dose. If prophylaxis and supportive medications have already been optimized, the guidance is to delay the dose until resolved to grade ≤ 1 or baseline, then reduce the dose by 1 level. Grade 4 guidelines are to discontinue the patient from the study treatment.

### Management of adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treated with everolimus: observations from a phase III clinical trial [^112Dn5qu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Management recommendations

Because stomatitis is a common AE (Table 1) experienced by patients treated with everolimus, prophylactic treatment and early recognition of this AE is highly important. Early and active management includes the promotion of good oral hygiene: consistent, regular, and thorough brushing with a soft toothbrush that is changed on a regular basis; daily flossing; frequent rinsing with bland rinses such as sterile water, normal saline, or sodium bicarbonate; and use of oral moisturizers.

Based on the clinical trial experience with patients treated with everolimus, various management strategies depending on the grade of stomatitis observed are recommended (Table 2). The prescribing information for everolimus specifically recommends that rinse formulations that contain alcohol should be avoided. The use of toothpastes that are strong-flavored and that contain sodium lauryl sulfate are not advised; milder, sodium lauryl sulfate-free toothpaste (e.g. children's flavors) should be used instead. Overall, oncology nurses should work to promote an oral program that addresses basic oral needs to help reduce the amount of microbial flora, reduce pain and bleeding, and prevent infection. Patients also should be advised to avoid acidic, spicy, and hard or crunchy foods and to consume foods that are tepid rather than hot in temperature to prevent the potential for mechanical injury.

Table 2
Recommended clinical management strategy: stomatitis

Early recognition and immediate effective treatment of stomatitis is essential to reduce the number and severity of ulcers. Although experience in managing everolimus-associated stomatitis is limited, it is recommended that topical corticosteroids and mouthwashes be used, similar to those managed with chemotherapy induced stomatitis. Consistently, standard treatment options include topical high-potency corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, 0.1 mg/mL; clobetasol gel, 0.05%), topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. amlexanox, 5% oral paste), and topical anesthetics ("miracle" or "magic" mouthwashes typically containing viscous lidocaine, diphenhydramine, and an antacid such as aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide), and nonimidazole antifungals also may be appropriate for some patients. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives should be avoided in patients with stomatitis.-Lysine 500 mg/day orally, originally used for recurrence of herpes simplex infections, may also be beneficial in patients with recurring oral ulcers.

### Erythema multiforme [^116QoMnu]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of first acute EM episode

The mainstay of therapy involves identifying and treating the causative agent, if possible as well as providing supportive care to the disease, prevent complications and mucosal sequelae. Mucosal pain, food intake, weight loss and other systemic symptoms should be evaluated to assess the need for hospitalization. There are no validated tools specific for EM but the general tools to measure pain like the numeric rating scale and food intake can be used for follow-up and for research purposes (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Sugg ested tools to measure pain and food intake in EM.

Supportive care and symptom control

There is no consensus on supportive care in EM mucosal lesions. Due to the similarities of the mucosal lesions and functional consequences in SJS/TEN and EM, supportive care would be comparable. The standard-of-care treatment firstly relies on: analgesics, including opioids, antipyretics, antiseptics, and mucous membrane care. Vaseline or other moisturizing ointment should be applied twice a day on skin lesions. Topical corticosteroids may also be considered to control the skin lesions.

The symptomatic treatment of mucous membranes consists of antiseptic and analgesic mouthwashes composed of chlorhexidine or with corticosteroids, mycostatin, lidocaine and bicarbonate mouthwashes every 4 h, and lidocaine gel before meals for the oral mucosae, artificial tears without preservative, and vitamin A ointment for the eyes; Vaseline for the genital membranes. If the patient presents with severe pain, opioids can be prescribed and if oral intake is severely affected, diet adapted to the ability to eat/drink, hydration with a gastric feeding tube if needed.

The use of Systemic Corticosteroid (SCS) during the established phase of severe EM remains a topic of debate and lacks standardized guidelines. Most current studies are retrospective and rely on small cohorts or case reports. They would have a potential interest in alleviating pain with quicker symptom control in severe EM. We recently conducted a multicenter retrospective national study showing that in routine practice, SCS were prescribed for 15.5% of hospitalized patients with severe EM with doses ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day with a rapidly decreasing dosage over 10–15 days. However, because of the retrospective design of the study, we failed to strongly demonstrate the benefit of SCS in reducing the length of hospital stay, control of pain or impaired food intake. To properly evaluate the benefits of SCS in this disease and provide robust guidance to clinicians, an academic randomized controlled trial is currently planned.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^114KTJuf]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Dry mouth and sicca syndrome

Dry mouth (or xerostomia) may occur as a separate irAE, or it may be a symptom of another irAE such as ICI-induced sicca syndrome. Dry mouth may also be linked to infections such as oral candidiasis — this is of particular concern in patients treated with ICIs, since oral corticosteroid use (commonly used to combat some ICI toxicities) is a risk factor for oral candidiasis. Dry mouth may be the cause of complications including infection and dental pathologies, including the loss of teeth, in severe cases of sicca syndrome. For this reason, it is important to account for the possibility of infection during diagnosis and monitoring. A systematic review determined that many clinical trials did not report the overall incidence of dry mouth, but that incidence varies from 3%–24% depending on the study. For initial management of dry mouth or painful sores, oral rinses with doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash (sometimes called 'magic mouthwash') have been shown to reduce radiotherapy-related mucositis pain, but data are lacking on their efficacy in ICI-treated patients. Sialogogue therapy, cevimeline, pilocarpine, or other systemic acetylcholinergic agents have been anecdotally reported as helpful when symptoms are persistent and bothersome and refractory to topical mouth rinses.

ICI-induced sicca syndrome may feature severe symptoms, including dry eyes and dry mouth. Sicca accompanied by true Sjögren syndrome (typically with the presence of ANAs, anti-Ro, and/or anti-La antibodies) is rare, occurring at a rate of < 1% in a registry study of grade ≥ 2 irAEs. The median time to onset of dry mouth, indicative of sicca syndrome, is 70 days. Patients who develop sicca syndrome often do not experience full resolution of their symptoms, and they may require long-term care for salivary hypofunction as well as being at risk for loss of teeth.

Case 2

A 62-year-old Filipino man with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for chronic leukemia presented with painful oral erosions and a pruritic blistering eruption on the trunk and extremities when tapering oral tacrolimus, used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Physical examination found urticarial plaques on the arms and trunk with peripheral vesicles and central hyperpigmentation (Fig 1, C); shallow erosions were noted on the buccal mucosa. The differential diagnosis included GVHD or coincident AIBD. Biopsy, immunofluorescence, and ELISA were consistent with BP (Table I). The patient was treated with betamethasone ointment, dexamethasone mouthwash, doxycycline, and a tapering course of prednisone with rapid improvement. In consultation with his oncologist, mycophenolate was initiated, which sustained clinical remission, but postinflammatory hyperpigmentation remained after 3 months.

### Homeopathic medicines for adverse effects of cancer treatments [^1149k3ka]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Homeopathic medicines are used by patients with cancer, often alongside conventional treatment. Cancer treatments can cause considerable morbidity and one of the reasons patients use homeopathic medicines is to help with adverse effects.

Objectives

Evaluate effectiveness and safety of homeopathic medicines used to prevent or treat adverse effects of cancer treatments.

Search Strategy

The following were searched up to November 2008: Cochrane PaPaS Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; BNI; CancerLIT; AMED; CISCOM; Hom-Inform; SIGLE; National Research Register; Zetoc; www.controlled-trials.com; http://clinicaltrials.gov; Liga Medicorum Homeopathica Internationalis (LMHI, Liga) conference proceedings; reference lists of relevant studies were checked; and homeopathic manufacturers, leading researchers and practitioners were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of homeopathic medicines in participants with a clinical or histological diagnosis of cancer where the intervention was aimed at preventing or treating symptoms associated with cancer treatments. All age groups, and all stages of disease were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and two review authors extracted data. Three review authors independently assessed trial quality using the Delphi List and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Where available, data were extracted for analysis.

Main Results

Eight controlled trials (seven placebo controlled and one trial against an active treatment) with a total of 664 participants met the inclusion criteria. Three studied adverse effects of radiotherapy, three studied adverse effects of chemotherapy and two studied menopausal symptoms associated with breast cancer treatment. Two studies with low risk of bias demonstrated benefit: one with 254 participants demonstrated superiority of topical calendula over trolamine (a topical agent not containing corticosteroids) for prevention of radiotherapy-induced dermatitis, and another with 32 participants demonstrated superiority of Traumeel S (a proprietary complex homeopathic medicine) over placebo as a mouthwash for chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. Two other studies reported positive results, although the risk of bias was unclear, and four further studies reported negative results. No serious adverse effects or interactions were reported attributable to the homeopathic medicines used.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found preliminary data in support of the efficacy of topical calendula for prophylaxis of acute dermatitis during radiotherapy and Traumeel S mouthwash in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. These trials need replicating. There is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of homeopathic medicines for other adverse effects of cancer treatments. Further research is required.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host-disease [^1129H4tf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroid therapy principles in oral cGVHD — topical corticosteroids are the first line of therapy, and the type of preparation and its concentration depend on the extent and severity of the oral lesions. When the lesions are ulcerative/erosive and symptomatic, an ultra-potent steroid is preferred, and selection is tailored to the patient's tolerance of its consistency and mode of application. It is recommended to avoid long-term application of steroid on the lips, and although topical application uncommonly causes systemic adverse effects, clinicians should be aware of this potential risk; topical application of potent steroids with lower bioavailability, such as budesonide, may be a preferred alternative. For delivery, when the lesions are generalized, a rinse may be more practical whereas a gel may be more applicable for localized lesions, and for gingival involvement, application in a medication tray or as a gauze occlusion may facilitate longer contact time.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^1156FgoJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Therapy usually involves the use of agents with proven efficacy in enteric CD, including topical and systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulatory agents. A cinnamon- and benzoate-free diet may be the first approach. Symptomatic treatment, including topical anesthetics, such as 2% viscous xylocaine, can help reduce the pain due to aphthous ulcers.

Beclamethasone mouthwashes (0.5 mg dissolved in water, several times a day) bring symptomatic relief. Lip swelling is sometimes helped by topical tacrolimus. Intralesional injection of steroids into swollen lips has been reported. In patients with persistent pain, swelling, and cosmetic disfigurement, the use of immunosuppression at an early point is to be considered. Doses used in conventional CD are employed. There are no reliable outcome data on this approach.

Biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α have been established as effective therapies and are now the treatment of choice for enteric fistulizing CD. Case reports have suggested that infliximab and adalimumab are effective therapies in orofacial CD; orofacial fistula healing and closure have been described.

### Fluticasone propionate spray and betamethasone sodium phosphate mouthrinse: a randomized crossover study for the treatment of symptomatic oral lichen planus [^112iUWcQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) has been palliated with a wide spectrum of topical and systemic therapies. Although the majority of management strategies include corticosteroids, few have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

Objective

We investigated the acceptability and efficacy of topical fluticasone propionate spray (FP) and betamethasone sodium phosphate mouthrinse (BSP) upon the signs and symptoms of OLP, assessing patient quality of life changes as a consequence of these therapies.

Methods

We implemented a randomized, crossover study in which each drug was administered for a period of 6 weeks with an intervening washout period of 2 weeks at an outpatient oral medicine unit in London, United Kingdom. We treated 48 patients with biopsy-proven symptomatic OLP, and 44 patients (92%) completed the study. The dosage was 50 microg two dose unit sprays and BSP 500 microg, each 4 times daily. Symptomatic improvement was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS), the McGill pain score, the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP), and Oral Health Quality of Life (OHQoL) questionnaires. The total surface area of the lesions, including all white, erythematous, and ulcerative lesions was measured at each visit. The efficacy, ease of application, and adverse effects associated with each medication were recorded.

Results

Both FP and BSP mouthwash caused both a statistically significant reduction in painful symptoms as measured by the VAS and improvement in quality of life as measured by the OHIP and OHoQL indices. There was no significant difference between the two corticosteroids in their efficacy in reducing painful symptoms (measured by the VAS) or in their effect on patient quality of life. Both FP and BSP significantly reduced the surface area of oral lesions. However, FP was statistically significantly better than BSP in reducing lesion surface area. There was no statistically significant difference between the patient-assessed effects of the 2 therapies.

Conclusions

FP and BSP are both effective in the short-term clinical management of symptomatic OLP. FP is more acceptable to patients than BSP because of the convenience of the spray form.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

### Lichen planus following recombinant zoster vaccine [^116qPrys]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights a rare association between the recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) and the development of LP, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis characterized by violaceous papules, plaques, and mucosal involvement. While one recent case report described LP following the administration of both Shingrix and a COVID-19 vaccine, to our knowledge, this represents the first well-documented case of LP developing secondary to the Shingrix vaccine series alone. A search of the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System revealed 7 reported cases of LP potentially linked to Shingrix administration as of May 2025, indicating that this association remains uncommon.

The patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of LP, and the temporal association between the onset of symptoms following the first Shingrix dose and significant exacerbation and spread after the second dose strongly suggests a vaccine-induced etiology. The pathogenesis of vaccine-induced LP remains incompletely understood but may involve molecular mimicry or an adjuvant effect stimulating a T-cell mediated autoimmune response against keratinocytes. Although Shingrix is a recombinant subunit vaccine rather than a live attenuated virus, it contains glycoprotein E, which contributes to immune regulation in the setting of viral pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy, and an adjuvant component that could possibly trigger immune dysregulation in susceptible individuals.

Management of vaccine-induced LP involves addressing both cutaneous and mucosal symptoms. Topical corticosteroids are first-line treatments and were effective in improving the patient's symptoms; however, the subsequent development of mucosal involvement necessitated additional therapy with corticosteroid mucosal paste and compounded mouthwash. While the patient experienced significant improvement in cutaneous lesions, the mucosal involvement underscores the chronic and relapsing nature of LP, which may require long-term management and follow-up.

### Clinical practice guideline: hoarseness (dysphonia) (update) [^115DQ3zg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid use in dysphonia — risk profile and limited indications: Steroid adverse effects include dose-related mucosal complications, and hypersensitivity reactions are rare but documented; therefore, steroids should not be used empirically. Rinsing the oral cavity, gargling, drinking water after use, and using the lowest possible inhaled dose is recommended to mitigate side effects. Steroids should also be considered for patients with airway compromise to decrease edema and inflammation, with appropriate evaluation and determination of the cause required prior to starting steroid therapy. Steroid hypersensitivity can be either type 1 (IgE mediated), which can include anaphylaxis (rare, 0.3%-0.5%), or, more commonly, type IV (T cell mediated), usually following topical corticosteroid application.

### Oral GVHD post-cardiac xenograft valve replacement: a case report [^111XhNTr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In October 2023, the patient was referred to the periodontics unit for the diagnosis and management of such oral lesions. Upon oral examination (Fig. 1), the manifestations of GVHD-like lesions (reticular forms) were observed all around the gingival and alveolar mucosa (attached photos; Feteih, 2023): (a), lower lip (labial) mucosa (b), cheek mucosa (c), tongue tip (d), and palatal marginal gingiva and (e) upper labial mucosa.

Considering the patient's history of cardiac surgery with a soft tissue for valve replacement, along with the chronicity of stay and occurrence of oral lesions observed sometime after the surgery, GVHD as an oral manifestation was suspected. The child and her father denied involvement of any other body part in the manifestation of symptoms.

The patient underwent a thorough oral exam, along with careful history recording and the photos and radiographs that were taken were with informed consent.

Upon cardiology consultation, the soft tissue valve replacement was of xenograft; bovine origin, instead of mechanical valves to prevent the lifelong use of anticoagulants (e.g. Coumadin), improving her lifestyle along with the results obtained with soft tissue valve grafts. The discussion was regarding whether GVHD was encountered before with xenografts and was confirmed with a cardiologist who had observed a rare case as such before, yet with much severity, and that the plan for this patient would be continued with regular follow- ups as the results shown in (Tables 3 and 4) at her visit with cardiology in October 2023. Otherwise, for the oral lesions, a mouthwash containing corticosteroids was permissible and would not affect her cardiac situation, and the tissue valve that was placed would remain as the patient's cardiac condition was stable. From a cardiovascular perspective, the patient was fit for dental procedures with prophylaxis practiced (2 gm of amoxicillin 1 h before any dental procedure), while the patient continued on her medications until her next follow-up visit (6 months).

### Nonpainful hyperkeratotic variant of transient lingual papillitis: a case report [^111yJCWS]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of these conditions has not yet been fully optimized, as symptom management has been the primary goal. Most often, mouthwashes, antihistamines, and local anesthetics are used with topical corticosteroids, in addition to consuming cold foods and avoiding the irritants. All of these management techniques are aimed at suppressing inflammation, rather than targeting the underlying cause. Avoidance of irritating agents was the main form of management that was recommended to the patient in this case, as her outbreaks were attributed to the gum that she was chewing.

As an underdiagnosed and underreported condition, this case serves as a reminder of the important role of dermatologists in the diagnosis and management of oral pathologies. Current literature states that oral and perioral pathologies are better diagnosed by dermatologists when compared to orthodontists, pediatricians and family doctors. For this reason, dermatologists should continue to be educated on oral pathologies as the field itself is defined as a branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the skin, hair, nails, and oral cavity. Our case further highlights the importance of understanding the presentation of TLP and the role of dermatologists in the diagnosis and management of these conditions.

Oral corticosteroids in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are commonly used to manage uncontrolled symptoms, and in CRS with polyps short-term oral corticosteroids have been shown to improve symptoms and reduce polyp burden within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment; preoperative oral corticosteroids for CRS with polyposis have been shown to decrease polyp burden and improve visualization during sinus surgery and thus can be considered perioperatively or in patients with uncontrolled symptoms related to CRS with polyps. Evidence is even more limited for oral corticosteroids use in CRSsNP, and caution should be used because of potential significant side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, insomnia, elevated blood glucose levels in diabetics, adrenal suppression, and bone loss; the use of and duration of topical therapies should be documented in the medical record, and nasal saline irrigations and topical steroids may be continued long term if found beneficial in the absence of side effects.

### Talquetamab in multiple myeloma [^114uVW6A]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Managing toxicities

First, and foremost, talquetamab should be initiated with close monitoring in a setting with direct access to tocilizumab, critical care facilities, and capacity of neurologic evaluation and treatment.

Adverse events related to the nails can be managed with ammonium lactate cream, Vaseline, and various topical steroid ointments. Skin changes like xerosis and pruritis can be managed similarly with topical steroids and oral antihistamines for itchiness. Grade 3 rashes in the original study resolved after oral or topical corticosteroid use and talquetamab was able to be restarted in most patients with this issue.

Taste and other oral adverse events can lead to significant malnourishment and weight loss and need extra vigilance. Artificial saliva, biotin sprays and anesthetic mouthwashes can improve dry mouth, mucositis, oral cavity pain. Close monitoring for candidiasis and early treatment is necessary. It can be helpful to encourage softer diets and nutritional supplements in the form of shakes.

Infections remain a significant challenge in the field of MM immunotherapies. At our institution, acyclovir/valacyclovir and Bactrim for prophylaxis is regularly employed. Patients are encouraged to get shingles, COVID, and influenza vaccination and any other vaccines that are indicated. We regularly check immunoglobulin levels and our institution recommends intravenous immunoglobulin repletion for recurrent infections or levels below 400 mg/dL.

What are the possible side effects of ALVESCO?

ALVESCO may cause serious side effects, including:

Thrush (Candida), a fungal infection of your nose, mouth, or throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have discomfort or pain in your throat, have hoarseness in your voice or have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. Rinse your mouth after you use your ALVESCO.
Immune system problems that may increase your risk of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that may weaken your body's ability to fight infections. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while you use ALVESCO. Symptoms of an infection may include:
fever
pain
aches
chills
feeling tired
nausea
vomiting
Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Your healthcare provider will follow you closely if you take steroids by mouth and are having them decreased (tapered) or you are being switched to ALVESCO. People have died while steroids are being decreased and when people have been switched from steroids by mouth to inhaled steroids like ALVESCO. If you are under stress, such as with surgery, after surgery or trauma, you may need steroids by mouth again.

### Talquetamab in multiple myeloma [^1123jK3E]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurotoxicity was noted in 10% of patients receiving the 405 mcg dose and 5% of patients receiving the 800 mcg dose and were grade 1 or two and resolved. In each subcutaneous dose level, there was one event of encephalopathy occurring during the step-up doses and target dose. In the group receiving intravenous talquetamab, 3% experienced grade 3 ICANS. As such, the intravenous dose level was not pursued for the phase II trial. In the phase II trial results, ICANS was reported at a rate of 10.7% and 11% for the 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg groups respectively.

Nail issues and taste changes were frequent and likely related to the expression of GPRC5D in these tissue. Nail AE tended to occur at a median of 50.5 days with a wide range. These AE can range from nail thinning to complete separation of the nail plate from the matrix due to disruption of growth, onychomadesis, as noted in an early case report. In this report, topical corticosteroids were heavily applied to the hands, feet, and skin in general due to the patient's diffuse xerosis and pruritis but only the pruritis and xerosis resolved with the topical corticosteroids. Despite the potential for severe nail-related AE, no discontinuations resulted from them. In another study, nail and skin AE were managed with ammonium lactate cream, triamcinolone cream, and Vaseline applied twice a day. Grade 3 rashes resolved with oral and topical corticosteroids and treatment resumption was possible afterwards in most patients. Oral antihistamines can also be employed to reduce associated pruritis. The median time to skin toxicities was 24 days in the subcutaneous dosing group with close to half resolving at a median duration was 39 days. Taste AE tended to occur at a median of 13.5 days. This and other oral AE including dysphagia, appetite loss, dry mouth can lead to significant malnutrition and weight loss. Many clinicians recommend extra vigilance for oral and esophageal candidiasis and early treatment if suspected. Other management strategies include biotin sprays and mouthwashes geared towards managing mucositis and the incorporation of thin liquids and nutritional supplement shakes to improve nutrition and caloric intake. Artificial saliva has been tried with limited success. Early dose and schedule adjustments seem the optimal management strategy(Table 2).

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral manifestations of chronic graft-versus-host-disease [^116kn6RQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Management

As cGVHD is a systemic disease, the overall management goal is to control the disease, to maintain optimal function, and to preserve adequate quality of life. Organ involvement with cGVHD determines the specific management goals. Below is a description of the aspects pertinent to oral cGVHD.
The treatment goals in oral cGVHD are to relieve pain and xerostomia, improve oral function (e.g. eating, mouth opening), prevent secondary infection, prevent deterioration of the dentition, and detect malignant transformation as early as possible. Overall, this will improve quality of life and possibly life expectancy.
Patients post allogeneic HCT, who are at risk for cGVHD, should be examined by an oral health care professional every 6–12 month for oral cGVHD manifestations, or sooner if the patient notices any changes. Biopsy and pathological examination should be performed on lesions suspicious for oral cancer.
Generally, cGVHD is treated with systemic corticosteroids and steroid-sparing immunomodulators, including the classic calcineurin inhibitors as well as the more recent mechanism-based targeted agents. However, when the oral mucosa is the only site of cGVHD involvement or when the oral cGVHD is resistant to systemic treatment, topical treatment is of outmost importance. In such cases, the following treatment principles are suggested: When the lesions are generalized, a rinse may be more practical, whereas a gel may be more applicable for localized lesions. For gingival involvement, application in a medication tray or as a gauze occlusion may facilitate longer contact time. Topical corticosteroids are the first line of therapy (Table 1). The type of preparation and its concentration depend on the extent and severity of the oral lesions. When the lesions are ulcerative/erosive and symptomatic, an ultra-potent steroid is preferred. The topical steroid selection is also tailored to the patient's tolerance of its consistency and mode of application. It is recommended to avoid long-term application of steroid on the lips. Although topical application uncommonly causes systemic adverse effects, clinicians should be aware of this potential risk. This is mostly applicable for patients with ulcerative oral cGVHD who use topical steroids for longer durations. Topical application of potent steroids with lower bioavailability, such as budesonide, may be a preferred alternative. Topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus (Table 1) may be considered when topical steroids have an insufficient clinical effect. Patients should be informed that the medication may cause burning during initial application of tacrolimus ointment, which usually subsides with subsequent applications. For persistent, localized symptomatic oral lesions, intralesional steroid injections (Table 1) may be administered. Although some patients experience relief following a single injection, others need a few cycles of injections to achieve the desired outcome. Triamcinolone acetonide is the common steroid reported in the dental literature for intralesional injection in the management of inflammatory oral ulcers. Additional optional steroids, side effects, complications, and pitfalls have been reported in the dermatology literature. Pain management should be considered. Topical agents for pain management include local anesthetics, local anti-histamines, or other agents that were reported to alleviate pain in oral mucositis. Systemic pain management should be monitored, given the chronicity of the disease and risk for adverse effects in long-term use. Early evidence suggesting the benefits of phototherapy (PUVA or UVB), photobiomodulation, and platelet gel has been published. Topical belumosudil suspension was tested for safety and tolerability in oral cGVHD patients. More research is needed about these interventions.
Exophytic lesions, such as pyogenic granuloma and verruciform xanthoma, necessitate surgical excision followed by histopathological analysis of the excised tissue. In contrast, superficial mucoceles typically do not require a biopsy for diagnostic confirmation.
Patients with sclerodermatous-type cGVHD are often treated systemically. In addition, these patients should be instructed to practice daily physical therapy such as active stretching of the tongue and perioral muscles, to prevent further oral and perioral fibrosis and preserve the range of motion. During follow-up appointments, the patient should be encouraged to continue performing these exercises. Other suggested treatment strategies include surgery, and intralesional corticosteroid injections.
For detailed management protocols of hyposalivation or xerostomia, clinicians are referred to the OCSG CPS about Salivary Gland Hypofunction and Xerostomia. Below are some general principles in the management of hyposalivation pertinent to cGVHD patients: Pharmacological sialogogues, such as pilocarpine and cevimeline, may be considered, taking into account the contraindications and possible adverse effects. Over-the-counter moistening agents may be used for palliation of dry mouth. Nonpharmacological saliva stimulants, such as sweet/sour sugar-free hard candies or chewing gums, may be used. In refractory cases, intraductal irrigation of the parotid glands or electrostimulation therapy may be considered for xerostomia relief. Frequent topical application of high-concentration fluoride preparation may help prevent dental caries. Patient should be educated and encouraged to practice meticulous oral hygiene.
Given that secondary oral candidiasis is relatively common in patients with hyposalivation treated with corticosteroids, antifungal treatment may be needed. Topical antifungals (e.g. nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole) are advised for oral candidiasis. Antifungal lozenges should be avoided in cases of severe dry mouth, as such conditions do not facilitate the lozenges disintegration. Patients should be instructed to comply with the dosing protocol in order to achieve the best effect and to follow basic principles of resistance development prevention. Systemic antifungals (e.g. fluconazole) may also be considered. Denture wearers should be advised to minimize use of their prostheses (for example, removing them during sleep), and to clean, disinfect, and soak the prostheses in antifungal solution upon removal.
The oral cGVHD manifestations may negatively impact the dentition. Hyposalivation due to cGVHD or the pretransplant high-intensity conditioning regimen may increase the risk for dental caries, and desquamative gingivitis may compromise oral hygiene practice. Furthermore, the limitation of mouth opening and loss of vestibular elasticity may be a barrier for oral and dental care. Therefore, the patient should be educated about the necessity of frequent dental checkups and meticulous oral hygiene tailored to their specific needs.

### A phase 2 multicenter trial of ofatumumab and prednisone as initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^117KDLMh]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment plan

Prednisone was started at 1 mg/kg actual body weight per day. The duration of prednisone therapy and tapering schedule were not mandated by the protocol and were coordinated by the treating physicians according to their institutional guidelines. If cGVHD activity increased upon taper, prednisone could be increased to an upper limit of 2 mg/kg per day (or equivalent), but doses higher than that were considered a separate line of additional systemic IST. Taper of other systemic agents and use of topical agents (eg, ocular drops, mouth rinses, topical steroid creams) were similarly not regulated by the trial or considered treatment failure. Ofatumumab was administered by IV infusion; preparation and infusion conditions were per standard procedures. Subjects in this phase II portion of the trial were uniformly dosed at 1000 mg of ofatumumab (delivered once on day 0 and again on day 14 of therapy). Premedication was uniformly delivered within 30 minutes before each infusion: acetaminophen 1000 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg, and methylprednisolone IV 50 mg. Vital signs were monitored every 30 (± 5) minutes during infusion or more frequently as needed. The initial infusion rate, timing of sequential infusion rate escalation, and rules surrounding response to observed infusion reactions were enforced. If grade 4 infusion reactions occurred, no further ofatumumab therapy was to be given; lesser grade infusion reactions were managed with supportive care, including IV fluids, antihistamines, and steroids. Supportive antimicrobial prophylaxis followed institutional standards. IV immunoglobulin replacement was delivered per discretion of the treating physician.

### Oral GVHD post-cardiac xenograft valve replacement: a case report [^115GWaqy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Dental treatment plan

The patient was managed by detailed history recording, including questions about familial and/or immunity related diseases which were uneventful, reaching a preliminary diagnosis along the clinical presentations observed intra-orally. Upon examination; the oral lesions were non-scrapable, not painful, and with no history of remission and/or exacerbations and the absence of other areas involved, before the cardiac surgery. So, differential diagnoses as infectious, lichen planus or lupus erythematosus were excluded. A cardiology consultation was made, for the possibility of GVHD to occur from xenografts and the response was positive but rare, with the oral mucosa merely involved.

The case was managed by an oral hygiene visit including oral hygiene instructions (OHI) for the gingival inflammation observed with plaque accumulation. The patient was regularly monitored with Cardiology and periodically with Periodontics for almost a year. Also, an oral corticosteroid mouthwash was prescribed for the oral manifestations (leukoplakia, reticular features similar to lichen planus, marginal gingival inflammations), which did not much affect the lesions observed. A biopsy was planned and performed to confirm the diagnosis. The labial mucosal lining was very thin along ulcers observed, and upon soft tissue manipulation the areas readily bled and were easily torn. Also, periodic periodontal follow-ups were planned for monitoring of the oral lesions, a future biopsy may be required for any soft tissue changes and a referral to gastroenterology (GI) for further investigation.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^114Cn3JE]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Oral biopsy is important in establishing a correct diagnosis of the disease. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is associated in 90% of cases. The differential diagnosis includes mainly pemphigus vegetans (the condition may also be caused by zinc deficiency).

Management of PPV depends on the presence of coexisting IBD. The first course of action is the treatment of the underlying condition, which is usually sufficient to control oral and skin lesions.

Various treatments for PD-PSV have been reported, such as topical and oral corticosteroids, and systemic corticosteroids combined with antibiotics, sulfonamides, dapsone, sulphamethoxypiridazine, azathioprine, cyclosporine A or etanercept. The treatment of choice is systemic corticosteroids, starting with moderate to high dosage. Bens et al reported that three injections of infliximab and successive maintenance therapy with methotrexate caused a rapid and complete regression of both the PV and the CD. Multivitamin complexes and nutritional supplements can be provided. Surgical treatment in severe cases IBD involves total colectomy and has resulted in complete remission of symptoms.

The oral lesions can be managed with local therapies using antiseptic mouthwashes, tetracycline mouth rinses, and topical corticosteroids. Treatment with topical tacrolimus ointment for PD-PSV has been beneficial in some patients. However, local therapy is generally insufficient. Unfortunately, the lesions can recur when treatment is tapered or stopped.

Sweet's syndrome

Sweet's syndrome (SS) (or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a reactive neutrophilic dermatosis. It may be associated with infection of the upper respiratory tract and/or gastrointestinal tract, IBD, pregnancy, cancer, medications and connective tissue diseases.

The syndrome has been reported as an unusual extra-intestinal manifestation of IBD, principally associated with CD and less commonly with UC. In these patients, SS is more common in women, with colonic and perianal involvement, and in patients with other extra-intestinal manifestations.

The skin manifestations of SS appear concurrently with the relapse of CD (75% of the cases) although SS may also precede or follow the digestive symptoms by many years. It has been also described after proctocolectomy.

### A prospective observational study on the evaluation of everolimus-related adverse events in metastatic renal cell carcinoma after first-line anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy: the AFINITE study in France [^1128hpGK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of the study was to describe the occurrence of stomatitis and noninfectious lung disease in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with second-line everolimus in a real-world setting.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted in France by physicians with experience of treatment of patients with mRCC. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who received everolimus after first-line antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy were included in the study. The primary safety assessments were occurrence of stomatitis (in terms of severity, event dates, and therapeutic management) and noninfectious pneumonitis (in terms of detection methodology, severity, event dates, and therapeutic management).

Results

Between September 2010 and August 2012, 284 patients were enrolled at 77 centers, of whom, 274 received everolimus therapy. Most patients had mRCC of clear cell histology (88%), and most of them (84%) received first-line sunitinib. In total, 40% of patients experienced treatment-related stomatitis, and 15% of patients experienced noninfectious lung disease. Most of them had a single episode. The incidence of grade 3 stomatitis and noninfectious lung disease were 8 and 3%, respectively. Mean time to the first episode was 27 days for stomatitis and 72 days for noninfectious lung disease from treatment initiation. Stomatitis and noninfectious lung disease resulted in treatment discontinuations in 2 and 7% of patients, respectively. The primary first-episode treatment was mouthwash (86%) for stomatitis and corticosteroids (65%) for noninfectious lung disease.

Conclusions

This study confirms that stomatitis and noninfectious lung disease are commonly associated with everolimus use. Both adverse events were rarely severe and were managed easily and efficiently.

### Interventions for treating oral lichen planus: corticosteroid therapies [^113Moooz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a relatively common chronic T cell-mediated disease, which can cause significant pain, particularly in its erosive or ulcerative forms. As pain is the indication for treatment of OLP, pain resolution is the primary outcome for this review. This review is an update of a version last published in 2011, but focuses on the evidence for corticosteroid treatment only. A second review considering non-corticosteroid treatments is in progress.

Objectives

To assess the effects and safety of corticosteroids, in any formulation, for treating people with symptoms of oral lichen planus.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 25 February 2019: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of any local or systemic corticosteroid treatment compared with a placebo, a calcineurin inhibitor, another corticosteroid, any other local or systemic (or both) drug, or the same corticosteroid plus an adjunctive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently scanned the titles and abstracts of all reports identified, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data from included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the estimates of effects of an intervention as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. The statistical unit of analysis was the participant. We conducted meta-analyses only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 35 studies (1474 participants) in this review. We assessed seven studies at low risk of bias overall, 11 at unclear and the remaining 17 studies at high risk of bias. We present results for our main outcomes, pain and clinical resolution measured at the end of the treatment course (between one week and six months), and adverse effects. The limited evidence available for comparisons between different corticosteroids, and corticosteroids versus alternative or adjunctive treatments is presented in the full review. Corticosteroids versus placebo Three studies evaluated the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids in an adhesive base compared to placebo. We were able to combine two studies in meta-analyses, one evaluating clobetasol propionate and the other flucinonide. We found low-certainty evidence that pain may be more likely to be resolved when using a topical corticosteroid rather than a placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.36; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%). The results for clinical effect of treatment and adverse effects were inconclusive (clinical resolution: RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 47.58; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; adverse effects RR 1.48, 95% 0.48 to 4.56; 3 studies, 88 participants, I² = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids versus calcineurin inhibitors Three studies compared topical clobetasol propionate versus topical tacrolimus. We found very low-certainty evidence regarding any difference between tacrolimus and clobetasol for the outcomes pain resolution (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88; 2 studies, 100 participants; I² = 80%), clinical resolution (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99; 2 studies, 52 participants; I² = 95%) and adverse effects (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83; 2 studies, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). One study (39 participants) compared topical clobetasol and ciclosporin, and provided only very low-certainty evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution with clobetasol (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 9.93), pain resolution (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.76 to 5.86) and adverse effects (RR 6.32, 95% CI 0.84 to 47.69). Two studies (60 participants) that compared triamcinolone and tacrolimus found uncertain evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35; very low-certainty evidence) and that there may be a lower rate of adverse effects in the triamcinolone group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99; low-certainty evidence). These studies did not report on pain resolution.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids have been first line for the treatment of OLP. This review found that these drugs, delivered topically as adhesive gels or similar preparations, may be more effective than placebo for reducing the pain of symptomatic OLP; however, with the small number of studies and participants, our confidence in the reliability of this finding is low. The results for clinical response were inconclusive, and we are uncertain about adverse effects. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that calcineurin inhibitors, specifically tacrolimus, may be more effective at resolving pain than corticosteroids, although there is some uncertainty about adverse effects and clinical response to tacrolimus showed conflicting results.

Oral mucositis/stomatitis — management in immunotherapy recipients: Unlike chemotherapy/radiotherapy-associated mucositis, the mainstay of treatment for immunotherapy-associated oral mucositis is topical steroids, with systemic steroids required if symptoms are severe and oral intake is affected; in more extreme cases the immunotherapy dose may need to be adjusted, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinued. For immunotherapy-induced non-specific oral mucositis, nonopioid topical agents are preferred for pain relief, topical morphine rinse may be a second line, other topical analgesics may be used at the clinician's discretion if proved effective, and if severe pain impairs oral intake, systemic pain medications may be administered according to the World Health Organization analgesic ladder; non-pharmacologic pain management options may be considered.

To determine which topical treatments for dry mouth are effective in reducing this symptom.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (28 October 2011), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2011), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 28 October 2011), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 28 October 2011), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 28 October 2011), AMED via OVID (1985 to 28 October 2011), CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 28 October 2011).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of topical interventions such as lozenges, sprays, mouthrinses, gels, oils, chewing gum or toothpastes for the treatment of dry mouth symptom. We classified interventions into two broad categories, saliva stimulants and saliva substitutes, and these were compared with either placebo or another intervention. We included both parallel group and crossover trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two or more review authors independently carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias. Trial authors were contacted for additional information as required.

Main Results

Thirty-six randomised controlled trials involving 1597 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two trials compared saliva stimulants to placebo, nine trials compared saliva substitutes to placebo, five trials compared saliva stimulants directly with saliva substitutes, 18 trials directly compared two or more saliva substitutes, and two trials directly compared two or more saliva stimulants. Only one trial was at low risk of bias and 17 were at high risk of bias. Due to the range of interventions, comparisons and outcome measures in the trials, meta-analysis was possible for only a few comparisons. Oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) saliva substitute spray shows evidence of effectiveness compared to an electrolyte spray (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.15) which corresponds to approximately a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) for mouth dryness. Both integrated mouthcare systems (toothpaste + gel + mouthwash) and oral reservoir devices show promising results but there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend their use. Although chewing gum is associated with increased saliva production in the majority of those with residual capacity, there is no evidence that gum is more or less effective than saliva substitutes.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no strong evidence from this review that any topical therapy is effective for relieving the symptom of dry mouth. OGT spray is more effective than an aqueous electrolyte spray (SMD 0.77, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15) which is approximately equivalent to a mean difference of 2 points on a 10-point VAS scale for mouth dryness. Chewing gums appear to increase saliva production in those with residual secretory capacity and may be preferred by patients, but there is no evidence that gum is better or worse than saliva substitutes. Integrated mouthcare systems and oral reservoir devices may be helpful but further research is required to confirm this. Well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials of topical interventions for dry mouth, which are designed and reported according to CONSORT guidelines, are required to provide evidence to guide clinical care. For many people the symptom of dry mouth is a chronic problem and trials should evaluate whether treatments are palatable, effective in reducing xerostomia, as well as the long-term effects of treatments on quality of life of those with chronic dry mouth symptoms.

CRS-directed antibiotics and steroids — Clinicians should use systemic antibiotics for acute exacerbations of CRS; however, in some patients, this may not be necessary (Rec, C). Consider a 3- to 6-week course of topical antibiotics for CRS (Rec, C). Consider the use of systemic antibiotics plus a short course of oral steroids in the treatment of CRS; greater benefit with antibiotics has been reported in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP (Rec, A). Consider a short course of oral steroids for the treatment of CRSwNP (Rec, C). Use short-term treatment with oral steroids in CRSwNP because it decreases nasal polyp size and symptoms (StrRec, A). Use intranasal corticosteroid (INS; sprays and aerosols) for the treatment of CRSwNP and CRSsNP (StrRec, A).

Acute urticaria and angioedema — oral corticosteroids — In severe cases oral corticosteroids might be necessary, and in patients with poor response to antihistamines, a brief course might be required while eliminating suspected triggers and developing a treatment plan; a short course can be considered if symptoms are severe or not resolving with antihistamines. A randomized controlled study in adults showed that adding oral corticosteroids to antihistamines decreased time to resolution of acute urticaria symptoms in an emergency department setting, and a small study in adults and children showed more rapid resolution with oral corticosteroids than with antihistamines; however, these findings are not sufficient to warrant routine use of oral corticosteroids rather than antihistamines. Use of oral corticosteroids for acute urticaria/angioedema is common in an adult emergency department setting.

### Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to improve patient outcomes and to protect healthcare workers treating them [^1121iZbs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them.

Search Methods

Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.

PPES

Prevention strategies for PPES include prophylactic removal of hyperkeratotic areas, application of moisturizing cream containing urea ≥ 10%, pedicures, and cushioning of callused areas using soft or padded shoes [48]. Other preventive tactics include avoidance of activities that cause force or rubbing on the hands and feet during the first 6 weeks of treatment and limiting contact with harsh chemicals and sources of heat, such as sitting in saunas or the sun.

Management of PPES consists of keratolytic agents such as urea ≥ 10% for grade ≥ 1 PPES, with addition of high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% for grade ≥ 2 symptoms.

Stomatitis

Preventive strategies include undertaking dental work aimed at eliminating existing tooth and gum disease before the start of treatment and education regarding the importance of thorough and frequent cleaning of the oral cavity. Avoidance of salty, spicy, or citrus‐based foods, as well as hot beverages, may help prevent stomatitis.

Upon emergence of grade 1 or 2 stomatitis, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL elixir is recommended; an augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% gel applied to gauze and held against the affected surface may also assist in alleviating symptoms.

Dry Skin

Patients should be advised to moisturize skin to minimize the risk of skin adverse events and to avoid excessive exposure to detergents and soaps containing fragrances. Urea preparations have been shown to prevent transepidermal water loss, and salicylic acid preparations are helpful for their keratolytic, bacteriostatic, and fungicidal effects [50]. Exfoliation of scaly areas of xerosis is recommended. For more severe grade 3 xerosis, which results in asteatotic dermatitis, treatment can be initiated with low‐potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment or triamcinolone 0.1% cream.

Dry Mouth/Xerostomia

Patient education is an important component of dry mouth prevention. The importance of good oral hygiene, regular dentist visits, and other strategies for preventing oral disease should be stressed.

Treatment may include systemic and topical salivary stimulants, such as cevimeline and pilocarpine, and intraoral topical agents, such as chewing gums and saliva stimulants and substitutes [59]. High‐fluoride toothpaste is also recommended to prevent cavities.

Clinical practice guidance

GI toxicity predicts post-transplant complications.
A multidisciplinary approach to care including input from haematologists, dietitian, gastroenterologists and specialist symptom control team is helpful.
Endoscopic tests with small bowel aspiration and biopsies are helpful in patients with diarrhoea after stem cell transplantation for differentiating between small bowel bacterial or fungal overgrowth, enteric infections (especially with C. difficile or cytomegalovirus) and GvHD.
Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with small intestinal aspirate and biopsies combined with flexible sigmoidoscopy is significantly safer than colonoscopy in patients with lower GI symptoms and is similarly effective at reaching a diagnosis.
Wireless capsule endoscopy is not recommended to make the diagnosis of GvHD.
In patients with typical symptoms of GvHD, treatment should not be delayed while waiting for biopsy results.

GI toxicity after a haematopoietic stem cell transplant relates to complications from preconditioning of the bone marrow secondary to SACT and GvHD after allogeneic stem cell transplants. Mucositis in common following both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplants, and pain is usually managed with soluble paracetamol and oral morphine. In addition, mouthwashes and coating agents can be helpful as described in the oral mucositis section above. In more severe cases, a subcutaneous infusion of morphine and antiemetics is required. Expert advice from the palliative care team can be sought if symptoms are severe.

Regular review by a dietitian is necessary for all patients undergoing stem cell transplantation. Many patients tolerate nutritional supplements, but those with more severe symptoms will require interventional nutritional support. When possible, a nasogastric tube should be used, but parenteral nutrition is often required owing to malabsorptive symptoms and inability to tolerate a feeding tube.

Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea are very common following a haematopoietic stem cell transplant. In patients undergoing autologous transplantation these symptoms are related to the SACT and are managed with antiemetics and antidiarrhoeal agents. Stool cultures should be obtained to exclude C. difficile infection before institution of antidiarrhoeal medications. Diarrhoea is commonly due to medication, GvHD, malabsorptive syndromes as a result of mucosal damage, SIBO, fungal overgrowth and viral enteritides. It is common for several causes to coexist.

### Use of antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays by healthcare workers to protect them when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [^1148kMHZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. If the mouth and nose of HCWs are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help reduce the risk of active infection being passed from infected patients to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves, or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. Understanding these possible side effects is particularly important when the HCWs are otherwise fit and well.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect themselves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Search Methods

Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified three ongoing studies (including two RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 700 participants. The interventions included in these trials are povidone iodine, nitric oxide and GLS-1200 oral spray (the constituent of this spray is unclear and may not be antimicrobial in nature).

### Prednisolone oral solution (prednisolone) [^114ybSos]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated.

Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

Reduce resistance
Exacerbate existing infections
Increase the risk if disseminated infections
Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
Mask some signs of infection

Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.

Monitor for the development of infection and consider prednisolone oral solution withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

Do not administer prednisolone oral solution by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection.

Tuberculosis

If prednisolone oral solution is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged prednisolone oral solution therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections

Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution. In corticosteroids-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles:

### Systematic review of cytokines and growth factors for the management of oral mucositis in cancer patients [^1113k9zB]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this project was to review the literature and define clinical practice guidelines for the use of cytokines and growth factor agents for the prevention or treatment of oral mucositis induced by cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO). The body of evidence for each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was assigned an evidence level. Based on the evidence level, one of the following three guideline determinations was possible: Recommendation, Suggestion, No guideline possible.

Results

Sixty-four clinical studies across 11 interventions were evaluated. A recommendation was made for the use of recombinant human KGF-1 (palifermin) at a dose of 60 μg/kg per day for 3 days prior to conditioning treatment and for 3 days post-transplant for prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies. A suggestion was made against using granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mouthwash for the prevention of oral mucositis in the setting of high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. No guideline was possible for any other cytokine or growth factor agents due to inconclusive evidence.

Conclusions

Of the cytokine and growth factor agents studied for oral mucositis, the evidence only supports use of palifermin in the specific population listed above. Additional well-designed research is needed on other cytokine and growth factor interventions and in other cancer treatment settings.

Key Points

Question

What duration of oral corticosteroid use is associated with adverse effects among adult patients with atopic dermatitis?

Findings

In this nested case-control study including 1 025 270 patients with atopic dermatitis, use of oral corticosteroids for more than 90 days during 1 year was associated with a slightly increased risk of composite adverse outcomes. There was no increased risk with use of oral corticosteroids for more than 30 days.

Meaning

This study suggests that for patients with exacerbations of atopic dermatitis, limiting the duration of oral corticosteroid treatment to 90 days or less may limit adverse effects.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: management of oral complications of immunotherapy [^1146DYwT]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Oral mucositis/stomatitis

Previous relevant literature used general terms including "oral mucositis" or "oral stomatitis" to define oral mucosal irAEs. These terms refer to non-specific erosion and ulceration of the oral mucosa. It may manifest on a broad spectrum, from localized erythema to extensive ulceration. In this CPS, the presence of clinical non-specific oral erosion and ulceration, without typical white striae, or without a specific microscopic appearance, will be considered a distinct oral irAE entity rather than an OLP/OLR. Of note, with the resolution of the ulcers, a milder form of OLP/OLR may be revealed, which may re-define the diagnosis as OLP/OLR. Therefore, the characteristics of this entity may change as the literature focuses on its specific aspects.
The treatment aims to alleviate the symptoms and signs, primarily by accelerating the healing of mucosal erosion or ulceration and reducing its severity.
Unlike chemotherapy/radiotherapy-associated mucositis, the mainstay of treatment for immunotherapy-associated oral mucositis is topical steroids (Table 2). The selection of agent and its texture depends on the distribution of the lesions and the ease of applicability to the patient. If the symptoms are severe and oral intake is affected, systemic steroids may be required.
In patients with more extreme cases, the immunotherapy dose may need to be adjusted, temporarily withheld, or permanently discontinued.
For immunotherapy-induced non-specific oral mucositis, nonopioid topical agents are preferred for pain relief (Table 2). A second line of therapy may be topical morphine rinse (Table 2). Other topical analgesic agents may be used at the clinician's discretion if proved effective. Importantly, the efficacy of these agents has been confirmed through extensive research and clinical experience with managing oral ulcerative diseases and was not a subject of research on oral irAEs. If severe pain impairs oral intake, systemic pain medications may be administered according to the World Health Organization analgesic ladder. Non-pharmacologic pain management options may be considered (Box 1). Box 1 Non-pharmacologic treatment modalities for pain management that may be applied to oral immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated pain This list is based on evidence of pain management in other ulcerative oral lesions or in general pain conditions; evidence for their efficacy in irAEs is not present in the literature
The patient should be informed about the projection of this oral irAE and the expectations from the treatment, which is supportive rather than curative. The patient's understanding that oral irAEs will continue while receiving immunotherapy or even after discontinuing it is important for setting the correct expectations from the treatment.
Practicing good oral hygiene is important to reduce microbial load, reduce inflammation of gingiva, and prevent secondary infection.

### Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays to protect healthcare workers when undertaking aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [^112vPbht]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. The risks of transmission of infection are greater when a patient is undergoing an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Not all those with COVID-19 infection are symptomatic, or suspected of harbouring the infection. If a patient who is not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19 infection is to undergo an AGP, it would nonetheless be sensible to minimise the risk to those HCWs treating them. If the mouth and nose of an individual undergoing an AGP are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may be a simple and safe method of reducing the risk of any covert infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. Alternatively, the use of antimicrobial solutions by the HCW may decrease the chance of them acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to HCWs and/or patients when undertaking AGPs on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Search Methods

Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to the patient or HCW before and/or after an AGP.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs or patients; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 4) change in COVID-19 viral load at site(s) of irrigation; 5) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 6) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review, nor any ongoing studies. The absence of completed studies is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. However, we are disappointed that this important clinical question is not being addressed by ongoing studies.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^116iVPWt]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

HSV stromal keratitis — A topical corticosteroid agent in conjunction with an oral antiviral agent for at least ten weeks is the preferred treatment, and the balance between antiviral and corticosteroid therapy should be adjusted depending on the presence or absence of epithelial ulceration (Strong Recommendation, Good Quality). In a double blind, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial, patients treated with a ten-week taper of topical prednisolone plus trifluridine solution or topical placebo with trifluridine had treatment failure during the ten-week course in 26% versus 73%, respectively, and the study demonstrated that ten weeks may be too brief because one half of the combination group and 76% of the placebo group failed within six weeks of corticosteroid cessation. In a second HEDS study, 75% of patients receiving topical prednisolone, topical trifluridine, and oral acyclovir and 74% of those receiving the same regimen except for placebo instead of oral acyclovir had failed treatment six weeks after treatment ended; therefore, a tapered course of topical corticosteroids for greater than ten weeks is recommended, and for HSV stromal keratitis, oral antiviral agents are preferred to the two topical antiviral agents.

### Prednisolone oral (prednisolone) [^1173durt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated.

Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection

Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:

Reduce resistance
Exacerbate existing infections
Increase the risk if disseminated infections
Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections
Mask some signs of infection

Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.

Monitor for the development of infection and consider prednisolone oral solution withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.

Do not administer prednisolone oral solution by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection.

Tuberculosis

If prednisolone oral solution is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged prednisolone oral solution therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.

Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections

Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution. In corticosteroids-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles:

### Mouthwash… [^112GrbLG]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

Usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the mouth, although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory or anti-fungal action. Additionally, some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia. Cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste. Chemo­thera­peutic agents, including mouthwashes, could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care, preventing and controlling supra­gingival plaque, gingivitis and oral malodor. Prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures, such as tooth extraction, or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. They are also prescribed for aphthous ulcers, other oral ulcers, and other mouth pain.

"Magic mouthwashes" are prescription mouthwashes compounded in a pharmacy from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor. Despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions, many patients and prescribers continue to use them. There has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash; it shows no difference in efficacy between the most common magic-mouthwash formulation, on the one hand, and commercial mouthwashes or a saline/baking soda solution, on the other. Current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief and in shortening the healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies. A clinical trial and laboratory studies have shown that alcohol-containing mouthwash could reduce the growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the pharynx.

However, subsequent trials have found that there was no difference in gonorrhoea cases among men using daily mouthwash compared to those who did not use mouthwash for 12 weeks. Benzoic acid Benzoic acid acts as a buffer. Betamethasone Betamethasone is sometimes used as an anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid mouthwash. It may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis. Chlorhexidine digluconate and hexetidine Chlorhexidine digluconate is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a 0. 05–0. 2% solution as a mouthwash. There is no evidence to support that higher concentrations are more effective in controlling dental plaque and gingivitis. A randomized clinical trial conducted in Rabat University in Morocco found better results in plaque inhibition when chlorohexidine with alcohol base 0. 12% was used, when compared to an alcohol-free
0. 1% chlorhexidine mouthrinse.

Chlorhexidine has good substantivity. It has anti-plaque action, and also some anti-fungal action. It is especially effective against Gram-negative rods. The proportion of Gram-negative rods increase as gingivitis develops, so it is also used to reduce gingivitis. It is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease, although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well. Chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque, so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing. Instead, chlorhexidine mouthwash is more effective when used as an adjunctive treatment with toothbrushing and flossing. In the short term, if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain, as may occur in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, chlorhexidine mouthwash is used as a temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures.

### Mouth ulcer [^113KSfsZ]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

The vesicles and bullae of blistering mucocutaneous disorders progress quickly to ulceration in the mouth, because of moisture and trauma from food and teeth. The high bacterial load in the mouth means that ulcers may become secondarily infected. Cytotoxic drugs administered during chemotherapy target cells with fast turnovers such as malignant cells. However, the epithelia of the mouth also has a high turnover rate and makes oral ulceration a common side effect of chemotherapy. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation. Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Mucous membrane pemphigoid, an autoimmune reaction to the epithelial basement membrane, causes desquamation/ulceration of the oral mucosa.

Numerous aphthous ulcers could be indicative of an inflammatory autoimmune disease called Behçet's disease. This can later involve skin lesions and uveitis in the eyes. Vitamin C deficiency may lead to scurvy which impairs wound healing, which can contribute to ulcer formation. For a detailed discussion of the pathophysiology of aphthous stomatitis, see Aphthous stomatitis#Causes. The diagnosis comes mostly from the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests microbiological swabs, or urinalysis. A biopsy with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected.

Chemical injury Caustic chemicals may cause ulceration of the oral mucosa if they are of strong-enough concentration and in contact for a sufficient length of time. The holding of medication in the mouth instead of swallowing it occurs mostly in children, those under psychiatric care, or simply because of a lack of understanding. Holding an aspirin tablet next to a painful tooth in an attempt to relieve pulpitis is common, and leads to epithelial necrosis. Chewable aspirin tablets should be swallowed, with the residue quickly cleared from the mouth. Other caustic medications include eugenol and chlorpromazine. Hydrogen peroxide, used to treat gum disease, is also capable of causing epithelial necrosis at concentrations of 1–3%. Silver nitrate, sometimes used for pain relief from aphthous ulceration, acts as a chemical cauterant and destroys nerve endings, but the mucosal damage is increased.

Phenol is used during dental treatment as a cavity sterilizing agent and cauterizing material, and it is also present in some over-the-counter agents intended to treat aphthous ulcerations. Mucosal necrosis has been reported to occur with concentrations of 0. 5%. Other materials used in endodontics are also caustic, which is part of the reason why use of a rubber dam is now recommended. The exact cause of aphthous stomatitis is unknown, but there may be a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include hematinic deficiency, stopping smoking, stress, menstruation, trauma, food allergies or hypersensitivity to sodium lauryl sulphate. Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to those affected.

### Oral mucosa… [^117VVUjs]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Changes indicative of disease are seen as alterations in the oral mucosa lining the mouth, which can reveal systemic conditions, such as diabetes or vitamin deficiency, or the local effects of chronic tobacco or alcohol use. The oral mucosa tends to heal faster and with less scar formation compared to the skin. The underlying mechanism remains unknown, but research suggests that extracellular vesicles might be involved. Classification Oral mucosa can be divided into three main categories based on function and histology: Thus, to check for malignant changes, a baseline biopsy and microscopic study of any whitened tissue may be indicated, especially if in a high-risk cancer category, such with a history of tobacco or alcohol use or are HPV positive. Hyperkeratinized tissue is also associated with the heat from smoking or hot fluids on the hard palate in the form of nicotinic stomatitis. A variable number of Fordyce spots or granules are scattered throughout the nonkeratinized tissue.

These are a normal variant, visible as small, yellowish bumps on the surface of the mucosa. They correspond to deposits of sebum from misplaced sebaceous glands in the submucosa that are usually associated with hair follicles.
- Protection: One of the main functions of the oral mucosa is to physically protect the underlying tissues from the mechanical forces, microbes and toxins in the mouth. Keratinised masticatory mucosa is tightly bound to the hard palate and gingivae. It accounts for 25% of all oral mucosa.
- Secretion: Saliva is the primary secretion of the oral mucosa. It has many functions including lubrication, pH buffering and immunity. The lubricating and antimicrobial functions of saliva are maintained mainly by resting; saliva results in a flushing effect and the clearance of oral debris and noxious agents. Saliva contains numerous antimicrobial proteins that help protect the oral ecosystem from infectious agent.

Clinical significance Infective Viral The majority of viral infections affecting the oral cavity are caused by the human herpes virus group. Each human herpes virus may present differently within the oral cavity. They are more likely to affect immunocompromised patients such as children and the senior population.
- Herpetic gingivostomatitis: A self-limiting viral infection which is caused by herpes simplex virus-1. It usually presents in young children and is very contagious. It is characterised by the presence of small oral blisters which break down and coalesce into ulcers.
- Herpes labialis: Reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus-1 triggered by sunlight, stress, and hormonal changes. It is characterised by the presence of crusting blisters on the upper lip.
- Chickenpox: A type of viral infection which is caused by varicella zoster virus and presents in children. Numerous itchy blisters are found on the face and body.

Blisters could also be found on inner cheek and palate of the mouth.
- Herpes zoster/shingles: Viral infection caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus and found in adults. Patients can present with acute pain before or after the onset of blisters. If viral reactivation occurs in the facial nerve, it can cause Ramsay–Hunt syndrome in which patients can develop facial paralysis, blisters around the ears and on the tongue, and loss of tongue sensation.
- Hand, foot, and mouth disease: A highly contagious viral infection which infects young children and is caused by coxsackie virus A16. It is characterised by presence of small blisters all over the limbs and the mouth.
- Measles: A highly infectious condition which is caused by measles virus. It most commonly presents in young children who have not been vaccinated. It is characterised by presence of white spots which rupture to form ulcers on the palate. Usually painless and singular.
