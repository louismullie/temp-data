## Question

I want detailed information about the management of heat stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for detailed information about the management of heat stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining heat stroke and establishing diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of "cool first, transfer second". Next, I will examine prehospital recognition and cooling logistics, followed by in-hospital cooling targets and supportive care. After that, I need to review what to avoid pharmacologically, consider special populations and disposition, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Heat stroke is a core temperature greater than 40°C with central nervous system abnormalities, and it is subclassified as exertional or classic; importantly, CNS dysfunction plus hyperthermia is the key, not the absolute number alone, and altered mental status with core temperature below 40°C should prompt alternative diagnoses rather than heat stroke, so I need to keep that differential in mind [^111AKQz1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management priorities; I should verify the foundational principle. Across contemporary guidelines, the highest-yield intervention is immediate, aggressive cooling — "cool first, transfer second" — because time is tissue and delays worsen outcomes; this is a strong, consistent theme in SCCM, WMS, and ACSM documents and is reflected in Olympic-level prehospital protocols as well [^114CSGe8] [^116yBKaN] [^111qmjnx].

> Next, I should review prehospital recognition and diagnostics, and I need to ensure I'm precise about temperature measurement. Rectal temperature is the gold standard for core assessment; axillary and tympanic measures are unreliable in this context, and in suspected heat stroke with altered sensorium, empiric active cooling should begin even if the exact core temperature is unknown or below 40°C, while I simultaneously assess mental status, vitals, and consider mimics like hyponatremia or hypoglycemia with point-of-care testing when feasible [^111AKQz1] [^114Uk5ij] [^111qmjnx].

> I will now examine cooling logistics in the field, and I should double-check the target and endpoint. Ice-water immersion is first-line when feasible; if not, use the fastest alternative available and continue cooling until the rectal temperature is below 39°C and mental status normalizes, ideally within 30 minutes; field stations using prepared ice-water tubs report excellent outcomes when protocols are followed, and Olympic guidance operationalizes a "heat deck" for this purpose [^111on882] [^114Ago8d] [^111qmjnx].

> Wait, let me verify the cooling rate threshold that operationalizes the 30-minute target. A cooling rate of at least 0.155°C/min is associated with achieving target temperature within 30 minutes across a range of starting temperatures, and observational data suggest lower mortality when cooling is achieved rapidly; while the certainty varies, this benchmark is pragmatic and widely adopted in recent guidelines [^116BBvT8] [^114Ago8d].

> Let me consider what to do when immersion is not possible, and I should confirm the hierarchy. Alternatives include aggressive evaporative/convective cooling with ice packs to the axillae and groin, continuous cold-water dousing with fans, and, in select settings, tarp-assisted cooling; these are less effective than immersion but still superior to passive cooling, and the key is to maximize the rate of temperature decline using available resources [^111VhPsJ] [^114CSGe8].

> Next, I should review in-hospital cooling and supportive care, and I need to ensure I don't overstate any single modality. Ice-water or cold-water immersion remains first-line in the ED when feasible, with targets of 38.3–38.8°C to avoid overshoot; simultaneous supportive care includes airway and breathing support, circulatory access, isotonic crystalloids guided by urine output and hemodynamics, and vasopressors for refractory shock after volume; continuous rectal temperature monitoring is preferred to avoid interrupting cooling, and I should remember that antipyretics are not helpful here [^115wL3eD] [^114rWGFs] [^1156oyH5].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid pharmacologically so I don't inadvertently cause harm. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and salicylates should be avoided because they do not improve cooling kinetics and carry risks of hepatotoxicity, AKI, and bleeding; dantrolene is not indicated and should not be used for heat stroke; and routine prophylactic antibiotics or antiseizure medications lack evidence and should be reserved for research contexts or specific clinical indications rather than prophylaxis [^1156oyH5] [^111PNrq1] [^11598rCG].

> I need to check disposition and special populations, and I should be careful not to overgeneralize. For exertional heat stroke in healthy individuals, if core temperature is below 39°C, mental status is normal, and there are no concerning features, discharge after a few hours of observation may be reasonable in experienced settings; for classic heat stroke, older adults, or those with comorbidities, transfer to higher-acuity care is recommended even if initial response looks favorable; pediatric patients follow similar principles with weight-based fluids and careful monitoring [^115yKaCn] [^114uD6WW] [^116575r8].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Suspect heat stroke with altered mental status in a hot environment; confirm with rectal temperature when possible but do not delay cooling; initiate immediate active cooling targeting below 39°C within 30 minutes; prioritize ice-water immersion when feasible; if not, use aggressive evaporative/convective cooling with ice packs; provide supportive ABCs and isotonic fluids without delaying cooling; avoid antipyretics and dantrolene; reassess mental status and vitals continuously; and disposition based on type of heat stroke, comorbidities, and response, with return-to-activity planning after recovery [^114CSGe8] [^116yBKaN] [^114rWGFs].

> But wait, what about return-to-activity and secondary prevention; I should confirm the staging and timelines. After exertional heat stroke, hold activity for at least 7 days, then progress through a staged re-acclimatization over 2–4 weeks in cool conditions before heat exposure, with medical clearance contingent on normal end-organ function; athletes with prior EHS have a higher recurrence risk, so education, acclimatization, and risk-factor modification are essential [^114sxouC] [^116V35N9] [^114KFW37].

> I should double-check key knowledge gaps so we don't overstate certainties. Optimal cooling rates, the best combinations when immersion is not feasible, the role of biomarkers to predict organ failure, and the potential utility of immunomodulators or anticoagulants remain unresolved; guidelines emphasize research needs and caution against extrapolating beyond current evidence, which reinforces the primacy of rapid cooling and supportive care while we await higher-certainty data [^112XFoG3] [^1139c6TX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is crisp and actionable: heat stroke is a time-critical emergency defined by hyperthermia with CNS dysfunction; immediate, aggressive cooling to below 39°C within 30 minutes is the cornerstone; ice-water immersion is first-line when available; avoid antipyretics and dantrolene; deliver supportive care in parallel; tailor disposition to phenotype and comorbidity; and plan staged return-to-activity with risk mitigation, as this strategy offers the best chance to prevent death and long-term neurologic injury [^114CSGe8] [^116yBKaN] [^115wL3eD].

Heat stroke is a **medical emergency** characterized by core temperature ≥ 40°C with CNS dysfunction [^112VCsRA]. Immediate, aggressive cooling is the cornerstone of care [^114CSGe8], with **ice-water immersion as first-line** [^111on882] when feasible, targeting 38.3–38.8°C within 30 minutes [^115wL3eD] [^114Ago8d]. If immersion is not possible, use ice packs, misting/fanning, or cold IV fluids, and avoid antipyretics, dantrolene, or cooling blankets [^1156oyH5] [^111PNrq1] [^117Thi3A]. Supportive care includes airway protection, isotonic IV fluids, and monitoring for complications such as rhabdomyolysis, AKI, and coagulopathy [^114rWGFs] [^1139c6TX]. Early recognition and rapid cooling reduce mortality and neurologic sequelae [^116yBKaN] [^114Ago8d].

---

## Clinical recognition and diagnosis

- **Definition**: Core temperature ≥ 40°C with CNS dysfunction (altered mental status, seizures, coma) [^112VCsRA] [^11359QL1].
- **Types**: Classic (non-exertional) and exertional (associated with strenuous activity) [^112VCsRA] [^113LrE61].
- **Core temperature measurement**: Rectal thermometry is the gold standard; avoid tympanic or oral measurements due to inaccuracy [^111AKQz1] [^112MNNqE].

---

## Immediate management priorities

### Rapid cooling (within 30 minutes)

- **First-line therapy**: Ice-water immersion (1–5°C) or cold-water immersion (9–12°C) [^111on882] [^112F6xLA].
- **Alternative methods**: If immersion is not feasible, use ice packs to axillae/groin, misting with fans, or cold IV fluids [^111VhPsJ] [^116575r8].
- **Target temperature**: 38.3–38.8°C; avoid overshooting to hypothermia [^115wL3eD] [^112zZ1BS].
- **Cooling rate**: Aim for ≥ 0.155°C/min to reach target within 30 minutes [^116BBvT8] [^114Ago8d].

---

### Supportive care

- **Airway and breathing**: Secure airway if altered mental status; provide supplemental oxygen [^114rWGFs].
- **Circulation**: Establish IV access; give isotonic fluids (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 1–2 L for adults or 20 mL/kg for pediatrics [^116575r8] [^111b4Ryv].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous rectal temperature, cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and urine output [^114rWGFs].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Avoid **antipyretics** — acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and salicylates are ineffective and may cause harm (e.g. hepatotoxicity, bleeding) [^1156oyH5]. Do not use **dantrolene**; it does not improve outcomes and may prolong cooling [^111PNrq1]. Prophylactic antibiotics or antiseizure medications are not recommended outside research settings [^11598rCG].

---

## Complications and monitoring

- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Monitor CK, electrolytes, and renal function; treat with aggressive IV fluids and urine alkalinization if indicated [^notfound].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Monitor urine output and renal function; consider renal replacement therapy if severe [^notfound].
- **Coagulopathy and DIC**: Monitor PT/INR, aPTT, platelets, and fibrinogen; transfuse as indicated [^notfound].
- **Neurologic sequelae**: Persistent cognitive impairment, seizures, and focal deficits may occur [^111on882].

---

## Disposition and follow-up

Hospitalization is required for all patients with heat stroke for **monitoring and supportive care** [^114uJVZC]. Return-to-activity should be **gradual**, with at least 7 days off after discharge, then staged reintroduction over 2–4 weeks with medical clearance [^114sxouC] [^116V35N9].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Hydration**: Maintain euhydration; use IV fluids for heat stroke, oral fluids for milder illness [^116575r8] [^111b4Ryv].
- **Acclimatization**: Gradual exposure to heat over 7–14 days [^notfound].
- **Environmental awareness**: Avoid strenuous activity in extreme heat; use WBGT guidelines [^113LLtgE].
- **Education**: Train athletes, workers, and healthcare providers on recognition and management [^111J78Kb].

---

## Special considerations

Pediatric patients follow the same cooling principles with **weight-based fluid resuscitation** [^116575r8]. Elderly patients have higher mortality and require **close monitoring for complications** [^115vD9jR]. Patients with chronic illness (e.g. cardiovascular, diabetes) are at **increased risk** and need tailored management [^114uJVZC].

---

## Evidence-based outcomes

Rapid cooling within 30 minutes is associated with **lower mortality and improved neurologic outcomes** [^114Ago8d] [^116yBKaN]. Ice-water immersion achieves the fastest cooling rates and is the preferred method when feasible [^111on882] [^114tQACL].

---

Heat stroke management hinges on **rapid recognition and aggressive cooling** to 38.3–38.8°C within 30 minutes, with supportive care and avoidance of harmful medications. Early, protocolized care reduces mortality and neurologic sequelae [^114Ago8d] [^116yBKaN].

Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) heat stroke guideline methodology — The intended audience is all individuals who provide care for patients with heat stroke in both the pre-hospital and acute care settings, including physicians, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, nurses, respiratory therapists, medical and nursing directors, athletic trainers, coaches, and other allied health and/or administrative professionals. The guideline was developed by an international panel of experts across critical care and related fields and plus one patient representative. Conflict-of-interest management required disclosure per the SCCM's policy, was assessed at each phase and every panel meeting, and panel members with a COI were excluded from voting on a specific recommendation if a COI was present; there were no COIs that prohibited participation in discussion or voting, and there was no input from industry to produce these guidelines. Recommendations were formulated by prioritizing Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions with clinical practice importance and available evidence, focusing on patients with heat stroke as opposed to other less severe forms of heat-related illness; the final PICO questions selected (n = 7) are listed in Table 1. Evidence review involved searches from inception (of each database) through May 2024 by a medical librarian using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; the search strategy included all ages and did not restrict to subpopulations; clinical data were systematically reviewed for each PICO question, and meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model with RevMan.

Clinical management and return to activity after exertional heat stroke (EHS) are framed by emergency care priorities: EHS is a true medical emergency with potential for irreversible organ injury and death; optimal management is promoted by a synchronized chain of survival with rapid recognition and management and accurate communication between care teams; health care providers should understand the definitions, etiologies, and nuances of EHE, EHI, and EHS; early identification and rapid total body cooling of an athlete with suspected EHS is essential for survival, and time is tissue; recovery is variable and likely related to the duration of severe hyperthermia, with those treated before cell injury and with exaggerated acute phase response usually returning to full activity within a few weeks, whereas more complicated and prolonged courses require a graduated and supervised return to prior activity levels; prevention relies on recognizing and mitigating well described risk factors addressed through leadership, policy, and on-site health care.

Rationale

Predicted increases in heat-related weather phenomena will result in increasing heat exposures and heat injuries, like heat stroke. Prompt recognition, early intervention, and evidence-based management are necessary to optimize outcomes.

Objectives

The objective of these guidelines was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with heat stroke.

Design

The Society of Critical Care Medicine convened a multidisciplinary panel of 18 international clinicians, comprising expertise in critical care, emergency medicine, neurocritical care, surgery, trauma/burn surgery, sports medicine, athletic training, military medicine, nursing, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, and one patient representative. The panel also included a guidelines methodologist specialized in developing evidence-based recommendations in alignment with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Conflict-of-interest policies were strictly followed during all phases of guidelines development including panel selection and voting.

Methods

The panel members identified Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes questions in two main areas: cooling modalities and medications that affect temperature. A systematic review for each question was conducted to identify the best available evidence, statistically analyze the evidence, and assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. The GRADE evidence-to-decision framework was used to formulate the recommendations. Good practice statements were included to provide additional clinical guidance.

Results

The panel generated two strong recommendations, five good practice statements and one "only-in-the-context of research" statement. Active cooling measures are recommended over passive cooling methods, with cold- or ice-water immersion achieving the fastest cooling rate. This method should be prioritized where available. In heat stroke patients, there is no evidence to support pharmacological interventions that affect temperature control and they should be avoided.

Conclusions

The guidelines task force provided recommendations for the management of patients with heat stroke. These recommendations should be considered along with the patient's clinical status and available resources.

### Heat-related illnesses [^113LrE61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Climate change is anticipated to continue to adversely affect public health, with heat stress the predominant threat. Accordingly, heat-related illness is predicted to increase as extremely hot days become more frequent. Heat stroke, the most serious heat-related illness, is a medical emergency that may be fatal if it is not promptly recognized, addressed with early and rapid cooling, and accompanied by multidisciplinary supportive care as clinically indicated. Heat stroke is a preventable illness that occurs in 2 distinct forms-classic and exertional-that have distinct demographic profiles and clinical courses but similar management paradigms.

### Prehospital management of exertional heat stroke at sports competitions: international olympic committee adverse weather impact expert working group for the olympic games tokyo 2020 [^111qmjnx]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This document aimed to summarise the key components of exertional heat stroke (EHS) prehospital management.

Methods

Members of the International Olympic Committee Adverse Weather Impact Expert Working Group for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 summarised the current best practice regarding the EHS prehospital management.

Results

Sports competitions that are scheduled under high environmental heat stress or those that include events with high metabolic demands should implement and adopt policy and procedures for EHS prehospital management. The basic principles of EHS prehospital care are: early recognition, early diagnosis, rapid, on-site cooling and advanced clinical care. In order to achieve these principles, medical organisers must establish an area called the heat deck within or adjacent to the main medical tent that is optimised for EHS diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Once admitted to the heat deck, the rectal temperature of the athlete with suspected EHS is assessed to confirm an elevated core body temperature. After EHS is diagnosed, the athlete must be cooled on-site until the rectal temperature is below 39°C. While cooling the athlete, medical providers are recommended to conduct a blood analysis to rule out exercise-associated hyponatraemia or hypoglycaemia, provided that this can be safely performed without interrupting cooling. The athlete is transported to advanced care for a full medical evaluation only after the treatment has been provided on-site.

Conclusions

A coordination of care among all medical stakeholders at the sports venue, during transport, and at the hospital is warranted to ensure effective management is provided to the EHS athlete.

### Heat-related illness [^112SEcMJ]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heat-related illness is a set of preventable conditions ranging from mild forms (e.g., heat exhaustion, heat cramps) to potentially fatal heat stroke. Hot and humid conditions challenge cardiovascular compensatory mechanisms. Once core temperature reaches 104°F (40°C), cellular damage occurs, initiating a cascade of events that may lead to organ failure and death. Early recognition of symptoms and accurate measurement of core temperature are crucial to rapid diagnosis. Milder forms of heat-related illness are manifested by symptoms such as headache, weakness, dizziness, and an inability to continue activity. These are managed by supportive measures including hydration and moving the patient to a cool place. Hyperthermia and central nervous system symptoms should prompt an evaluation for heat stroke. Initial treatments should focus on lowering core temperature through cold water immersion. Applying ice packs to the head, neck, axilla, and groin is an alternative. Additional measures include transporting the patient to a cool environment, removing excess clothing, and intravenous hydration. Delayed access to cooling is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with heat stroke. Identification of at-risk groups can help physicians and community health agencies provide preventive measures.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of heat illness: 2024 update [^114rWGFs]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hospital and field management of heat stroke — Field medical stations using immediate cooling in prepared tubs with an ice-water slurry and observation before discharge have reported no fatalities or lingering morbidity; in the absence of medically supervised, pre-established field-cooling protocols, patients with heat stroke should be transported to a capable medical facility, and those whose mental status or physical examination has not returned to baseline should also be transferred, with cooling measures continued during transport; in hospital, the primary goals are rapidly lowering core temperature and supporting organ system function, and supportive care may include supplemental oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation, intravascular or intraosseous access, intravenous isotonic crystalloid, bladder catheterization to monitor urine output and temperature, and vasopressors after adequate volume resuscitation, undertaken simultaneously with cooling; the best available evidence supports ice-water immersion as the most rapid, effective treatment for young, athletic patients with EHS.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) temperature management includes that sources of hyperthermia (temperature > 38°C) should be identified and treated, and antipyretic medications should be administered to lower temperature in hyperthermic patients with stroke. The benefit of induced hypothermia for treating patients with ischemic stroke is not well established and hypothermia should be offered only in the context of ongoing clinical trials. Supporting observational data note that peak temperature in the first 24 hours < 37°C and > 39°C was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death compared with normothermia in 9366 patients with AIS.

ACSM return-to-activity (RTA) considerations after exertional heat stroke (EHS) or exertional heat illness (EHI) state that a detailed history and physical examination including unique intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, the timing of treatment, and the rate of cooling must be considered in the RTA decision. The athlete should refrain from exercise for at least 7 d after release from initial medical care, at which time the clinician will address the clinical course of the heat stroke incident and carefully assess the status of end-organ function. The clinician should carefully address any intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with the EHS event. When medically eligible for RTA/RTP based on the return of normal end organ function, an individual can begin exercise in a cool environment and gradually increase the duration, intensity, and heat exposure over 2 to 4 wk to initiate environmental acclimatization, improve fitness, and demonstrate heat tolerance. If return to vigorous activity and evidence of the patient's ability to adapt to exercise-heat stress over several days is not accomplished within 4 to 6 wk, consider referral to a physician with experience in heat related disorders for further evaluation that may include HTT in a controlled setting. An athlete may be allowed to resume full competition between 2 and 4 wk after demonstrating sports-specific exercise acclimatization and heat tolerance with no abnormal symptoms or test results during the re-acclimatization period.

Society of Critical Care Medicine heat stroke — active cooling recommendations and targets: Mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) cases is high and morbidity persists, as "mortality rates in patients requiring ICU care for heat stroke approach 60% and approximately 30% of heat stroke survivors experience some form of long-term cognitive or motor dysfunction". The method with the fastest cooling rate is immersion, as "The method with the fastest cooling rate is ice-water and cold-water immersion (water temperature ≤ 12°C)". When immersion is not feasible, "clinicians should choose a method or combination of methods that will achieve a rapid rate of temperature reduction (Fig. 1) and reach the target temperature within 30 minutes of onset of heat stroke symptoms", and "restoring body temperature to "normal" physiologic levels (e.g., < 39°C) can reverse life threatening, pathophysiologic processes". The panel "issued a strong recommendation in favor of active cooling methods", and Good Practice Statement 1 states: "Clinicians should prioritize cooling methods that achieve the most rapid rate of cooling, which is ice-water immersion (1–5°C) or cold-water immersion (9–12°C)".

### Prehospital management of exertional heat stroke at sports competitions for paralympic athletes [^1137484R]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

EHS prehospital care overview

Basic components of EHS prehospital care include: (1) early recognition, (2) early diagnosis, (3) rapid, on-site cooling and (4) advanced clinical care. Unlike other sports-related medical emergency (eg, spinal injury, brain trauma, complex fracture), EHS requires the treatment to be completed on-site first, before the patient is transported to the advanced care. This is due to the fact that the duration of sustained hyperthermia is known to dictate patient prognosis. A delay in appropriate recognition, diagnosis and cooling can lead to catastrophic outcome. Current clinical best practice suggests that EHS patients must be cooled until their core body temperature is below 39°C within 30 min of the onset. Therefore, it becomes critical that medical providers working at sporting events with risk of EHS are well equipped with skills and resources to execute (1) rectal temperature assessment to confirm the diagnosis, (2) rapid cooling using whole-body cold-water immersion and (3) follow-up examination to assess discharge readiness.

When possible, it may be of benefit to acquire the athlete's medical history and ongoing therapy prior to the event since impairment type indicated by the competition class does not necessarily represent whether the athlete is predisposed to increase thermoregulatory strain. For example, eligibility in the Quad class of wheelchair tennis is not restricted to athletes with tetraplegia. Consequently, a player with a spinal cord injury at the C8 level or above versus a player with an upper limb myopathy will both be eligible, but the former is at higher risk for exertional heat illness. If personal medical information cannot be acquired due to medical privacy reasons, organisers of the event are advised to request participating athletes and staff to report any foreseeable heat-related issues prior to the day of the competition. Some of the key questions to ask include: (1) presence of thermoregulatory impairment and the reason, (2) history of exertional heat illness, (3) baseline blood pressure, if lower than the reference value and (4) any intake of medication that may alter the interpretation of vital signs.

Hospital treatment — transport, goals, and supportive care for heat stroke: Generally, patients with heat stroke should be transported to a medical facility capable of critical care management of patients with multiple organ failure, with exceptions for soldiers or athletes treated in the field with ice‑water immersion immediately at the onset of EHS and complete resolution of symptoms who can be observed in a medical station or infirmary. In a hospital setting, the primary goals are rapidly lowering core body temperature and supporting organ system function because patients may develop multiple organ failure with shock, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and intestinal ischemia. Depending on clinical status, supportive treatment may include supplemental oxygen, intubation and mechanical ventilation, intravascular access, intravenous isotonic crystalloid solution, bladder catheterization to monitor urine output, and vasopressors to support blood pressure after adequate volume resuscitation.

The guideline recognizes feasibility constraints and adds that clinicians are advised to select the method or combination of methods that will achieve the fastest rate of temperature reduction. Case-series data cited found higher mortality (16% vs. 0%) with insufficient cooling (< 0.15°C/min) and a higher rate of medical complications (risk ratio [RR], 4.57; 95% CI, 3.42–6.28).

Hyperthermia/heat exposure management and complications — For patients with signs and symptoms of heat stroke, rapid cooling takes priority over other interventions (e.g., cardiac monitoring, IV access). Heat stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias independent of drug ingestion/overdose and has also been associated with cerebral edema. Controversy: shivering may occur while treating heat stroke. It is uncertain how harmful shivering is to heat stroke patients. Cooling should be continued until the above temperature and mental status goals are met. Treat shivering as above. Research does not demonstrate the value of one benzodiazepine over another in shivering patients or any value of other medications.

Temperature measurement and empiric cooling — assessment of suspected heat stroke: Accurate measurement of core temperature is an important step in differentiating heat stroke from less severe heat illness, as altered mental status with a core temperature below 40 °C should not be attributed to heat stroke; initial assessment and aggressive cooling should be implemented based on clinical suspicion, regardless of the degree of hyperthermia or mode of measurement. When assessing heat illness, we recommend using rectal temperature as the preferred measure for core temperature (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence), and in a hyperthermic patient with an altered sensorium and a presentation suspicious for heat stroke, we recommend the empiric use of active cooling even if the core temperature is unknown or measured and below the diagnostic threshold of 40 °C (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Prehospital management of exertional heat stroke at sports competitions for paralympic athletes [^115fqrxe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To adapt key components of exertional heat stroke (EHS) prehospital management proposed by the Intenational Olympic Committee Adverse Weather Impact Expert Working Group for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 so that it is applicable for the Paralympic athletes.

Methods

An expert working group representing members with research, clinical and lived sports experience from a Para sports perspective reviewed and revised the IOC consensus document of current best practice regarding the prehospital management of EHS.

Results

Similar to Olympic competitions, Paralympic competitions are also scheduled under high environmental heat stress; thus, policies and procedures for EHS prehospital management should also be established and followed. For Olympic athletes, the basic principles of EHS prehospital care are: early recognition, early diagnosis, rapid, on-site cooling and advanced clinical care. Although these principles also apply for Paralympic athletes, slight differences related to athlete physiology (eg, autonomic dysfunction) and mechanisms for hands-on management (eg, transferring the collapsed athlete or techniques for whole-body cooling) may require adaptation for care of the Paralympic athlete.

Conclusions

Prehospital management of EHS in the Paralympic setting employs the same procedures as for Olympic athletes with some important alterations.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^116SjYNd]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

ACSM expert consensus — exertional heat stroke (EHS) is defined as a life-threatening condition with central nervous system disturbances and hyperthermia, usually > 40°C rectal temperature; EHS is usually associated with body temperature > 40°C with multisystem distress. A presenting core temperature ≥ 40°C alone is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of EHS, and core temperature values ≥ 40°C have been documented during high-intensity physical activity in both warm and hot weather with no apparent adverse effects on performance or health. Signs and symptoms suggesting EHS include persistent mental status changes, delirium, loss of ambulatory function (ataxia), seizure, coma, and high rectal temperature, > 40°C (> 104°F). Clinical management following EHS may require critical care interventions for organ and tissue damage induced by hyperthermia and sequelae, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

### Management of heat-related illness and injury in the ICU: a concise definitive review [^1139c6TX]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The increasing frequency of extreme heat events has led to a growing number of heat-related injuries and illnesses in ICUs. The objective of this review was to summarize and critically appraise evidence for the management of heat-related illnesses and injuries for critical care multiprofessionals.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline, Embase, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from inception through August 2023 for studies reporting on heat-related injury and illness in the setting of the ICU.

Study Selection

English-language systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and observational studies were prioritized for review. Bibliographies from retrieved articles were scanned for articles that may have been missed.

Data Extraction

Data regarding study methodology, patient population, management strategy, and clinical outcomes were qualitatively assessed.

Data Synthesis

Several risk factors and prognostic indicators for patients diagnosed with heat-related illness and injury have been identified and reported in the literature. Effective management of these patients has included various cooling methods and fluid replenishment. Drug therapy is not effective. Multiple organ dysfunction, neurologic injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are common complications of heat stroke and must be managed accordingly. Burn injury from contact with hot surfaces or pavement can occur, requiring careful evaluation and possible excision and grafting in severe cases.

Conclusions

The prevalence of heat-related illness and injury is increasing, and rapid initiation of appropriate therapies is necessary to optimize outcomes. Additional research is needed to identify effective methods and strategies to achieve rapid cooling, the role of immunomodulators and anticoagulant medications, the use of biomarkers to identify organ failure, and the role of artificial intelligence and precision medicine.

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) cooling endpoints and rectal temperature monitoring — When EHS is suspected or confirmed as the cause of collapse, initiating whole-body cooling is essential for favorable clinical outcomes. The recommendation to stop active cooling at ~38°C (101°F) to prevent hypothermia is not based on data showing adverse clinical outcomes, and most "overcooled" EHS casualties are in the 35°C to 36°C (95°F to 97°F) rectal temperature range, which is not associated with any known adverse outcomes. Athletes with indwelling rectal thermistors can be monitored continuously without interrupting body cooling, whereas repeatedly measuring rectal temperature when an indwelling thermistor is not available interrupts body cooling and reduces the overall cooling rate. Simply continuing uninterrupted cooling until the victim clinically demonstrates a return to normal central nervous system (CNS) function (e.g., "wakes up" with eyes open, normal behavior, and conversation), heart rate, and blood pressure may be a more effective cooling strategy in this clinical scenario.

Hydration in heat illness and heat stroke — euhydration is an important factor in reducing hyperthermia, and dehydration predisposes patients to hyperthermia by decreasing sweat rates and increases thermal strain at a given temperature. We recommend that dehydration be minimized in heat illness and, for patients with mild and moderate heat illness, we recommend using oral fluid replacement as first-line therapy for dehydration. For heat stroke, we recommend the use of intravenous fluids, not oral, for rehydration, and any effort to provide hydration in suspected heat stroke should not delay rapid whole-body cooling. As those with exertional heat stroke (EHS) may be volume depleted, we recommend initiating rehydration treatment with 1–2 L of isotonic (0.9% sodium chloride or lactated Ringer's) fluids for adult patients or 20 mL/kg estimated body weight for pediatric patients.

Conclusion

Maximising survival and minimising sequela from EHS requires following basic principles: early recognition, early diagnosis, rapid, on-site cooling and advanced clinical care. This requires the close coordination of all medical stakeholders who are providing care at a sports venue, during transport and at hospital. It is recommended that a thorough review of the EHS medical protocols together with hands-on scenario training should be carried out with all the medical staff prior to competition.

What are the new findings?

The current document outlines the steps that should be taken to properly identify, treat and manage athletes with suspected exertional heat stroke (EHS) using the unique context of an elite, large-scale sports competition as an example.
A designated area for EHS assessment and treatment should be established to ensure that all athletes diagnosed with EHS are cooled first before being transported to the hospital for a follow-up evaluation.
A rectal temperature probe should be available for the primary diagnosis of EHS. A point-of-care blood analysis device should be available to conduct blood sodium and blood glucose analysis for a differential diagnosis of the collapsed athlete's medical condition.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

The chief medical officer of mass participation events may implement the algorithms presented in the current document as part of the policy and procedures for exertional heat stroke (EHS) prehospital management.
While rigorous infection prevention measures should be implemented, general processes required for the prehospital management of EHS can be considered a low risk for aerosol transmission. Medical providers should be reminded to follow the general rules of triage to prioritise the assessment and treatment of athletes that require more immediate attention to increase the chance of survival (eg, sudden cardiac arrest > EHS > suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection).

### Heat stroke management updates: a description of the development of a novel in-emergency department cold-water immersion protocol and guide for implementation [^116cvvUu]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The growing prevalence of heat stroke as a public health issue, exacerbated by climate change and increasing global temperatures, demands an immediate and strategic response to prevent weather-related morbidity and mortality. Heat stroke results from the body's inability to cope with excessive heat, leading to systemic inflammatory responses, cellular apoptosis, and potential multiorgan dysfunction or failure. However, little information explicitly outlines how to perform cold-water immersion in the emergency department (ED), including potential patient selection, how much water or ice to use, target temperatures, when to stop, and complications or challenges with the process. This narrative explores implementing a comprehensive protocol for total-body cold-water immersion developed in an ED setting, a method proven effective in rapidly reducing core body temperatures, with the goal of reducing mortality and morbidity rates associated with heat-related illnesses. The protocol involves immediate temperature assessment, followed by cold-water immersion for patients with altered mental status and core temperatures above 40 °C. Discussion about the development of the process and results from applying the protocol during the summer of 2023, including cooling rates and patient outcomes, is also included. Additionally, the article addresses challenges and lessons learned during the protocol's implementation, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration, staff education, and the adaptation of ED infrastructure to support this lifesaving treatment based on its use during the last 3 years. The successful resolution of the presented cases, along with the protocol's potential for widespread adoption, illustrates the critical role of cold-water immersion in enhancing ED responses to heat stroke, offering a blueprint for future research and the development of similar protocols across health care settings. This work contributes to the evolving landscape of emergency medicine and aligns with the global effort to combat the adverse health effects of climate change.

### Preventative strategies and interventions to improve outcomes during heatwaves [^116SmJCo]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Extreme weather events including recently experienced prolonged heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change. Vulnerable groups, and particularly older persons, are at increased risk of heat-related illness and mortality. Multimodal interventions that incorporate community, primary and secondary care programmes are required. Social programmes such as early warning systems, regional heat plans and community-led initiatives that specifically target the isolated, dependent older person are protective. Establishing clear and effective communication on health promotion and preventative measures is the key. Energy-efficient building design and eco-city planning are vital to reduce the impact of heatwaves at both a population and individual level. Anticipatory strategies should be adopted to ensure ample access to fluids, target barriers to increase oral intake and allow early identification of intercurrent illness, along with regular medication reviews. Prompt management of risk factors for the development of heat-related illness and treatment of complications such as heat stroke and cardiovascular events are keys to reducing the negative health impact of extreme heat in at-risk populations. Morbidity and mortality in heatwaves should be preventable. Evidence-based interventions are available to mitigate and prevent the negative health impact of extreme heat and should be implemented in all residential settings.

### Cooling and hemodynamic management in heatstroke: practical recommendations [^112WKVxb]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This review revealed the need for more conclusive research aimed at identifying the optimal cooling methods and hemodynamic management of heatstroke. Although the recommendations suggested should be taken cautiously, they were based on a thorough review of the available evidence and hence reflect the current state of knowledge. Until further evidence is established, these could serve as a practical approach for the cooling and hemodynamic management of heatstroke, a condition predicted to become more frequent in epidemic form in the near future.

Heat stroke — Heat stroke is a medical emergency requiring aggressive cooling measures and hospitalization for support. A presumptive diagnosis of heat stroke is made in the field when people have body temperature ≥ 41°C (≥ 104°F) and marked alteration of mental status, including delirium, convulsions, or coma; if a thermometer is available, a rectal temperature is the most reliable way to check the temperature of someone with suspected heat stroke, and an axillary temperature might give a reasonable estimation. Onset can be acute (also known as exertional), characterized by collapse while exercising in the heat, usually with profuse sweating, or gradual or non-exertional (also referred to as classic or epidemic), occurring in chronically ill people experiencing passive exposure to heat over several days. Heat stroke is life-threatening, and many complications occur in the first 24–48 hours, including liver or kidney damage and abnormal bleeding; most victims have significant dehydration, and many require hospital intensive care management to replace fluid losses. If evacuation to a hospital is delayed, patients should be monitored closely for several hours for temperature swings.

Cooling modalities — Recommendation 1 for heat stroke states: "We recommend active cooling methods over passive cooling in patients with heat stroke (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Remarks add that "Cold-water immersion or ice-water immersion will result in the fastest rate of temperature reduction and shortest time to target temperature (< 39°C)". A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in participants with experimental exertional hyperthermia reported that "A faster cooling rate was recognized with active vs. passive cooling by a mean of 0.04°C/min (95% CI, 0.03–0.05°C/min)", and "The overall certainty of evidence for the recommendation is very low, primarily due to indirectness (experimental exertional hyperthermia vs. actual heat stroke subjects), imprecision, and inconsistency". Clinical outcome data were limited: "There were insufficient data directly comparing active vs. passive cooling methods on clinical outcomes such as survival, length of stay, organ dysfunction, and complications", with mortality reported as "0% to 26.5%" in exertional heat stroke, "19% to 71.4%" in classic heat stroke, and pediatric series reporting "25% (n = 7) and 60% (n = 50)".

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) recurrence risk and multiple-hit factors — Athletes with an EHS episode are at higher risk for a subsequent event. In an 11.4-km warm-hot weather road race, the relative risk of a second EHS was 3.3 in the 2 years following the initial episode and the relative risk dropped to 1.3 in the 3 to 5 years following the episode based on a total of 333 EHS patients among 174,853 finishers. Studies of French and U.S. military personnel show an association between hospitalization for EHS following a previous episode, and among active-duty soldiers, those with a prior serious exertional heat illness (EHI) event had four-fold greater odds of experiencing a mild EHI event and those with a prior mild EHI had a 1.8-fold greater risk of having a serious EHI event at a future date. An important risk factor for EHS is extrinsic pressure to perform beyond the level of acclimatization or fitness, leadership plays an important role in the evolution and prevention of EHI and EHS, and the presence of a predisposing factor on a particular day increases the risk of heat stroke in subsequent days and sets up the "multiple-hit hypothesis".

ACSM staged return to activity after exertional heat stroke (EHS) outlines seven sequential stages from medical recovery to full sport participation. Stage 1 includes activities of daily living for 1 to 2 wk with a gradual increase in home activities without fatigue. Stage 2 uses a self‑paced comfortable walk in low heat stress, with return to practice as a walk‑through if conditions are not stressful or in an air‑conditioned area. Stage 3 advances to walking at 3.5 mph in low heat stress for 60 min at HR < 140 bpm or < 70% of age adjusted Maximal HR. Stage 4 adds walk and run in low heat stress with 60 min of progressively increasing run to walk ratio until constant run for 60 min. Stage 5 runs in ambient warm or hot conditions with 60 min of progressively increasing run until constant run for 60 min. Stage 6 participates in practice in ambient conditions, initially in sports‑specific drills with equipment then progressing to training and scrimmage. Stage 7 is return to sport with normal game or competition in ambient conditions, exemplified by Meet 1 — run to finish the race and Meet 2 — race to place in the race.

Exertional heat illness (EHI) definition and pathophysiology — EHI is characterized by organ damage and dysfunction in the presence of hyperthermia without central nervous system changes seen in exertional heat stroke (EHS), may follow delayed recognition and/or inadequate cooling of EHS, and can lead to dysfunction that may persist for several weeks; during exercise in the heat, cardiac output is increased to support high skin and muscle blood flow at the expense of renal and splanchnic blood flow, and when compensatory responses are insufficient, skin, muscle, and even brain blood flow are compromised; as ambient temperature rises, sweating increases and sweat evaporation becomes the primary heat transfer mechanism, and unreplaced sweating fluid losses reduce plasma volume, elevate physiological strain, impair work capabilities, and increase the risk of exertional heat illness; more severe illness can result in liver or kidney failure requiring organ transplantation for survival.

### Impact of fever prevention in brain-injured patients (INTREPID): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^113TU6kJ]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple studies demonstrate that fever/elevated temperature is associated with poor outcomes in patients with vascular brain injury; however, there are no conclusive studies that demonstrate that fever prevention/controlled normothermia is associated with better outcomes. The primary objective of the INTREPID (Impact of Fever Prevention in Brain-Injured Patients) trial is to test the hypothesis that fever prevention is superior to standard temperature management in patients with acute vascular brain injury.

Methods

INTREPID is a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint study of fever prevention versus usual care in patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. The fever prevention intervention utilizes the Arctic Sun System and will be compared to standard care patients in whom fever may spontaneously develop. Ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage patients will be included within disease-specific time-windows. Both awake and sedated patients will be included, and treatment is initiated immediately upon enrollment. Eligible patients are expected to require intensive care for at least 72 h post-injury, will not be deemed unlikely to survive without severe disability, and will be treated for up to 14 days, or until deemed ready for discharge from the ICU, whichever comes first. Fifty sites in the USA and worldwide will participate, with a target enrollment of 1176 patients (1000 evaluable). The target temperature is 37.0 °C. The primary efficacy outcome is the total fever burden by °C-h, defined as the area under the temperature curve above 37.9 °C. The primary secondary outcome, on which the sample size is based, is the modified Rankin Scale Score at 3 months. All efficacy analyses including the primary and key secondary endpoints will be primarily based on an intention-to-treat population. Analysis of the as-treated and per protocol populations will also be performed on the primary and key secondary endpoints as sensitivity analyses.

Discussion

The INTREPID trial will provide the first results of the impact of a pivotal fever prevention intervention in patients with acute stroke (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02996266; registered prospectively 05DEC2016).

In conclusion, these results offer insight into the influence created by opportunities at international sporting events for medical providers to acquire new skills regarding EHS prehospital management. To apply and transfer the acquired knowledge and skills to other sporting events and competition levels, there is a need for continued education to increase the number of stakeholders who support EHS prehospital management. Organisational and financial support is also critical to establishing an ideal prehospital medical system to treat EHS.

Heat stress progression — adaptation versus exertional heat illness — Figure 1 diagrams progression from exercise heat stress to exertional heat illness; if the physiological strain is not excessive, multiple heat exposures stimulate adaptations such as heat acclimatization and acquired thermal (heat) tolerance that help to improve performance in the heat and protect from exertional heat illness, whereas excessive physiological strain induces pathological events including increased gut permeability, endotoxemia, exaggerated acute phase response and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, coagulopathy (DIC), and cell death, with reduced cerebral blood flow and coagulopathy leading to dysfunction of the CNS and changes associated with EHS and EHI; organ damage involves brain, liver, intestine, kidney, and skeletal muscle; preliminary research reports long-term risks with EHS/EHI of a 3.9 times higher incidence of major cardiovascular events, a 5.5 times greater incidence of ischemic stroke, and a 1.5 times greater incidence of atrial fibrillation during a 14-year follow-up period.

### Management of heatstroke and heat exhaustion [^114NSMx6]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are part of a continuum of heat-related illness. Both are common and preventable conditions affecting diverse patients. Recent research has identified a cascade of inflammatory pathologic events that begins with mild heat exhaustion and, if uninterrupted, can lead eventually to multiorgan failure and death. Heat exhaustion is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, headache, and nausea. Treatment involves monitoring the patient in a cool, shady environment and ensuring adequate hydration. Untreated heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke, a much more serious illness involving central nervous system dysfunction such as delirium and coma. Other systemic effects, including rhabdomyolysis, hepatic failure, arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and even death, are not uncommon. Prompt recognition and immediate cooling through evaporation or full-body ice-water immersion are crucial. Physicians also must monitor electrolyte abnormalities, be alert to signs of renal or hepatic failure, and replace fluids in patients with heatstroke. Most experts believe that physicians and public health officials should focus greater attention on prevention. Programs involving identification of vulnerable individuals, dissemination of information about dangerous heat waves, and use of heat shelters may help prevent heat-related illness. These preventive measures, when paired with astute recognition of the early signs of heat-related illness, can allow physicians in the ambulatory setting to avert much of the morbidity and mortality associated with heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

### Heat-related illnesses [^114uJVZC]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Heat-related illnesses comprise a spectrum of syndromes resulting from disruption of thermoregulation in people exposed to high environmental heat. Symptoms range from heat edema and exercise-associated muscle cramps to exercise-associated collapse, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat stroke. Athletes, outdoor laborers, and military personnel are at greatest risk. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors increase the risk of heat-related illness, including medical conditions, environmental factors, medication use, and inadequate acclimatization. Proper recognition and treatment are effective in preventing adverse outcomes. Management of the mildest forms of heat-related illness (e.g., heat edema, exercise-associated muscle cramps) is largely supportive, and sequelae are rare. Heat exhaustion is characterized by cardiovascular hypoperfusion and a rectal core temperature up to 104°F without central nervous dysfunction. Mild cooling, rest, and hydration are recommended. Heat stroke is a medical emergency in which patients present with rectal core temperature of 105°F or greater, multiorgan damage, and central nervous dysfunction. Ice water or cold water immersion is recommended. Patients adequately cooled within 30 minutes have excellent outcomes. Patients with heat stroke generally require hospitalization to monitor for medical complications despite rapid cooling. People diagnosed with heat stroke or severe heat-related illness should refrain from physical activity for at least seven days after release from medical care, then gradually begin activity over two to four weeks. Acclimatization, adequate hydration, and avoidance of activities during extreme heat are the most effective measures to reduce the incidence of heat-related illnesses.

Treatments

Cooling and hydration are the fundamental treatments for heatstroke. However, once the trigger of HSIC is initiated, additional therapy may also be beneficial to control the sequential events. Since inflammation and coagulation play significant roles in the pathophysiology of heatstroke, antiinflammatory and anticoagulant therapies are rational adjuncts for treatment to explore. In addition, in the case of exertional heatstroke, the management of toxic substances spilled out from the rhabdomyocytes is also expected.

### Heat stroke… [^1156Mto1]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Some of the first cells in the body to be affected are in the brain. These cells are sensitive to temperature changes. The heart also must work harder to push blood to the skin. As a person's temperature gets closer to the air temperature, the rate of heat transferred to the skin decreases. Evaporation of sweat also decreases with higher humidity. Sweating leads to further dehydration and loss of electrolytes and minerals vital for muscle and nerve cell function. As the body is no longer able to cool itself by sweating, heart rate and breathing increase to compensate. This can be aggravated by medications that alter heart function or by chronic diseases. Prevention Schedule outdoor activities during cool times of the day. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid drinks with too much sugar or alcohol, which can cause dehydration. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. Acclimate to new hot environments, over many days if possible. Be aware of medication side effects.

If taking medications, be aware of those that may cause fluid losses, decrease sweating, or slow the heart rate. Common medications include those used for depression, blood pressure and heart disease, and coughs and colds. Never leave an impaired adult or a child in a car unattended. What to Do If you see these signs of heat stroke, call 911 immediately: core body temperature over 104°F; rapid heart rate; rapid breathing; flushed, hot skin; nausea and vomiting; or mental status changes. Follow these steps while waiting for emergency personnel: Move the individual out of the heat. Remove clothing to promote cooling. Position the person on his or her side to minimize aspiration. Immerse the individual in cold water or apply cold, wet cloths or ice packs to the skin to lower the body temperature.

Continue cooling the individual until the body temperature reaches 101°F to 102°F. Do not give any fluids to the person because it is not safe to drink during an altered level of consciousness. If the person is alert and requests water, give small sips. Avoid aspirin and acetaminophen; they do not help with cooling.

Key messages

- Rapid cooling and management of circulatory failure are crucial to the prevention of irreversible tissue damage and death in heatstroke.

- The literature review failed to identify reliable clinical data on optimum cooling and hemodynamic management of heatstroke.

- Immersion in iced water is effective among young people, military personnel, and athletes with exertional heatstroke.

- No evidence to support the superiority of any one cooling technique in classic heatstroke was found.

- The circulatory alterations in heatstroke were mostly due to a form of distributive shock associated with relative or absolute hypovolemia.

### Heat-related illnesses… [^111J78Kb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Workers exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may be at risk for experiencing heat-related illnesses.
- Workers and supervisors should be trained about heat-related illnesses, symptoms, and first aid. Types Outdoor and indoor workers exposed to extreme heat or work in hot environments may be at risk for experiencing heat related illnesses. Heat-related illnesses include heat stroke, heat exhaustion, rhabdomyolysis, heat syncope, heat cramps, and heat rash. Heat stroke Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related illness. It occurs when the body can no longer control its temperature: the body's temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body is unable to cool down. When heat stroke occurs, the body temperature can rise to 106°F or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause permanent disability or death if the person does not receive emergency treatment.

Symptoms Symptoms of heat stroke include:

- Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech
- Loss of consciousness
- Hot, dry skin or profuse sweating
- Seizures
- Very high body temperature
- Fatal if treatment delayed. First aid Take the following steps to treat a worker with heat stroke:

- Call 911 for emergency medical care.
- Stay with the worker until emergency medical services arrive.
- Move the worker to a shaded, cool area and remove outer clothing.
- Cool the worker quickly, using the following methods:
	- With a cold water or ice bath, if possible
	- Wet the skin
	- Place cold wet cloths on the skin
	- Soak clothing with cool water
	- Circulate the air around the worker to speed cooling.
	- Place cold wet cloths or ice on the head, neck, armpits, and groin; or soak the clothing with cool water.

First aid Workers with heat cramps should do the following:

- Drink water and have a snack or a drink that replaces carbohydrates and electrolytes every 15 to 20 minutes.
- Avoid salt tablets.
- Get medical help if the worker:
	- Has heart problems.
	- Is on a low sodium diet.
	- Has cramps that do not subside within 1 hour.

Cooling efforts should continue until the patient's temperature is less than 102.2°F (39°C) or, if continuous temperature monitoring is not available, until the patient demonstrates improvement in mental status. Establish IV access for patients suffering from heat stroke — give cool fluids at 20 mL/kg boluses and reduce to 10 mL/kg/hr boluses when vitals are stable, monitor for arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse, treat seizures per the Seizures Guideline, and all patients suffering from life threatening heat illness (including heat stroke) should be transported to the hospital.

### Cooling and hemodynamic management in heatstroke: practical recommendations [^116kCc7V]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Acute circulatory failure is found in 20% to 65% of patients with heatstroke and has been implicated in the aggravation of tissue injury and cell death. The cause of this failure is not well understood but has been attributed variously to pooling of blood into the cutaneous circulation, volume loss by evaporation and insufficient intake of fluid, myocardial damage, and distributive shock resembling that of sepsis. Accordingly, several treatment modalities have been proposed without adequate supporting evidence. The objective of this report is to present a systematic review of the literature which addresses these central phases of care, for the purpose of developing evidence-based practice guidelines for cooling and hemodynamic support in heatstroke, especially classic heatstroke.

### Targeted temperature management in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or acute ischaemic stroke: consensus recommendations [^114bGkpu]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A modified Delphi approach was used to identify a consensus on practical recommendations for the use of non-pharmacological targeted temperature management in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or acute ischaemic stroke with non-infectious fever (assumed neurogenic fever).

Methods

Nine experts in the management of neurogenic fever participated in the process, involving the completion of online questionnaires, face-to-face discussions, and summary reviews, to consolidate a consensus on targeted temperature management.

Results

The panel's recommendations are based on a balance of existing evidence and practical considerations. With this in mind, they highlight the importance of managing neurogenic fever using a single protocol for targeted temperature management. Targeted temperature management should be initiated if the patient temperature increases above 37.5°C, once an appropriate workup for infection has been undertaken. This helps prevent prophylactic targeted temperature management use and ensures infection is addressed appropriately. When neurogenic fever is detected, targeted temperature management should be initiated rapidly if antipyretic agents fail to control the temperature within 1 h, and should then be maintained for as long as there is potential for secondary brain damage. The recommended target temperature for targeted temperature management is 36.5–37.5°C. The use of advanced targeted temperature management methods that enable continuous, or near continuous, temperature measurement and precise temperature control is recommended.

Conclusions

Given the limited heterogeneous evidence currently available on targeted temperature management use in patients with neurogenic fever and intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or acute ischaemic stroke, a Delphi approach was appropriate to gather an expert consensus. To aid in the development of future investigations, the panel provides recommendations for data gathering.

Probable heat stroke is characterized by unconsciousness, confusion or mental status changes, combative behavior, vomiting, or rectal temp > 40°C (104°F); the pathway states to begin aggressive cooling measures immediately (Cool first, transfer second), then transport to an emergency facility with instructions to limit IV fluids if hyponatremia is suspected, monitor airway & vital signs, and continue cooling during transport. For probable heat exhaustion (weak and dizzy but alert; mental status normal; may have vomiting), remove from activity, begin cooling, rest and remove clothing and equipment, elevate legs (Trendelenburg position), provide oral fluids, and reevaluate athlete in 10 to 20 Minutes; if not clinically improving, consider transport for medical evaluation.

There is a growing incidence of heat-related illnesses due to rising global temperatures. Heat-related illnesses range from mild to severe, with heat stroke being the most critical. The wet bulb global temperature index considers humidity and solar intensity; its use is recommended to estimate heat stress on an individual and mitigate risk. Efficient cooling methods, such as cold water immersion, are essential in severe cases. Prevention is through hydration, appropriate clothing, recognition of high risk medications, and awareness of environmental conditions. Recognizing heat-related illnesses early in the clinical course and implementing rapid cooling strategies reduces morbidity and mortality.
