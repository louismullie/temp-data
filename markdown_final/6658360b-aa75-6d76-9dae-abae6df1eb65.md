## Question

55 yo F with a history of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), mild osteopenia on DEXA, complaints of pruritus, baseline AST/ALT minimally elevated, presents for evaluation; labs reveal corrected calcium 9.7 mg/dL, ALP 480 (baseline), albumin 3.1. Rheumatologist recommends starting alendronate 70 mg weekly for bone protection. Proceed with alendronate therapy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to start alendronate 70 mg weekly for a 55-year-old woman with PBC and mild osteopenia, and what the evidence-based approach should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's fracture risk and whether osteopenia alone justifies pharmacologic therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about bisphosphonates in PBC and whether they endorse treatment in osteopenia. Next, I will examine the efficacy and safety data for alendronate in PBC, including any fracture outcomes. After that, I need to check for contraindications such as esophageal varices or severe renal impairment. Finally, I will consider alternatives and outline a practical, guideline-concordant plan with supplementation and monitoring, before making a recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. The patient has PBC, mild osteopenia, and is 55 years old; importantly, she does not have osteoporosis, which is typically defined by a T-score ≤ −2.5, and she lacks other major fragility fracture risk factors beyond age and cholestasis, so her absolute fracture risk is likely not high enough to mandate pharmacologic therapy on that basis alone [^828db4fa] [^aee819e2].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually recommend. The AASLD PBC guidance recommends oral alendronate or other effective bisphosphonates when patients are osteoporotic, and explicitly advises avoiding oral bisphosphonates if there is acid reflux or known varices; it does not recommend pharmacologic therapy for osteopenia alone in PBC, emphasizing instead calcium and vitamin D supplementation and periodic DEXA surveillance [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163] [^3ec303d7]. The APASL guidance similarly supports bisphosphonates for osteoporosis with caution regarding varices, and again focuses supplementation rather than pharmacotherapy for osteopenia, aligning with a conservative approach in this scenario [^38ecb25f] [^38aafd3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the evidence base for alendronate in PBC. Randomized trials in PBC show alendronate improves lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density compared with placebo or etidronate, but these studies are small and underpowered for fracture endpoints, and a Cochrane review concluded there is no definitive evidence that bisphosphonates reduce fractures in PBC, which tempers enthusiasm for treating osteopenia pharmacologically in the absence of osteoporosis or high fracture risk [^a5ed7953] [^b1961ac1] [^0dcd4341]. Let me reconsider: while BMD gains are real, the clinical relevance for fracture prevention in osteopenic PBC patients remains unproven, reinforcing a conservative stance here [^0dcd4341].

> I need to ensure there are no contraindications before even contemplating therapy. Oral bisphosphonates should be avoided in patients with esophageal varices or significant gastroesophageal reflux due to mucosal irritation and bleeding risk; given PBC's propensity for portal hypertension and varices, I should confirm variceal status before considering any oral bisphosphonate, and if varices are present, oral agents are generally contraindicated and parenteral options would be preferred if treatment were indicated [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163]. I should also confirm renal function; alendronate is acceptable down to creatinine clearance ≥ 35 mL/min without dose adjustment, so moderate CKD alone is not a contraindication, though severe renal impairment would preclude use [^06daf923].

> Next, I should review what to do instead of alendronate. Guidelines consistently recommend ensuring adequate calcium intake of 1,000–1,500 mg/day and vitamin D 1,000 IU/day, measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D annually in advanced disease, and repeating DEXA about every 2 years to detect progression to osteoporosis; this is the backbone of management in osteopenic PBC patients and should be optimized now [^3ec303d7] [^4e35f645] [^143a0b49]. Let me double-check: yes, both AASLD and APASL endorse this supplementation-first strategy with surveillance, which fits this case precisely [^3ec303d7] [^38aafd3a].

> But wait, what if the rheumatologist's concern reflects a high FRAX score or imminent menopause transition? I should calculate FRAX using the PBC-specific context and, if the 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk is below typical treatment thresholds, continue with calcium, vitamin D, lifestyle measures, and monitoring rather than starting a bisphosphonate; if FRAX is high or if the patient progresses to osteoporosis, then pharmacologic therapy would be appropriate, with attention to variceal status and agent selection [^5a206c21] [^0dffc667]. I should confirm that this individualized, risk-stratified approach aligns with contemporary guidance, which it does [^0dffc667] [^a4937c82].

> I will now examine alternatives in case osteoporosis emerges or oral therapy is contraindicated. If osteoporosis is confirmed or if oral bisphosphonates are not suitable due to varices or intolerance, intravenous zoledronic acid or ibandronate are reasonable options supported by guidance and transplant literature, and denosumab has emerging PBC-specific data showing sustained BMD gains, though long-term fracture data remain limited and access or regional guidance may vary [^02004848] [^9ecca51f] [^38aafd3a]. Hold on, I should verify that denosumab's efficacy signal is real; yes, 3-year data in PBC show meaningful BMD increases, but I should still frame it as a conditional option pending fracture-outcome data and individual risk–benefit review [^9ecca51f].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For a 55-year-old woman with PBC and mild osteopenia, without osteoporosis or other high-risk features, starting alendronate 70 mg weekly is not indicated; instead, optimize calcium and vitamin D, reassess vitamin D status, repeat DEXA in 1–2 years, calculate FRAX to refine risk, and treat pharmacologically only if osteoporosis develops or if FRAX risk crosses intervention thresholds, while screening for varices before any oral bisphosphonate if treatment becomes indicated [^0dffc667] [^3ec303d7] [^5a206c21]. I should double-check that this aligns with both disease-specific and general osteoporosis guidance, which it does, including the principle to individualize treatment decisions in osteopenia rather than reflexively medicate [^a4937c82] [^eb74bfd8].

Do not start **alendronate** for mild osteopenia in PBC without osteoporosis, as guidelines do not recommend pharmacologic therapy at this stage [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163]. Instead, optimize **calcium (1,000–1,500 mg/day)** and **vitamin D (1,000 IU/day)** [^3ec303d7], ensure weight-bearing exercise, and repeat DEXA in 1–2 years [^notfound]. Reserve bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or high fracture risk, and avoid oral bisphosphonates if varices or severe reflux are present [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163]. If pharmacologic therapy is later indicated, consider IV zoledronic acid or denosumab if oral agents are contraindicated [^02004848] [^9ecca51f].

## Pathophysiology of bone disease in PBC

PBC-related bone disease is multifactorial, driven by **cholestasis-induced vitamin D malabsorption**, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and direct effects of bile acids on bone turnover [^d7c34995]. The prevalence of osteoporosis in PBC is 20–44%, with osteopenia even more common, and fracture risk is increased compared with the general population [^be403770] [^38aafd3a].

---

## Current guidelines for osteoporosis management in PBC

Guidelines from AASLD and APASL provide clear recommendations on **bone health management** in PBC:

- **Calcium and vitamin D supplementation**: Recommended for all patients with PBC, typically 1,000–1,500 mg/day of calcium and 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D, with vitamin D levels monitored and corrected if deficient [^3ec303d7] [^38aafd3a].

- **Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring**: Baseline DEXA is recommended, with repeat testing every 2 years, especially in postmenopausal women or those with advanced disease [^143a0b49] [^3ec303d7].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Bisphosphonates, including alendronate, are recommended for patients with osteoporosis (T-score ≤ −2.5) or those with significant fracture risk. They are not routinely recommended for mild osteopenia without additional risk factors [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163].

---

## Evidence for alendronate in PBC

Alendronate has been shown to **improve BMD** in patients with PBC-related osteoporosis, with randomized controlled trials demonstrating significant increases in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD compared to placebo or etidronate [^a5ed7953] [^b1961ac1]. However, these studies did not demonstrate significant fracture risk reduction, likely due to small sample sizes and short follow-up durations [^0dcd4341].

---

## Risks and contraindications of alendronate in PBC

While alendronate is generally well tolerated, certain risks and contraindications must be considered in patients with PBC:

- **Esophageal irritation**: Oral bisphosphonates can cause esophagitis and esophageal ulcers, which may be problematic in patients with esophageal varices or severe reflux, both of which are more common in advanced liver disease [^0dffc667] [^e2be8163].

- **Renal function**: Alendronate is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min) [^notfound].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Corrected calcium should be normalized before initiating therapy, as alendronate can exacerbate hypocalcemia [^38aafd3a].

---

## Alternative therapies and lifestyle modifications

For patients with mild osteopenia, **non-pharmacologic interventions** are recommended:

- **Weight-bearing exercise**: Regular weight-bearing and resistance exercises help maintain and improve bone density [^02004848].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall prevention strategies are important [^facd6b72] [^5a206c21].

- **Alternative pharmacologic therapies**: If osteoporosis develops or if oral bisphosphonates are contraindicated, intravenous bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronic acid) or denosumab may be considered [^02004848] [^9ecca51f].

---

## Clinical decision-making and patient-specific factors

The decision to initiate alendronate should be individualized, considering:

- **Fracture risk assessment**: Use of FRAX or other validated tools to assess 10-year fracture risk [^5a206c21].

- **Patient preferences**: Discussion of potential benefits, risks, and alternatives with the patient [^4a01e7b0].

- **Monitoring plan**: Regular follow-up of BMD, calcium, and vitamin D levels, as well as monitoring for adverse effects [^3ec303d7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's mild osteopenia without osteoporosis, **routine initiation of alendronate is not recommended**. Instead, optimize calcium and vitamin D intake, implement lifestyle modifications, and monitor BMD periodically. Reserve pharmacologic therapy for patients who progress to osteoporosis or have a high fracture risk, and consider alternative agents if oral bisphosphonates are contraindicated.

Osteoporosis

Osteoporosis affects 20–44% of patients with PBC with the resultant risk of fragility fractures, while the majority of patients have osteopenia. Risk factors for osteopenic bone disease in PBC include female gender, menopausal status, low body mass index (through the effects of disordered bile acid homeostasis and the pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with PBC), older age, advanced disease and chronic cholestasis with resultant vitamin D deficiency. Patients with PBC also have higher markers of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline) and lower markers of bone formation (osteocalcin).

Patients should be given general lifestyle advice to prevent loss of bone density (weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, minimising alcohol intake, etc). Falls are seen with increased frequency in PBC due to associated autonomic dysfunction and add to the increased fracture risk presented by osteoporosis. Patients with a clinical history of falls should be referred to a specialist falls clinic for multidisciplinary assessment, including for the presence of autonomic dysfunction.

All patients with cirrhosis and those with other recognised risk factors (eg, female gender, post-menopausal women, low body mass index, older age) should be assessed for osteoporosis and fracture risk. The FRAX score (the WHO fracture risk assessment tool can be used with or without bone mineral density (BMD) values) or QFracture (BMD values cannot be incorporated into the risk algorithm) should be used to estimate 10-year predicted absolute fracture risk. Following risk assessment with FRAX (without a BMD value) or QFracture, consider measuring BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in people whose fracture risk is in the region of an intervention threshold and recalculate absolute risk using FRAX with the BMD value.

National guidelines should be referred to for treatment algorithms. Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected and an adequate dietary intake assured. The use of calcium alongside vitamin D supplementation depends on the adequacy of dietary intake. If a bisphosphonate is required, alendronic acid is usually used first line. Specialist referral should be considered for patients who are unable to tolerate alendronate or risedronate. Treatment options include strontium ranelate, raloxifene, denosumab and teriparatide. There is a widely held view that oral bisphosphonates are unsafe in patients with varices because of the risk of superficial erosion and enhanced bleeding risk. The evidence to support this view is limited. Intravenous bisphosphonates can be used if there is clinical concern. There are limited data regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy and its efficacy in osteoporosis prevention in PBC.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^38aafd3a]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis guidance addresses screening, supplementation, and pharmacotherapy. EASL nutritional guidelines recommend supplement vitamin D orally in cirrhotic patients with vitamin D levels < 20 ng/ ml, to reach serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) ≥ 30 ng/ml, and for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women sufficient calcium (1000–1500 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU/day) in the diet or as supplements are recommended if they have no history of renal stones. It is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for serum vitamin D status and it is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women. The risk fracture in PBC patients is two times higher than that in the health population, and supplements of calcium and vitamin D are recommended with particular care in patients with a history of renal stones. Bisphosphonates are generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects including gastroesophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain, and atrial fibrillation, and are not recommended for people with severe impairment of renal function or hypocalcemia; people with specific problems of the esophagus may not be able to take the oral tablets. Evidence for fracture prevention includes a recent randomized clinical trial showing that either weekly alendronate or monthly ibandronate treatment could improve bone mass in patients with PBC; however, hormone replacement therapy in women with PBC is not supported by reliable evidence, and a report confirmed the efficacy and safety of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, for osteoporosis in patients with PBC.

### Alendronate is more effective than etidronate for increasing bone mass in osteopenic patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^b1961ac1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Osteopenia increases the morbidity of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In this study, we have compared two bisphosphonates, alendronate and cyclical etidronate, that inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and have examined their effects on bone mass in patients with this disease.

Methods

A total of 32 women with PBC were randomly assigned to receive alendronate (10 mg/day) or etidronate (400 mg/day) for 14 days every 3 months. Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and proximal femur were measured initially and every 6 months. Bone fractures and markers of bone mineral metabolism were also evaluated.

Results

Sixteen patients were allocated to each group, which were comparable with respect to the severity of PBC and osteopenia. Thirteen patients in each group completed the 2-yr trial. Both treatments increased bone mineral density after 2 yr, although the increase at the lumbar spine and at the proximal femur was significantly higher in patients receiving alendronate than in patients on etidronate. This higher effect of alendronate paralleled with changes in the biochemical markers of bone turnover. No patient developed new vertebral fractures, but new peripheral fractures were detected in two patients on alendronate and in one on etidronate. There were no serious adverse effects. Neither treatment impaired liver function or cholestasis.

Conclusions

Alendronate effectively increases bone mass and has greater antiresorptive power than etidronate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, and is associated with minor or no side effects.

### Alendronate improves bone mineral density in primary biliary cirrhosis: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^a5ed7953]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Bone loss is a well-recognized complication of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Although it has been suggested that alendronate might improve bone mineral density (BMD) in PBC, no randomized placebo-controlled trial has been conducted. The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of alendronate versus placebo on BMD and biochemical measurements of bone turnover in patients with PBC-associated bone loss. We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with a PBC and BMD t score of less than -1.5 were randomized to receive 70 mg per week of alendronate or placebo over 1 year. BMD of the lumbar spine and proximal femur were measured at entry and at 1 year. Changes from baseline in BMD and biochemical measurements of bone turnover were assessed. Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were randomized to each arm. After 1 year, a significantly larger improvement (P = 0.005) in spine BMD was observed in the alendronate group (0.09 ± 0.03 g/cm2 SD from baseline) compared with the placebo group (-0.003 ± 0.02 g/cm2 SD from baseline). A larger improvement (P = 0.046) was also observed in the femoral BMD of alendronate patients versus placebo. BMD changes were independent of concomitant estrogen therapy. The rate of adverse effects was similar in both groups. In conclusion, in patients with PBC-related bone loss, alendronate significantly improves BMD compared with placebo. Although in this study oral alendronate appears to be well tolerated in patients with PBC, larger studies are needed to formally evaluate safety.

Guidance statements in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — bile acid sequestrants should be used as initial therapy for patients with PSC who have pruritus that does not respond to conservative measures such as heat avoidance, emollients, and antihistamines; alternatives for refractory pruritus include sertraline 100 mg daily, naltrexone titrated to a dose of 50–100 mg daily, and rifampin 150–300 mg twice daily. Nutritional assessments, including but not limited to biometrics and lipid-soluble vitamin levels, should be performed at PSC diagnosis and yearly thereafter with nutritional intervention and vitamin supplementation as needed. Bone density examinations should be performed to exclude osteopenia or osteoporosis at diagnosis and at 2-year to 3-year intervals thereafter based on risk factors.

### Bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis [^0dcd4341]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonates are widely used for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis often have osteoporosis - either postmenopausal or secondary to the liver disease. No systematic review or meta-analysis has assessed the effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis in primary biliary cirrhosis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, clinicaltrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and full text searches were conducted until November 2011. Manufacturers and authors were contacted for additional studies during the conductance of the review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials of bisphosphonates in primary biliary cirrhosis compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate, or any other drug.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data. RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) and of continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Methodological components were used to assess risk of systematic errors (bias). Trial sequential analysis was also used to control for random errors (play of chance).

Main Results

Six trials were included. Three trials with 106 participants, of which two trials with high risk of bias, did not demonstrate significant effects of bisphosphonates (etidronate or alendronate) versus placebo or no intervention regarding mortality (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.66, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04). Two trials with 62 participants with high risk of bias compared one bisphosphonate (etidronate or alendronate) versus another (alendronate or ibandronate) and found no significant difference regarding mortality (RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.14 to 0.07, I² = 0%), fractures (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.18 to 5.06, I² = 0%), or adverse events (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.04, I² = 0%). Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on liver-related mortality, liver transplantation, or liver-related morbidity compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates had no significant effect on bone mineral density compared with placebo or no intervention, or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates compared with placebo or no intervention seem to decrease the urinary amino telopeptides of collagen I (NTx) concentration (MD -16.93 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine; 95% CI -23.77 to -10.10; 2 trials with 88 patients; I² = 0%) and serum osteocalcin (SMD -0.81; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.39; 3 trials with 100 patients; I² = 34%) concentration. The former result was supported by trial sequential analysis, but not the latter. Alendronate compared with another bisphosphonate (ibandronate) had no significant effect on serum osteocalcin concentration (MD -3.61 ng/ml, 95% CI -9.41 to 2.18; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%) in a random-effects meta-analysis, but it significantly decreased serum osteocalcin (MD -4.40 ng/ml, 95% CI -6.75 to -2.05; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 82%), the procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (MD -8.79 ng/ml, 95% CI -15.96 to -1.63; 2 trials with 47 patients; I² = 38%), and NTx concentration (MD -14.07 nmol bone collagen equivalents/mmol creatinine, 95% CI -24.23 to -3.90; 2 trials with 46 patients; I² = 0%) in a fixed-effect model. The latter two results were not supported by trial sequential analyses. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients having bisphosphonates withdrawn due to adverse events compared with placebo or no intervention (RD -0.04; 95% CI -0.21 to 0.12; 2 trials with 46 patients; I² = 0%), or another bisphosphonate (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.14 to 2.17; 2 trials with 62 patients; I² = 0%). One trial with 32 participants and with high risk of bias compared etidronate versus sodium fluoride without finding significant difference regarding mortality, fractures, adverse events, or bone mineral density. Etidronate compared with sodium fluoride significantly decreased serum osteocalcin, urinary hydroxyproline, and parathyroid hormone concentration.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find evidence to support or refute the use of bisphosphonates for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The data seem to indicate a possible positive intervention effect of bisphosphonates on decreasing urinary amino telopeptides of collagen I concentration compared with placebo or no intervention with no risk of random error. There is need for more randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of bisphosphonates for osteoporosis on patient-relevant outcomes in primary biliary cirrhosis.

### Osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^828db4fa]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Metabolic bone disease has been recognized as an important complication of chronic liver disease particularly in cholestatic disorders [primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis] and after liver transplantation. It includes osteoporosis and more rarely osteomalacia, which is more frequent in severe malabsorption and advanced liver disease. The pathogenesis of this disorder is complex and is likely to be multifactorial. Regardless of the etiology of osteoporosis in PBC patients, they have an increased risk of spontaneous or low-trauma fracturing leading to significant patient morbidity, deterioration of quality of life, and even patient mortality. The development of bone densitometry has allowed assessment of bone mass and then contributed in estimating the fracture risk. The gold standard of bone mineral density measurement is currently the dual- energy X-ray absorptiometry. Recommendations formulated by the World Health Organization have reported the diagnostic ranges of osteoporosis based on the t-score: patient with osteoporosis has a t-score less than -2.5 SD, osteopenia has a t-score between -1.0 and -2.5 SD and a normal individual has a t-score more than -1.0 SD. The risk of fracture shows a correlation with bone mineral density but no fracture threshold was determined and the best site of characterizing the hip fracture risk is the measure of the bone mineral density of the proximal femur. The treatment of osteoporosis in patients with PBC is largely based on trials of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis as there are a few and smaller studies of osteoporotic patients with PBC. Bisphosphonates seem to be effective in biliary disease and are more tolerated.

### Randomized trial comparing monthly ibandronate and weekly alendronate for osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis [^3c4f860b]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Osteoporosis resulting in bone fractures is a complication in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Once-weekly alendronate improves bone mass and is well tolerated in these patients, but there is a concern because of poor compliance. Therefore, the efficacy, adherence, and safety of monthly ibandronate (150 mg) with weekly alendronate (70 mg) were compared in a randomized, 2-year study in 42 postmenopausal women with PBC and osteoporosis. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur (by DXA), liver function, and bone markers were measured at entry and every 6 months over 2 years. Adherence to therapy was assessed by the Morisky-Green score. At enrollment, the two groups were similar with respect to age, BMD, severity of cholestasis, previous fractures, and bone markers. Thirty-three patients, 14 in the ibandronate group and 19 in the alendronate group, completed the trial. At 2 years both treatments resulted in a significant increase in BMD at the lumbar spine (from 0.875 ± 0.025 to 0.913 ± 0.026 g/cm(2), P < 0.001 with alendronate, and from 0.898 ± 0.024 to 0.949 ± 0.027 g/cm(2), P < 0.001 with ibandronate). The mean percentage change was 4.5% and 5.7%, respectively (P = not significant). BMD increased at the total hip by 2.0% and 1.2%, respectively. Changes in bone markers were similar in both groups and one patient with alendronate developed a new vertebral fracture. Adherence to therapy was higher with ibandronate (P = 0.009). Neither treatment impaired liver function or cholestasis.

Conclusion

Both regimens, weekly alendronate and monthly ibandronate, improve bone mass and are comparable in safety for osteoporosis therapy in patients with PBC, although adherence is higher with the monthly regimen. Further larger studies are needed to assess fracture prevention.

Nutrition and mineral bone disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — patients with early PSC have reported deficiencies of vitamins A, D, and E at rates of 40%, 14%, and 2%, respectively; among those with advanced disease the rates were 82%, 57%, and 43%, respectively, and vitamins A, D, and E should be measured and supplemented as needed. In a 2011 single-center longitudinal cohort of 237 patients with PSC, osteoporosis was identified in 15%, with a 2.3- to 8-fold increased risk compared to population controls; multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 54, body mass index < 24 kg/m², and IBD for ≥ 19 years correlating with osteoporosis. In contrast, a recent study of 238 patients with PSC found no correlation between osteoporosis and age, disease duration, or severity of disease but rather a correlation between bone mineral density and bone resorption and T helper 17–cell frequency. All patients with PSC should be screened for metabolic bone disease by bone density measurement at diagnosis and then every 2–3 years in those with normal bone mineral density.

### Prospective, multicenter cohort study on primary biliary cholangitis (PBC-cohort) [^40ab46d9]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease. The course of the disease is characterized by a slow destruction of bile ducts, and progressive cholestasis. Prognosis depends on the development of cirrhosis and its complications. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been established as standard therapy for PBC and improves patients' long-term outcome. However, UDCA is not a uniformly effective drug, and the prognosis of PBC patients insufficiently responding to treatment is markedly worse. For patients with suboptimal treatment response to UDCA obeticholic acid as newly approved medication is available as second line treatment. In approximatly 40 sites in Germany routine data is collected. There are no specifications for the diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of the PBC patients. The documentation of the routine data is carried out alongside with guideline recommended treatment intervals of the patients.
- History of elevated ALP levels for 6 months. Positive anti-mitochondrial antibody titer or if AMA negative or in low titer = > PBC-specific antibodies:

- anti-GP210 and/or
- anti-SP100 and/or
- antibodies against the major M2 components.
- Liver biopsy consistent with PBC.
- Medication-based treatment with at least one drug approved in Germany for the treatment of PBC Availability of all following essential parameters at the initial diagnosis of PBC prior to the initiation of treatment with UDCA, 12 months after initiation of UDCA and if applicable at time point of secondary incomplete response:

- Platelet count
- Alkaline Phosphatase
- Total Bilirubin
- Aspartate aminotransferase
- Age at initial diagnosis of PBC
- Patients must meet criteria of one of the cohorts within this NIS according to design.
- **written statement of informed consent Exclusion Criteria**: Current participation in a phase I to IV interventional clinical trial for PBC or participation in another PBC registry.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — Complications — If left untreated, PBC patients with persistent cholestasis will eventually progress to the advanced stage with complications associated with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis. Hyperlipidemia is common and can cause xanthelasmas and xanthomas, and it seems not to confer an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. PBC patients are more inclined to have hepatic osteodystrophy, with osteoporosis affecting around 20–44% of the patients. Signs of portal hypertension can develop before cirrhosis and are presinusoidal in nature, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma increases, especially in men or those with advanced diseases.

Recommendation 32

We recommend that all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines. (Strong; High)

When should patients be considered for clinical trials?

For many years following the original UDCA trials there has been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need in the condition, with progress to new licensed second-line therapies such as OCA, which has FDA and EMA approval, as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see).

High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease

The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process — namely, the upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury (typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA response criteria at the end of 1 year of treatment at 13–15 mg/kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.

Pruritus resistant to current therapy

Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) following first and established second-line therapy or who are intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.

Fatigue

Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature of the clinical problem. They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in these guidelines should be followed before trial participation is considered.

Asymptomatic patients are increasingly diagnosed at an early disease stage mainly due to routine testing of liver biochemistry, especially in East Asia. In elderly asymptomatic PBC patients (≥ 55 years), mortality was similar to that of the age‑ and sex‑matched general population, yet if left undiagnosed or untreated, two thirds of asymptomatic patients will develop into the symptomatic phase within five years.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a liver-specific autoimmune disease that primarily affects women (female-to-male ratio, 10:1) between 40 and 60 years of age. Metabolic bone disease is a common complication of PBC, affecting 14% to 52% of patients, depending on the duration and severity of liver disease. The osteoporosis seen in PBC seems mainly due to low bone formation, although increased bone resorption may contribute. Treatment of osteoporosis consists primarily of antiresorptive agents. Additional large prospective, long-term studies in patients with PBC are needed to determine efficacy in improving bone density as well as reducing fracture risk.

For suboptimal response, issues of adherence, superimposed liver disease including fatty liver, and coadministration with bile sequestrants such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam should be considered. UDCA use has been associated with reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a reduced risk of developing varices, and slower histologic progression, but it does not improve fatigue, pruritus, associated bone disease, or autoimmune features found in association with primary biliary cholangitis.

Case scenario conclusion

After 6 months of UDCA therapy, the patient's repeat ALP was 480 U/L and total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL. Based on these laboratory values, she is considered a nonresponder to UDCA, and second-line PBC treatments can thus be considered. A repeat ALP after 12 months of UDCA therapy was 325 U/L with a total bilirubin of 0.8 mg/dL, a serum albumin of 3.8 g/dL, and a platelet count of 145 × 10⁹/L. The patient's GLOBE score was 1.29, and her predicted 3-year survival was 87.9% compared with the mean survival of 98.2% in age-matched and sex-matched patients in the 58–66-year age group. There was a discussion with the patient about off-label treatment with fenofibrate vs on-label treatment with OCA. She was then started on OCA 5 mg/d with the plan to monitor her ALP and bilirubin in 3–6 months and consider adding fenofibrate if a complete biochemical response was not achieved.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^979c135d]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the first nationwide pilot audit of PBC management, our primary aim was to gain an indication of the quality of PBC care to inform a potential widespread audit. We obtained a large sample size, treated across 11 large hospitals. This is representative of the population of patients with PBC managed within the NHS and enables examination of care quality and nationwide variability. Real-world data were captured, ensuring that our findings are reflective of clinical practice.

None of the hospitals met all the recommended EASL targets, and targets were often substantially missed. The poor adherence to recommended UDCA dosing is a cause for concern. Surprisingly, 50% of hospitals met the target for assessment of UDCA response, which may reflect an emphasis on risk stratification in PBC education. Poor survival has been reported in individuals responding poorly to UDCA. The early identification of high-risk individuals and provision of second-line treatments could significantly improve disease outcomes. Undertreatment of UDCA via sub-optimal dosing has been suggested as a predictive factor in the development of cirrhosis, HCC and liver failure.

No hospital met the target for symptom screening or bone density assessment. Regular assessment of symptom burden has been highlighted as a key aspect of lifelong PBC management. One study observed that approximately 51% of patients develop PBC symptoms within 5 years after diagnosis. Furthermore, up to 44% of patients with PBC are affected by osteoporosis, with the majority having osteopenia. This pilot audit was based on EASL guidelines alone, which recommend the use of DEXA scan in all patients with PBC. BSG/UK-PBC guidelines recommend risk assessment — using the FRAX or QFracture score — and a subsequent DEXA scan when scores indicate treatment. This disparity may explain the poor performance for this target across hospitals.

This audit has identified statistically significant variation in performance across individual hospitals, between countries and between GGC and DHC. Caution should be undertaken when interpreting the GGC versus DHC comparison due to the differences in population sizes between the assessed groups (55 vs 735 patients, respectively). This may be due to the increased availability of PBC-related databases within DHC. For this reason, not every hospital was able to participate and hospitals with DHC were more willing to contribute to the study. Geographic variation in UDCA use has been reported. Additionally, a global cohort study — which included the UK — previously reported a large number of patients who were underdosed with UDCA.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) approval, mechanism, and efficacy include Food and Drug Administration approval in May 2016 for use with UDCA in patients with inadequate response to at least 1 year of UDCA, or as monotherapy in those intolerant to UDCA; OCA is a farnesoid X receptor agonist that is 100 times more potent than the endogenous ligand chenodeoxycholic acid. In a phase 2 randomized controlled trial of 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg OCA versus placebo for 3 months in 165 patients, a 21% to 25% reduction in ALP occurred versus 3% with placebo. Another phase 2 monotherapy study in 59 patients showed serum ALP reductions of 53.9% with 10 mg and 37.2% with 50 mg versus 0.8% with placebo; pruritus led to discontinuation of 38% of subjects in the 50-mg arm. A larger phase 3 trial included 210 patients treated for 1 year with an optional 6-year extension while continuing UDCA, and the primary endpoint combined ALP less than 1.67 times the upper limit of normal, a reduction from baseline greater than 15%, and normal bilirubin.

### Bone disorders in chronic liver disease [^3b34f4eb]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteomalacia rarely occurs in adult patients with chronic liver disease despite a low serum vitamin D level being reported in up to two-thirds of patients with cirrhosis. In contrast, osteoporosis, which increases the risk of vertebral fractures, occurs in 12%-55% of patients with cirrhosis. Although the prevalence is probably falling, as shown by a fall from 57%-26% in patients with biliary disease requiring liver transplantation over the last 2 decades, it still accounts for significant patient morbidity. Bone density also falls in the first 3 months after liver transplantation, and pretransplant fractures are predictive of posttransplant fractures. Many of the known risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis exist in the cirrhotic population, such as excess alcohol intake, steroid use, poor nutrition, and hypogonadism. There is also an increased risk of osteoporosis in patients without cirrhosis, particularly those with hemochromatosis and biliary disease. The diagnosis is made with bone density measurements. The effective treatment is largely based on evidence from postmenopausal osteoporosis as there have been only a few small clinical trials of patients with chronic liver disease. Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment; they have been shown to be effective in biliary disease and are well tolerated.

Sixty-seven patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and osteopenia, defined by bone mineral density criteria (T-score < -2.0) were enrolled. Measurements of the lumbar spine and proximal femur, as well as x-rays of the lumbar spine, were obtained. Patients received cyclical etidronate 400 mg/day for 14 days every 3 months for at least 1 year. Supplemental calcium was administered on the days patients did not receive etidronate.

Results

Of the 67 patients entered, 60 completed at least 1 year of therapy. There was no significant difference in changes in bone density at either the lumbar spine or femur in patients receiving etidronate when compared to placebo. Fractures occurred in eight patients, four receiving etidronate. Etidronate therapy was associated with a significant reduction in markers of bone turnover compared to placebo. These changes did not correlate with changes in bone density.

Conclusions

Cyclical etidronate administered with supplemental calcium did not significantly improve bone density in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.

Treatment of Extrahepatic Complications

Patients with PBC commonly experience distressing symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue, significantly impacting their overall well-being. The management of pruritus is part of the essential treatment goal in the risk stratification strategy of PBC patients, which will be elaborated in the subsequent text. Fatigue occurs in about 80% of patients with PBC, significantly impacting their quality of life. Thus far, no pharmaceutical interventions have been permitted for the treatment of fatigue and cognitive symptoms. The current approach primarily involves addressing other potential contributing factors, such as depression, extrahepatic autoimmune diseases, anemia, and sleep disorders, along with mindfulness therapy and ensuring sufficient daily physical activity. The phase-III clinical trial of Seladelpar, a selective PPAR-δ agonist, demonstrated that 55–64% of patients in the Seladelpar group experienced improvements in the PBC-40 fatigue scoring. An open-label prospective study revealed that the combination therapy of UDCA and S-Adenosyl-L- Methionine (SAMe) significantly ameliorated the scores of fatigue, pruritus, and anxiety symptoms in the PBC-40 scale. The novel Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A (GABA-A) receptor-modulating steroid antagonist, Golexanolone, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy and safety in a bile duct-ligated rat model and a phase-Ib/II pilot trial of cirrhosis patients, respectively, which exhibits significant therapeutic potential for managing fatigue, motor, and cognitive impairments in PBC patients. Artificial tears and cyclosporin eye drops benefit ocular dryness. Maintaining good oral hygiene and utilizing saliva substitutes are helpful to maintain oral moisture. Choline receptor agonists like Pilocarpine or Cevimeline are also deemed efficacious for oral dryness. PBC-associated metabolic bone disease is characterized by bone demineralization and the development of osteoporosis, where Bisphosphonates, vitamin A, vitamin D, and Calcium supplementation are helpful. For PBC patients with hypercholesterolemia, lipid-lowering medications are only considered for those with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Primary biliary cirrhosis is not an additional risk factor for bone loss in women receiving regular calcium and vitamin D supplementation: a controlled longitudinal study [^38546a82]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Goals

Alterations in bone metabolism in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are generally considered to be highly prevalent and severe, but no data are available from prospective studies with adequate control groups. The aims of this study were: (1) to measure changes in bone mineral density (BMD) over time; (2) to correlate the degree of bone loss with the severity of liver disease; and (3) to characterize bone disease in PBC patients receiving regular calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

Study

We enrolled 118 women with PBC (mean age ± SD: 56 ± 11 y; 72% postmenopausal; 43% with cirrhosis), and measured BMD (lumbar spine, DXA-Hologic) at entry and serially over the following 5 years. The controls were 472 healthy women selected from a large observational group matched for age and menopausal status (mean age ± SD: 55 ± 10 y; 73% postmenopausal).

Results

Mean BMD was 0.851 ± 0.142 g/cm2 in the PBC group and 0.857 ± 0.158 g/cm2 in the control group; the prevalence of osteoporosis was 28% and 29%, respectively. BMD significantly correlated with age and postmenopausal status, but not with liver cirrhosis or serum bilirubin levels. The biochemical markers of bone turnover were high in about 50% of the patients. The yearly bone loss in the PBC group was 0.008 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval: 0.014–0.003) similar to that calculated in the control group.

Conclusions

Among patients with PBC, the prevalence of osteoporosis and the yearly rate of BMD loss are similar to those observed in the general population, and are not associated with the severity of liver disease.

Cirrhosis, portal hypertension and liver failure

In an observational series of 174 patients with PSC who underwent a liver biopsy, advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis was found in 43% of patients with asymptomatic disease, and in 69% of those who were symptomatic; 25% died of liver failure. Other studies have shown similar results. It is likely that these series are subject to referral bias with patients at a more advanced stage than many patients routinely followed up in local centres, but they indicate a high prevalence of advanced parenchymal liver disease in PSC. The true prevalence of portal hypertension is not known, but extrapolating data from clinical findings, such as the presence of splenomegaly and oesophageal varices, suggests that clinically significant portal hypertension is present in 30%.

Metabolic bone disease

As with other cholestatic liver diseases, osteopenia and osteoporosis are common in PSC. In a study of 237 patients who underwent annual measurement of bone mineral density, 15% had evidence of osteoporosis, equating to a 24-fold risk of osteoporosis compared with an age-matched population. In this study, the presence of older age (> 54 years), low body mass index (< 24 kg/m²) and presence of IBD were strong risk factors of low bone density (prevalence of 75% with all three risk factors and 3% with none), but interestingly, cumulative dose of corticosteroids was not. Patients may also have coexistent vitamin D deficiency, but overt osteomalacia is uncommon. UK guidelines on the management of osteoporosis associated with chronic liver disease advise that all patients should receive lifestyle advice and those with cirrhosis or advanced cholestasis should have bone densitometry performed every 2 years. In practice, young patients with early disease are at low risk of low bone density and will not usually require formal testing. Patients with a high risk of bone disease and those requiring steroid treatment for IBD or liver transplantation should be treated with daily vitamin D 400 IU (10 μg) and calcium supplements if calculated dietary calcium intake is insufficient. Those with confirmed osteoporosis should be treated according to BSG and NICE guidelines and fracture risk scores.

Recommendation 19: We recommend that all patients with PSC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Once osteoporosis is detected, treatment and follow-up should be in accordance with national guidelines (strength of recommendation: STRONG; quality of evidence: MODERATE).

### A 4-year treatment with clodronate plus calcium and vitamin D supplements does not improve bone mass in primary biliary cirrhosis [^ca9e10a1]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

International guidelines for managing osteoporosis in cirrhosis or severe cholestasis indicate a < -2.5 t-score as a cut-off for medical treatment, while no treatment is recommended in the case of osteopenia (t-scores ranging from -1.0 to -2.5).

Aim

We conducted a prospective study in primary biliary cirrhosis with a view to optimizing the rationale for the medical treatment of bone loss.

Methods

All naïve post-menopausal women with primary biliary cirrhosis were enrolled in the study. Bone metabolism was evaluated by measuring 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin. Bone mineral density was assessed at the lumbar spine by dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry at the baseline and every 2 years for up to 4 years. Patients with either osteopenia or osteoporosis received the following treatment: oral calcium carbonate (1000 mg/day)+vitamin D3 (880 IU/day)+i.m. disodium clodronate 100mg every 10 days for 4 years.

Results

Ninety-six patients completed the study: 30 had a normal bone mineral density (group 1), 37 had osteopenia (group 2), 29 had osteoporosis (group 3). No significant differences in biochemical parameters of bone metabolism were observed between the three groups. A total of 288 bone mineral density measurements were taken. Linear regression analysis failed to reveal significant changes in t-score over the follow-up in all groups.

Conclusions

A 4-year treatment with clodronate+calcium/vitamin D3 supplements does not significantly improve osteoporosis or osteopenia in primary biliary cirrhosis women in menopause, but prevents the natural bone loss in these patients. Extensive international trials are warranted to optimize the prevention and treatment of bone loss in primary biliary cirrhosis.

### Reply [^53a1a94a]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

We thank Dr. Ana Lleo and colleagues for having interest in our paper showing that long‐term administration of denosumab safely increased bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis. 1

The beneficial effect of denosumab on bone metabolism is achieved by suppressing RANK signaling in osteoclastogenesis. The influence of inhibiting RANK‐RANKL axis is now explored in other areas. A recent phase 3 trial demonstrated that adjuvant denosumab in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer significantly improved disease‐free survival compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.82 [0.69‐0.98]). 2 RANK and RANKL are expressed in immune cells and possibly in tumor and stroma cells, and these interactions in the tumor microenvironment could lead to immunosuppression. 3 Remarkable response was documented following concurrent treatment with denosumab and immune‐checkpoint inhibitors in several case reports. 4 Therefore, denosumab might be used as an adjuvant in anticancer therapy.

In PBC, the RANK‐RANKL axis might also have implications beyond osteoclastogenesis. A previous study demonstrated that the expression of RANK in cholangiocytes and RANKL in CD4, CD8, and CD19 cells around bile ducts was significantly greater in patients with PBC than those with other liver diseases, 5 suggesting the involvement of RANK‐RANKL axis in the mechanism of bile duct injury in PBC. Therefore, denosumab might improve not only bone metabolism but also liver function in this intractable disease.

We analyzed the change in serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma‐glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels in 6 patients with PBC who received 3‐year denosumab therapy. 1 The ALP levels decreased, although it was largely attributable to the decline in bone‐related isozyme. Serum GGT levels were not improved by denosumab therapy. As our patients had been receiving ursodeoxycholic acid for a long time when denosumab therapy initiated, there might be no room for further decrease in ALP and GGT. Nevertheless, a hypothesis that the RANK‐RANKL axis plays a role in bile duct injury in PBC is worth further investigation. A prospective trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with bisphosphonate in the treatment of osteoporotic patients with PBC is ongoing. Analysis from the viewpoint of improving bile duct injury might prove this hypothesis.

### Bone mineral density before and after OLT: long-term follow-up and predictive factors [^2c160979]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Fracturing after liver transplantation (OLT) occurs due to the combination of preexisting low bone mineral density (BMD) and early posttransplant bone loss, the risk factors for which are poorly defined. The prevalence and predictive factors for hepatic osteopenia and osteoporosis, posttransplant bone loss, and subsequent bone gain were studied by the long-term posttransplant follow-up of 360 consecutive adult patients with end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Only 20% of patients with advanced PBC or PSC have normal bone mass. Risk factors for low spinal BMD are low body mass index, older age, postmenopausal status, muscle wasting, high alkaline phosphatase and low serum albumin. A high rate of spinal bone loss occurred in the first 4 posttransplant months (annual rate of 16%) especially in those with younger age, PSC, higher pretransplant bone density, no inflammatory bowel disease, shorter duration of liver disease, current smoking, and ongoing cholestasis at 4 months. Factors favoring spinal bone gain from 4 to 24 months after transplantation were lower baseline and/or 4-month bone density, premenopausal status, lower cumulative glucocorticoids, no ongoing cholestasis, and higher levels of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone. Bone mass therefore improves most in patients with lowest pretransplant BMD who undergo successful transplantation with normal hepatic function and improved gonadal and nutritional status. Patients transplanted most recently have improved bone mass before OLT, and although bone loss still occurs early after OLT, these patients also have a greater recovery in BMD over the years following OLT.

Osteoporosis is a major complication in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor‐dB ligand (RANKL), increases bone mineral density (BMD) by inhibiting development and activity of osteoclasts and decreasing bone resorption. We have already reported the efficacy and safety of short‐term (1‐year) denosumab therapy for osteoporosis in patients with PBC or AIH, 1 but the effect of long‐term administration remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of long‐term denosumab therapy for osteoporosis in patients with PBC or AIH.

### Relationship between osteoporosis, sarcopenia, vertebral fracture, and osteosarcopenia in patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^1979634e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is well known that patients with PBC are more frequently complicated by osteoporosis, compared to those with other liver diseases. Specifically, menopausal female patients are more susceptible to osteoporosis. Furthermore, early and late postmenopausal patients develop osteoporosis six and 10 times, respectively, more than premenopausal patients. However, most notably, the present study suggested that sarcopenia was more strongly involved in osteoporosis than female and menopause. Considering that postmenopausal female account for the majority of PBC patients in a real-world clinical setting, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of sarcopenia are becoming increasingly crucial.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the prevalence of sarcopenia limited to PBC patients. According to the diagnosis criteria of sarcopenia proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology, the prevalence was 23.1% for all patients and 25.0% for female patients in the present study, whereas it was approximately 15% for Japanese CLD (predominantly viral hepatitis) patients in previous studies. The median age was 68 (interquartile range 57–73) years in the present study, and 65 (58–73) years and 65 (54–72) years in the previous studies. Additionally, the prevalence of liver cirrhosis was only 9.4% in the present study and approximately 40% in the previous studies. These findings suggest that patients with PBC are more susceptible to sarcopenia, compared to those with other CLD. Thus, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for sarcopenia are required especially in PBC patients, and are also beneficial for those with osteoporosis, given that sarcopenia and osteoporosis were closely interrelated with each other.

Comparison of clinical characteristics between patients with and without osteoporosis/sarcopenia

We divided the 117 patients into four groups: (1) patients without both osteoporosis and sarcopenia (75/117; 64.1%); (2) patients with osteoporosis alone (15/117; 12.8%); (3) patients with sarcopenia alone (9/117; 7.7%); and (4) patients with both osteoporosis and sarcopenia (osteosarcopenia) (18/117; 15.4%) (Table S7, Supplemental digital content 1). Patients with osteosarcopenia were significantly older and had lower levels of BMI, serum albumin and IGF-1, and higher levels of M2BPGi compared to those without both osteoporosis and sarcopenia (Fig. 2 a–e). The osteosarcopenia group was significantly highest in the prevalence of vertebral fracture among the four groups (10/18; 55.6%, adjusted residual = |4.5|), whereas patients without both sarcopenia and osteoporosis had significantly lowest vertebral fracture rate (5/75; 6.7%, adjusted residual = |4.1|) (Fig. 2 f).

INTRODUCTION

Case scenario

A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was seen for complaints of mild fatigue and pruritus for several months. The physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed alanine transaminase (ALT) = 44 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 45 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) = 650 U/L, total bilirubin = 0.8 mg/dL, serum albumin = 4 g/dL, and international normalized ratio = 1.0. Her symptoms and laboratory test results indicated primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) as a possibility.

PBC is a chronic, inflammatory, progressive autoimmune disease that, without treatment, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, resulting in liver-related death. A recent study sought to identify temporal trends in patients with PBC and disease characteristics over a 44-year period across a large international cohort of 4,805 patients with PBC. Patients were divided into 5 cohorts according to the year of diagnosis (1970–1979 [n = 143], 1980–1989 [n = 858], 1990–1999 [n = 1,754], 2000–2009 [n = 1,815], and 2010 and later [n = 235]). In recent decades, significantly more patients have presented with mild disease, according to both biochemical and histological definitions. In addition, decompensation rates significantly decreased, and 10-year transplant-free survival rates significantly increased over the 4 investigated decades. The authors postulated that these trends may, in part, be attributed to the increased routine use of serum liver biochemical tests. It would be expected that the availability of effective therapies may further accelerate these positive trends.

### Reevaluating goals of therapy in primary biliary cholangitis: is good enough is not good enough anymore? [^3c00b661]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune-mediated inflammatory cholestatic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis. This issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology features the results of the GLOBAL PBC Study Group evaluating patients with PBC over a 10-year period. Although biochemical response was evaluated in previous studies, this study showed that bilirubin levels ≤ 0.6 upper limit of normal or normal levels of alkaline phosphatase are associated with the lowest risk for liver transplantation or death in patients with PBC.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) phenotype and biochemical markers — prognosis and monitoring — note that younger age at diagnosis and female sex are associated with better outcomes, and small-duct PSC progresses to large-duct disease in twenty-three percent over 5–14 years with recommended MRI/MRCP monitoring every 3–5 years. Prognostically, presence of symptoms and high ALP are adverse, while persistently normal/low levels (ALP < 1.5 × ULN) are favorable. In children, GGT should be used in children, and persistently normal/low levels (GGT < 50 U/L) are associated with better prognosis.

Statement 100. We recommend that patients starting corticosteroids should be assessed for risk of osteoporosis. Those at high risk should be started on bisphosphonate therapy at the onset of corticosteroid therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), after ensuring adequate calcium intake and supplementing vitamin D (Agreement: 90.7%).

Reduction in bone mineral density and fracture risk are worsened by oral corticosteroid use, and the greatest bone loss occurs in the first 6 months of treatment. Before starting oral steroids, patients should have their fracture risk assessed as shown in figure 5. For patients aged over 40, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) can be used to assess the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with a high FRAX score (score ≥ 20% major fracture and ≥ 3% hip fracture), those aged under 40 with risk factors or those receiving prolonged (more than 3 months) or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density assessed by bone densitometry. Note that FRAX does not discriminate past versus current corticosteroid use, nor does it stratify risk according to doses beyond 7.5 mg, and risk should be adjusted accordingly. Patients on long-term steroids should have a repeat bone densitometry at 1 year, and if stable, repeated at 2–3-year intervals, but if declining, repeated annually. Women and men aged 70 or more, with past fragility fracture, taking high-dose steroids (7.5 mg or more prednisolone-equivalent), or at high risk based on FRAX score, should be considered for bone-protective therapy at the start of steroid treatment. Alendronate or risedronate should be used, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated, in which case intravenous zoledronate or teriparatide should be given. For women of childbearing age requiring bone-protective therapy, if they are taking effective contraception (or not sexually active), oral bisphosphonates are the first-line therapy followed by teriparatide if oral bisphosphonates cannot be used. Denusomab and high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates should not be used in this situation due to lack of data on the risk of fetal harm should an unplanned pregnancy occur. There is a lack of safety data on use of denosumab with immunosuppressive therapy, and on all osteoporosis therapies during pregnancy, other than calcium and vitamin D.

### Primary biliary cholangitis drug evaluation and regulatory approval: where do we go from here? [^3a924a83]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

WHERE WE ARE NOW

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive chronic cholestatic liver disease. Predominantly affecting women, PBC can have a significant impact on patients through progression to cirrhosis with its associated complications and risk of death, and through the development of chronic and often life-altering symptoms including itch and fatigue. Other implications include a decreased quality of life and stigma and discrimination. In the early days of liver transplantation, despite being a rare disease, PBC was among the commonest indications for the procedure, reflecting the scale of its impact and lack of effective treatments. However, the landscape is now very different with improved survival and the vast majority of patients not requiring transplantation (living and dying "with PBC" rather than "from PBC"). This change has come about through a combination of better awareness among patients and clinicians, increasing access to diagnostic tests, and, most notably, through the advent of effective treatment regimens and early prescription.

Also integral to the improvement in outcomes has been the move away from the traditional hepatology model of intervening to reduce transplant or death risk once advanced disease has developed, to a disease modification model of early intervention to prevent progression in the first place and improve quality of life. Inherent in this changed thinking is that transplant is not a panacea for patients (there are challenges around access, especially for women with PBC and patients in minority groups, poor organ quality with long-term sequelae, and, crucially, quality of life after transplant) and it is reasonable to aspire to avoid it if at all possible. This changed treatment model was a key factor in the name change from primary biliary cirrhosis to PBC. Moving to the early diagnosis/early intervention model has, however, contributed significantly to the impasse in therapy development that inspired this white paper. We need to address the conundrum of how to demonstrate improved outcomes that may only be seen many years down the line in response to early therapy intervention, in a way that is acceptable to both patients and regulators. The danger that the PBC community faces is the need to demonstrate that therapies improve survival drives us to evaluate them in advanced disease (the only group of patients in whom a sufficient number of endpoint events would be seen within a feasible trial timeframe). At best this approach forces us to go back to the old, later-stage therapy model, potentially missing out on the maximum benefits of therapies that modify the whole disease course. At worst it means that we can't show that any therapy "works", leading us to potentially lose valuable treatment options.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune-mediated cholestatic liver disease occurring predominantly in middle-aged women and eventually progressing to liver failure. Given that PBC occurs nine times more frequently in women than in men, sex-related factors could affect its pathogenesis and development. PBC is occasionally complicated by osteoporosis due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. Furthermore, hyperbilirubinemia, which develops more frequently and severely with progression of disease than other liver diseases, impairs osteoblast function, resulting in promotion of osteoporosis. These disease conditions predispose patients to fragility fractures affecting morbidity and health-related quality of life.

The reported prevalence of osteoporosis among PBC patients varies from 20 to 37% and is higher than that in the general population (10–11%). Specifically, osteoporosis is closely linked to menopause in women and advanced disease stages. Menopause causes a drastic decline in estrogen, leading to a decrease in bone mass (osteoporosis), and muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). These findings and fact mean that reduced sex hormone concurrent with PBC may increase the frequency and enhance the severity of musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, declining physical function and health-related quality of life due to osteoporosis and sarcopenia are critical concerns in postmenopausal female patients with PBC.

Sarcopenia is characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, and classified into primary sarcopenia when muscle loss is caused by aging and secondary sarcopenia where the loss is caused by underlying diseases, such as chronic liver disease (CLD), inflammatory disorder, and malignancy. Specifically, secondary sarcopenia caused by CLD has become a clinical focus, given that it aggravates health-related quality of life and prognoses for patients with CLD, including those with PBC. Hence, appropriate assessment and treatment of sarcopenia are imperative for PBC patients. Of note, sarcopenia and osteoporosis closely interrelate with each other and frequently coexist in the elderly general population and CLD patients. Consequently, the term 'osteosarcopenia' has been recently defined as the coexistence of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. The presence of osteosarcopenia exacerbates negative health outcomes and has been described as a 'hazardous duet', because it causes both ease of falling (due to sarcopenia) and bone vulnerability (due to osteoporosis).

Despite the clinical research advancements in bone disorders, the accurate prevalence and influencing factors for sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia in PBC patients have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the factors associated with osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and osteosarcopenia and clarify the relationship among these complications in PBC patients.

Background & Aims

The influence of osteoporosis and liver disease on fracture risk is not well characterized in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). We studied a large series of women with PBC to assess the prevalence and risk factors for fractures and the fracture threshold.

Methods

In female patients with PBC (n = 185; age, 55.7 ± 0.7 years; range 28–79 years), age, duration of PBC, menopausal status, and histologic stage and severity of liver disease were assessed. Vertebral and non-vertebral fractures were recorded in 170 and 172 patients, respectively. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were diagnosed based on densitometry analysis.

Results

The prevalences of vertebral, non-vertebral, and overall fractures were 11.2%, 12.2%, 20.8%, respectively. Osteoporosis was significantly more frequent in patients with PBC than in normal women. Osteoporosis was associated with age, weight, height, histologic stage, severity, and duration of liver damage; fractures were associated with osteoporosis, menopause, age, and height but not with severity of PBC. Osteoporosis was a risk factor for vertebral fracture (odds ratio [OR], 8.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.67–26.95). Lumbar T score < -1.5 (OR, 8.27; 95% CI: 1.84–37.08) and femoral neck T score < -1.5 (OR, 6.83; 95% CI: 1.48–31.63) were significant risk factors for vertebral fractures.

Conclusions

Fractures, particularly vertebral fractures, are associated with osteoporosis, osteopenia, and T scores less than -1.5, whereas osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with the severity of liver damage. Patients with T scores less than -1.5 might require additional monitoring and be considered for therapy to prevent fractures.

Asymptomatic versus symptomatic PBC — natural history without ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) shows substantial symptom development and reduced survival. Across series, between 36% and 89% became symptomatic during average follow‑up of 4.5 to 17.8 years, with median time from diagnosis to symptoms between 2 and 4.2 years. In the absence of UDCA therapy, survival is significantly shortened compared with a healthy population. Ten‑year survival of asymptomatic patients in three series ranged from 50% to 70%, whereas symptomatic patients had a median survival of 5 to 8 years from symptom onset. In an early U.S. cohort of 279 patients followed for 24 years, median survival was 7.5 years for symptomatic patients versus 16 years for asymptomatic patients.

Osteoporosis and bone health after liver transplantation — pharmacotherapy and surveillance guidance state that oral alendronate at 70 mg weekly is an appropriate starting point, with intravenous zoledronic acid or ibandronate if oral therapy is not tolerated, and oral alendronate has been given with good effect for 10 years for postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the first 5 years after transplantation, screening by bone mineral density (BMD) should be done yearly for osteopenic patients and every 2 to 3 years for patients with normal BMD; thereafter, screening depends on the progression of BMD and on risk factors (grade 2, level B). If osteopenic bone disease is confirmed or if atraumatic fractures are present, patients should be assessed for risk factors for bone loss, including calcium intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, gonadal and thyroid function, a full medication history, and thoracolumbar radiography (grade 1, level A). The osteopenic LT recipient should perform regular weight-bearing exercise and receive calcium and vitamin D supplements (grade 1, level A), and bisphosphonate therapy should be considered in LT recipients with osteoporosis or recent fractures (grade 1, level A).

2.7 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation

Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium if dietary intake is inadequate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered.

Patients treated with glucocorticoids should receive adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D.

2.8 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses

If a once-weekly dose of alendronate sodium tablet is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. They should not take two doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.
