## Question

tell me about this:

Low-attenuation lesion within the pancreatic body, probable side
branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Follow-up pancreatic
protocol MRI without and with contrast is recommended.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what this CT report means — a low-attenuation lesion in the pancreatic body favored to be a side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) — and whether pancreatic protocol MRI with and without contrast is the appropriate next step, along with the downstream management pathway for such a lesion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a "low-attenuation lesion" on CT implies and how confidently CT can subtype a cyst as BD-IPMN. Then, I should verify the malignant risk spectrum of BD-IPMN versus main-duct disease. Next, I need to check which specific imaging and clinical features risk-stratify IPMN and whether they are provided in the report. After that, I will justify MRI/MRCP technically and clinically as the next imaging step and clarify when to add EUS-FNA. Finally, I should confirm surveillance versus resection thresholds, reconcile guideline differences on follow-up duration, and ensure the report's recommendation aligns with current consensus guidance [^111pttvV] [^114wBdTL].

> Let me first interpret the CT language carefully: a "low-attenuation lesion" is most consistent with a cystic process, and the descriptor "probable side branch IPMN" suggests a suspected cyst–duct communication that CT often cannot prove definitively, so I should confirm that CT's soft-tissue and ductal resolution limitations make this a provisional call pending dedicated ductal imaging with MRCP [^115ugYsq] [^113fRG8n].

> Next, I need to consider BD-IPMN biology and risk spectrum; BD-IPMNs are mucin-producing cystic neoplasms arising from branch ducts with lower but nontrivial malignant potential compared with main-duct or mixed-type IPMN, so surveillance is common but must be risk-stratified, and lifelong follow-up is typically advised while the patient remains fit for surgery due to ongoing progression risk [^112RxEmR] [^113MoGY7].

> Wait, let me verify what information is missing from the CT report that would determine near-term management; I should confirm whether cyst size, mural nodules and their enhancement, main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter, wall thickening/septations, lymphadenopathy, and serum CA 19–9 are documented, because size ≥ 3 cm, nonenhancing nodules, and MPD 5–9 mm are "worrisome features", whereas enhancing mural nodules, obstructive jaundice, or MPD ≥ 10 mm are "high-risk stigmata", and CT often underdetects subtle nodules or small degrees of ductal change [^114wBdTL] [^113wrgoo].

> I will now justify MRI with MRCP as the next step; MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and noninvasive duct mapping to confirm cyst–duct communication, detect small mural nodules, and measure MPD caliber, which are essential for BD-IPMN diagnosis and risk stratification, and all major guidelines prefer MRI/MRCP as the initial comprehensive evaluation for pancreatic cysts to avoid radiation and maximize ductal detail [^111pttvV] [^113fRG8n] [^115ugYsq].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of contrast; enhancing mural nodules are high-risk stigmata, so obtaining MRI with and without gadolinium helps differentiate true enhancing nodules from debris and is appropriate at baseline characterization, although I note that for some surveillance scenarios gadolinium may add limited incremental value, which does not negate its importance when assessing for enhancement on initial staging [^113fRG8n] [^115kELX1].

> Let me think about immediate next steps beyond imaging; I should confirm that ordering a pancreatic protocol MRI/MRCP with and without contrast is paired with checking a serum CA 19–9 given its worrisome-feature status in several algorithms, and then I can align the downstream decision to pursue EUS-FNA based on whether worrisome or high-risk features are found on MRI [^113fRG8n] [^111VeHdH].

> Now, I need to outline risk-tiered management; if MRI shows high-risk stigmata such as an enhancing mural nodule or MPD ≥ 10 mm, surgical consultation is indicated for patients who are operative candidates, whereas worrisome features such as cyst ≥ 3 cm, nonenhancing nodules, or MPD 5–9 mm should prompt EUS-FNA for further stratification and short-interval imaging, and the absence of both high-risk and worrisome features supports nonoperative surveillance [^114wBdTL] [^112oicNU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cyst size > 2 cm alone might mandate resection, but I should double-check cutoffs; while older surgical series associated malignancy with size > 2 cm, contemporary Fukuoka-based algorithms treat size ≥ 3 cm as a worrisome feature that triggers EUS and closer surveillance rather than automatic resection, especially in presumed BD-IPMN, reflecting efforts to limit overtreatment [^116ZXjGc] [^114wBdTL].

> Next, I should review surveillance cadence for low-risk BD-IPMN; after initial diagnosis without high-risk features, a short-interval MRI/MRCP at 3–6 months helps confirm stability, then European guidance favors 6-month follow-up in the first year and annual imaging thereafter for as long as the patient remains surgically fit, whereas AGA suggests stopping after 5 years of stability, a stance increasingly challenged by data showing continued accrual of advanced neoplasia beyond 5 years and late events on extended follow-up [^113fRG8n] [^112RxEmR] [^1167aPDR].

> Hold on, let me verify the rationale for lifelong surveillance; IPMN reflects a pancreatic field defect with risk of de novo PDAC remote from the index cyst and a small but persistent long-term risk of progression, with large contemporary cohorts showing that nearly half of subsequent cancers may arise separate from the surveyed lesion and that clinically relevant progression accumulates over years, which argues against a universal "stop at 5 years" approach in fit patients [^112kprPR] [^111GQe2k].

> I should confirm the report's specific recommendation; "pancreatic protocol MRI without and with contrast" precisely aligns with ACR Appropriateness Criteria and international consensus that MRI/MRCP, preferably with contrast to evaluate enhancement, is the optimal next step for characterizing incidentally detected pancreatic cysts and suspected IPMN, before considering EUS-FNA based on risk features [^111pttvV] [^111VeHdH] [^113fRG8n].

> To synthesize the clinical pathway, let me ensure the steps are clear and internally consistent: obtain pancreatic protocol MRI/MRCP with and without contrast promptly, check CA 19–9, triage to EUS-FNA if MRI reveals worrisome or high-risk features, refer for surgery if high-risk stigmata are present and the patient is fit, and if low-risk, use short-interval confirmation at 3–6 months followed by annual MRI long term while the patient remains a surgical candidate, with multidisciplinary input as needed and counseling that BD-IPMN is typically indolent but warrants sustained surveillance due to nonzero malignant potential and metachronous PDAC risk [^113fRG8n] [^112RxEmR] [^113MoGY7].

A low-attenuation pancreatic body lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN, is a **mucin-producing cystic neoplasm** [^116na1zK] with a low but real malignant potential. MRI with and without contrast is recommended to confirm **ductal communication**, evaluate for **mural nodules** [^115ugYsq], and further characterize the lesion [^111VeHdH]. If no high-risk stigmata or worrisome features are present [^113fRG8n], surveillance is appropriate [^111pttvV]; surgery is reserved for lesions with high-risk features or for fit patients [^113HCiiY] with worrisome features [^115PVpkA].

---

## Clinical significance and malignant potential

- **Malignant potential**: Side-branch IPMNs have a lower risk than main-duct IPMNs [^113wrgoo], but can progress to invasive carcinoma [^1115FwPe] [^111sjr4k].
- **Risk factors**: Cyst size > 3 cm, mural nodules [^116nSpm8], and main duct dilation increase malignancy risk [^113wrgoo].
- **Progression risk**: Low-risk IPMNs have a 3.12% 5-year and 7.77% 10-year cancer risk [^111sjr4k].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

MRI with and without contrast is recommended to confirm **cyst–duct communication** [^1135cCYh] and detect **mural nodules** or **ductal changes** that suggest higher risk [^111VeHdH]. It also avoids radiation and is generally well tolerated [^113fRG8n].

---

## Management guidelines

Management depends on **risk features**:

| **Risk category** | **Features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk stigmata [^114wBdTL] | - Enhancing mural nodule <br/> - Main duct ≥ 10 mm [^117D64pF] <br/> - Obstructive jaundice | Surgical resection if fit |
| Worrisome features [^114wBdTL] | - Cyst ≥ 3 cm [^116nSpm8] <br/> - Non-enhancing mural nodule <br/> - Main duct 5–9 mm [^113wrgoo] <br/> - Thickened cyst wall <br/> - Abrupt duct change with atrophy <br/> - Lymphadenopathy | EUS ± FNA; consider surgery if high-risk features on EUS |
| Low-risk [^112RxEmR] | - No high-risk or worrisome features | Surveillance [^111pttvV] with MRI or EUS [^116fUc2Y] |

---

## Surveillance protocols

Surveillance intervals are based on **cyst size and features** [^113fRG8n]:

- **< 1 cm**: MRI every 2–3 years.
- **1–2 cm**: MRI every 1–2 years [^1167aPDR].
- **2–3 cm**: MRI every 6–12 months [^113fRG8n].
- **> 3 cm or worrisome features**: MRI every 3–6 months; consider EUS.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated when **high-risk stigmata** are present on imaging; it is also indicated when **worrisome features** [^114wBdTL] are accompanied by **high-risk EUS findings**. Patient factors also influence management [^115PVpkA]; surgery is favored for young, fit individuals or those with a strong preference for resection [^113HCiiY].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Low-risk lesions have a **favorable prognosis** and a low risk of progression [^111sjr4k]. High-risk lesions carry a higher progression risk, and surgery improves outcomes in appropriate candidates [^1115FwPe]. For low-risk lesions, surveillance is effective [^111sjr4k], balancing cancer risk against operative morbidity [^112kprPR].

A low-attenuation pancreatic body lesion, likely a side-branch IPMN, **warrants MRI with and without contrast** [^111VeHdH] to confirm the diagnosis and risk-stratify. Management is **guided by risk features** [^114wBdTL], with surveillance for low-risk lesions and surgery for high-risk or selected worrisome-feature lesions.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^113HCiiY]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

All patients "fit for surgery" with high-risk stigmata should undergo surgery. Additionally, young patients fit for surgery with worrisome features should also undergo resection due to their long life expectancy and higher cumulative risk of malignant progression of IPMN or de novo development of PDAC.

Patients fit for surgery without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features will undergo surveillance for early detection of malignant progression of IPMN and early detection of concomitant PDAC. Surveillance for PDAC is also needed in patients who have undergone resection, even for non-invasive IPMN.

The interval and period of surveillance remain controversial. IAP guidelines recommend intervals stratified by cyst size, which can be lengthened after 2 years of stability. Other guidelines recommend discontinuation after 2 years (American College of Radiology 2010) or 5 years (American Gastroenterology Association 2015) of stability. According to the authors, the small risk of malignant progression in stable cysts is outweighed by the costs of surveillance. However, Tanaka suggests discontinuing or lengthening surveillance may be dangerous due to the long-lasting risk of concomitant PDAC in patients with IPMN. Even a 6-month interval might be insufficient for an early diagnosis of PDAC.

In particular, patients with IPMN or patients who have been resected for IPMN need follow-up to detect not only early malignant degeneration of IPMN but also early detection of concomitant PDAC, whether synchronous or metachronous.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^114wBdTL]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) has heterogeneous malignant potential, and thus, the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP), with the Fukuoka consensus in 2012, proposed two-tier criteria to predict malignancy. The first tier is represented by "worrisome features", a group of imaging findings suggesting that the lesion is not malignant yet, but could evolve into malignancy. This requires further evaluation by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to better risk-stratify the lesion and ensure strict follow-up.

- **Fukuoka consensus guidelines, 2012 and 2017**: The Fukuoka consensus guidelines for 2012 (intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm — IPMN — and mucinous cystic neoplasm — MCN) and 2017 (IPMN) outline the criteria. The second tier is represented by "high-risk stigmata", a group of imaging findings suggesting the possibility of malignancy, thus requiring surgical resection if the patient is fit.

The 2012 Fukuoka consensus guidelines were widely accepted, showing high sensitivity for predicting invasive carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia, but had relatively low specificity, leading to a high number of unnecessary pancreatic resections. In 2017, revised Fukuoka consensus guidelines were proposed. However, future cohort studies are needed to determine whether the revised criteria increase specificity without compromising sensitivity.

At the time of writing, the management of IPMN remains controversial. To simplify, according to the 2017 Fukuoka revised consensus, patients with IPMN with high-risk stigmata should undergo resection if fit. Patients with IPMN with worrisome features need further workup, while those with IPMN without worrisome features require ongoing monitoring.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pancreatic cyst [^111pttvV]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, specifically in terms of diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following investigations for the initial evaluation of patients with incidentally detected main pancreatic duct dilation greater than 7 mm in size, with suspected main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm:

- **EUS**: Endoscopic ultrasound should be considered for detailed evaluation.

- **Abdominal MRI with and without IV contrast with MRCP**: A comprehensive imaging approach to assess the pancreatic cysts.

- **Abdominal MRI without IV contrast with MRCP**: An alternative imaging technique that excludes the use of IV contrast.

### Cystic pancreatic lesions: MR imaging findings and management [^115ugYsq]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Segmental MD-IPMN can be observed in MRCP, showing a segmental dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the body of the pancreas. The MPD upstream exhibits signs of chronic obstructive pancreatitis, characterized by finger-like dilatation of branch ducts, although the thickness of the pancreatic gland remains normal. After 20 months, the dilatation of the MPD upstream is no longer visible due to atrophy of the pancreatic gland.

The evolution of a mixed MD-IPMN is seen in T2-weighted images and MRCP, with a dilatation of a branch duct in the tail of the pancreas accompanied by slight enlargement of the MPD in the tail. Five years later, a diffuse dilatation of the MPD is evident.

Mixed-type IPMN manifests as segmental or diffuse dilatation of the MPD and branch ducts along its course. However, BD-IPMN may cause dilatation of the MPD due to mucin overproduction without actual involvement of the MPD, mimicking mixed-type IPMN.

BD-IPMN appears as unifocal or multifocal cystic lesions communicating with the MPD. These cysts may be unilocular or multilocular, with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to some centimeters, often arranged in grape-like clusters and separated by thin septa that usually enhance after the administration of contrast medium. Demonstrating communication with the MPD is essential for the diagnosis of BD-IPMN, making high-quality MRCP the most sensitive and important sequence in the entire MRI protocol.

Unifocal BD-IPMN can be appreciated in T2-weighted and MRCP images, showing a cystic lesion with tiny septa in the head of the pancreas. At T1-weighted imaging after paramagnetic contrast media injection, the septa are visible.

### Assessment of a revised management strategy for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms involving the main pancreatic duct [^117D64pF]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

According to the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) involving the main duct (MD IPMNs) or the main and branch ducts (mixed IPMNs) of the pancreatic system is a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter of 5.0 mm or greater on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, surgical resection is recommended for patients with an MPD diameter of 10.0 mm or greater, which is characterized as a high-risk stigma. An MPD diameter of 5.0 to 9.0 mm is not an indication for immediate resection.

The objective of this study was to determine an appropriate cutoff (i.e. one with high sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the MPD diameter on CT or MRI as a prognostic factor for malignant disease and to propose a new management algorithm for patients with MD or mixed IPMNs.

This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients who underwent surgical resection for a preoperative diagnosis of MD or mixed IPMN, and in whom IPMN was confirmed by surgical pathologic findings at a single institution from July 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015. Malignant disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia or invasive adenocarcinoma on results of surgical pathologic evaluation. An appropriate MPD diameter on preoperative CT or MRI to predict malignant disease was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the new management algorithm that incorporated the new MPD diameter cutoff was evaluated.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: Observations in 145 patients who underwent resection [^1115FwPe]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas arising in branch ducts are thought to be less aggressive than their main-duct counterparts, and guidelines for their conservative management were recently proposed. This study describes the combined experience of two tertiary centers with branch-duct IPMNs, aiming to validate these recommendations.

- **Methods**: A review of 145 patients with resected, pathologically confirmed, branch-duct IPMNs between 1990 and 2005 was conducted.

- **Results**: Sixty-six patients (45.5%) had adenoma, 47 (32%) borderline tumors, 16 (11%) carcinoma in situ, and 16 (11%) invasive carcinoma. Median age was similar between benign and malignant subgroups (66 vs. 67.5 years, respectively). Jaundice was more frequent in patients with cancer (12.5% vs. 1.8%, respectively, P = 0.022) and abdominal pain in patients with benign tumors (45% vs. 25%, respectively, P = 0.025). Forty percent of tumors were discovered incidentally. Findings associated with malignancy were the presence of a thick wall (P), or size ≥ 30 mm (P < .001). All neoplasms with cancer were larger than 30 mm in size or had nodules, or caused symptoms. After a mean follow-up of 45 months, the 5-year disease-specific survival for branch-duct IPMNs with noninvasive neoplasms was 100% and, for invasive cancer, was 63%.

- **Conclusions**: This large cohort of resected branch-duct IPMNs shows that cancer is present in 22% of cases and validates the recent guidelines that indicate absence of malignancy in tumors < 30 mm, without symptoms or.

### The landmark series: Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^113fRG8n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

For non-operative surveillance, all three sets of guidelines state that MRI is the preferred modality over CT because MRI does not expose patients to radiation and is better able to confirm the structural relationship between the cyst and pancreatic duct.

At baseline, the revised Fukuoka guidelines suggest that BD-IPMN patients without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features (such as cysts larger than 3 cm, enhancing mural nodularity, or cyst wall, main duct dilation, stricture, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA19–9, significant growth rate, jaundice, or symptoms) undergo short interval (3–6 months) pancreatic MRI/MRCP or CT to confirm stability. However, unlike the European and AGA guidelines, the revised Fukuoka guidelines provide recommendations on subsequent surveillance according to cyst size.

For patients without an indication for immediate resection, the European guidelines recommend a 6-month follow-up for the first year, with subsequent annual follow-ups as long as no risk factors are present that could prompt surgery. Additionally, in patients with only relative indications for resection, older patients, and those with severe comorbidity, continual 6-month follow-up is suggested.

In cases where there are no indications for resection, the AGA guidelines recommend that patients with cysts smaller than 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic duct receive MRI surveillance in 1 year, followed by every 2 years, for a total period of 5 years if there are no changes in size or characteristics.

### Validation of the 2012 international consensus guidelines using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging: Branch duct and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^113wrgoo]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To validate the 2012 guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas and to compare diagnostic performances of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differentiating malignant from benign IPMN, this study was conducted. As IPMN presents variable risks of malignancy, and its management is closely related to its malignant potential, predicting the risks of IPMN malignancy is crucial.

This retrospective study included 158 patients with surgically confirmed IPMN of the pancreas who underwent both preoperative CT and MRI. Two radiologists evaluated the "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features" of the 2012 guidelines for branch duct (BD)-IPMN and main duct (MD)-IPMN. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to identify significant predictors of malignancy in IPMN. The diagnostic performance was compared between CT and MRI.

Malignant IPMN was observed in 8 of 60 patients (13.3%) with BD-IPMN and 44 of 98 patients (44.9%) with MD-IPMN. The presence of a mural nodule was the most important predictor in BD-IPMN and MD-IPMN, with odds ratios of 9.2 and 7.6 respectively (P = 0.01 on CT), and 5.7 and 13.3 respectively (P ≤ 0.04 on MRI). Mural nodule size and lymphadenopathy were significant only in MD-IPMN (P = 0.34).

In conclusion, the presence of a mural nodule was the most important predictor of malignancy in both types of IPMN, emphasizing the significance of this feature for diagnostic purposes.

How should surgical specimens with an IPMN lesion be examined and reported?

- **Gross examination**: Involvement of the MPD and/or branch duct(s), the length of the MPD that is macroscopically involved, and the largest diameter of the dilated MPD or of the cyst, in cases of BD-IPMNs, should be recorded. In cases of multifocal BD-IPMNs, the largest diameter of each lesion should be reported.

- **Histopathological examination**:
	- **IPMN without invasive carcinoma**: The histological subtype should be documented (gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, or oncocytic), based on morphology and immunohistochemical staining. For grading of dysplasia in an IPMN, the use of a two-tiered classification system (low-grade vs. high-grade dysplasia) is recommended.
	- **IPMNs with associated invasive carcinoma**: The largest diameter of the invasive lesion should be measured and reported, in addition to the overall size of the lesion. The associated invasive carcinoma should be reported according to the WHO and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) recommendations. If transition from an IPMN to invasive carcinoma is not demonstrable, complete sampling of the intervening tissues should be conducted to substantiate whether the IPMN and invasive carcinoma are truly separate.

The term 'malignant IPMN' should not be used. Instead, it should be simply stated whether invasion is present or not. It is important to assess the histological subtype of IPMN, since it is associated with the prediction of postoperative outcomes.

### "High-risk stigmata" of the 2012 international consensus guidelines correlate with the malignant grade of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^112oicNU]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

The 2012 international consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas stratified patients into two clinical categories, "high-risk stigmata" and "worrisome features", and recommended different therapeutic strategies for these groups. The aim of this study was to elucidate the significance of these categories in terms of predicting malignant IPMNs.

The medical records of 100 consecutive patients who underwent pancreatectomy for IPMNs were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy patients with branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMNs) were stratified into three groups. The relationships between the number of predictive factors and histopathologic grade were investigated.

The prevalence rates of malignant IPMN, invasive carcinoma, and lymph node metastasis in the high-risk group were 80%, 55%, and 20%, respectively, with these percentages significantly increasing in a stepwise manner according to the number of predictive factors. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between the number of worrisome features and grade of malignancy in patients stratified as having worrisome BD-IPMNs.

The number of high-risk stigmata correlated significantly with the grade of malignancy of BD-IPMNs. The presence of at least one high-risk stigma in patients with BD-IPMNs indicates a need for pancreatectomy with lymphadenectomy.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, particularly concerning surveillance imaging, ACG 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining short-interval MRI or EUS, with or without FNA, in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or mucinous cystic neoplasms. This is particularly advised for those with new onset or worsening diabetes mellitus, or a rapid increase in cyst size (> 3 mm/year), as they may have an increased risk of malignancy.

### Cyst features and risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: a meta-analysis [^116nSpm8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Aims: International guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas recommend surgical resection of those with specific characteristics. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of malignancy associated with each of these features of IPMNs.

Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE from January 1, 1996, to November 11, 2011, for studies that included any of the features mentioned in the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of main duct and branch duct IPMNs. Data were analyzed from 41 studies for the following features: cyst size greater than 3 cm, the presence of mural nodules, dilated main pancreatic duct, symptoms, and main duct vs. branch duct IPMNs. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with carcinoma in situ or more advanced histology. A separate meta-analysis was performed for each risk factor to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs). A random-effects model was used based on the assumption of variation among study populations.

Results: The risks of malignancy associated with individual cyst features were as follows: cyst size greater than 3 cm (OR, 62.4; 95% confidence interval, 30.8–126.3), presence of a mural nodule (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 5.3–16.1), dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (OR, 7.27; 95% CI, 3.0–17.4), and main vs. branch duct IPMN (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.3–6.9). There was a moderate level of heterogeneity among studies (I(2) range, 34–67).

Conclusions: Based on a meta-analysis, cyst features proposed by the international guidelines for resection of IPMN were high.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^112RxEmR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as the progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN, several factors may predict progression during surveillance (e.g. diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

- **Clinical implications**: For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

	- For patients with a relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidities, a 6-month follow-up is recommended (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN, lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection, therefore, does not eliminate the need for continued monitoring.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^116na1zK]. Human Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a grossly visible (≥ 1 cm), mucin-producing neoplasm that arises in the main pancreatic duct and/or its branches. Patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm can present with symptoms caused by obstruction of the pancreatic duct system, or they can be asymptomatic.

There are three clinical subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: main duct, branch duct, and mixed. Five histologic types of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm are recognized: gastric foveolar type, intestinal type, pancreatobiliary type, intraductal oncocytic papillary neoplasm, and intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. Noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are classified into three grades based on the degree of cytoarchitectural atypia: low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade dysplasia. The most important prognostic factor is the presence or absence of an associated invasive carcinoma.

Some main duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms progress into invasive carcinoma, mainly tubular adenocarcinoma (conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) and colloid carcinoma. Branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have a low risk for malignant transformation. Preoperative prediction of the malignant potential of an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is of growing importance because pancreatic surgery has its complications, and many small intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, especially branch duct-intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, have an extremely low risk of progressing to invasive cancer.

### Consequences of a surveillance strategy for side-branch intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms: Long-term follow-up of one thousand cysts [^112kprPR]. Annals of Surgery (2024). High credibility.

To quantify the rate of progression in surveilled cysts and assess which factors should indicate delayed resection, researchers investigated side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (SB-IPMNs), which are increasingly identified, complicating the decision of which patients require resection to avoid inappropriate treatment. While most incidental lesions are surveyed, the outcomes of this strategy remain uncertain.

A prospectively maintained database of pancreatic cystic neoplasms was queried for patients with SB-IPMN. Patients included had ≥ 2 imaging studies > 6 months apart. Clinically relevant progression (CR-progression) was defined by symptoms, worrisome/high-risk stigmata, or invasive cancer (IC), with growth ≥ 5 mm in two years considered CR-progression; size ≥ 3 cm alone was not.

- **Results**: Between 1997 and 2023, 1,337 patients were diagnosed with SB-IPMN. Of these, 37 (2.7%) underwent up-front surgery, and 1,000 (75.0%) had > 6 months of surveillance. The CR-progression rate was 15.3% (n = 153) based on criteria such as size increase (n = 63, 6.3%), main-duct involvement (n = 48, 4.8%), symptoms (n = 8, 5.0%), or other criteria (n = 34, 3.4%). After a median follow-up of 6.6 years (interquartile range: 3.0–10.26), 17 patients (1.7%) developed IC. Among those with CR-progression, 11.1% (n = 17) developed IC, and 6.5% (n = 10) developed high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Nearly half of the cancers were not contiguous with the surveyed SB-IPMN. Size ≥ 3 cm was not associated with HGD/IC (P = 0.232). HGD/IC was least common in CR-progression determined by size growth (6.3%) versus main-duct involvement.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pancreatic cyst [^111VeHdH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neoplastic pancreatic cysts, and more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following investigations for the initial evaluation of patients with an incidentally detected pancreatic cyst greater than 2.5 cm in size with high-risk stigmata and worrisome features:

- **Eus**: This investigation provides detailed evaluation and is imperative when assessing pancreatic cysts.

- **Abdominal MRI without and with IV contrast with MRCP**: This imaging is crucial in delineating the anatomical features of cysts and associated structures within the pancreas.

These guidelines aim to ensure a comprehensive initial evaluation for optimal patient management.

### Progression of unresected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas to cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sjr4k]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

This study aims to clarify the management of patients with low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas, focusing on the progression of IPMNs to cancer. The cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer development in individuals with unresected, particularly low-risk, IPMNs was investigated.

We conducted a systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases until November 30, 2016. The search targeted studies reporting on the cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer in patients with unresected IPMNs or those providing data detailed enough to calculate cumulative incidence values. Patient series were categorized into studies on low-risk IPMNs (lesions without main pancreatic duct involvement or mural nodules) and those on non-low-risk IPMNs. We calculated meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up using the inverse variance method and a random-effects model.

From 1514 articles screened, we identified 10 studies of low-risk IPMNs (n = 2411) and 9 studies of non-low-risk IPMNs (n = 825). In low-risk IPMN studies, the meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 0.02% at 1 year (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-0.23%; I² = 0.0%), 1.40% at 3 years (95% CI, 0.58%-2.48%; I² = 58.5%), 3.12% at 5 years (95% CI, 1.12%-5.90%; I² = 88.0%), and 7.77% at 10 years (95% CI, 4.09%-12.39%; I² = 79.8%). In contrast, these values were found to be much higher in non-low-risk IPMN studies, where the cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 1.95% at 1 year.

### Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with compressed sensing at 1.5 T: Clinical application for the evaluation of branch duct IPMN of the pancreas [^1135cCYh]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Written informed consent for the MRI was obtained from each patient. Institutional review board approval was granted by means of a general waiver for studies with retrospective data analysis (local research ethics committee, Medical University of Innsbruck; 20 February 2009). The authors, who are employees of Siemens Healthcare, had no control over any data and were not involved in the execution of the study.

- **Patients**: Patients were included in the study using the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients referred to the Department of Radiology (Medical University of Innsbruck) for the MRI evaluation of a cystic lesion of the pancreas; (2) age > 18 years; (3) no history of pancreatic surgery; (4) acquisition of our whole MRCP protocol as mentioned below; (5) suspicion of branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN) in our MRI report, with positive communication of the cystic lesion with the main pancreatic duct in at least one sequence, no previous MRI available, or in other imaging procedures (e.g. computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), or previous MRI), i.e. positive communication of the cystic lesion with the main pancreatic duct, mentioned in the report.

		- **Patient demographics**: After searching our internal database, we retrospectively included 41 patients (27 female; 14 male; median age, 69 years; range, 46–89 years) between March 2018 and December 2018. Of these, 18 out of 41 were referred with suspicion, and 23 out of 41 for follow-up of BD-IPMN (patients with previous MRI).

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^116Nu32q]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All patients with a presumed diagnosis of BD-IPMN, lacking any WF and/or HRS at the time of diagnosis, observed between January 2006 and December 2015, were included in the study. A highly probable diagnosis of BD-IPMN was based on the presence of one or more dilated branch ducts communicating with a non-dilated MPD (3 mm or less) on high-resolution imaging, including MRI and/or CT with intravenous contrast and/or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).

A certain diagnosis of IPMN was based on cytological diagnosis obtained by EUS fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or fine-needle biopsy (FNB). Patients were considered eligible for the study only if they had low-risk BD-IPMN, were under active surveillance, and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. A family history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), considered as at least one first-degree relative affected by pancreatic cancer, was evaluated in the entire cohort.

Patients aged less than 18 years, those with a history of major pancreatic surgery, and patients with WF and/or HRS at diagnosis were excluded from the analysis. WF and/or HRS were based on 2012 guidelines and classified as follows:

- **WF**: Cyst size over 30 mm, non-enhancing mural nodules, MPD 5–9 mm, acute pancreatitis, thickened enhanced cyst walls, and abrupt change in the MPD calibre with distal pancreatic atrophy.

- **HRS**: Major symptoms including jaundice, enhancing nodules, presence of malignant cells at cytology, and MPD size at least 10 mm.

Pathological assessment included FNA and FNB.

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^113754FS]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with a non-suspicious cyst should have an imaging test after 6–12 months (agree 83.7%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Patients with a newly detected indeterminate solid lesion should have follow-up screening at 3 months, if surgery is not imminent (agree 85.7%, grade low, 'do it'). If an indeterminate main pancreatic duct stricture is detected, repeat imaging should be performed within 3 months (agree 95.9%, grade low, 'do it').

Cystic branch-duct lesions (presumed BD-IPMNs) without concerning features indicating malignancy should be re-evaluated at intervals depending on size, similar to accepted international consensus guidelines for sporadic BD-IPMNs. The majority of such BD-IPMNs remained stable during follow-up.

Small (< 1 cm diameter) lesions identified as solid by EUS are difficult to manage, particularly when not detected by MRI or CT. These lesions can be aspirated, but the yield for these lesions is low. Some indeterminate solid lesions identified only by EUS are cancers, but they can be benign lesions, such as non-metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or low-grade PanIN with focal associated lobulocentric parenchymal atrophy. There was no consensus reached on the need for additional tests such as CT, ERCP, FNA, or the timing of repeat imaging, although 73.5% suggested 3 months to evaluate these lesions.

Long-term follow-up of PC screening cohorts is lacking, with a maximum follow-up period of 10 years and a mean follow-up time of 4 to 4.2 years. Importantly, the group acknowledged that until there are additional studies, we will not know if screening HRIs saves lives.

### Is it necessary to follow patients after resection of a benign pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114SWqr1]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the risk of subsequently developing a new or progressive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) after partial pancreatic resection of a noninvasive IPMN.

- **Study design**: One hundred thirty patients with more than 1 year of follow-up after resection were included in this analysis.

- **Results**: At a median follow-up of 38 months, 22 (17%) developed imaging evidence of a new or progressive IPMN. Eleven (8%) underwent completion resection. Three of the 11 patients had invasive adenocarcinoma. Two other patients developed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and did not undergo resection. All 5 patients (4%) with cancer had negative margins at initial operation. Sixteen of 100 patients (16%) with negative margins for IPMN at the initial operation developed a new IPMN vs. 6 of 30 patients (20%) with margins positive for IPMN (p = ns). Five of 22 patients (23%) with a new IPMN had a family history of pancreatic cancer, while 8 of 108 patients (7%) without a new IPMN had a family history (p < 0.05). Overall, the chances of developing a new IPMN at 1, 5, and 10 years after the initial surgery were 4%, 25%, and 62%, respectively, and of requiring surgery were 1.6%, 14%, and 18%, respectively. The estimated chances of developing invasive pancreatic cancer were 0%, 7%, and 38% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Patients who have undergone resection for noninvasive IPMN require indefinite close surveillance because of the risks of developing a new IPMN, requiring surgery, and developing cancer. A family history of pancreatic cancer increases these risks.

### Management of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: observation with MR imaging [^114riHFZ]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical outcomes of conservative management by observation with MRI of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs), the study enrolled twenty-three consecutive patients. These patients were followed up with MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for more than nine months after their initial MRI examinations. The number of lesions, the maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs, lesion location, the presence of associated dilation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD), the presence of enhancing mural nodules within the lesion, and the presence of interval changes were retrospectively reviewed in consensus by two radiologists using initial and follow-up MR images. All patients were evaluated for evidence of malignant progression of the disease.

The follow-up period ranged from 10 to 96 months, with a mean of 37 months. On initial MRI with MRCP, a total of 39 lesions were found in 23 patients. The maximum diameter of BD-IPMNs ranged from 6 to 32 mm, with a mean of 12 mm. Thirty-four lesions (87%) in 19 patients remained unchanged in maximum diameter. Five lesions (13%) in four patients showed an increase in maximum diameter. Enhancing mural nodules were not found in any individual on the initial MRI study or the follow-up studies. There was no patient with evidence of local aggressive tumor growth or metastases to distant sites.

Our study suggests that branch-duct IPMNs without enhancing mural nodules are essentially benign.

### Benefit of extended surveillance of low-risk pancreatic cysts after 5-year stability: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JwiqT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Aims: Low-risk branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) lacking worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS) warrant surveillance. However, their optimal duration, especially among cysts with initial 5 years of size stability, warrants further investigation. We systematically reviewed the surveillance of low-risk BD-IPMNs and investigated the incidence of WF/HRS and advanced neoplasia, including high-grade dysplasia and pancreatic cancer, during the initial 5 years.

Methods: A systematic search (CRD42020117120) identified studies investigating long-term IPMN surveillance outcomes of low-risk IPMN from sources such as the Cochrane Library, Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, from inception until July 9, 2021. The outcomes included the incidence of WF/HRS and advanced neoplasia, disease-specific mortality, and surveillance-related harm, expressed as a percentage per patient-years. The meta-analysis relied on time-to-event plots and used a random-effects model.

Results: Forty-one eligible studies underwent systematic review, and 18 studies were meta-analyzed. The pooled incidence of WF/HRS among low-risk BD-IPMNs during initial and extended surveillance was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.0%-3.7%) and 2.9% (95% CI, 1.0%-5.7%) patient-years, respectively, whereas the incidence of advanced neoplasia was 0.6% (95% CI, 0.2%-1.00%) and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.5%) patient-years, respectively. The pooled incidence of disease-specific mortality during initial and extended surveillance was 0.3% (95% CI [text cut off]).

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^114CtJmJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

In the general population, the prevalence of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is around 8 percent. Most lesions are branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are usually detected incidentally. They have a more indolent behavior than mixed-type or main-duct IPMNs. In 2006, international consensus guidelines incorporated non-operative management for low-risk asymptomatic IPMNs less than 30 mm in size, with negative cytology, and without nodules and main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation. Updates of the guidelines in 2012 and 2017 introduced two categories of risk for malignancy: worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS), and surveillance was recommended for BD-IPMNs lacking these features. A similar approach was proposed in the 2018 European guidelines and validated by different studies. International and European guidelines propose a different surveillance schedule for low-risk BD-IPMNs, but they are concordant in supporting lifetime observation unless patients become unfit for surgery. A more liberal approach has been suggested by the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines, which include discontinuation of surveillance after 5 years in the absence of significant changes. Although lifetime surveillance is costly, a general recommendation for discontinuation after 5 years may be inappropriate. Therefore, studying the progression of low-risk BD-IPMN is clinically relevant for a better definition of surveillance timing and possible discontinuation in selected patients. The aim of the present study is to…

### Should patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas undergo long-term radiographic surveillance? Results of 3024 patients evaluated at a single institution [^114D8EVL]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Gastroenterological Association recommended the discontinuation of radiographic surveillance after 5 years for patients with stable pancreatic cysts. The study evaluated the yield of continued surveillance of pancreatic cysts up to and after 5 years of follow-up.

A prospectively maintained registry of patients evaluated for pancreatic cysts was queried (1995–2016). Patients who initially underwent radiographic surveillance were divided into those with a 5mm increase in diameter, cross-over to resection, and development of carcinoma were performed.

A total of 3024 patients were identified, with 2472 (82%) undergoing initial surveillance. The ≥ 5 year group (n = 596) experienced a greater frequency of cyst growth (44% vs. 20%; P < 0.0001), a lower rate of cross-over to resection (8% vs. 11%; P = 0.02), and a similar frequency of progression to carcinoma (2% vs. 3%; P = 0.07) compared with the < 5 year group (n = 1876). Within the ≥ 5 year group, 412 patients (69%) had demonstrated radiographic stability at the 5-year time point. This subgroup, when compared with the < 5 year group, experienced similar rates of cyst growth (19% vs. 20%; P = 0.95) and lower rates of cross-over to resection (5% vs. 11%; P < 0.0001) and development of carcinoma (1% vs. 3%; P = 0.008). The observed rate of developing cancer in the group that was stable at the 5-year time point was 31.3 per 100,000 per year, whereas the expected national age-adjusted incidence rate for this group.

### Do consensus indications for resection in branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm predict malignancy? A study of 147 patients [^113323at]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent consensus guidelines suggest that the presence of one or more of the following is an indication for resection (IR) of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN-Br): cyst-related symptoms, a main pancreatic duct diameter of 10 mm or more, cyst size of 30 mm or more, intramural nodules, or cyst fluid cytology suspicious/positive for malignancy. Among a cohort of patients with IPMN-Br, we determined if the consensus IR (CIR), presence of multifocal IPMN-Br, or growth of cyst size on follow-up predicts malignancy.

Methods involved identifying 147 patients with IPMN-Br, of whom 66 underwent surgical resection at diagnosis and 81 were followed conservatively, with 11 being resected during follow-up. Clinical data, imaging, histological, and cyst fluid characteristics from all patients were obtained from clinical records and/or by contacting the patients. The presence of CIR at baseline and during follow-up (N = 66), multifocal cysts (N = 57), and increases in cyst size (N = 38) were documented in all cases.

Among the 77 resected IPMN-Brs, at initial evaluation, 61 had at least one CIR and 16 had none. Malignancy was present in 9 out of 61 (15%) with CIR and 0 out of 16 without IR (P = 0.1). When the presence of any CIR was taken as an indicator of malignancy, the CIR had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%, 23%, 14%, and 100%, respectively. The prevalence of malignancy in those with single versus multifocal IPMN-Br was similar (13% vs. 11%). No patient developed malignancy following a median follow-up.

### Treatment guidelines for branch duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: When can we operate or observe [^116ZXjGc]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the clinicopathological features of branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and to determine safe criteria for its observation. Most clinicians agree that surgical resection is required to treat main duct-type IPMN because of its high malignancy rate. However, no definite treatment guideline regarding the management of branch duct type IPMN has been issued, addressing whether surgery or observation is appropriate.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological data of 138 patients who underwent operations for IPMN between 1993 and 2006 at five institutes in Korea.

- **Results**: Of 138 patients (mean age 60.6 years; 87 men, 51 women), 76 underwent pancreatoduodenectomy, 39 distal pancreatectomy, 4 total pancreatectomy, and 20 limited pancreatic resection. There were 112 benign cases, consisting of 47 adenomas and 63 borderline cases. There were 26 malignant cases, with 9 being noninvasive and 17 invasive. By univariate analysis, tumor size and the presence of a mural nodule were identified as meaningful predictors of malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a tumor size of > 2 cm was the most valuable predictor of malignancy. When cases were classified according to tumor size and the presence of a mural nodule, the malignancy rate for a tumor size > 2 cm was > 25%.

- **Conclusions**: Many branch duct IPMNs are malignant. Surgical treatment is recommended, except in cases that are sufficiently low-risk for observation.

### Incidental cystic neoplasms of pancreas: What is the optimal interval of imaging surveillance [^1151eJNr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The optimal interval for imaging studies in the surveillance of incidental pancreatic cystic neoplasms is not yet determined. A retrospective analysis of longitudinal medical records of patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms was conducted to examine the natural history of these incidentally detected cystic pancreatic neoplasms, focusing on the development of significant growth and identifying predictors of such growth.

After excluding patients with small cysts (< 10 mm, N = 144), inadequate clinical follow-up of less than 6 months (N = 79), and those with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocysts, serous cystadenoma, main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (N = 29), and neuroendocrine tumor (N = 3), a total of 166 cysts in 150 patients were available for analysis. The working diagnoses for these cysts, based on clinical and radiological features, aspiration cytology, cyst fluid analysis, and surgical pathology data when available, were mucinous cystic neoplasm in 117 cases and branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 49 cases. The mean initial size of these cysts was 2 cm with a standard error (SE) of 0.1 cm. Over a median follow-up period of 32 months (inter-quartile range [IQR] 19–48), 89% of all cysts did not show significant growth.

In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, the initial size of the cystic lesion was an independent predictor of significant growth during follow-up (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.61, P = 0.01). The only other significant variable identified was the presence of intracystic growth.

### Risk of the watch-and-wait concept in surgical treatment of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^111SAMV6]. JAMA Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The natural history of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) remains uncertain, and inconsistencies among published guidelines preclude accurate decision-making. The outcomes and potential risks of a conservative watch-and-wait approach versus a surgical approach must be compared.

This cohort study provides an overview of the surgical management of IPMNs, focusing on the timing of resection. Conducted in a single referral center, it analyzed patients with pathologically proven IPMN who underwent pancreatic resection between October 2001 and December 2019. Preoperative imaging and medical history were scrutinized for signs of progression and/or malignant features. The timeliness of resection was categorized into too early (adenoma and low-grade dysplasia), timely (intermediate-grade dysplasia and in situ carcinoma), and too late (invasive cancer). Perioperative characteristics and outcomes were compared across these groups.

- **Exposures**: Timeliness of resection according to the final pathological findings.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The risk of malignant transformation at the final pathology.

The results revealed that out of 1439 patients, 438 (30.4%) were classified as too early, 504 (35.1%) as timely, and 497 (34.5%) as too late. Radiological criteria for malignant conditions were identified in 53 of 382 patients (13.9%) in the too early group, 149 of 432 patients (34.5%) in the timely group, and 341 of 385 patients (88.6%) in the too late group (p < 0.001).

### Incidental pancreatic cysts: Natural history and diagnostic accuracy of a limited serial pancreatic cyst MRI protocol [^115kELX1]. European Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This study examines the natural history of incidentally detected pancreatic cysts and evaluates whether a simplified MRI protocol without gadolinium is adequate for lesion follow-up.

Over a 10-year period, 301 patients with asymptomatic pancreatic cysts underwent follow-up (45 months ± 30). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol included axial, coronal T2-weighted images, MR cholangiopancreatographic, and fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences before and after gadolinium. Three radiologists independently reviewed the initial MRI and the follow-up studies, first using only unenhanced images and then gadolinium-enhanced sequences. Lesion changes during follow-up were recorded, and the added value of gadolinium-enhanced sequences was assessed by classifying the lesions into risk categories.

A total of 301 patients (1,174 cysts) constituted the study population. Only 35 of 301 patients (12%) showed significant lesion changes on follow-up. Multivariate analysis identified initial lesion size as the only independent factor associated with lesion growth (OR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7–3.3; P < 0.001) and mural nodule development (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.4; P = 0.03) during follow-up. No patient with an initial lesion size of less than 2 cm developed cancer during the follow-up period. Intra-observer agreement with and without gadolinium enhancement ranged from 0.86 to 0.97. After a consensus review of discordant cases, gadolinium-enhanced sequences demonstrated no added value.

In conclusion, most incidental pancreatic cystic lesions did not demonstrate change during follow-up. The addition of gadolinium enhancement was not necessary for lesion risk stratification.

### Are the current guidelines for the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas adequate? A multi-institutional study [^115WcWUq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Controversy persists regarding the management of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). International consensus guidelines stratify patients into high-risk, worrisome, and low-risk categories.

- **Study design**: The medical records of seven institutions were reviewed for patients who underwent surgical management of IPMN between 2000 and 2015.

- **Results**: There were 324 patients included in the analysis; 60.4% of patients had main-duct/mixed type, and 39.7% had branch-duct IPMN. The median cyst size was 2.65 cm. Invasive cancer (IC) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) was present in 42% (n = 136); 68.9% of patients with high-risk features, 40.0% of patients with worrisome features, and 24.6% of patients with low-risk features exhibited HGD/IC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only 1 of 3 high-risk features and 2 of 7 worrisome features predicted the presence of HGD/IC. Positive predictive values for HGD/IC in patients with obstructive jaundice and lymphadenopathy were 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.91), respectively. In the absence of high-risk features, HGD/IC was still present in 57.4% of patients with 2 or more worrisome features. Regression analysis demonstrated that each additional worrisome factor present was additive in predicting HGD/IC in a linear fashion (odds ratio 1.39; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: These data demonstrate that the consensus guidelines for surgical resection of IPMN may not adequately stratify and identify patients at risk for having HGD or invasive cancer.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: A single-institution experience [^113DGv8E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30%, and that half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma. Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms, and in particular, regarding long-term prognosis.

Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and that it is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery. In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^114uYR5F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

This multicenter study of 661 patients with an average follow-up of nearly four years showed that the Fukuoka criteria perform exceptionally well in discriminating presumptive high-risk BD-IPMN from those posing minimal or no risk (such as when patients die from causes other than pancreatic disease). Clinically suspected BD-IPMN with one or more Fukuoka criteria were much more likely to harbor or develop pancreatic cancer compared to those without these features. A total of 59 pancreatic malignancies occurred in the group of 250 patients with at least one Fukuoka criterion. This corresponds to a 28% cumulative risk over a seven-year period of follow-up using Kaplan-Meier analysis. There was only one case of pancreatic cancer in the group of 411 patients with benign-appearing lesions (1.2% cumulative risk over a seven-year period). These findings support the use of Fukuoka criteria to risk stratify clinically suspected BD-IPMN, as recommended in the 2012 revised international consensus guidelines.

Most pancreatic malignancies (80%) were found at the time of index EUS, immediate surgery, or during the first year of follow-up. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough evaluation of indeterminate pancreatic cysts at the time of cyst diagnosis and during the first year of follow-up. These prevalent cancers were found in 7.3% of the cohort, which is much lower than the estimate of 25.5% derived from surgical data of resected BD-IPMN, likely reflecting differences in patient populations and referral patterns.

### Natural history of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules: A Japan Pancreas Society multicenter study [^112MaaVV]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was made by imaging when a dilated main pancreatic duct (MPD) or a cystically dilated branch duct was recognized in association with secretion of mucin from the major or minor papilla, or mobile filling defects in the pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This diagnosis was also made when multilocular cystic lesions were recognized on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and/or computed tomography (CT). Branch duct IPMN was defined as a condition in which the main lesion was a cystically dilated branch duct with an MPD diameter of less than 10 mm. The size of the dilated branch duct was measured en bloc in patients with multilocular cysts.

The presence or absence of mural nodules (MNs) in cystic branches was determined based on morphological features on EUS at the initial diagnosis. Color Doppler imaging or contrast-enhanced EUS was not applied in most of the cases due to the prevalent use of a mechanical radial scanner. Changes in the height of MNs were assessed primarily by follow-up EUS at registration, as available. In patients who underwent surgery after follow-up, the diagnosis of IPMN was confirmed histologically. Pathologic results were determined based on the World Health Organization criteria published in 2010; these criteria are as follows: low-grade dysplasia ("intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma"), intermediate-grade dysplasia ("IPMN with moderate dysplasia"), high-grade dysplasia ("intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, noninvasive", "carcinoma in situ"), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The highest pathologic grade was applied when there were multifocal lesions.

### Editorial: Stopping pancreatic cyst surveillance [^1149sYWx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with pancreatic cysts, especially presumed branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs), remains a challenge. BD-IPMNs carry a very low risk of malignancy and occur in predominantly older individuals who often die from causes not related to their pancreatic disease. The specific decision to stop surveillance of presumed low-risk BD-IPMNs (those without either worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS)) is controversial. It needs to balance the real risk of malignancy or developing malignancy and IPMN-related mortality with the patient's life expectancy, quality of life expectations, and mortality from non-pancreatic-related causes.

With improved life expectancy, improved survival from non-pancreatic malignancies, rising health costs, and growing detection of ever smaller presumed BD-IPMNs, this issue is becoming ever more critical.

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111Nfhzr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is uncertain in patients with clinically suspected branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) based on the "high-risk stigmata" or "worrisome features" criteria proposed in the 2012 international consensus guidelines ("Fukuoka criteria").

- **Methods**: Retrospective case series involving patients referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of indeterminate pancreatic cysts with clinical and EUS features consistent with BD-IPMN. Rates of pancreatic cancer occurring at any location in the pancreas were compared between groups of patients with one or more Fukuoka criteria ("Highest-Risk Group", HRG) and those without these criteria ("Lowest-Risk Group", LRG).

- **Results**: After exclusions, 661 patients comprised the final cohort (250 HRG and 411 LRG patients), 62% female with an average age of 67 years and 4 years of follow-up. Pancreatic cancer, primarily adenocarcinoma, occurred in 60 patients (59 HRG, 1 LRG). Prevalent cancers diagnosed during EUS, immediate surgery, or the first year of follow-up were found in 48/661 (7.3%) of the cohort and exclusively in HRG (33/77, 42.3%). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the cumulative incidence of cancer at 7 years was 28% in HRG and 1.2% in LRG patients (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: This study supports using Fukuoka criteria to stratify the immediate and long-term risks of pancreatic cancer in presumptive BD-IPMN. The risk of pancreatic cancer was highest during the first year and occurred exclusively in those with "high-risk stigmata" or "worrisome features" criteria.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cysts: A white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^113dKJNr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for managing pancreatic cysts that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update from the pancreatic component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Pancreas Subcommittee, which included abdominal radiologists, a gastroenterologist, and a pancreatic surgeon, developed this algorithm.

The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Algorithm branches successively categorize pancreatic cysts based on patient characteristics and imaging features. They terminate with an ascertainment of benignity and/or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up) or a management recommendation. The algorithm addresses most, but not all, pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve the quality of care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected pancreatic cysts.

### Malignant progression in IPMN: A cohort analysis of patients initially selected for resection or observation [^111GQe2k]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) may represent a field defect of pancreatic ductal instability. The relative risk of carcinoma in regions remote from the radiographically identified cyst remains poorly defined. This study describes the natural history of IPMN in patients initially selected for resection or surveillance.

- **Methods**: Patients with IPMN submitted to resection or radiographic surveillance were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Comparisons were made between these two groups.

- **Results**: From 1995 to 2010, a total of 356 of 1,425 patients evaluated for pancreatic cysts fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median follow-up for the entire cohort was 36 months. Initial resection was selected for 186 patients (52%); 114 had noninvasive lesions and 72 had invasive disease. A total of 170 patients underwent initial nonoperative management. Median follow-up for this surveillance group was 40 months. Ninety-seven patients (57% of those under surveillance) ultimately underwent resection, with noninvasive disease in 79 patients and invasive disease in 18. Five of the 18 (28%) invasive lesions developed in a region remote from the monitored lesion. Ninety invasive carcinomas were identified in the entire population (25%), ten of which developed the invasive lesion separate from the index cyst, representing 11% with invasive disease.

- **Conclusions**: Invasive disease was identified in 39% of patients with IPMN selected for initial resection and 11% of patients selected for initial surveillance. Ten patients developed carcinoma in a region…

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^112Qpygr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The primary endpoint was the development of WF and/or HRS during surveillance. Secondary endpoints included the development of pathologically confirmed malignant IPMN, including both high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and invasive carcinoma, and the occurrence of PDAC not associated with IPMN.

Demographic, radiological, pathological, and follow-up data were obtained from prospectively developed institutional databases. BD-IPMN was considered incidentally discovered in the absence of acute pancreatitis, jaundice, or other symptoms, including worsening or new-onset diabetes, steatorrhea, unintentional weight loss, and non-specific abdominal pain. The latter symptom was described as pain without irradiation to the back and/or without an increased serum amylase level. The site of IPMN was defined according to the anatomical location (head versus body–tail) and the number of lesions. It was described as diffuse when multiple cysts were present and focal when a single cyst was diagnosed.

Surveillance was carried out using a combination of CT, MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and EUS, but also included transabdominal ultrasonography, as stated in the Italian guidelines. Notably, transabdominal ultrasonography was an imaging modality complementary to MRI or EUS. The date of diagnosis, date of each follow-up, and type of imaging were recorded. In patients with multiple lesions, the features of the largest cyst were included.

Indications for surgery were considered relative when WF occurred or absolute when HRS developed during surveillance. Histology was assessed accurately and completely to ensure precise patient management guidelines.

### Higher growth rate of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms associates with worrisome features [^113JHcs1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

For patients with branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs, cysts), it is a challenge to identify those at high risk for malignant lesions. We sought to identify factors associated with the development of pancreatic cancer, focusing on neoplasm growth rate.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of 189 patients with BD-IPMNs who underwent at least two contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging studies, one year or more apart, at a tertiary referral center from January 2003 through 2013. Patients with cysts that had Fukuoka worrisome or high-risk features were excluded. Two radiologists reviewed all images. Cyst size was recorded at the initial and final imaging studies, and growth rate was calculated. We collected patient demographic data, cyst characteristics, and clinical outcomes; univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of developing worrisome features. The primary outcomes were to determine the growth rate of low-risk BD-IPMNs and to assess whether cyst growth rate correlates with high-risk features of IPMNs.

- **Results**: Based on image analyses, cysts were initially a median 11 mm (range, 3–31 mm), and their final size was 12.5 mm (range, 3–42 mm). After a median follow-up time of 56 months (range, 12–163 months), the median cyst growth rate was 0.29 mm/year. Twelve patients developed worrisome features, no patients developed high-risk features, four patients had surgical resection, and no cancers developed. The rate of BD-IPMN growth was greater in patients who developed worrisome features than those who did not.

### Noninvasive discrimination of low and high-risk pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^116w8sbm]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

To propose a noninvasive diagnostic approach, which allows reliable distinction between low- and high-risk pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

IPMNs are identifiable precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer, for which surgical resection is warranted prior to the development of invasive carcinoma. However, low-grade IPMNs should not be unnecessarily resected and diagnostic tools that preoperatively enable accurate risk stratification of IPMNs are missing.

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 56 patients who underwent surgical resection for IPMN, including 18 low-risk (low-grade) and 38 high-risk (high-grade/invasive carcinoma) IPMNs, from whom clinical features and serum samples were prospectively obtained. An antibody microarray platform was used to analyze the serum proteome. Based on serum markers and selected clinical characteristics, support vector machine models were constructed to predict the risk of IPMN malignancy.

A serum protein signature discriminating low- and high-risk IPMN patients was identified. Combinations of established clinical features and the newly identified serum biomarkers correctly distinguished low- and high-risk IPMNs in 93% on 1000-fold cross-validation.

This study highlights the synergistic predictive value of combining a novel serum protein signature with conventional clinical characteristics to risk-stratify IPMN patients. If these findings are supported by larger validation studies, they might enable more rational decision-making in clinical management.

### Validation of the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: More than 5 years of follow-up [^112mnbrN]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines suggest that imaging surveillance be conducted for 5 years for patients with at most one high-risk feature. If there are no significant changes, surveillance is stopped. We sought to validate this follow-up strategy.

- **Methods**: In study 1, data were analyzed for 392 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and at most one high-risk feature who were periodically followed up for more than 1 year with imaging tests. In study 2, data were analyzed for 159 IPMN patients without worsening high-risk features after 5 years (stop surveillance group).

- **Results**: In study 1, pancreatic cancer (PC) was identified in 12 patients (27.3%) in the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) indication group and none in the non-EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In the EUS-FNA indication group, 11 patients (25%) died, whereas 29 (8.3%) died in the non-EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In study 2 (stop surveillance group), PC was identified in three patients (1.9%) at 84, 103, and 145 months.

- **Conclusions**: PC risk and mortality for IPMNs not showing significant change for 5 years is likely to be low, and the non-EUS-FNA indication can provide reasonable decisions. However, three patients without worsening high-risk features for 5 years developed PC. The stop surveillance strategy should be reconsidered.

- **Key points**: The AGA guidelines provide reasonable clinical decisions for the EUS-FNA indication. In the stop surveillance group, PC was identified in 3 patients (1.9%).

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^113MoGY7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

In the discussion, it is noted that non-operative management of presumed BD-IPMN without worrisome features (WF) or high-risk stigmata (HRS) is a safe strategy. The overall rate of malignancy during follow-up was low, with invasive cancer occurring in 1.1 percent of patients. Factors associated with the development of WF/HRS included localized IPMN, main pancreatic duct (MPD) size between 3 and 5 mm, and cyst size of at least 20 mm. Center expertise or strategy influenced the detection rate.

Several studies have identified cyst size over 15 mm as an independent predictor of the development of WF/HRS in patients with low-risk BD-IPMNs undergoing surveillance. MPD dilatation is crucial for assessing IPMN risk of malignancy. Most studies have focused on the risk of malignancy when the MPD was between 5 and 9 mm or more than 10 mm in size. Few studies addressed the size of a normal MPD (less than 5 mm) as a possible predictor of subsequent development of WF/HRS. An MPD growth rate of at least 0.2 mm/year is considered an independent predictor of WF/HRS. The present study adds to the literature by indicating that an MPD diameter between 3 and 5 mm represents a risk factor for WF/HRS.

### Natural history of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with mural nodules: A Japan Pancreas Society multicenter study [^115GnXKG]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Another problematic issue in patients with BD-IPMNs is that a distinct PDAC may develop either synchronously or metachronously. Ohtsuka et al. reported that the incidence of synchronous and metachronous multifocal occurrence of IPMNs in the remnant pancreas during follow-up evaluation after pancreatectomy for IPMNs was 20% and that of distinct PDAC was 9.9%. Izawa et al. stated the possibility of multicentric development of cancer in IPMN, based on the observation that hyperplasia developed multifocally in different branch ducts with a different frequency of K-ras point mutation. In this study, we could not detect any significant predictive factors for the development of PDAC concomitant with IPMN.

The present study has several limitations. First, because of the retrospective nature of this study, the modality used for monitoring BD-IPMN at intervals of 3 to 6 months was at the discretion of each institution, not following a unified protocol. Second, the presence of MNs was determined based solely on morphological features on EUS without color Doppler imaging, which may have resulted in the inclusion of mucus nodules. However, the requirement in the inclusion criteria to have undergone EUS, US, and/or CT at least twice is thought to have minimized this risk. Third, the number of patients with MNs included in this study was not large because the presence of MNs is considered to be the most important factor for the surgical indication of BD-IPMN regardless of its height. However, the subjects were patients who had been followed up despite having MNs, and the study continued accordingly.

### Management of incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: Integrating novel diagnostic and prognostic factors with current clinical guidelines [^112X4QMK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Owing to increased detection rates, the diagnosis and management of incidental pancreatic cysts have become a common predicament. Up to 13% of patients undergoing cross-sectional imaging studies for other indications are found to have pancreatic cystic lesions. Although most cystic lesions are benign, the malignant potential of several types of pancreatic cysts makes accurate classification vital to directing therapy. Advances in the last decade have led to better characterization of pancreatic cyst morphology, enhancing the ability to predict underlying histopathology and biological behavior. Although accurate classification remains a challenge, the utilization of complementary diagnostic tools is the optimal approach to dictate management.

The following review includes a description of pancreatic cysts, a critical review of emerging diagnostic techniques, and a review of recent guidelines in the management of incidental pancreatic cysts.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^114SW6w3]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **What is the best imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN**: MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN; EUS can be used in selected cases (GRADE 1B, strong agreement). See section 3 for details.

- **Should the progress of IPMN be followed for as long as the patient is fit for surgery**: The risk of IPMN progression increases over time, therefore patients affected by IPMN without indication for surgery should be followed up until they are no longer fit for surgery (GRADE 1B, strong agreement). The risk of progression of IPMN increases over time as does the risk of developing indications for surgical resection. Interruption of surveillance is not recommended if the patient is fit for a potential surgical resection. A single study on IPMN concluded that patients with a Charlson-age comorbidity index ≥ 7 have an 11-fold risk of comorbidity-related death within 3 years and only 6% of patients will die of malignant IPMN.

- **Should patients with IPMNs be screened for other tumours (including pancreatic cancer)**: The incidence of new extra-pancreatic neoplasms during the follow-up evaluation of pancreatic IPMN is not significantly greater than in the general population. Comprehensive screening outside the national protocols might not be necessary. Patients with IPMN are at risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and attention should be paid to its concomitant development even when an IPMN has been successfully resected (GRADE 1C, strong agreement). A systematic review concluded that the available data remain inconclusive.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: Multicentre study [^114dQ4fY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Different surveillance strategies for patients with low-risk branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPMN) have been described. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMN and to identify risk factors for the development of worrisome features (WF), high-risk stigmata (HRS), and pancreatic malignancies.

- **Methods**: This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients with BD-IPMN who were under active surveillance between January 2006 and December 2015. Patients were eligible if they had a low-risk lesion and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Outcomes were the development of WF/HRS or cytologically/histologically confirmed malignant IPMN.

- **Results**: Of 837 patients included, 168 (20 percent) developed WF/HRS. At the end of the observation time, 132 patients (79 percent) with WF/HRS were still under surveillance without progression to pancreatic cancer. Factors associated with the development of WF or HRS in multivariable analysis included localized nodules (versus diffuse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95 percent CI 0.26 to 0.68), cyst size 15–19mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 1.88, 1.23 to 2.87) or at least 20mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 3.25, 2.30 to 4.60), main pancreatic duct size over 3mm (versus 3mm or less: HR 2.17, 1.41 to 3.34), and symptoms at diagnosis (versus no symptoms: HR 2.29, 1.52 to 3.45). Surveillance in an endoscopy-oriented centre was also associated with increased detection of WF or HRS (versus radiology-oriented: HR 2.46, 1.74 to 3.47).

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): Are cyst volumetry and other novel imaging features able to improve malignancy prediction compared to well-established resection criteria [^112CZgxg]. European Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Guidelines base the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) on several well-established resection criteria, including cyst size. However, malignancy may occur in small cysts. Since branch-duct IPMN are not perfect spheres, volumetric and morphologic analysis might better correlate with mucin production and grade of dysplasia. Nonetheless, their role in malignancy (high-grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) prediction has been poorly investigated. Previous studies evaluating resection criteria also included patients with solid-mass-forming pancreatic cancer, which may affect the criteria's yield. This study aimed to assess the role of volume, morphology, and other well-established criteria in malignancy prediction in patients with branch-duct and mixed-type IPMN after excluding solid masses.

Retrospective ethical review-board-approved study of 106 patients (2008–2019) with histopathological diagnosis of branch-duct and mixed-type IPMN (without solid masses) and preoperative MRI available was conducted. Standard imaging and clinical features were collected. The novel imaging features cyst volume and elongation value [EV = 1 − (width/length)] were calculated on T2-weighted images. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with statistical significance set at two-tailed, p < 0.05.

### Biomarker risk score algorithm and preoperative stratification of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions [^11355Bjz]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2021). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are incidentally detected in up to 13% of patients undergoing radiographic imaging. Of the most frequently encountered types, mucin-producing (mucinous) pancreatic cystic lesions may develop into pancreatic cancer, while nonmucinous ones have little or no malignant potential. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical for optimal management, but has been difficult to achieve, resulting in unnecessary major surgery. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm based on biomarker risk scores to improve risk stratification.

- **Study design**: Patients undergoing surgery and/or surveillance for a pancreatic cystic lesion, with diagnostic imaging and banked pancreatic cyst fluid, were enrolled in the study after informed consent (n = 163 surgical, 67 surveillance). Cyst fluid biomarkers with high specificity for distinguishing nonmucinous from mucinous pancreatic cysts (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], glucose, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], amylase, cytology, and DNA mutation) were selected. Biomarker risk scores were used to design an algorithm to predict preoperative diagnosis. Performance was tested using surgical (retrospective) and surveillance (prospective) cohorts.

- **Results**: In the surgical cohort, the biomarker algorithm outperformed the preoperative clinical diagnosis in correctly predicting the final pathologic diagnosis (91% vs. 73%; p < 0.000001). Specifically, nonmucinous serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) were correctly classified more frequently by the algorithm than clinical diagnosis (96% vs. 30%; p < 0).

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^1159R24S]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is uncertain in patients with clinically suspected branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (BD-IPMN) based on the "high-risk stigmata" or "worrisome features" criteria proposed in the 2012 international consensus guidelines ("Fukuoka criteria").

- **Methods**: A retrospective case series was conducted involving patients referred for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of indeterminate pancreatic cysts with clinical and EUS features consistent with BD-IPMN. Rates of pancreatic cancer occurring at any location in the pancreas were compared between groups of patients with one or more Fukuoka criteria ("Highest-Risk Group", HRG) and those without these criteria ("Lowest-Risk Group", LRG).

- **Results**: After exclusions, 661 patients comprised the final cohort (250 HRG and 411 LRG patients), with 62% being female, an average age of 67 years, and a follow-up period of 4 years. Pancreatic cancer, primarily adenocarcinoma, occurred in 60 patients (59 HRG, 1 LRG). Prevalent cancers diagnosed during EUS, immediate surgery, or the first year of follow-up were found in 48/661 (7.3%) of the cohort and exclusively in HRG (33/77, 42.3%). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the cumulative incidence of cancer at 7 years was 28% in HRG and 1.2% in LRG patients (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: This study supports using the Fukuoka criteria to stratify the immediate and long-term risks of pancreatic cancer in presumptive BD-IPMN. The risk of pancreatic cancer was highest during the first year and occurred exclusively in those with "high-risk stigmata" or "worrisome features" criteria.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^111vdsgQ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Lifelong surveillance is recommended following resection of an IPMN, as long as the patient is fit and willing to undergo surgery if indicated. Patients with evidence of an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma should be followed up in the same manner as those with a resected pancreatic cancer. IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN should have close follow-up every 6 months for the first 2 years, followed by yearly surveillance. IPMN with low-grade dysplasia should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected IPMN (see statement 4.2 and figure 1 for details). Patients with IPMN in the remnant pancreas, who do not have high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN, should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected BD-IPMN (see section 4.15 and figure 1 for details). Follow-up imaging using MRI or EUS is recommended (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Several studies have reported that IPMN recurrence is possible 5 to 10 years after resection. The risk of BD-IPMN and MD-IPMN recurrence is similar (7–8%). Resected IPMN with low-grade dysplasia have a low risk of recurrence (5.4–10%) with disease-free survival of approximately 52 months, while IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma have a higher risk (> 50%), with disease-free survival of 29 months.

- **Diagnostic investigation**: For a patient with an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma, preoperative investigation should be performed. The criteria used should be the same as for pancreatic cancer.
