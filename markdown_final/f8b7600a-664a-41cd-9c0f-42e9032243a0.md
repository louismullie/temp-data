## Question

How does obesity contribute to insulin resistance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how obesity contributes to insulin resistance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initiating event of caloric excess and adipose expansion. Then, I should verify the role of ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity in muscle and liver. Next, I will examine inflammatory signaling and macrophage-mediated effects. After that, I need to check adipokine dysregulation and their systemic impact. I will then consider mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, followed by central nervous system insulin resistance. I should also review the gut microbiome's contribution, and finally integrate how these mechanisms converge to impair insulin signaling and create a vicious cycle, while noting exceptions and clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the initiating event: sustained caloric excess drives adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, expanding fat mass and altering adipose tissue biology, which is the foundational substrate for insulin resistance in obesity [^113991aD]. Wait, let me verify the temporal relationship — does insulin resistance precede or follow weight gain? Evidence suggests insulin action can be attenuated within days of overnutrition, indicating that insulin resistance can precede significant weight accrual, though the full phenotype consolidates with continued excess adiposity and ectopic fat deposition [^1116qMsx].

> I will now examine ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. When subcutaneous adipose storage capacity is exceeded, fatty acids spill over to liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, generating toxic lipid intermediates such as diacylglycerol and ceramides that impair insulin signaling by activating serine/threonine kinases and inhibiting IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathways, producing hepatic and muscle insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction [^112nF1CC]. Hold on, I should verify whether impaired disposal rather than increased delivery can drive this — yes, reduced oxidative capacity and impaired fatty acid handling in muscle and liver contribute to intramyocellular and intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance, reinforcing the lipotoxic model [^112nF1CC].

> Next, I should review inflammatory signaling, and I need to check which pathways are most central. Obesity triggers chronic, low-grade inflammation with activation of JNK and IKKβ/NF-κB pathways, which serine-phosphorylate IRS proteins and blunt insulin signaling; macrophage infiltration and crown-like structures in adipose tissue are key histopathologic correlates of this process [^112FxFvC] [^112Vt4qS]. Let me verify the macrophage polarization angle — classically activated macrophages amplify inflammation, while alternatively activated macrophages may be protective, underscoring the therapeutic potential of modulating macrophage programs [^111VQCkr].

> I should confirm adipokine dysregulation next, because endocrine signals from adipose tissue materially alter systemic insulin sensitivity. In obesity, TNF-α and IL-6 are elevated and directly interfere with insulin receptor signaling, while adiponectin is suppressed, removing an insulin-sensitizing signal; resistin has also been implicated as a link between adiposity and impaired glucose homeostasis, although its human relevance remains debated [^1114mW4T] [^1139NrNm]. Wait, let me verify the directionality — reduced adiponectin tracks with insulin resistance across populations, and experimental augmentation of adiponectin signaling improves insulin sensitivity, supporting a causal contribution [^115kWQ5k].

> I need to ensure I incorporate mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress, as these are frequent downstream consequences of nutrient excess. Lipid overload and inflammatory signaling impair mitochondrial oxidative capacity, increase ROS, and activate ER stress kinases, which converge on IRS inhibition and reduced insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue; importantly, interventions that enhance mitochondrial function improve insulin action, arguing for pathogenic relevance [^111V3rif] [^112Vt4qS]. Hold on, I should verify whether mitochondrial defects are primary or secondary — data suggest both can occur, but the net effect is a self-reinforcing cycle of oxidative stress and signaling blockade [^111V3rif].

> Let me consider central insulin resistance, because I should double-check whether the brain is an early node. Hypothalamic insulin and leptin resistance dysregulate energy balance, promote hyperphagia, and impair suppression of hepatic glucose production, thereby worsening hyperglycemia and peripheral insulin resistance; human studies demonstrate impaired neuronal insulin responses in obesity, supporting a brain-periphery axis in pathogenesis [^117V3g4L] [^111FeqeE]. Hmm, wait a minute — does central resistance precede or follow peripheral resistance? Evidence suggests bidirectionality, but diet-induced central insulin resistance can occur early and amplify peripheral metabolic dysfunction [^117V3g4L].

> I should review the gut microbiome contribution, and I need to be cautious not to overstate causality in humans. Obesity alters microbiota composition, increasing fermentation products like acetate that can stimulate parasympathetic tone, enhance insulin secretion, promote ghrelin and hyperphagia, and thereby exacerbate obesity and insulin resistance; microbial transfer experiments in animals causally modulate host metabolism, though human data remain largely associative [^111yMdjP] [^113s4ahQ]. But wait, what if timing matters? Longer-term microbiota alterations appear more tightly linked to chronic insulin resistance than acute changes, aligning with the concept that dysbiosis contributes to sustained metabolic inflammation and dysglycemia [^114CFmiD].

> Now, I will integrate how these mechanisms converge to impair insulin signaling, and I should confirm the key nodes. Lipotoxic intermediates, inflammatory kinases, and oxidative/ER stress converge on IRS-1/2 to inhibit PI3K/Akt, reducing GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, while failing to restrain hepatic gluconeogenesis; this creates compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which itself can propagate β-cell stress and further insulin resistance, completing a vicious cycle [^113KVWXp] [^1116qMsx]. Hold on, I should verify whether hyperinsulinemia is merely compensatory or also pathogenic — hyperinsulinemia can independently worsen insulin resistance and β-cell function, reinforcing the cycle beyond simple compensation [^113boLzG].

> I should double-check exceptions and heterogeneity, because not all obese individuals are insulin resistant. Variability in subcutaneous adipogenic capacity, ectopic fat distribution, genetic susceptibility, and inflammatory tone explain discordant metabolic phenotypes; some individuals with high BMI remain insulin sensitive if they have low visceral and ectopic fat, whereas others with relatively modest adiposity can be markedly insulin resistant if ectopic deposition is high [^1129D63k] [^113991aD]. Let me reconsider whether inflammation always precedes insulin resistance — adolescent data suggest insulin resistance can precede systemic cytokine elevations in some contexts, underscoring pathogenic heterogeneity and the need for individualized risk assessment [^114grLfw].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit and supported. Weight loss, exercise, and pharmacotherapies that reduce ectopic fat, dampen inflammation, or enhance insulin sensitivity can reverse many of these defects. Early caloric restriction rapidly depletes hepatic and pancreatic fat and restores first-phase insulin secretion, while sustained weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, aligning mechanism with therapeutic response [^1173nJN6] [^1116qMsx]. Hold on, I should verify that these interventions map onto the mechanisms — yes, they reduce lipotoxicity, lower inflammatory signaling, improve mitochondrial function, and in some cases modulate central or microbiome axes, explaining their clinical efficacy [^1173nJN6] [^1116qMsx].

Obesity causes insulin resistance primarily through **ectopic lipid accumulation** (lipotoxicity) in liver and muscle [^1129D63k], which impairs insulin signaling via diacylglycerol/ceramide-mediated inhibition of IRS-1/PI3K/Akt [^112nF1CC]. Chronic, low-grade **inflammation** from adipose tissue [^116VK3pG] releases TNF-α, IL-6, and resistin, further disrupting insulin action [^1139NrNm] and promoting insulin resistance [^111VQCkr]. Adipokine dysregulation (low adiponectin, high leptin/resistin) [^1114mW4T], mitochondrial dysfunction, and ER/oxidative stress [^111V3rif] amplify these defects. Central insulin resistance in the brain worsens glucose homeostasis [^117V3g4L], and the gut microbiome contributes via increased LPS and short-chain fatty acids [^111yMdjP] [^112pjqoS]. These mechanisms converge to impair insulin action in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue [^111yb5Gp], driving hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes [^1114WYwR].

## Ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity

- **Ectopic fat deposition**: Excess caloric intake exceeds adipose storage, leading to lipid accumulation in liver (steatosis), muscle, and pancreas, causing insulin resistance [^1129D63k] [^112KM8cM].

- **Lipotoxicity**: Saturated fatty acids generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides, which activate PKCθ and JNK, serine-phosphorylating IRS-1 and inhibiting PI3K/Akt, impairing insulin signaling [^112FxFvC] [^112nF1CC].

- **Hepatic insulin resistance**: Increased hepatic DAG/PKCε impairs insulin receptor kinase, increasing gluconeogenesis and VLDL export, worsening hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia [^116MccZv].

---

## Chronic inflammation and adipokine dysregulation

- **Adipose tissue inflammation**: Obesity drives macrophage infiltration and cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-6, resistin), which inhibit IRS-1 and insulin signaling [^111VQCkr] [^116VK3pG].

- **Adipokine imbalance**: Low adiponectin (insulin-sensitizing) and high leptin/resistin promote insulin resistance and inflammation [^1114mW4T] [^1139NrNm].

- **Systemic inflammation**: Elevated CRP and proinflammatory cytokines correlate with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome [^114k5xkf].

---

## Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress

Mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity reduces oxidative capacity, increases ROS, and promotes **insulin resistance** [^111V3rif]. Oxidative stress from ROS damages insulin signaling proteins and worsens insulin resistance [^114U2XQx]. Endoplasmic reticulum stress from nutrient excess activates inflammatory pathways that further impair insulin action [^112pjqoS].

---

## Central insulin resistance

Hypothalamic insulin resistance disrupts glucose and energy homeostasis, worsening **peripheral insulin resistance** [^117V3g4L]. Leptin resistance further impairs appetite and glucose control, compounding insulin resistance [^notfound].

---

## Gut microbiome alterations

Dysbiosis in obesity increases LPS and short-chain fatty acids, triggering **inflammation** and insulin resistance [^111yMdjP] [^112pjqoS]. Microbiome-derived metabolites modulate host metabolism and insulin sensitivity [^111yMdjP] [^113s4ahQ].

Obesity causes insulin resistance through **ectopic lipid accumulation**, chronic inflammation, adipokine dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, central insulin resistance, and gut microbiome alterations, all of which impair insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis, increasing type 2 diabetes risk [^116K2LYy].

### Insulin resistance as the core defect in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115zQbCM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and plays a key role in associated metabolic abnormalities, such as dyslipidemia and hypertension. Obesity, especially visceral adiposity, is negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. The release of free fatty acids from adipocytes can block insulin-signaling pathways and lead to insulin resistance. In addition, recently identified adipocyte-specific chemical messengers, the adipocytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, adiponectin, and resistin, appear to modulate the underlying insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is combined with beta-cell defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, or type 2 diabetes can result. The thiazolidinediones are potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists and directly improve insulin resistance and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence supports the early use of thiazolidinediones for preventing, delaying, or treating diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity and beta-cell insulin secretion.

### A central role for JNK in obesity and insulin resistance [^112FxFvC]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Obesity is closely associated with insulin resistance and establishes the leading risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, yet the molecular mechanisms of this association are poorly understood. The c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) can interfere with insulin action in cultured cells and are activated by inflammatory cytokines and free fatty acids, molecules that have been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. Here we show that JNK activity is abnormally elevated in obesity. Furthermore, an absence of JNK1 results in decreased adiposity, significantly improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced insulin receptor signalling capacity in two different models of mouse obesity. Thus, JNK is a crucial mediator of obesity and insulin resistance and a potential target for therapeutics.

### Viewpoints on the way to the consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The adipose tissue [^1129dFRp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The primacy of defective subcutaneous fat storage versus visceral fat enlargement in the development of metabolic complications is supported by evidence in patients with total lipodystrophy, who experience severe insulin resistance despite the lack of visceral fat. In addition, treatments that selectively augment the ability of subcutaneous tissue to take up and store fat (including glitazones in humans and subcutaneous fat re-implantation in animals) have a major impact to reverse insulin resistance and normalize metabolic risk factors without modifying (or even increasing) the total mass of ectopic fat depots. Conversely, liposuction fails to correct the metabolic disturbances, i.e. insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, in obese humans; this may be partly accounted for by the fact that lifestyle is not modified, and macronutrient intake is a demonstrated source of oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially interfering with insulin signaling. Subcutaneous tissue is at least 10-fold larger than visceral fat mass, and its production of FAs and adipokines outweighs the contribution of those from nonsubcutaneous fat depots. The immediate consequence of a defect in subcutaneous storage capability is the uncontrolled outflow of substrates (FAs) and compensatory expansion of alternative fat depots or deposition of triglycerides in nonadipose tissues. Thus, removal of part, or all, of a fat depot leads to expansion of alternative fat tissue.

### Inflammation: the link between insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes [^114k5xkf]. Trends in Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Recent data have revealed that the plasma concentration of inflammatory mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is increased in the insulin resistant states of obesity and type 2 diabetes, raising questions about the mechanisms underlying inflammation in these two conditions. It is also intriguing that an increase in inflammatory mediators or indices predicts the future development of obesity and diabetes. Two mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Firstly, glucose and macronutrient intake causes oxidative stress and inflammatory changes. Chronic overnutrition (obesity) might thus be a proinflammatory state with oxidative stress. Secondly, the increased concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6, associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, might interfere with insulin action by suppressing insulin signal transduction. This might interfere with the anti-inflammatory effect of insulin, which in turn might promote inflammation.

### Why does obesity cause diabetes? [^1114WYwR]. Cell Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The accumulation of an excessive amount of body fat can cause type 2 diabetes, and the risk of type 2 diabetes increases linearly with an increase in body mass index. Accordingly, the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity has led to a concomitant increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The cellular and physiological mechanisms responsible for the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes are complex and involve adiposity-induced alterations in β cell function, adipose tissue biology, and multi-organ insulin resistance, which are often ameliorated and can even be normalized with adequate weight loss.

### Long term but not short term exposure to obesity related microbiota promotes host insulin resistance [^114CFmiD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The majority of individuals with features of prediabetes, such as glucose intolerance, eventually develop T2D. Environmental factors such as diet and lower activity/exercise levels contribute to the increased prevalence of prediabetes, which. coincides with increased incidences of obesity. The composition of the intestinal microbiota can also influence postprandial glucose responses. The composition of the gut microbiota is altered by obesity, T2D, insulin sensitizing drugs, age, diet constituents and exercise among other environmental factors –. It is not clear how or when the microbiota contributes to the progression of glucose intolerance versus obesity. This is an important distinction because not all obese individuals develop insulin resistance, glucose intolerance or T2D. Further, the timing and progression of obesity can be different from that of dysglycemia

The intestinal microbiota can contribute to host energy balance and lipid deposition through hormonal cues. Microbial transplant experiments show that differences in the gut bacterial community are sufficient to increase adiposity, independently of host genetics. Hence, there is a strong connection between the microbiota and obesity, but it is not clear if a microbiota-induced change in adiposity is the primary factor contributing to glucose intolerance. In mice, diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota more than host genetics and it is already known that increasing dietary fat content can rapidly perturb the composition of the microbiota within days. An obesogenic, low fiber, high-fat diet (HFD) is a widely used model that induces insulin resistance and glucose intolerance that is coincident with obesity in rodents. The mechanisms underpinning glucose intolerance during the initial stages of feeding this obesogenic diet are different than those governing chronic glucose intolerance during prolonged diet-induced obesity. For example, ectopic lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle and liver is associated with glucose intolerance after the first few days of HFD feeding, whereas metabolic tissue inflammation plays a more prominent role in propagating glucose intolerance after months of HFD-feeding in mice. It is not clear if diet-induced changes in the microbiota contribute to the mechanisms underpinning acute versus chronic insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. We wanted to fill this knowledge gap by testing if short term or long term diet-induced changes in the microbiota were sufficient to alter glycemic control.

### Diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in COVID-19: molecular interrelationship and therapeutic implications [^111TcegH]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 manifestations and evolution has improved over the past 10 months, but the reasons why evolution is more severe in obese and diabetic patients are not yet completely understood.

Main text

In the present review we discuss the different mechanisms that may contribute to explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 including viral entrance, direct viral toxicity, endothelial dysfunction, thromboinflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

Conclusions

We show that the viral infection activates an integrated stress response, including activations of serine kinases such as PKR and PERK, which induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance. In parallel, we correlate and show the synergy of the insulin resistance of COVID-19 with this hormonal resistance of obesity and diabetes, which increase the severity of the disease. Finally, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of drugs used to treat insulin resistance and diabetes in patients with COVID-19.

### Viewpoints on the way to the consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The adipose tissue [^112K6AeD]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Adipose tissue metabolism, perfusion, and inflammation

Adipose tissue accounts for 10–20% of whole-body glucose utilization. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal is impaired in obese nondiabetic subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. It has been suggested that expansion of fat mass partly compensates for the defect in insulin action, supporting a role for adipose tissue in attenuating insulin resistance. Notably, fat-specific GLUT4 deletion causes whole-body insulin resistance, whereas muscle GLUT4 ablation stimulates adipose tissue glucose disposal. Recent data in humans document higher fasting FA uptake in adipose tissue in obese subjects. Circulating FA levels are typically increased in insulin-resistant states and generally correlate with the severity of insulin resistance; normal FA levels may be observed, if a compensatory increase in FA clearance occurs. An acute increase in FFA concentrations in normal subjects leads to acute cellular inflammation, as revealed by the increase in nuclear factor κB and macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Both of these factors have been implicated as potential causes of insulin resistance, thus suggesting an additional indirect mechanism of FA-induced insulin resistance.

Adipose tissue blood flow is reduced in obese nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects, and this could lead to a defect in triglyceride clearance by adipocytes and FA spillover from adipose tissue. The perfusion defect may be due, in part, to adipocyte enlargement, which cannot be compensated by adequate angiogenesis. The diameter (140–180 μm) achieved by enlarged adipocytes is greater than the diffusion distance of oxygen, thus limiting the exchange between blood and adipocyte cytoplasm. Hypoxia may inhibit adipocyte differentiation and adiponectin expression, promote formation of free radicals and inflammation, and lead to cell death. Consistent with this, macrophages in adipose tissue are localized primarily around dead adipocytes. Increased numbers of macrophages in fat are observed in obese individuals, and newly recruited macrophages have a greater increase in proinflammatory properties than resident ones. Inflammation and macrophage infiltration intensify with increasing obesity and can be reversed by weight loss.

### Preliminary evidence for obesity-associated insulin resistance in adolescents without elevations of inflammatory cytokines [^114grLfw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Rodent studies suggest that obesity-associated low grade chronic inflammation is critical for the development of insulin resistance. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway is central in the cascade leading from inflammation to insulin resistance. These relationships are not well understood, and most human studies in adults are cross-sectional and only establish a co-occurrence of inflammation and insulin resistance, but cannot inform which occurs first. The few existent prospective human studies use non-naturalistic experimental diet paradigms that cause rapid weight gain, but also hyperglycemia, and are therefore not optimal to elucidate the physiological mechanism behind gradual weight gain leading to insulin resistance. In contrast to adult studies, where obesity is most frequently associated with insulin resistance, adolescents can be obese without having overt insulin resistance. For this reason, adolescents provide a more straightforward opportunity to investigate the causal relationship between inflammation and insulin resistance in the human. Our data clearly suggests that among obese adolescents insulin resistance may precede the elevation of systemic cytokines and some adipokines.

The adipokines adiponectin and resistin were not different across our lean and obese adolescent groups, whereas leptin was significantly higher in the obese group. Unlike adiponectin and resistin, leptin is a satiety signal. Leptin expression can be increased by gastric hormones like ghrelin and as a compensatory mechanism for the leptin resistance that is frequently observed in obesity. Also, unlike adiponectin and resistin, which are only produced by adipocytes, leptin is also produced by gastric epithelium cells and glands in the gastric fundus. Lastly, adiponectin and resistin are more sensitive to changes in inflammatory homeostasis. Increases in inflammation can decrease adiponectin and increase resistin; however, leptin expression is not as sensitive to these biological changes. These relationships are clearly captured in our data, where we showed elevations in the acute phase reactants and leptin but not in inflammatory cytokines nor adiponectin and resistin.

### The inflammatory syndrome: the role of adipose tissue cytokines in metabolic disorders linked to obesity [^1164V32k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

The metabolic effects of obesity have made this highly prevalent disease one of the most common risk factors for diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, the leading causes of end-stage renal failure. However, obesity per se, as defined by body mass index, is less predictive of the development of these diseases than is the presence of a constellation of obesity-related abnormalities now known as the metabolic syndrome. Recognition of this syndrome, which can readily be identified in clinical settings using defined threshold values for waist circumference, BP, fasting glucose, and dyslipidemia, allows for earlier intervention in these high-risk patients. Systemic insulin resistance has been implicated as one possible factor that links visceral obesity to adverse metabolic consequences; however, the mechanism whereby adipose tissue causes alterations in insulin sensitivity remains unclear. Infection and inflammation are commonly associated with insulin resistance, and visceral obesity is associated with a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state, suggesting that inflammation may be a potential mechanism whereby obesity leads to insulin resistance. Moreover, adipose tissue is now recognized as an immune organ that secretes numerous immunomodulatory factors and seems to be a significant source of inflammatory signals known to cause insulin resistance. Therefore, inflammation within white adipose tissue may be a crucial step contributing to the emergence of many of the pathologic features that characterize the metabolic syndrome and result in diabetes and atherosclerosis. This review describes the role of proinflammatory cytokines and hormones released by adipose tissue in generating the chronic inflammatory profile associated with visceral obesity.

### Inflammation, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes: back to the future? [^112Vt4qS]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

The current-day investigations that link obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance, including the articles featured in this issue of Diabetes, result from research findings from the early 1990s. Research reported at the time suggested that a protein called tumor necrosis factor-α, produced by adipocytes and overproduced with obesity, can attenuate metabolism locally and systemically. Since those initial reports, research on adipocyte secretions (e.g. interleukin-6, resistin, adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and angiotensinogen) and their role in whole-body insulin action has been aggressivley pursued. The investigations have focused on intracellular pathways modulated by these adipocyte products and have provided a total restructuring of concepts about obesity, insulin resistance, and development of type 2 diabetes. Specifically, research has established that the link between inflammation and insulin resistance resides at the level of the IκB kinase-β (IKKβ)/NFkB axis. As such, modulation of this system with regard to clinical treatment is being actively investigated.

The precise physiological events leading to initiation of the inflammatory response in obesity remain incompletely understood. However, one emerging hypothesis, as recently evaluated by Regazzetti et al. envisions hypoxia as a novel mechanism participating in insulin resistance in adipose tissue of obese patients. It has been suggested that hypertrophic adipocytes become hypoperfused, creating regional areas of microhypoxia leading to increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1. Activation of JNK1 and IKK/NFkB pathways along with increased expressions of genes involved in inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress appears to be enhanced in hypoxic adipose tissue. This may lead to the release of chemokines recruiting macrophages into the adipose tissue and end with the formation of crown-like structures and adipocyte death. Thus, microhypoxia is emerging as a mechanism suggested to exacerbate the proinflammatory nature of adipose tissue.

### Changes in insulin resistance following bariatric surgery: role of caloric restriction and weight loss [^113tuhb9]. Obesity Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity in the western world is steadily increasing. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment of T2DM in obese patients. The mechanism by which weight loss surgery improves glucose metabolism and insulin resistance remains controversial. In this review, we propose that two mechanisms participate in the improvement of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance observed following weight loss and bariatric surgery: caloric restriction and weight loss. Nutrients modulate insulin secretion through the entero-insular axis. Fat mass participates in glucose metabolism through the release of adipocytokines. T2DM improves after restrictive and bypass procedures, and combinations of restrictive and bypass procedures in morbidly obese patients. Restrictive procedures decrease caloric and nutrient intake, decreasing the stimulation of the entero-insular axis. Gastric bypass (GBP) operations may also affect the entero-insular axis by diverting nutrients away from the proximal GI tract and delivering incompletely digested nutrients to the distal GI tract. GBP and biliopancreatic diversion combine both restrictive and bypass mechanisms. All procedures lead to weight loss and decrease in the fat mass. Decrease in fat mass significantly affects circulating levels of adipocytokines, which favorably impact insulin resistance. The data reviewed here suggest that all forms of weight loss surgery lead to caloric restriction, weight loss, decrease in fat mass and improvement in T2DM. This suggests that improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance following bariatric surgery result in the short-term from decreased stimulation of the entero-insular axis by decreased caloric intake and in the long-term by decreased fat mass and resulting changes in release of adipocytokines. Observed changes in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance following bariatric surgery do not require the posit of novel regulatory mechanisms.

### Obesity, diabetes, and gut microbiota: the hygiene hypothesis expanded? [^117HuvfN]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Along with the increasing worldwide incidence of obesity-associated disorders, research has recently unraveled important pathways reciprocally connecting metabolism with the immune system. The development of obesity is a complex process involving genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, which both remain only partially understood. In such instances, gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as an important factor connecting genes, environment, and immune system. The human gut hosts an enormous number and variety of microorganisms, including at least 10¹⁴ bacteria belonging to ∼1,000 species. The genome size of this microbial organ, collectively named microbiome, exceeds the size of the human nuclear genome by two orders of magnitude and provides important biological and metabolic functions that cannot be performed by researchers. Genomic and environmental factors at the basis of mutual host-microbiota interactions have been intensely investigated with metagenomic and metabolomic approaches in the last 5 years. This article will discuss recent advances in understanding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes and their potential therapeutic applications.

### Insulin resistance in pediatric obesity: from mechanisms to treatment strategies [^115yH7U1]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Causes of Insulin Resistance in Individuals with Obesity

Currently, the mechanism underlying insulin resistance in obesity remains incompletely understood, and there is a lack of explicit literature identifying differences in the mechanisms of insulin resistance between adults and children. However, most individuals with insulin resistance are accompanied by obesity or overweight, a phenomenon that is gaining attention. The dysfunction of adipose tissue and abnormal adipose metabolism are the primary etiological factors in obesity-related metabolic disorders. As the largest endocrine organ, the involvement of white adipose tissue in the development of T2DM and insulin resistance has been recognized. Moreover, the imbalance of redox reaction and the occurrence of oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and genetic factors have been shown to be responsible for reduced insulin sensitivity.

4.1. Lipid Metabolism Disorders

As a consequence of obesity, the upregulation of hormone-sensitive lipase activity in adipose tissue resulted in an elevation of serum levels of FFA, diacylglycerol, and related metabolites. These metabolites were deposited into nonadipocytes, leading to a cascade of metabolic changes and abnormalities in cytokine expression and consequently inhibiting insulin signaling pathways and exacerbating insulin resistance.

### Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic relevance [^1158zX9f]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance is a reversible evolutionary preserved mechanism to ensure survival. Chronic insulin resistance along with a compensatory increase in insulin release is a hallmark of obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The presence of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has long been neglected and any insulin resistance in T1D has been mostly accounted for by glucose toxicity due to chronic hyperglycemia. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiology of insulin resistance in T1D may involve additional factors such as lipotoxicity, low-grade inflammation, peripheral hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglucagonemia. Although T1D has been characterized primarily by autoimmune destruction of β-cells, its pathophysiology seems to be more complex. Indeed, it has been even hypothesized that the generation of autoantibodies in T1D may be a secondary event triggered by environment- and lifestyle-related processes leading to islet destruction, and that distinct pathogenetic mechanisms are driving β-cell loss during disease progression. Insulin resistance could play a pathogenetic role in this process by forcing compensatory insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia and thus promote antigen presentation and faster loss of β-cell functionality. Accordingly, T1D onset in genetically susceptible individuals seems to occur more often under insulin-resistant conditions such as puberty and infections. Moreover, insulin resistance, a well-established factor for vascular complications in T2D, is also associated with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in T1D.

This review aims to integrate current evidence on the features and natural course, clinical significance, and therapeutic options of insulin resistance in T1D. We have focused mainly on studies investigating insulin resistance by the gold-standard technique, the glucose–insulin clamp, which allows comparison of individuals with T1D with glucose-tolerant humans at identical glycemia and insulinemia.

The relevant literature was retrieved by searching for the terms insulin resistance, autoimmunity, hepatic/muscle/adipose tissue/whole-body insulin resistance, glucagon, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), mitochondria/oxidative stress, metabolic memory/legacy effect, sleep, insulin treatment, metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, exercise, physical activity/inactivity, glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, MASLD/metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis, and obesity, all related to T1D from 1980 to June 2024 in PubMed. Further references were identified by analyzing the retrieved publications and by the authors' files.

### Metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity [^116VK3pG]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Obesity is becoming an epidemic in the United States and worldwide and increases risk for many diseases, particularly insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms linking obesity with these diseases remain incompletely understood. Over the past 2 to 3 decades, it has been recognized that in obesity, inflammation, with increased accumulation and inflammatory polarization of immune cells, takes place in various tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, gut, pancreatic islet, and brain and may contribute to obesity-linked metabolic dysfunctions, leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therapies targeting inflammation have shed light on certain obesity-linked diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but remain to be tested further and confirmed in clinical trials. This review focuses on inflammation in adipose tissue and its potential role in insulin resistance associated with obesity.

### The metabolic syndrome – from insulin resistance to obesity and diabetes [^113CtSWS]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

In today's society with the escalating levels of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome is receiving considerable attention and is the subject of much controversy. Greater insight into the mechanism(s) behind the syndrome may improve our understanding of how to prevent and best manage this complex condition.

### Molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance that impact cardiovascular biology [^113boLzG]. Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is concomitant with type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and other features of the metabolic syndrome. Because insulin resistance is associated with cardiovascular disease, both scientists and physicians have taken great interest in this disorder. Insulin resistance is associated with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, but individual contributions of either of these two conditions remain incompletely understood and a subject of intense investigation. One possibility is that in an attempt to overcome the inhibition within the metabolic insulin-signaling pathway, hyperinsulinemia may continue to stimulate the mitogenic insulin-signaling pathway, thus exerting its detrimental influence. Here we discuss some of the effects of insulin resistance and mechanisms of potentially detrimental influence of hyperinsulinemia in the presence of metabolic insulin resistance.

### Insulin resistance in pediatric obesity: from mechanisms to treatment strategies [^113QwK6t]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance, an increasingly prevalent characteristic among children and adolescents with obesity, is now recognized as a significant contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other metabolic diseases in individuals with obesity. Insulin resistance refers to a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissues (primarily skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver) to insulin, which is mainly characterized by impaired glucose uptake and utilization. Although the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance in children with obesity remain incompletely elucidated, several risk factors including lipid metabolism disorders, oxidative stress (OS), mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and genetic factors have been identified as pivotal contributors to the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance. In this review, we comprehensively analyze relevant literature and studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance in childhood obesity. Additionally, we discuss treatment strategies for pediatric obesity from a perspective centered on improving insulin sensitivity, aiming to provide valuable insights for the prevention and management of pediatric obesity.

### Obesity and type 2 diabetes: what can be unified and what needs to be individualized? [^112wG2Kh]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

This report examines what is known about the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes and how future research in these areas might be directed to benefit prevention, interventions, and overall patient care.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

An international working group of 32 experts in the pathophysiology, genetics, clinical trials, and clinical care of obesity and/or type 2 diabetes participated in a conference held on 6–7 January 2011 and cosponsored by The Endocrine Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. A writing group comprising eight participants subsequently prepared this summary and recommendations. Participants reviewed and discussed published literature and their own unpublished data.

RESULTS

The writing group unanimously supported the summary and recommendations as representing the working group's majority or unanimous opinions.

CONCLUSIONS

The major questions linking obesity to type 2 diabetes that need to be addressed by combined basic, clinical, and population-based scientific approaches include the following: 1) Why do not all patients with obesity develop type 2 diabetes? 2) Through what mechanisms do obesity and insulin resistance contribute to β-cell decompensation, and if/when obesity prevention ensues, how much reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence will follow? 3) How does the duration of type 2 diabetes relate to the benefits of weight reduction by lifestyle, weight-loss drugs, and/or bariatric surgery on β-cell function and glycemia? 4) What is necessary for regulatory approval of medications and possibly surgical approaches for preventing type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity? Improved understanding of how obesity relates to type 2 diabetes may help advance effective and cost-effective interventions for both conditions, including more tailored therapy. To expedite this process, we recommend further investigation into the pathogenesis of these coexistent conditions and innovative approaches to their pharmacological and surgical management.

### Relationships between circulating metabolic intermediates and insulin action in overweight to obese, inactive men and women [^113ijcr6]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

With people in developed countries becoming increasingly less active and more obese, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is growing at an alarming rate. Given the critical role of skeletal muscle in glucose disposal, much work has focused on understanding skeletal muscle insulin resistance. In addition, because progression to overt type 2 diabetes requires defective pancreatic β-cell secretion of insulin, efforts are also underway to dissect the mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell failure. Prevailing theories for insulin resistance focus on lipid-mediated mechanisms but also include insulin resistance mediated by elevated concentrations of amino acids and inflammatory signaling molecules as well as combinations of these. Similarly, β-cell dysfunction leading to type 2 diabetes has been linked to cellular stress responses triggered by overstimulation of insulin synthesis and secretion, as well as the effects of lipid mediators to cause changes in key metabolic activities of β-cells that impair control of insulin secretion.

Most of these hypotheses have revolved around elegant physiological investigations often performed in animal models. However, although these physiological investigations provide great insight into mechanisms, they do not conclusively illustrate that such mechanisms function at the population level in humans. Using a well-characterized sample from a clinical trial, our objective was to determine whether the measurement of metabolic intermediates with a targeted, mass spectrometry–based platform might provide insight into the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, a harbinger and essential component of type 2 diabetes. Our hypothesis was that in this group of men and women at risk for, but without, overt type 2 diabetes, lipid mediators would be related to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia would be related to β-cell dysfunction.

### Are obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes autoimmune diseases? [^113gnTyQ]. Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Obesity and associated insulin resistance predispose individuals to develop chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although these disorders affect a significant proportion of the global population, the underlying mechanisms of disease remain poorly understood. The discovery of elevated tumor necrosis factor-α in adipose tissue as an inducer of obesity-associated insulin resistance marked a new era of understanding that a subclinical inflammatory process underlies the insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction that precedes type 2 diabetes. Advances in the field identified components of both the innate and adaptive immune response as key players in regulating such inflammatory processes. As antigen specificity is a hallmark of an adaptive immune response, its role in modulating the chronic inflammation that accompanies obesity and type 2 diabetes begs the question of whether insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes can have autoimmune components. In this Perspective, we summarize current data that pertain to the activation and perpetuation of adaptive immune responses during obesity and discuss key missing links and potential mechanisms for obesity-related insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes to be considered as potential autoimmune diseases.

### Diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in COVID-19: molecular interrelationship and therapeutic implications [^115uoM6a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 manifestations and evolution has improved over the past 10 months, but the reasons why evolution is more severe in obese and diabetic patients are not yet completely understood.

Main Text

In the present review we discuss the different mechanisms that may contribute to explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 including viral entrance, direct viral toxicity, endothelial dysfunction, thromboinflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Conclusions

We show that the viral infection activates an integrated stress response, including activations of serine kinases such as PKR and PERK, which induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and insulin resistance. In parallel, we correlate and show the synergy of the insulin resistance of COVID-19 with this hormonal resistance of obesity and diabetes, which increase the severity of the disease. Finally, we discuss the potential beneficial effects of drugs used to treat insulin resistance and diabetes in patients with COVID-19.

### Free fatty acids-the link between obesity and insulin resistance [^116MccZv]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To present evidence that free fatty acids (FFA) are an important link between obesity and insulin resistance.

Methods

The role of FFA in peripheral insulin resistance, hepatic insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and type 2 diabetes is discussed.

Results

Obesity is invariably associated with insulin resistance. In most obese subjects, plasma FFA levels are increased. Physiologic increases in plasma FFA levels cause insulin resistance in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects by producing several metabolic defects: (1) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at the level of glucose transport or phosphorylation (or both); (2) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis; and (3) FFA inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. (This last-mentioned defect probably does not contribute to insulin resistance.) FFA probably also cause hepatic insulin resistance, which results in increased rates of endogenous glucose production in relationship to the prevailing degree of hyperinsulinemia. Lastly, FFA support between 30 and 50% of basal insulin secretion and potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in short-term and long-term settings. The stimulatory action of FFA on b-cells enables obese individuals who do not have a genetic predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus to compensate for their FFA-potentiated insulin resistance with an increase in FFA-mediated insulin secretion. In contrast, subjects who are genetically predisposed to develop type 2 diabetes may be unable to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin to compensate for their FFA-induced insulin resistance. This situation will lead to an increase in blood glucose concentration and eventually to type 2 diabetes.

Conclusion

FFA have been shown to have an important contributing role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in human obesity.

### Role of mitochondrial dysfunction in insulin resistance [^111V3rif]. Circulation Research (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is characteristic of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and components of the cardiometabolic syndrome, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, that collectively contribute to a substantial risk for cardiovascular disease. Metabolic actions of insulin in classic insulin target tissues (eg, skeletal muscle, fat, and liver), as well as actions in nonclassic targets (eg, cardiovascular tissue), help to explain why insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation are central in the pathogenesis of the cardiometabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Glucose and lipid metabolism are largely dependent on mitochondria to generate energy in cells. Thereby, when nutrient oxidation is inefficient, the ratio of ATP production/oxygen consumption is low, leading to an increased production of superoxide anions. Reactive oxygen species formation may have maladaptive consequences that increase the rate of mutagenesis and stimulate proinflammatory processes. In addition to reactive oxygen species formation, genetic factors, aging, and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis all contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. These factors also contribute to insulin resistance in classic and nonclassic insulin target tissues. Insulin resistance emanating from mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities and subsequent increases in cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, interventions that improve mitochondrial function also improve insulin resistance. Collectively, these observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may be a central cause of insulin resistance and associated complications. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction related to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in classic insulin-responsive tissue, as well as cardiovascular tissue.

### Viewpoints on the way to the consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The adipose tissue [^1114mW4T]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Adipokines

Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ in the body and generates multiple signals that regulate metabolism in other tissues. Leptin acts centrally to enhance the resting metabolic rate and decrease appetite, thus reducing tissue triglyceride accumulation. In lipodystrophic humans with severe insulin resistance, the administration of leptin restores insulin sensitivity and reduces organ steatosis and hyperglycemia. However, leptin deficiency and resistance are rare causes of disease in humans. Interestingly, leptin receptors have been identified in the vessel wall, and leptin infusion increases arterial blood pressure. Adiponectin is produced by adipose tissue in inverse amounts to the fat mass and is one relevant mediator of the action of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) agonists. Administration of adiponectin reverses the insulin resistance associated with obesity or lipodystrophy by reducing FA and triglyceride levels. Plasma adiponectin concentrations typically are reduced in obese normal glucose tolerant, insulin-resistant and lean, and obese type 2 diabetic subjects, and decreased plasma adiponectin levels are predictive of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. However, the observation that weight loss has a dramatic effect on insulin sensitivity without change in the plasma adiponectin concentration mitigates against a causal role of this hormone in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The role of resistin, which is elevated in animal models of obesity and diabetes, and of visfatin and omentin (which are produced by visceral fat) in the development of insulin resistance remains controversial.

Adipocytokines

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis, promotes VLDL production, interferes with insulin signaling and expression of adiponectin, and increases the expression of interleukins. In humans, tissue expression, rather than circulating levels of TNF-α, correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. Interleukin (IL)-6 also is associated with insulin resistance, increased fat mass, and elevated circulating FA levels, consistent with the lipolytic action of this cytokine. IL-6 interferes with the insulin signaling pathway in hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue and inhibits the production of adiponectin.

### Relationship of obesity to adipose tissue insulin resistance [^113991aD]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Some basic molecular studies supported by animal studies have well documented that hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes can induce inflammation as a major underlying cause of insulin resistance of adipose tissue. To our knowledge, there were only limited population-based studies that have assessed the relationship between obesity and adipose tissue insulin resistance. Several recent studies have examined the differences of Adipo-IRI across the spectrum from normal weight to obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI), which demonstrated that the Adipo-IRI in youngand adultobese subjects was about twofold higher than normal weight subjects. Obesity is a highly heterogeneous condition whereby fat is distributed in different regions of the body, which can be assessed by various anthropometric measurements or indicators. These anthropometric indicators include BMI, neck circumference (NC), waist circumference (WC) and waist/hip ratio (WHR), which have been used to measure total, upper or abdominal obesity, respectively. Several studies have indicated that abdominal (WC/WHR) and upper body (NC) obesity were either similar or stronger indicators of metabolic diseases than general obesity (ie, BMI). When the utilization of WC was not applicable in some clinical situations, such as pregnancy, ascites and abdominal tumors, the NC could be used as a more convenient clinical alternative. Therefore, more detailed information about the relationship of obesity to adipose tissue insulin resistance is needed, such as what anatomical forms of obesity are most closely related to adipose tissue insulin resistance? The predictive value and contribution of obesity to adipose tissue insulin resistance in the general population are also unclear. Elucidation of such important questions could be useful in understanding how obesity influences adipose tissue insulin resistance on a population level, which could therefore provide a direct basis for choosing the adipose tissue to target when treating metabolic disorder.

In this study, we have systemically examined the association of the distinct forms of anatomical obesity as defined by various anthropometric indicators with adipose tissue insulin resistance; and we also determined which anthropometric indicators have better predictive value for adipose tissue insulin resistance. Furthermore, we also assessed the contribution of obesity to adipose tissue insulin resistance.

Adipocytes and insulin resistance

A number of different views of the adipocyte and its relationship to insulin resistance were presented at the Congress. Sonia Caprio (New Haven, CT) reviewed the role of ectopic fat and the relationships between adipocyte size and adipogenic potential of subcutaneous tissue, inflammation, and insulin resistance in obese adolescents. There is a great deal of heterogeneity in insulin resistance among obese adolescents, with studies of insulin-resistant obese, insulin-sensitive obese, and lean adolescents showing muscle and visceral fat composition to predict the degree of insulin resistance. Fat storage may take place in subcutaneous, pericardial, perivascular, or visceral adipose tissue in or insulin-sensitive tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. Focusing on ectopic fat in liver and muscle to identify factors that cause some but not other obese children to develop abnormal glucose metabolism, Caprio asked whether the degree or the distribution of obesity is of greatest importance. Limited or inefficient fat storage in the subcutaneous depot might be related to liver, muscle, and visceral fat accumulation. In a study of 118 obese adolescents, stratified by visceral fat, there was an inverse relationship between visceral and subcutaneous fat, while visceral fat correlated with hepatic fat, with the degree of insulin resistance when fasting insulin–based measures were used, as well as with prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Liver fat was associated with the likelihoods of impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and type 2 diabetes. Subcutaneous fat biopsy was performed in 15 study participants with low visceral/high subcutaneous fat and in 18 with high visceral/low subcutaneous fat, revealing an expanded population of small adipose cells and impaired adipose cell differentiation in the latter group in association with increased visceral and hepatic fat and with insulin resistance; subcutaneous fat characteristics did not correlate with muscle fat. PPARγ2 expression appeared to reflect the abnormality of impaired adipocyte differentiation, and a trend to greater degrees of adipose tissue macrophage infiltration was seen in the biopsy specimens from children with insulin resistance.

### Mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [^112J6VKn]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In obese individuals, adipose tissue releases increased amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that are involved in the development of insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet beta-cells - the cells that release insulin - failure to control blood glucose levels results. Abnormalities in beta-cell function are therefore critical in defining the risk and development of type 2 diabetes. This knowledge is fostering exploration of the molecular and genetic basis of the disease and new approaches to its treatment and prevention.

### Where does insulin resistance start? The brain [^117V3g4L]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

According to these findings, impaired glucose metabolism and obesity may arise from disruptions of hypothalamic insulin signaling (Fig. 2). It is still not clear how the genetic background and the environment may affect these neuronal pathways. High-energy or fat-enriched diets may work, not only through an impaired ability of insulin to activate the peripheral PI 3-kinase pathway, but also by negatively modifying the intracellular insulin signaling in the hypothalamus. Recent studies have demonstrated that cerebral insulin resistance also may occur in humans. By means of a magneto-encephalographic approach during a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, an impaired cortical neuronal response to insulin was demonstrated in obese subjects and in individuals with the Gly972Arg polymorphism in IRS-1, a genetic condition associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the reduced neuronal response to insulin in the two pathological conditions (obesity versus genetic predisposition to develop type 2 diabetes) showed a different magneto-encephalographic pattern, suggesting that 1) different mechanisms can lead to cerebral insulin resistance and 2) central insulin resistance may not only be a consequence of, but also a starting point for, the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Figure 2
The consequences of central insulin resistance are depicted. An impairment of insulin signaling in the CNS may lead to hyperphagia, weight gain, and consequently to hyperinsulinemia (upper part), but also to a dysregulation of plasma glucose levels for the potentiation of gluconeogenesis.

In summary, the brain is an insulin-sensitive tissue and, in association with other nutrient and adiposity signals, such as fatty acids, amino acids, and leptin, may play an important role in the regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. Hence, an impairment of the fuel-sensing mechanisms in the CNS may lead to both weight gain and dysregulation of plasma glucose levels. Diet, rather than obesity per se, seems to play a greater role in inducing a state of central insulin resistance. However, the ensuing obesity may further reduce the neuronal sensitivity to peripheral signals, such as insulin and leptin. These pathological processes, in turn, exacerbate obesity and the hyperinsulinemic state, leading to overt hyperglycemia, and thus generate a vicious cycle that, in combination with β-cell dysfunction, progresses to diabetes. The future will divulge whether restoration of central neuronal signaling will be beneficial for both obesity and diabetes.

### Obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance [^111C6Me4]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Weight gain and obesity are major risk factors for conditions and diseases ranging from insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus to atherosclerosis and the sequelae of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A chronic, subacute state of inflammation often accompanies the accumulation of excess lipid in adipose tissue and liver (hepatic steatosis), evidenced by changes in both inflammatory cells and biochemical markers of inflammation. These changes can be seen in the involved tissues and systemically, in terms of elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers. The link between obesity and inflammation has therefore raised the important question of whether obesity-induced inflammation plays a pathogenic role in the development and progression of these disorders. We review the rapidly expanding body of animal and clinical data that support potential roles for inflammation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Leptin as a predictive marker for metabolic syndrome [^111BChmq]. Cytokine (2019). Medium credibility.

Metabolic syndrome poses a major threat on human health affecting the quality of life. Adipose tissue is an important organ which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Adipocytokines secreted by the adipose tissue plays a critical role in storage, food intake, energy expenditure, lipid and glucose metabolism. Leptin is primarily involved in regulating food intake, body weight and energy homeostasis through neuroendocrine functions. Contemporary research suggests that leptin also influences insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. High leptin concentrations are directly associated with the obesity subsequent development of metabolic disease sequelae such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Elucidation of the mechanism of action of leptin would help to develop novel therapeutic approaches for there metabolic disorders like obesity and diabetes. This review provides an updated 'state-of-the-art' about the leptin and its role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome at the molecular level.

### Role of branched-chain amino acid metabolism in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes-related metabolic disturbances BCAA metabolism in type 2 diabetes [^114JCUvW]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of world's most prevalent diseases, and is related to the epidemic of obesity. Obesity can lead to the onset of T2D when pancreatic β-cells are no longer able to compensate higher insulin secretion for the reduced insulin sensitivity that often accompanies obesity. Over the last decade, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolism has increasingly been considered to have an emerging role in the development of insulin resistance in people with obesity and T2D. In these individuals, BCAA levels are considerably elevated in plasma and tissues. Furthermore, elevated BCAA levels in plasma strongly associate with insulin resistance in people with obesity and T2D. Although it is still unknown why these BCAA levels are elevated and why they associate with insulin resistance, a dysfunctional BCAA catabolism may be one of the underlying factors. This review aims to provide insight into the mechanisms behind elevated plasma BCAA levels in people with obesity and/or T2D and its role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Furthermore, this review will overview pharmaceutical and alternative lifestyle intervention strategies in order to lower plasma BCAA levels and its effects on metabolic health.

### Obesity and free fatty acids [^113Ww8XR]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels are elevated in obesity. FFAs cause insulin resistance in all major insulin target organs (skeletal muscle, liver, endothelial cells) and have emerged as a major link between obesity, the development of the metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerotic vascular disease. FFAs also produce low-grade inflammation in skeletal muscle, liver, and fat, which may contribute to cardiovascular events. The challenges for the future include the prevention or correction of obesity and elevated plasma FFA levels through methods that include decreased caloric intake and increased caloric expenditure, the development of methods to measure FFAs in small blood samples, and the development of efficient pharmacologic approaches to normalize increased plasma FFA levels.

### Adipose inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease [^115GS1pX]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Adiposity-associated inflammation and insulin resistance are strongly implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This article reviews the mechanisms of adipose inflammation, because these may represent therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and for prevention of metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity. The initial insult in adipose inflammation and insulin resistance, mediated by macrophage recruitment and endogenous ligand activation of Toll-like receptors, is perpetuated through chemokine secretion, adipose retention of macrophages, and elaboration of pro-inflammatory adipocytokines. Activation of various kinases modulates adipocyte transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and NFkappaB, attenuating insulin signaling and increasing adipocytokine and free fatty acid secretion. Inflammation retards adipocyte differentiation and further exacerbates adipose dysfunction and inflammation. Paracrine and endocrine adipose inflammatory events induce a local and systemic inflammatory, insulin-resistant state promoting meta-bolic dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Developing therapeutic strategies that target both adipose inflammation and insulin resistance may help to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the emerging epidemic of obesity.

Role of Obesity in the Pathogenesis of T2DM

A number of mechanisms have been postulated to connect obesity to insulin resistance and the subsequent risk of T2DM. One key factor is the increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, from adipose tissue. These adipokines can interfere with insulin signaling pathways, leading to insulin resistance. The compensatory hyperinsulinemia further promotes the deposition of "ectopic fat" in liver. The excess accumulation of fat in liver leads to increased fat distribution to various tissues, including the pancreas, which can contribute to a gradual decline in insulin production over time. This intricate interplay of elevated insulin levels and ectopic fat accumulation forms a cycle that results in hyperglycemia and contributes to the pathogenesis of T2DM. Another defect that links obesity to T2DM could be mitochondrial dysfunction, which exerts effects by decreasing insulin sensitivity and compromising beta cell function. Weight loss, on the contrary, may cause a rapid loss of ectopic fat from liver, pancreas and other peripheral tissues and lead to significant improvements in insulin resistance. Decreased body weight also restores pancreatic first-phase insulin secretion, a key factor in pathogenesis of T2DM.

### Weight loss and exercise: implications for muscle lipid metabolism and insulin action [^114yfFqg]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2004). Low credibility.

Implications for Muscle Lipid Metabolism and An accumulation of intramuscular lipid has been reported with obesity and linked with insulin resistance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss: 1) mechanisms that may be responsible for intramuscular lipid accumulation with obesity, and 2) the effects of common interventions (weight loss or exercise) for obesity on skeletal muscle lipid metabolism and intramuscular lipid content. Data suggest that the skeletal muscle of morbidly obese humans is characterized by the preferential partitioning of lipid toward storage rather than oxidation. This phenotype may, in part, contribute to increased lipid deposition in both muscle and adipose tissue, and promote the development of morbid obesity and insulin resistance. Weight loss intervention decreases intramuscular lipid content, which may contribute to improved insulin action. On the other hand, exercise training improves insulin action and increases fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle of obese/morbidly obese individuals. In summary, the accumulation of intramuscular lipid appears to be detrimental in terms of inducing insulin resistance; however, the accumulation of lipid can be reversed with weight loss. The mechanism(s) by which exercise enhances insulin action remains to be determined.

### Association between insulin resistance and the development of cardiovascular disease [^114cp9Kb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The pathological processes and risk factors associated with CVD begin as early as during childhood. Notably, obesity associated with an abnormal lipid profile at younger age has been strongly correlated with insulin resistance. As highlighted in the literature, multiple factors such as obesity, abnormal lipid profiles and insulin resistance play key roles in the origin of CVD.

Under physiological conditions, insulin stimulates the use of metabolic substrates in multiple tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. In the cardiomyocytes, insulin promotes glucose and fatty acid uptake, but inhibits the use of fatty acids as an energy source. As a result of insulin resistance, the pancreas attempts to compensate by secreting increasing amounts of insulin, resulting in hyperinsulinemia.

During insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia, normal glucose tolerance is maintained due a series of physiological changes activated by these phenomenon. Interestingly, a strong correlation between insulin resistance and risk to develop CVD has been established. Several molecular mechanisms contribute to the association between insulin resistance and CVD. These mechanisms include the role of insulin resistance in atherosclerosis development, vascular function, hypertension and macrophage accumulation.

This review will be focused on the interactions among insulin resistance, and vascular disease, and the molecular mechanism involved. Specifically, the focus will be on the major changes in glucose and lipid metabolism induced by insulin and their impact on the CVD development.

### Type 2 diabetes remission and lifestyle medicine: a position statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^1116qMsx]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Mechanisms of T2D and remission — excess caloric intake drives rapid insulin resistance and ectopic fat–mediated dysfunction, with the underlying causes of T2D identified as excess weight and insulin resistance; these often result from excessive caloric intake causing rapid insulin resistance in as little as 1 to 2 days before weight gain. As caloric intake exceeds energy needs and overwhelms adipose storage, energy is stored in non-adipose tissues (liver, pancreas, muscle), leading to lipotoxicity that impairs glucose uptake via the GLUT-4 transporter, reduces beta-cell insulin production, and produces peripheral insulin resistance that is reduced with exercise. Caloric restriction removes triacylglycerols from the pancreas and liver in days, restoring beta-cell insulin production before significant weight loss, indicating excess calories rather than excess weight drive insulin resistance and T2D. Secretagogues and exogenous insulin increase insulin to "push" glucose into cells, sustaining the toxic metabolic state, whereas metformin reduces peripheral insulin resistance but does not remove the underlying toxic etiology of excess caloric intake.

PLAUSIBILITY: ADIPOSE TISSUE CAN CAUSE INSULIN RESISTANCE

Adipose tissue releases a variety of factors known to modulate insulin sensitivity, and their effects are summarized in Fig. 1.

Figure 1
Adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ in the body. The diagram summarizes the main roles and effects of representative fat-derived products that have been related to insulin resistance and metabolic risk. BP, blood pressure; HR, heart rate.

Fatty acids

The concept that fatty acids (FAs) provoke cardiac, skeletal muscle, and hepatic insulin resistance and impair β-cell function has been extensively confirmed in humans, and mechanisms are reviewed in detail elsewhere. A sustained pharmacologic inhibition of lipolysis, with reduction in the plasma FA concentration, reverses these defects. Elevated FA levels also promote the synthesis and release of VLDL by the liver by 1) increasing substrate availability, 2) inhibiting insulin-mediated apoB degradation, and 3) reducing hepatic insulin clearance, contributing to hyperinsulinemia. In the brain, excessive FA uptake and its response to weight loss have been documented in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, and FAs are implicated in the central regulation of glucose production.

FA overflow from adipocytes to skeletal muscle and other tissues may result in free radical formation during oxidative phosphorylation, the intramyocellular accumulation of triglyceride, and the production of toxic lipid metabolites (fatty-acyl CoAs, diacylglycerol, and ceramides) and metabolic intermediates, which reflect oxidative damage, both of which can interfere with the insulin signaling cascade. Consistent with this hypothesis, lipid oxidation is increased systemically and regionally, i.e. in the myocardium and skeletal muscle, and in the liver in states of insulin resistance and/or in steatosis, and recent evidence supports a role of β-cell oxidative stress in mediating FA-induced β-cell dysfunction. Local production of reactive oxygen species within adipose tissue likely initiates lipotoxicity and insulin resistance at the immediate site of FA release. Oxidative damage is amplified by peroxidation of lipid stores and could, in turn, impair mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity and produce inflammation in different target organs.

### Adapting to obesity with adipose tissue inflammation [^114Ganzb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Adipose tissue not only has an important role in the storage of excess nutrients but also senses nutrient status and regulates energy mobilization. An overall positive energy balance is associated with overnutrition and leads to excessive accumulation of fat in adipocytes. These cells respond by initiating an inflammatory response that, although maladaptive in the long run, might initially be a physiological response to the stresses obesity places on adipose tissue. In this Review, we characterize adipose tissue inflammation and review the current knowledge of what triggers obesity-associated inflammation in adipose tissue. We examine the connection between adipose tissue inflammation and the development of insulin resistance and catecholamine resistance and discuss the ensuing state of metabolic inflexibility. Finally, we review the current and potential new anti-inflammatory treatments for obesity-associated metabolic disease.

The gut microbiota has emerged as an integral factor that impacts host metabolism and has been suggested to play a vital role in metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In humans, cross-sectional studies have identified microbiota profiles associated with metabolic diseases, whereas causation mainly has been demonstrated in animal models. Recent studies involving microbiota-based interventions in humans, or transfer of disease-associated microbiota into germ-free mice, underscore that an altered microbiota may directly modulate host metabolism in humans. However, it will be essential to determine whether an altered gut microbiota precedes development of insulin resistance and diabetes and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Increased mechanistic insights of how the microbiota modulates metabolic disease in humans may pave the way for identification of innovative microbiota-based diagnostics and/or therapeutics.

### Link between insulin resistance and hypertension: what is the evidence from evolutionary biology? [^113XWJKU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diminished tissue sensitivity to insulin is a characteristic of various pathological conditions termed the insulin resistance syndrome, also known as the metabolic syndrome or cardiometabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is not a single disease, but rather a complex cluster of symptoms that include a large waist circumference, hypertension, hyperglycermia, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, all of which are commonly associated with increased risk of obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. Since patients with metabolic syndrome are commonly afflicted with cardiovascular morbidities, the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases share common pathways including increased oxidative stress, defective glucose, lipid metabolism, low grade inflammation, hypercoagulability and endothelial damage. Previously, investigators proposed to use the "circulatory syndrome" to refine the metabolic syndrome concept through the addition of markers of cardiovascular diseases such as renal impairment, microalbuminuria, arterial stiffness and left ventricular dysfunction. It has become increasingly obvious that insulin resistance and the efforts made by the insulin-targeted organs to compensate for this defect play a vital role in the pathogenesis and clinical course of the metabolic syndrome.

Insulin resistance and hypertension are the components of metabolic syndrome and often coexist. Clinical studies have shown that about 50% of hypertensive individuals have hyperinsulinemia or glucose intolerance, whereas up to 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes have hypertension. In addition to its metabolic effects, insulin induces vasorelaxation by stimulating the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelium and regulates sodium homeostasis by enhancing sodium reabsorption in the kidney; thereby, contributing to the regulation of blood pressure. Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin resistance can develop not only in the classic insulin-responsive tissues, but also in cardiovascular tissues where insulin participates in the development of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Insulin resistance has gained a bad name and is perceived as deleterious: commonly associated with the metabolic syndrome and hypertension that confer an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, in human evolutionary history, insulin resistance may be an essential part of normal homeostasis to facilitate redirection of nutrients to pivotal organs and a physiological adaptive mechanism to promote our ancestor's survival in times of critical conditions; such as, famine, infection, trauma and stress. The same mechanism may be inappropriately activated on a chronic basis on the current obesogenic environment, leading to the manifestation of hypertension, insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. This article reviews human evolution and the impact of modern environment on hypertension and insulin resistance.

### Insulin resistance in pediatric obesity: from mechanisms to treatment strategies [^114dpRxZ]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

3. Insulin Resistance and T2DM

Insulin is the only hypoglycemic hormone involved in regulating glucose and fat metabolism in the body. Insulin resistance arises when peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue exhibit decreased sensitivity to insulin, resulting in impaired uptake and utilization of glucose. More than 90% of primary insulin resistance is attributed to multiple genetic mutations such as those affecting the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), glucokinase, and insulin receptor substrate gene. Conversely, secondary insulin resistance is predominantly influenced by environmental factors, with obesity being recognized as one of the most significant. The estimated likelihood of children with obesity developing insulin resistance is 38.7%, and the accumulation of visceral fat in their bodies independently contributes to insulin sensitivity. Excessive adiposity significantly and persistently affects insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver among children with obesity, and insulin resistance may arise in some of these tissues prior to the onset of T2DM in individuals with obesity.

### Obesity and insulin resistance: an ongoing saga [^113jgh9V]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Another approach to understanding the link between obesity and insulin resistance (IR) has focused on differences in regional fat distribution. In particular, it has been argued that abdominal obesity, specifically an increase in visceral fat volume, is the fundamental culprit responsible for IR and associated abnormalities. Mechanistically, it has been proposed that enlarged visceral fat cells secrete a number of inflammatory cytokines that lead to IR. In this manner, fat cell enlargement and the fat cell as a source of circulating inflammatory markers have merged to create one theory accounting for the link between obesity and IR.

The fact that IR and its associated abnormalities are increased in obese individuals does not necessarily mean that all obese individuals are insulin resistant. McLaughlin et al. have published studies using techniques very similar to those of Kursawe et al. attempting to identify why equally obese adults can differ approximately threefold in terms of IMGU. They found a bimodal distribution of fat cell size in isolated subcutaneous fat with a higher proportion of small cells to large cells in insulin resistant — as compared with insulin sensitive — individuals. Parenthetically, McLaughlin et al. did not find a difference in the diameter of large cells between these two groups. These findings, along with a lower gene–expression profile for adipose cell differentiation, led these authors to suggest that insulin resistant, obese individuals were less able to store excess fat in newly differentiated subcutaneous fat cells, leading to its deposition as ectopic fat in other organs and contributing to IR.

Kursawe et al. expand on this hypothesis and propose a comprehensive mechanism for obesity-associated IR. They suggest that impaired adipose differentiation and lipogenesis decrease fat storage capacity in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, necessitating displacement of fat to organs such as the liver and muscle. This ectopic fat deposition then leads to organ dysfunction and IR. To evaluate this hypothesis, they divided obese adolescents into two groups based on their relative proportion of visceral to subcutaneous fat and found that those with higher visceral fat were more insulin resistant, had a higher fraction of small to large cells, and lower gene-expression markers for adipogenesis and lipogenesis. They also found that the diameters of the large fat cells were greater in those with higher visceral fat, similar to reports of older studies. The authors interpreted these findings to represent a reduced capacity for fat storage in the small cells and resultant hypertrophy of the large cells.

### Biomarkers of obesity-mediated insulin resistance: focus on microRNAs [^112W7Uz8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

From another perspective, we noted a high degree of variability among individuals with obesity. The individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome have been referred to as metabolically abnormal obese (MAO) and those who do not develop metabolic syndrome are referred to as metabolically healthy obese (MHO). The cause for this distinction may be explained by epigenetics. Epigenetics refers to changes in phenotype that are not rooted in DNA sequence. The epigenome includes DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs (including a variety of RNAs with known functions such as long-stranded non-coding RNAs and miRNAs, as well as RNAs with unknown functions). They play a role in regulating cell differentiation and promoting cell-specific gene expression. The metabolic state and nutritional requirements of the body may be influenced by epigenetic processes, such as chromatin arrangement, which can stimulate structural adaptations that control gene expression. Therefore, epigenetic modifications are key mechanisms linking obesity and metabolic diseases. The development of disease-associated gene- and genome-based new tools is essential for the early identification of the characteristics of individuals with obesity, which will help to screen individuals with a high prevalence of metabolic diseases at an early stage and enable targeted treatment for this population.

### Selective insulin and leptin resistance in metabolic disorders [^111FeqeE]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity represents a major risk factor for the development of insulin and leptin resistance, ultimately leading to a pleiotropic spectrum of metabolic alterations. However, resistance to both hormones does not uniformly affect all target cells and intracellular signaling pathways. In contrast, numerous clinical phenotypes arise from selective hormone resistance, leading to inhibition of defined intracellular signaling pathways in some tissues, while in other cell types hormone action is maintained or even overactivated. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms and clinical outcomes resulting from selective insulin and leptin resistance, which should ultimately guide future strategies for the treatment of obesity-associated diseases.

### Insulin resistance in the defense against obesity [^1141V7yt]. Cell Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In the face of the current obesity epidemic, the nature of the relationship between overnutrition and type 2 diabetes is of great importance. Obesity can be considered a state of excessive insulin action that elicits a series of cellular homeostatic responses, producing systemic insulin resistance. These responses occur in four steps: homologous desensitization to insulin action, leptin secretion, inflammation, and, finally, a counter-inflammatory phase that serves to conserve energy storage. The molecular mechanisms underlying these steps are discussed in the context of potential new therapeutic approaches.

### Hypoxia decreases insulin signaling pathways in adipocytes [^111CSUoY]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

The role of hypoxia in insulin resistance could be envisioned as a multistep process. In a first and early series of events, hypoxia induces local insulin resistance inside the adipose tissue by inhibiting the insulin signaling pathway. In a second and longer process, hypoxia attracts macrophages within the adipose tissue, leading to dysregulation of adipokine expression, which will be involved in the development of local, but also systemic, insulin resistance. Third, by creating a niche, hypoxia could increase mesenchymal stem cells' self-renewal while inhibiting adipocyte differentiation in restricted parts of the tissue. Then, through angiogenesis, hypoxia could create new vessels that would lead to reoxygenation of these niches, leading to the development of new adipocytes. As obesity progresses, this mechanism could create a vicious circle aggravating the syndrome.

In conclusion, we show here that hypoxia inhibits insulin signaling in adipocytes through HIF proteins. This mechanism could be involved in the establishment of an insulin-resistant state during obesity.

### Obesity and the human microbiome [^114smBRJ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Obesity was once rare, but the last few decades have seen a rapid expansion of the proportion of obese individuals worldwide. Recent work has shown obesity to be associated with a shift in the representation of the dominant phyla of bacteria in the gut, both in humans and animal models. This review summarizes the latest research into the association between microbial ecology and host adiposity, and the mechanisms by which microbes in the gut may mediate host metabolism in the context of obesity.

Recent Findings

Studies of the effect of excess body fat on the abundances of different bacteria taxa in the gut generally show alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota, and changes during weight loss. The gastrointestinal microbiota have been shown to impact insulin resistance, inflammation, and adiposity via interactions with epithelial and endocrine cells.

Summary

Large-scale alterations of the gut microbiota and its microbiome (gene content) are associated with obesity and are responsive to weight loss. Gut microbes can impact host metabolism via signaling pathways in the gut, with effects on inflammation, insulin resistance, and deposition of energy in fat stores. Restoration of the gut microbiota to a healthy state may ameliorate the conditions associated with obesity and help maintain a healthy weight.

### Obesity and insulin resistance: an ongoing saga [^11125CER]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Although the adverse effects of excess adiposity on insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) are well-recognized, the mechanism and/or mechanisms that explain this relationship continue to be debated. The article by Kursawe et al. in this issue of Diabetes provides another, and potentially important, mechanism linking excess adiposity and IMGU. However, to put their findings into perspective, it might be helpful to provide a brief history of other approaches to this issue.

The experimental methods utilized in earlier mechanistic studies are reminiscent of the study by Kursawe et al. and led to the view that metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity were related to changes in fat cell size rather than number. For example, ex vivo studies on adipose tissue isolated from obese humans demonstrated that the larger the fat cell, the more diminished the response to insulin. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity of isolated fat improved following weight loss-associated decreases in fat cell size. Although these data indicated that differences in fat cell size affected insulin action, the fat cell is not a major consumer of glucose. Thus, these data do not necessarily explain why large fat cells would have an adverse effect on whole-body IMGU. Furthermore, why some individuals had large fat cells and others did not remained unanswered.

### Adolescent obesity and insulin resistance: roles of ectopic fat accumulation and adipose inflammation [^111id197]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

As a consequence of the global rise in the prevalence of adolescent obesity, an unprecedented phenomenon of type 2 diabetes has emerged in pediatrics. At the heart of the development of type 2 diabetes lies a key metabolic derangement: insulin resistance (IR). Despite the widespread occurrence of IR affecting an unmeasurable number of youths worldwide, its pathogenesis remains elusive. IR in obese youth is a complex phenomenon that defies explanation by a single pathway. In this review we first describe recent data on the prevalence, severity, and racial/ethnic differences in pediatric obesity. We follow by elucidating the initiating events associated with the onset of IR, and describe a distinct "endophenotype" in obese adolescents characterized by a thin superficial layer of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, increased visceral adipose tissue, marked IR, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Further, we provide evidence for the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with this peculiar endophenotype and its relations to IR in the obese adolescent.

### Fatty acids, obesity, and insulin resistance: time for a reevaluation [^112nF1CC]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance associated with longer-term lipid overload is now considered to involve accumulation of lipids in insulin-responsive tissues other than adipose tissue, so-called ectopic fat deposition. Fatty acid uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues is also likely to be modulated by altered function/expression of transporter proteins. The detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity and other cellular processes are known as lipotoxicity. In skeletal muscle, an increase in intramyocellular lipid (cellular TG), associated with insulin resistance, is seen during Intralipid/heparin infusion and clearly represents increased supply. Although it is as yet unresolved as to whether regulatory defects in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, with the apparently concomitant intramyocellular TG accumulation, are primary or secondary to insulin resistance, the phenomena appear to be strongly linked. Importantly, whatever the mechanism of the TG accumulation, there is evidence that interactions with insulin action are caused by a corresponding increase in active lipid moieties such as diacylglycerol, ceramide, or fatty acyl-CoAs rather than the inert TG pool. In a simple model, lipotoxicity reflects increased adipose tissue NEFA release. However, it is now recognized that fat accumulation in nonadipose tissues may reflect impaired disposal of fat as much as increased uptake. However, in real-life pathophysiology, the same accumulation of intramyocellular lipid may well arise more through impaired oxidative capacity. Accordingly, lipotoxicity does not necessarily imply increased NEFA delivery.

### Is insulin resistance caused by defects in insulin's target cells or by a stressed mind? [^115e61s6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

The importance of understanding insulin action is emphasized by the increasing prevalence of insulin resistance in various populations and by the fact that it plays an important pathophysiological role in many common disorders, for example, diabetes, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The primary factors responsible for the development of insulin resistance are so far unknown, although both genetic and environmental factors are involved. The genetic defects responsible for the common forms of insulin resistance, for example, in type 2 diabetes, are largely unidentified. Some studies from our group as well as by other investigators suggest that cellular insulin resistance is reversible and that it may be secondary to factors in the in vivo environment. These may include insulin-antagonistic action of hormones like catecholamines, glucocorticoids, sex steroids and adipokines as well as dysregulation of autonomic nervous activity and they could contribute to the early development of insulin resistance. Some of these factors can directly impair glucose uptake capacity and this might be due to alterations in key proteins involved in insulin's intracellular signaling pathways. This article briefly summarizes proposed mechanisms behind cellular and whole-body insulin resistance. In particular, we question the role of intrinsic defects in insulin's target cells as primary mechanisms in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and we suggest that metabolic and neurohormonal factors instead are the main culprits.

### Inverse regulation of inflammation and mitochondrial function in adipose tissue defines extreme insulin sensitivity in morbidly obese patients [^1133om1b]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The number of obese individuals worldwide has reached two billion, leading to an explosion of obesity-related health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The increase in the prevalence of obesity is strongly correlated with an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus, reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. A key etiological factor linking obesity to type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance, characterized by decreased response in the cellular actions of insulin, leading to an impaired ability of insulin to inhibit glucose output from the liver and to promote glucose uptake in fat and muscle. The physiological mechanisms connecting obesity to insulin resistance have received intense investigation in recent years and several hypotheses have emerged, such as ectopic lipid accumulation in liver and muscle secondary to obesity-associated increase in serum free fatty acids, altered production of various adipocyte-derived factors (collectively known as adipokines), and low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue resulting from chronic activation of the innate immune system.

### Visceral adiposity syndrome [^113KVWXp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance and tissue inflammation

Insulin resistance is defined as the reduction of the metabolic (but not mitogenic) effects of insulin following its binding to the insulin receptor. Insulin resistance involves impaired activation of insulin substrate 1 (IRS1) and, subsequently, of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in insulin-sensitive tissues. Visceral adiposity is strongly associated with insulin resistance, but genetic and other factors also predispose to the development of this condition, since there are obese patients without insulin resistance as well as lean individuals who are resistant. An interesting point to consider is that individuals who have subnormal amounts of adipose tissue, such as the ones presenting monogenic lipodystrophy, also develop severe IR. This fact corroborates the hypothesis that adipose tissue failure (loss of capacity of expanding to store excess calories) is more important in the pathogenesis of VAS than the degree of obesity.

Several complex and interwoven mechanisms underlie IR in the presence of visceral adiposity, and some of them will be shortly addressed. The first question to be answered is why visceral fat? It is well established that visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissues (WAT) are different concerning adipocyte size and metabolic activity. This includes the ability to respond to the antilipolytic effects of insulin and to the lipolytic effects of catecholamines, which are, respectively, lower and higher in visceral than in subcutaneous tissue, featuring visceral WAT as more pathogenic.

Chronic over-consumption of nutrients concomitantly with insufficient energy expenditure exceed the storage capacity of glycogen and triglycerides by the "professional" metabolic tissues, namely, liver, muscle and WAT. In such situation, other tissues are exposed to supraphysiological concentrations of these nutrients, where they exert deleterious effects.

### Combined influence of insulin resistance, overweight / obesity, and fatty liver as risk factors for type 2 diabetes [^113f9uqy]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

People who develop type 2 diabetes represent a heterogeneous group of individuals, some of whom have normal insulin sensitivity, normal weight, and β-cell failure; others have insulin resistance (IR) and inadequate compensatory hyperinsulinemia; and others have a combination of defects in both insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. The prevalence of diabetes is predicted to double between the years 2000 and 2030 and, although an ageing population and increasing urbanization in developing countries will contribute to this marked increase in prevalence, the predicted prevalence is likely to be underestimated because of the increasing global burden of obesity. Several potential mechanisms may explain why obesity is a strong risk factor for diabetes. These mechanisms include increased production of nonesterfied fatty acids; adipokines/cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, resistin, and retinol-binding protein 4; as well as reduced levels of adiponectin and mitochondrial dysfunction that compromise β-cell function. Although obesity has undoubtedly contributed to the burden of diabetes and strategies to decrease body fat are effective in decreasing risk of diabetes, there are several unanswered questions regarding the mechanism(s) of the link between obesity and diabetes.

### Short-and long-term glucocorticoid treatment enhances insulin signalling in human subcutaneous adipose tissue [^1147pkYq]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The global epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes have heightened the need to understand the molecular mechanisms that contribute to their pathogenesis. Patients with Cushing's syndrome develop central obesity, insulin resistance and in some cases type 2 diabetes; this has focused attention on the potential pathogenic role of the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal axis, and endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) production and metabolism in simple obesity. Furthermore, the widespread therapeutic use of GCsmeans that understanding the mechanisms that lead to their adverse event profile has a huge clinical relevance.

GCs cause global insulin resistance. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that GCs may have tissue-specific effects on insulin action. We have shown that short-term (24 h) treatment with the synthetic GCs, dexamethasone (Dex) and cortisol, causes insulin sensitization in human adipose tissue, in cells cultured in the absence of insulin. Additionally, we have shown that this is functionally important and augments insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This contrasts with the induction of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Although these observations have contradicted the widely held dogma that GCs cause global 'pan-tissue' insulin resistance, it remains plausible that prolonged administration of GCs may have differing effects on insulin signalling. In addition, GC excess leads to hyperinsulinemia, which may further fuel insulin resistance, and high concentrations of insulin may modify the effect of GCs in adipose tissue. We have therefore determined the impact of short- and long-term GC treatment on insulin signalling in adipose tissue at differing insulin concentrations.

Challenges in treating obesity and its complications

Obesity prevalence has increased worldwide and reached epidemic proportions over the past few decades. Due to the complexity of the pathophysiological aspects of the disease, obesity cannot only be considered an energy imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure. In addition to the dangers caused by obesity itself, it induces many complications, such as insulin resistance (IR), chronic inflammation, and atherosclerosis, which increase the risk of several diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular disease. Approximately 4 million people die each year from obesity-related complications (Fig. 1). Although clinicians have attempted to prevent obesity progression, its management remains challenging.

Fig. 1
Complications caused by obesity. Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypogonadism, chronic inflammation, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoporosis, etc. There is an interrelationship between these complications. Obesity leads to chronic inflammation and disorders of lipid metabolism, where chronic inflammation is an intermediate factor leading to insulin resistance. Lipid metabolism disorder is an intermediate factor leading to atherosclerosis, while chronic inflammation will further lead to the development of atherosclerosis to coronary heart disease. In addition to this, chronic inflammation interacts with lipid metabolism disorders and both together lead to osteoporosis, hypogonadism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

### Metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and roles of inflammation – mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^1132XzzL]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, are associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that can be detected both systemically and within specific tissues. Areas of active investigation focus on the molecular bases of metabolic inflammation and potential pathogenic roles in insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. An increased accumulation of macrophages occurring in obese adipose tissue has emerged as a key process in metabolic inflammation. Recent studies have also begun to unravel the heterogeneity of adipose tissue macrophages, and their physical and functional interactions with adipocytes, endothelial cells, and other immune cells within the adipose tissue microenvironment. Translating the information gathered from experimental models of insulin resistance and diabetes into meaningful therapeutic interventions is a tantalizing goal with long-term global health implications. In this context, ongoing clinical studies are testing the effects of targeting inflammation systemically on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Mechanisms of macrophage activation in obesity-induced insulin resistance [^111VQCkr]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Chronic inflammation is now recognized as a key step in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This low-grade inflammation is mediated by the inflammatory (classical) activation of recruited and resident macrophages that populate metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue and liver. These findings have led to the concept that infiltration by and activation of macrophages in adipose tissue are causally linked to obesity-induced insulin resistance. Studies have shown, however, that alternatively activated macrophages taking residence in adipose tissue and liver perform beneficial functions in obesity-induced metabolic disease. Alternatively activated macrophages reduce insulin resistance in obese mice by attenuating tissue inflammation and increasing oxidative metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle. The discovery that distinct subsets of macrophages are involved in the promotion or attenuation of insulin resistance suggests that pathways controlling macrophage activation can potentially be targeted to treat these comorbidities of obesity. Thus, this Review focuses on the stimuli and mechanisms that control classical and alternative activation of tissue macrophages, and how these macrophage activation programs modulate insulin action in peripheral tissues. The functional importance of macrophage activation is further discussed in the context of host defense to highlight the crosstalk between innate immunity and metabolism.

### TLR4 at the crossroads of nutrients, gut microbiota, and metabolic inflammation [^112pjqoS]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Obesity is accompanied by the activation of low-grade inflammatory activity in metabolically relevant tissues. Studies have shown that obesity-associated insulin resistance results from the inflammatory targeting and inhibition of key proteins of the insulin-signaling pathway. At least three apparently distinct mechanisms-endoplasmic reticulum stress, toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 activation, and changes in gut microbiota-have been identified as triggers of obesity-associated metabolic inflammation; thus, they are expected to represent potential targets for the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. Here, we review the data that place TLR4 in the center of the events that connect the consumption of dietary fats with metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance. Changes in the gut microbiota can lead to reduced integrity of the intestinal barrier, leading to increased leakage of lipopolysaccharides and fatty acids, which can act upon TLR4 to activate systemic inflammation. Fatty acids can also trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress, which can be further stimulated by cross talk with active TLR4. Thus, the current data support a connection among the three main triggers of metabolic inflammation, and TLR4 emerges as a link among all of these mechanisms.

### Visceral adiposity, insulin resistance and cancer risk [^117TySbZ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is a well established link between obesity and cancer. Emerging research is characterising this relationship further and delineating the specific role of excess visceral adiposity, as opposed to simple obesity, in promoting tumorigenesis. This review summarises the evidence from an epidemiological and pathophysiological perspective.

Methods

Relevant medical literature was identified from searches of PubMed and references cited in appropriate articles identified. Selection of articles was based on peer review, journal and relevance.

Results

Numerous epidemiological studies consistently identify increased risk of developing carcinoma in the obese. Adipose tissue, particularly viscerally located fat, is metabolically active and exerts systemic endocrine effects. Putative pathophysiological mechanisms linking obesity and carcinogenesis include the paracrine effects of adipose tissue and systemic alterations associated with obesity. Systemic changes in the obese state include chronic inflammation and alterations in adipokines and sex steroids. Insulin and the insulin-like growth factor axis influence tumorigenesis and also have a complex relationship with adiposity. There is evidence to suggest that insulin and the IGF axis play an important role in mediating obesity associated malignancy.

Conclusions

There is much evidence to support a role for obesity in cancer progression, however further research is warranted to determine the specific effect of excess visceral adipose tissue on tumorigenesis. Investigation of the potential mechanisms underpinning the association, including the role of insulin and the IGF axis, will improve understanding of the obesity and cancer link and may uncover targets for intervention.

### Insulin resistance and thrombogenesis: recent insights and therapeutic implications [^114UQumX]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the relationship between insulin resistance and thrombogenesis, especially in the context of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and to discuss therapeutic implications.

Methods

The pertinent peer-reviewed literature was examined for evidence in support of the aforementioned relationship, and the reported efficacy of various therapeutic interventions was assessed.

Results

Robust evidence indicates that insulin resistance and enhanced thrombogenesis are closely related pathophysiologic mechanisms, especially in the presence of obesity. Thus, targeting insulin resistance and thrombogenesis may be of value in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many proven preventive and therapeutic strategies, such as weight loss, exercise, and various pharmaceutical agents, affect both thrombogenesis and insulin resistance.

Conclusion

Both insulin resistance and thrombogenesis contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Effective measures for prevention and management of diabetes and cardiovascular disease also tend to improve insulin sensitivity and to ameliorate abnormalities in coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function.

### Insulin resistance in pediatric obesity: from mechanisms to treatment strategies [^116p8iaE]. Pediatric Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

7. Conclusion

Obesity represents the foremost contributor to insulin resistance, which in turn exacerbates obesity, thereby creating a vicious cycle. The improvement of insulin resistance can be effectively achieved through weight loss, physical activity, and/or medication for hyperglycemia; however, it rarely returns to normal. Therefore, treatment for children with obesity is comprehensive and multifaceted, aiming to cultivate a healthy lifestyle that can effectively improve insulin resistance and enhance insulin sensitivity. In cases where patients have a poor response, pharmacological and metabolic surgical treatments may be considered to prevent chronic complications and premature mortality.

### Type 2 diabetes as a disease of ectopic fat? [^1129D63k]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence for the ectopic fat hypothesis in T2DM

Surprisingly, the pathophysiological basis for T2DM continues to attract debate. What is clear, however, is the emergence of one major hypothesis, namely that of ectopic fat leading to organ-specific insulin resistance via a process termed 'lipotoxicity'. Many individuals prone to T2DM appear to show a greater propensity to accumulate visceral fat for a given weight; interestingly, this characteristic may be a downstream consequence of an 'impaired' subcutaneous fat storage capacity, the mechanisms for which deserve greater attention. As extreme example of this concept is lipodystropy; individuals with this condition have an impaired ability to store subcutaneous fat, and consequently with even modest weight gain, they accumulate fat in visceral and ectopic tissues (for example, the liver), leading in turn to marked insulin resistance. At the other extreme are many individuals, particularly women, who, despite attaining very high BMIs (as high as 50 to 60 kg/m²), remain insulin-sensitive, normoglycaemic and normolipaemic. Imaging studies show these individuals to have low levels of visceral and ectopic fat but a high subcutaneous fat content. A pharmacological example underlying the importance of ectopic fat to dysglycaemia comes from the observation that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ agonists (thiazolidenediones) lower glucose levels despite increasing the patient's weight. They appear to do so by redistributing fat away from the liver and towards an expanded subcutaneous pool. Finally, transplantation of normal adipose tissue in the subcutaneous region of lipoatrophic mice, which are normally severely insulin-resistant, removes their excess hepatic fat and normalises hepatic insulin sensitivity.

### Obesity-induced insulin resistance and hyperglycemia: etiologic factors and molecular mechanisms [^114AVEaJ]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes, clinically evidenced as hyperglycemia. The altered glucose homeostasis is caused by faulty signal transduction via the insulin signaling proteins, which results in decreased glucose uptake by the muscle, altered lipogenesis, and increased glucose output by the liver. The etiology of this derangement in insulin signaling is related to a chronic inflammatory state, leading to the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and release of high levels of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species, which together cause posttranslational modifications in the signaling proteins. There are substantial differences in the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in muscle versus liver. Hormones and cytokines from adipocytes can enhance or inhibit both glycemic sensing and insulin signaling. The role of the central nervous system in glucose homeostasis also has been established. Multipronged therapies aimed at rectifying obesity-induced anomalies in both central nervous system and peripheral tissues may prove to be beneficial.

### Chain splitting of insulin: an underlying mechanism of insulin resistance? [^114tTm4A]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease. (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of intense research, the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are still poorly understood. What if one of the major causes of insulin resistance is not related to defects in the target tissues and/or insulin receptor signaling, but rather to a reduced survival of endogenously secreted insulin on its way to activating the receptor on the cell surface of the target tissues? Here, we present data and lay out arguments in support of this novel hypothesis, which is fundamentally different from the common view that insulin resistance is caused by the body's cells becoming less sensitive to insulin.

### Obesity and type 2 diabetes: what can be unified and what needs to be individualized? [^116K2LYy]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Does a shared pathogenesis underlie both obesity and type 2 diabetes?

Although the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes is widely held to involve two discrete lesions — obesity-induced insulin resistance and β-cell failure — both disorders may share an underlying defect. This "unified field theory" raises questions about whether defects favoring progressive weight gain and metabolic impairment also contribute to β-cell decompensation.

One potential link could be sustained cell exposure to nutrient concentrations exceeding energy requirements. Deleterious cellular effects of nutrient excess can include impaired inflammatory signaling, endoplasmic reticulum stress, excess production of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of triglycerides and/or fatty acyl intermediates, and activation of serine-threonine kinases. These responses are not mutually exclusive, and induction of one may trigger another, leading to a cascade of damage. Obesity-associated cellular injury can in turn recruit and activate macrophages and other immune cells that exacerbate tissue inflammation. Collectively, these responses contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, and some (e.g. acquired mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation) may occur in β-cells as well via mechanisms discussed above. In susceptible individuals, therefore, obesity-induced metabolic impairment can favor insulin resistance on the one hand and progressive β-cell dysfunction on the other. Reduced insulin secretion can in turn worsen the nutrient excess problem by raising circulating concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids, and other nutrients. In this way, a vicious cycle arises whereby obesity-induced nutrient excess triggers inflammatory responses that cause insulin resistance, placing a greater demand on the β-cell, and as β-cell function declines the cellular toll taken by nutrient excess increases. Since not all obese individuals develop hyperglycemia, however, an underlying abnormality of the β-cell must coexist with nutrient excess to promote type 2 diabetes.

Brain neurocircuits governing energy homeostasis also affect insulin sensitivity in the liver and perhaps other peripheral tissues, and inflammation similar to that induced by obesity in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues also occurs in these areas of the brain. If obesity is associated with impairment of neurocircuits regulating both energy balance and insulin action, obesity-induced insulin resistance may arise not only as a direct consequence of excessive adipose mass but via neuronal mechanisms as well. Whether disturbed neurocircuits also contribute to deteriorating β-cell dysfunction as obesity and its sequelae progress is an active area of investigation.

### Insulin resistance: metabolic mechanisms and consequences in the heart [^111GGCVD]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a characteristic feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus and impacts the heart in various ways. Impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake is a uniformly observed characteristic of the heart in these states, although changes in upstream kinase signaling are variable and dependent on the severity and duration of the associated obesity or diabetes mellitus. The understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological role of insulin resistance in the heart is evolving. To maintain its high energy demands, the heart is capable of using many metabolic substrates. Although insulin signaling may directly regulate cardiac metabolism, its main role is likely the regulation of substrate delivery from the periphery to the heart. In addition to promoting glucose uptake, insulin regulates long-chain fatty acid uptake, protein synthesis, and vascular function in the normal cardiovascular system. Recent advances in understanding the role of metabolic, signaling, and inflammatory pathways in obesity have provided opportunities to better understand the pathophysiology of insulin resistance in the heart. This review will summarize our current understanding of metabolic mechanisms for and consequences of insulin resistance in the heart and will discuss potential new areas for investigating novel mechanisms that contribute to insulin resistance in the heart.

### Fatty acids, obesity, and insulin resistance: time for a reevaluation [^113zbMmM]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

There is a widespread acceptance in the literature that plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), also called free fatty acids (FFA), can mediate many adverse metabolic effects, most notably insulin resistance. Elevated NEFA concentrations in obesity are thought to arise from an increased adipose tissue mass. It is also argued that the process of fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, normally suppressed by insulin, itself becomes insulin resistant — thus, lipolysis is further increased, potentially leading to a vicious cycle. Although we have also accepted this model for many years, recently there has been a steady accumulation of data, both in the literature and from our own research, that has forced us to realize that this simple story is not always true. Here we review the background to the idea of "fatty acids as metabolic villains", together with data from the literature and from our own studies, which tend to show another side to the fatty acids/insulin resistance story.

We will first examine the relationship between systemic concentrations of NEFA and obesity/insulin resistance and then study adipose tissue in the obese state with regard to its adaptation for NEFA release.

### Combined influence of insulin resistance, overweight / obesity, and fatty liver as risk factors for type 2 diabetes [^111RPmeT]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

IR is also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and has a close association with obesity. Both obesity and IR are also strongly associated with fatty liver, and it is now evident that fatty liver is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, fatty liver may occur in both normal weight and overweight/obese individuals, and the precise mechanism by which fatty liver increases risk of type 2 diabetes is uncertain. Fatty liver may affect risk of diabetes via an effect on the secretion of hepatokines, increased gluconeogenesis, decreased glycogen synthesis, and inhibition of insulin signaling. Although fatty liver is associated with diabetes, not all individuals with fatty liver have IR. Thus, although IR, overweight/obesity, and fatty liver are strongly correlated, there is clear evidence of dissociation between these three risk factors. The dissociation between these risk factors suggests that different pathogenetic mechanisms may operate by which insulin resistance, overweight/obesity, and fatty liver contribute to type 2 diabetes. Affected individuals who develop type 2 diabetes may have any one, two, or three of these risk factors, but the impact of different combinations of risk factors is uncertain. Establishing the roles of the different combinations of these risk factors may be helpful to understand the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and to inform approaches to prevention and treatment. Using data from a cohort study with measurements of IR, overweight/obesity, and fatty liver at baseline, the aim of our study was to 1) estimate the strength of the association between different combinations of these three risk factors and incident diabetes and 2) determine whether the effects of each factor are independent of each other and potential confounding factors.

### Insulin resistance: the link between obesity and cardiovascular disease [^113yMxTX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Insulin-mediated glucose disposal varies at least sixfold in apparently healthy individuals. The adverse effect of decreases in the level of physical fitness on insulin sensitivity is comparable to the untoward impact of excess adiposity, with each accounting for approximately 25% of the variability of insulin action. It is the loss of insulin sensitivity that explains why obese individuals are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease, but not all overweight/obese individuals are insulin resistant. At a clinical level, it is important to identify those overweight individuals who are also insulin resistant and to initiate the most intensive therapeutic effort in this subgroup. Finally, it appears that the adverse impact of overall obesity, as estimated by body mass index, is comparable to that of abdominal obesity, as quantified by waist circumference.

### Mitochondrial deficiency is associated with insulin resistance [^1152Mbd4]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The specific cellular underpinnings or mechanisms of insulin resistance (IR) are not clear. Here I present evidence to support a causal association between mitochondrial energetics and IR. A large body of literature indicates that mitochondrial capacity for oxidative metabolism is lower in human obesity and type 2 diabetes. Whether or not mitochondria play a causal role in IR is hotly debated. First, IR can be caused by many factors, many of which may or may not involve mitochondria. These include lipid overload, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Thus the first tenet of an argument supporting a role for mitochondria in IR is that mitochondria derangements can cause IR, but IR does not have to involve mitochondria. The second tenet of this argument is that animal models in which oxidative metabolism are completely abolished are not always physiologically or pathologically relevant to human IR, in which small metabolic perturbations can have profound effects over a prolonged period. Lastly, mitochondria are complex organelles, with diverse functions, including links with cell signaling, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which in turn can be connected with IR. In summary, mitochondrial "deficiency" is not merely a reduced energy generation or low fatty acid oxidation; this concept should be expanded to numerous additional important functions, many of which can cause IR if perturbed.

### The mitochondrial quality control system: a new target for exercise therapeutic intervention in the treatment of brain insulin resistance-induced neurodegeneration in obesity [^113h1pYD]. International Journal of Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a major global health concern because of its strong association with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases such as diabetes, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, brain insulin resistance in obesity is likely to lead to neuroplasticity deficits. Since the evidence shows that insulin resistance in brain regions abundant in insulin receptors significantly alters mitochondrial efficiency and function, strategies targeting the mitochondrial quality control system may be of therapeutic and practical value in obesity-induced cognitive decline. Exercise is considered as a powerful stimulant of mitochondria that improves insulin sensitivity and enhances neuroplasticity. It has great potential as a non-pharmacological intervention against the onset and progression of obesity associated neurodegeneration. Here, we integrate the current knowledge of the mechanisms of neurodegenration in obesity and focus on brain insulin resistance to explain the relationship between the impairment of neuronal plasticity and mitochondrial dysfunction. This knowledge was synthesised to explore the exercise paradigm as a feasible intervention for obese neurodegenration in terms of improving brain insulin signals and regulating the mitochondrial quality control system.

### Molecular mechanisms of obesity and diabetes: at the intersection of weight regulation, inflammation, and glucose homeostasis [^116P44yY]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Obesity is a major health crisis, and diabetes is one of its most serious sequelae. Obesity is associated with a state of chronic systemic inflammation that is a primary etiologic factor in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. This inflammatory state is based in adipose tissue and mediated in large part by tissue macrophages and their cytokine and adipokine products. Recent research has identified specific molecular mediators of the link between inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Study of these mediators and the specific mechanisms underlying inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity holds the promise for novel pharmacotherapy for obesity-related metabolic disease.

### The hormone resistin links obesity to diabetes [^1139NrNm]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that leads to complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage. Type 2 diabetes, characterized by target-tissue resistance to insulin, is epidemic in industrialized societies and is strongly associated with obesity; however, the mechanism by which increased adiposity causes insulin resistance is unclear. Here we show that adipocytes secrete a unique signalling molecule, which we have named resistin (for resistance to insulin). Circulating resistin levels are decreased by the anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone, and increased in diet-induced and genetic forms of obesity. Administration of anti-resistin antibody improves blood sugar and insulin action in mice with diet-induced obesity. Moreover, treatment of normal mice with recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance and insulin action. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by adipocytes is enhanced by neutralization of resistin and is reduced by resistin treatment. Resistin is thus a hormone that potentially links obesity to diabetes.

### How the association between obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer [^112URbJC]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Obesity is associated with metabolic dysfunction and over nutrition. Increased body mass index and obesity are strongly amalgamated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to altered secretion of adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators release as well as chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study were to review the evidence of how obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer.

Summary

Recent findings suggested that increased level of inflammatory mediators in obesity, plays an introductory and cabalistic role in the development of different types of inflammatory disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Link between elevated body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several of the factors-such as increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation etc. consequently result in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic progression too.

Conclusion

This review summarizes how cytokine production in adipose tissue of obese subject creates a chronic inflammatory environment that favors tumor cell motility and invasion to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. High levels of cytokine in the circulation of affected individuals have been associated with a significantly worse outcome. This article also reconnoiters the mechanisms that link obesity to numerous disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, cancers and most specifically combine these processes in a single image. Understanding these mechanisms may assist to understand the consequences of obesity.

### Diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance in COVID-19: molecular interrelationship and therapeutic implications [^116ZQCjM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the novel coronavirus (named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, reached pandemic status in February 2020, and now is present in every country around the world. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease manifestations has improved but the reason why the evolution is more severe in some patients is still unknown. Data coming from different sources has shown that body mass index (BMI) and metabolic syndrome are strong independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. In the present review we discuss the different mechanisms that may contribute to explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 including viral entrance, direct viral toxicity, endothelial dysfunction, thromboinflammation, dysregulation of the immune response, and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). Some of these mechanisms are common to sepsis such as the release of cytokines and microcirculation dysfunction, others are specific to COVID-19 such as Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediated viral entry and tissue damage, and dysregulation of the RAAS. In parallel, we correlate these mechanisms with obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance, which increase the severity of the disease, and the potential beneficial effect of drugs used to treat insulin resistance and diabetes in patients with COVID-19.

### Insulin resistance and obesity [^116ZtDTB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Obesity, particularly central obesity, is associated with insulin resistance. Much research has focused on mechanisms that link obesity to insulin resistance, including lipid accumulation in muscle and liver and the recently discovered adipocytokines. Insulin resistance is an important feature of a number of common conditions, including type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome and is associated with rarer disorders, such as inherited insulin receptoropathies and genetic and acquired lipodystrophies. Despite its use for a number of years, metformin's role as an insulin sensitizer has only recently been appreciated. The discovery of a new class of insulin sensitizing agents, the thiazolidinediones, represents a major advance in the understanding of the etiology of insulin resistance, particularly in relation to adipocyte biology and possibly, its inflammatory origins.

### Disordered fat storage and mobilization in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [^113EPJ63]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The primary genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors responsible for causing insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell failure and the precise sequence of events leading to the development of type 2 diabetes are not yet fully understood. Abnormalities of triglyceride storage and lipolysis in insulin-sensitive tissues are an early manifestation of conditions characterized by insulin resistance and are detectable before the development of postprandial or fasting hyperglycemia. Increased free fatty acid (FFA) flux from adipose tissue to nonadipose tissue, resulting from abnormalities of fat metabolism, participates in and amplifies many of the fundamental metabolic derangements that are characteristic of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes. It is also likely to play an important role in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to fasting hyperglycemia and conversion to frank type 2 diabetes in insulin resistant individuals. Adverse metabolic consequences of increased FFA flux, to be discussed in this review, are extremely wide ranging and include, but are not limited to: 1) dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis, 2) impaired glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver, 3) diminished insulin clearance, aggravating peripheral tissue hyperinsulinemia, and 4) impaired pancreatic beta-cell function. The precise biochemical mechanisms whereby fatty acids and cytosolic triglycerides exert their effects remain poorly understood. Recent studies, however, suggest that the sequence of events may be the following: in states of positive net energy balance, triglyceride accumulation in "fat-buffering" adipose tissue is limited by the development of adipose tissue insulin resistance. This results in diversion of energy substrates to nonadipose tissue, which in turn leads to a complex array of metabolic abnormalities characteristic of insulin-resistant states and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the biochemical mechanisms whereby glucose and fat exert adverse effects in insulin-sensitive and insulin-producing tissues are shared, thus implicating a diabetogenic role for energy excess as a whole. Although there is now evidence that weight loss through reduction of caloric intake and increase in physical activity can prevent the development of diabetes, it remains an open question as to whether specific modulation of fat metabolism will result in improvement in some or all of the above metabolic derangements or will prevent progression from insulin resistance syndrome to type 2 diabetes.

### Macrophages, immunity, and metabolic disease [^114P7pkF]. Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic, low-grade adipose tissue inflammation is a key etiological mechanism linking the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. It is well recognized that the immune system and metabolism are highly integrated, and macrophages, in particular, have been identified as critical effector cells in the initiation of inflammation and insulin resistance. Recent advances have been made in the understanding of macrophage recruitment and retention to adipose tissue and the participation of other immune cell populations in the regulation of this inflammatory process. Here we discuss the pathophysiological link between macrophages, obesity, and insulin resistance, highlighting the dynamic immune cell regulation of adipose tissue inflammation. We also describe the mechanisms by which inflammation causes insulin resistance and the new therapeutic targets that have emerged.

### Features, functions, and associated diseases of visceral and ectopic fat: a comprehensive review [^112KM8cM]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a complex, chronic, and recurrent disease marked by abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that poses significant health risks. The distribution of body fat, especially ectopic fat deposition, plays a crucial role in the development of chronic metabolic diseases. Under normal conditions, fatty acids are primarily stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue; however, excessive intake can lead to fat accumulation in visceral adipose tissue and ectopic sites, including the pancreas, heart, and muscle. This redistribution is associated with disruptions in energy metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance, impairing organ function and raising the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and fatty liver. This review explores the roles of visceral and ectopic fat in the development of insulin resistance and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Specifically, we examine the structure and characteristics of different fat types, their associations with disease, and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Future strategies for managing obesity-related diseases may include lifestyle modifications, surgical interventions, and emerging medications that target lipid metabolism and energy regulation, aiming to improve patient outcomes.

### The macrophage at the intersection of immunity and metabolism in obesity [^116ESTZq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Obesity is a worldwide pandemic representing one of the major challenges that societies face around the globe. Identifying the mechanisms involved in its development and propagation will help the development of preventative and therapeutic strategies that may help control its rising rates.

Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, and this is believed to be one of the major contributors to the development of insulin resistance, which is an early event in obesity and leads to type 2 diabetes when the pancreas fails to keep up with increased demand for insulin. In this review, we discuss the role of macrophages in mediation of inflammation in obesity in metabolic organs including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. The presence of immune cells at the interface with metabolic organs modulates both metabolic function and inflammatory responses in these organs, and may provide a potential therapeutic target to modulate metabolic function in obesity.

### Insulin resistance as a potential driving force of parental obesity-induced adverse metabolic programming mechanisms in children with obesity [^112kv7j2]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Family history of obesity is well-recognized as one of the most important risk factors for childhood obesity, but mechanisms driving this greater predisposition remain to be elucidated. Herein, we found that children born to parents with obesity had increased fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR scores, in agreement with previous clinical and experimental studies describing that PO may disrupt β cell development in the offspring, thus impairing insulin production and function. Interestingly, this was in turn accompanied by altered levels in a multitude of metabolites participating in a variety of pathways that are known to be tightly regulated by insulin action, as summarized in Fig. 2 and detailedly discussed in the following paragraphs. Additional statistical analyses showed that most of these associations between childhood obesity, PO, and blood metabolites were largely attenuated after adjusting for HOMA-IR scores (Additional file 1: Tables S1–S2). Altogether, our findings suggest that IR could represent a cornerstone in modulating PO-mediated exacerbations in the metabolic derangements typically underlying childhood obesity.

### Insulin action and resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes [^117Y9RRs]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Nutritional excess is a major forerunner of type 2 diabetes. It enhances the secretion of insulin, but attenuates insulin's metabolic actions in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, conflicting evidence indicates a lack of knowledge of the timing of these events during the development of obesity and diabetes, pointing to a key gap in our understanding of metabolic disease. This Perspective reviews alternate viewpoints and recent results on the temporal and mechanistic connections between hyperinsulinemia, obesity and insulin resistance. Although much attention has addressed early steps in the insulin signaling cascade, insulin resistance in obesity seems to be largely elicited downstream of these steps. New findings also connect insulin resistance to extensive metabolic cross-talk between the liver, adipose tissue, pancreas and skeletal muscle. These and other advances over the past 5 years offer exciting opportunities and daunting challenges for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

### Role of adiponectin system in insulin resistance [^115kWQ5k]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The knowledge of the pathogenesis of obesity and its metabolic sequelae has significantly advanced over the last few decades and adipose tissue is now considered a link between obesity and insulin resistance. Adiponectin, one of the major adipocyte-secreted proteins, has attracted scientific interest in recent years and has been extensively studied both in human and animal models. Adiponectin exerts insulin-sensitizing effects through binding to its receptors, leading to activation of AMPK, PPAR-α, and potentially other unknown molecular pathways. In obesity-linked insulin resistance, both adiponectin and adiponectin receptors are downregulated, leading to activation of signaling pathways involved in metabolism regulation. Up-regulation of adiponectin/adiponectin receptors or enhancing adiponectin receptor function may be an interesting therapeutic strategy for obesity-linked insulin resistance. In this review we will focus on the recent research related to the relationship between the adiponectin system and insulin resistance. The potential use of adiponectin or its receptor for therapeutic intervention will be also discussed.

### Insulin resistance, adipose depots and gut: interactions and pathological implications [^111yb5Gp]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

This review article focuses on the many metabolic actions of insulin at the level of muscle, liver and adipose tissue. In terms of pathogenetic mechanisms, the condition of insulin resistance is complex, as multiple genetic and environmental factors, among which an increasingly sedentary lifestyle associated with high-fat diet, mutually interact according to variable patterns in time in any given individual. It is well recognized that obesity (in particular abdominal obesity) favours the development of insulin resistance. Here we evaluate the impact of obesity and ectopic fat accumulation (visceral and hepatic) on insulin resistance at the level of different target organs, i.e., muscle, liver and adipose tissue. The roles of the gut and the liver, in particular of bile acids and gut microflora, are also discussed as possible determinants of energy balance and glucose metabolism.

### LGR signaling mediates muscle-adipose tissue crosstalk and protects against diet-induced insulin resistance [^111jRBem]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Insulin signaling is essential for glucose homeostasis. In peripheral tissues, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood and stimulates its conversion into glycogen and fat for storage. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and metabolism are reduced in insulin-resistant subjects, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. This elevation intensifies the secretory demand on pancreatic β-cells, which is further amplified by the increase in body mass due to obesity. This can result in β-cell loss or damage, ultimately leading to inadequate levels of circulating insulin and the development of diabetes. The adaptive mechanisms of hormonal and cellular physiology effectively manage glucose homeostasis under normal conditions. However, obesity and high-calorie diets can trigger insulin resistance in adipose tissue and other organs. Despite the great medical importance of this condition, the underlying hormonal pathways and mechanisms that become disrupted due to nutrient excess and subsequently lead to impaired insulin signaling remain poorly defined.

Many in-vivo studies and models of diet-induced insulin resistance have linked decreased tissue insulin sensitivity with factors such as lipid accumulation, endoplasmic-reticulum stress, and inflammatory stress responses. While improving β-cell function and ameliorating insulin resistance in individuals with obesity are key steps towards restoring normal glucose absorption to prevent and treat diabetes, the underlying mechanisms involve multi-organ crosstalk within complex hormonal systems that are still inadequately defined. Animal models of diet-induced obesity display insulin resistance and thus enable a range of experimental approaches to elucidate these mechanisms and identify targets for diabetes treatment. Because of the conservation of most metabolic pathways and many hormonal systems, the fruit fly Drosophila has become a valuable model for understanding the contribution of nutrition to metabolic disorders. In flies, diet-induced obesity produces many of the same pathophysiological effects observed in humans with obesity, indeed including hyperglycemia, altered insulin secretion, and insulin resistance. Given the fly's genetic adaptability, this model of diet-induced insulin resistance can be exploited to provide insight into the complex tissue crosstalk that drives insulin resistance and diabetes progression.

### Metabolic complications of obesity: inflated or inflamed? [^111MCDKh]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2007). Low credibility.

Adipose tissue dysfunction rather than excess adipose tissue mass (defined as obesity) is mechanistically related to development of metabolic diseases traditionally linked to obesity: metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Inflammation of adipose tissue seems to be an important manifestation of adipose tissue dysfunction and closely relates to insulin resistance, the mediator of obesity-related morbidity. However, it is not completely clear whether inflammation in adipose tissue leads to first, local, and then systemic insulin resistance or insulin resistance leads to adipose tissue inflammation, which, in turn, increases insulin resistance. These questions can only be answered by studying models of insulin resistance, independent of obesity. The conceptual shift from adipose tissue mass to adipose tissue function will have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Our efforts in establishing markers to identify "at risk" population and finding newer therapeutic agents must focus on adipose tissue dysfunction and not on obesity alone.

### IL-1 family members in the pathogenesis and treatment of metabolic disease: focus on adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance [^111uwxhy]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

Obesity is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Cytokines and chemokines produced by immunocompetent cells influence local as well as systemic inflammation and are therefore critical contributors to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Hence, cytokines that modulate inflammatory responses are emerging as potential targets for intervention and treatment of the metabolic consequences of obesity. The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines and receptors are key mediators of innate inflammatory responses and exhibit both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. During the last decades, mechanistic insights into how the IL-1 family affects the initiation and progression of obesity-induced insulin resistance have increased significantly. Here, we review the current knowledge and understanding, with emphasis on the therapeutic potential of individual members of the IL-1 family of cytokines for improving insulin sensitivity in patients with diabetes.

### Viewpoints on the way to the consensus session: where does insulin resistance start? The adipose tissue [^115C9h7o]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A high visceral-to-subcutaneous fat mass ratio correlates closely with the metabolic syndrome phenotype in obese and lean individuals and is a typical feature of aging and lean insulin-resistant offspring of type 2 diabetic individuals. Targeted expansion of the visceral fat mass by steroids and the selective surgical removal of visceral fat in animals and omental fat in humans support the detrimental role of this depot. Numerous large cohort studies have demonstrated that excessive visceral, intermuscular, and trunkal fat mass correlates with the severity of metabolic dysregulation, cardiovascular risk, and presence of type 2 diabetes. Smaller adipocyte size was shown to be associated with increased leg fat mass, whereas larger adipocyte size was related to more trunkal fat mass.

In summary, the inability of adipose tissue to store FA and glucose, independent of total body adiposity, appears to be a common feature in all disorders characterized by insulin resistance. The fat insulin resistance is related to excessive FA accumulation and cell enlargement. Oxidative stress in fat cells is exacerbated by reduced perfusion and relative hypoxia, which promote chemo-attraction and inflammation. These abnormalities adversely influence metabolic pathways throughout the body in the form of lipotoxicity, ectopic fat storage, systemic low-grade inflammation, and insulin resistance. Epicardial, intermuscular, and visceral abdominal fat depots are physiologically more metabolically active and less insulin sensitive. Their expansion exacerbates the flow of substrates and cytokines both locally and to vital organs, provoking triglyceride accumulation and oxidative damage. In the liver, FA overflow reduces insulin clearance, thereby promoting the exposure of peripheral tissues, brain, and vessels to hyperinsulinemia, which exacerbates insulin resistance and causes sympathetic activation. The cascade of events hypothesized above is summarized in Fig. 2.

Figure 2
Proposed cascade of events via which abnormal adipose tissue development leads to insulin resistance in nonadipose organs. Ectopic fat deposition, oxidative damage, and inflammation play a central role in the development of insulin resistance in muscle, liver, and other organs and establish a negative reverberating cycle.

### Acetate mediates a microbiome-brain-β-cell axis to promote metabolic syndrome [^111yMdjP]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Obesity, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome are associated with changes to the gut microbiota; however, the mechanism by which modifications to the gut microbiota might lead to these conditions is unknown. Here we show that increased production of acetate by an altered gut microbiota in rodents leads to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, which, in turn, promotes increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, increased ghrelin secretion, hyperphagia, obesity and related sequelae. Together, these findings identify increased acetate production resulting from a nutrient-gut microbiota interaction and subsequent parasympathetic activation as possible therapeutic targets for obesity.

### Defining and characterizing the progression of type 2 diabetes [^1162FyPx]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

β-Cells maintain their responsiveness in the face of insulin resistance through increased insulin secretion in response to meals as well as through a chronic response by increasing β-cell mass. Normal-weight and obese individuals maintain a normal and similar 24-h glucose response to meals. However, the groups differ in their mean insulin secretion, which is significantly higher in obese subjects than in their normal-weight counterparts. In addition, insulin secretion in obese subjects fails to return to baseline between meals.

Two acquired defects have been implicated with regard to impaired glucose secretion: glucotoxicity, whereby β-cells become sensitized to the presence of glucose, and lipotoxicity, whereby accumulated fatty acids and their metabolic products deleteriously affect β-cells. In glucotoxicity, chronic hyperglycemia depletes insulin secretory granules from β-cells, lessening the amount of insulin available to be released in response to new glucose stimuli. Lowering glucose levels permits regranulation of β-cells and a better acute insulin response follows. In lipotoxicity, prolonged increases in free fatty acid levels adversely affect the conversion of proinsulin to insulin and eventually affect insulin secretion. Fatty infiltration of pancreatic islets may also contribute to β-cell dysfunction, and pancreatic fat correlates negatively with β-cell function. But once diabetes occurs, factors additional to pancreatic fat (perhaps glucose toxicity) account for further β-cell function decline. The concepts of gluco- and lipotoxicity remain hypotheses; the exact mechanisms responsible for impaired β-cell function have yet to be conclusively proved. This concept is being tested further in clinical trials such as ORIGIN, where insulin will be used early to eliminate glucotoxicity and determine whether early and maintained normoglycemia will decrease disease progression. The concept of remission in diabetes by elimination of glucotoxicity has actually been tested in a few small studies.

### Obesity in type 1 diabetes: pathophysiology, clinical impact, and mechanisms [^111RLmLv]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity in people with type 1 diabetes in recent years. Although obesity has long been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and a catalyst for complications, much less is known about the role of obesity in the initiation and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Emerging evidence suggests that obesity contributes to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and cardiometabolic complications in type 1 diabetes. Unique therapeutic strategies may be required to address these comorbidities within the context of intensive insulin therapy, which promotes weight gain. There is an urgent need for clinical guidelines for the prevention and management of obesity in type 1 diabetes. The development of these recommendations will require a transdisciplinary research strategy addressing metabolism, molecular mechanisms, lifestyle, neuropsychology, and novel therapeutics. In this review, the prevalence, clinical impact, energy balance physiology, and potential mechanisms of obesity in type 1 diabetes are described, with a special focus on the substantial gaps in knowledge in this field. Our goal is to provide a framework for the evidence base needed to develop type 1 diabetes-specific weight management recommendations that account for the competing outcomes of glycemic control and weight management.
