## Question

Trigger finger treatment options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me about trigger finger treatment options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and prognostic stratification. Then, I should evaluate first-line conservative options and their evidence. Next, I will appraise corticosteroid injection technique, dosing, expected outcomes, and follow-up decision points. After that, I need to consider surgical options and their risks, including when to add FDS slip excision. I will then address special populations such as pediatric patients, those with diabetes, and those with concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome. Finally, I should integrate cost-effectiveness, shared decision making, postoperative expectations, and a pragmatic algorithm, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the key elements of initial assessment that drive outcomes and treatment selection: symptom duration, severity grading (e.g. Quinnell or Green), number of digits involved, and comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and carpal tunnel syndrome; I also need to check for a preoperative PIP joint contracture given its surgical implications, especially for potential FDS slip excision [^115hSwZJ] [^114xgdSS] [^111pud97] [^115qdw98].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; early disease with Quinnell grade 1–2 and symptoms under 3 months often behaves differently than chronic or high-grade disease, so I should stratify accordingly before choosing therapy because milder, shorter-duration cases respond better to noninvasive options than fixed contractures or long-standing disease, which show higher conversion to surgery [^113Zp1KW] [^116D5tGL].

> Next, I will examine the role of night splinting for appropriately selected early cases; a 6-week course of a hand-based nighttime orthosis led to complete resolution in 55% of adults with Quinnell grade 1–2 and symptoms under 3 months, which is useful as a low-risk first step with the understanding that nearly half will need escalation, and I should verify there is no rigid locking before prescribing this path [^113Zp1KW].

> I need to check the evidence base for NSAIDs and therapy as stand-alone treatments; a Cochrane review found no eligible randomized trials supporting NSAIDs alone for trigger finger, and more recent randomized data suggest that adding an orthosis to a corticosteroid injection does not confer short-term benefit over injection alone, so I should use NSAIDs as adjuncts for pain rather than as primary disease-modifying therapy [^113hikGE] [^116D5tGL].

> Now, regarding corticosteroid injections as first-line for most adults, I should verify contemporary benchmarks: a national database analysis shows 66.3% success after a single injection, increasing to approximately 79% after the second and third injections, which supports offering a second injection if the first is only partially effective at 6–8 weeks, with counseling that diminishing returns and rising surgery selection occur after multiple failures [^115hSwZJ] [^114LYyWB].

> Let me think about dosing because optimal steroid dose matters; a prospective study comparing 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide found 20 mg achieved the highest 6-month effectiveness at 79% versus 52% and 62% for 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, suggesting 20 mg as a reasonable standard dose, whereas very low-dose approaches (2–8 mg) appear to provide short-term improvement but a high rate of additional treatment, which may be acceptable for selected mild cases prioritizing cost or safety [^116SAnLV] [^11536R2a].

> Wait, let me verify the effect of adding local anesthetic to the steroid because I recall conflicting data; one randomized trial reported higher immediate pain when lidocaine with epinephrine was included versus steroid alone, whereas a subsequent randomized trial found the opposite, with lower injection pain when lidocaine was added compared with steroid alone during administration and at 1 hour, and no difference in 6-week failure rates, so I should acknowledge this inconsistency and individualize based on patient preference for short-term comfort versus simplicity of a single-agent injection [^112pCgMd] [^115RsBF5].

> I should confirm technique nuances and guidance; family practice guidance allows injections with or without ultrasound, and while ultrasound can improve localization, superiority in outcomes is not clearly established, so routine ultrasound guidance is not mandatory for efficacy though it may aid accuracy in challenging anatomy or after prior failures [^1159XUbH].

> Next, I will review expected durability and recurrence to set accurate expectations; single-injection long-term success ranges from about 45% at up to 10 years in mixed cohorts to approximately 69% at eight years in some series, and recurrence after injection occurs in roughly 20% with a mean efficacy duration of around 10 months, which I should relay to patients when discussing follow-up and the possibility of repeat injection or surgery if symptoms return [^1152VMzx] [^115N7wTS] [^114hbm8V].

> At the 6–8 week decision point after an initial injection or splinting, I need to ensure I re-evaluate response and risk factors; if symptoms are resolved, observation and recurrence counseling are appropriate, if partially improved, a second injection can raise success to about 79%, and if there is no improvement or recurrent locking, I should proceed to surgical consultation, noting that obesity and concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome increase the odds of injection failure and that the long-term success probability of second and third injections hovers around 39% in single-center series, which can guide the threshold for moving to surgery [^114LYyWB] [^115hSwZJ] [^111GNYsy].

> But wait, I should double-check special monitoring after injection; in patients with diabetes, steroid-related hyperglycemia can occur, so peri-injection glucose monitoring and counseling are prudent, even though large datasets suggest that, when controlling for confounders like multiple digit involvement, diabetes itself may not independently predict injection failure in many cohorts [^116PnLw9] [^112expvW] [^112aLbeT].

> For operative management when conservative therapy fails or in high-grade disease with fixed contracture, I will now examine open versus percutaneous A1 pulley release; a recent meta-analysis of eight RCTs found no significant differences in revision, complications, or pain between techniques, aligning with prior systematic reviews indicating comparable effectiveness, so either approach is acceptable and can be chosen based on surgeon expertise and patient factors [^111au7Vj] [^115kaBnW].

> I need to ensure I present realistic outcomes and risks; open release typically leads to complete resolution in the vast majority with a low recurrence rate of around 2.4%, but minor complications such as scar pain, stiffness, and slow recovery occur in 7–17%, major complications like bowstringing, digital nerve injury, or deep infection are uncommon but can be devastating if they occur, and patients should know that the average time to feel fully recovered can be about six months, which often exceeds surgeon expectations [^114fRBwQ] [^111g8VqJ] [^112L3Xbr] [^111FT1Qt].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation steps intraoperatively when triggering persists; adjunctive resection of an FDS slip can be necessary if there is persistent triggering despite an adequate A1 release, and patients with multiple trigger fingers or a preoperative PIP joint contracture are significantly more likely to require FDS slip excision, so preoperative counseling should prepare for this possibility [^111pud97] [^115qdw98].

> Let me consider special populations; pediatric trigger thumb often resolves spontaneously but responds reliably to A1 release when needed, whereas pediatric trigger finger more commonly involves the FDS decussation and may require FDS slip excision in addition to A1 release to prevent recurrence, which differs from the adult pattern and should be explicitly recognized in counseling and consent [^115F9212] [^113MmcCA].

> For adults with diabetes, I need to reconcile mixed efficacy data; an older randomized trial suggested lower success of injection in diabetics compared to nondiabetics, yet multiple large observational datasets have not found diabetes to be an independent predictor of injection failure after accounting for confounders such as multiple digit disease, and from a cost perspective, immediate clinic-based surgical release can be the least costly strategy for poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetics, so decisions should be individualized to glycemic control, digit number, and patient preferences [^115GqP39] [^112aLbeT] [^112expvW] [^117188MZ].

> Patients with concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome warrant special attention; I should confirm that CTS is among the strongest predictors of injection failure across first through third injections, and if both conditions are symptomatic, concurrent or staged surgery may be considered, with the understanding that concomitant carpal tunnel release can slow recovery from trigger release [^115XDuVR] [^114LYyWB] [^111g8VqJ].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness and resource use; a classic cost-minimization analysis supports a strategy of one injection followed by a second if needed before proceeding to surgery as the least costly route for most patients, whereas immediate operating room surgery is 2.5–3.4 times more expensive, and notably, nonadherence to evidence-based sequencing (e.g., surgery without prior injection) has been associated with substantial excess spending, while in diabetics, immediate clinic-based release may be most cost-effective in many scenarios [^117GutkD] [^112expvW] [^117188MZ].

> I will now examine shared decision making because patient values strongly shape choices; a point-of-care preference elicitation tool was usable in clinic and showed that most patients prioritize success over cost and tend to choose injection as an initial strategy, and even with high clinical success rates, contemporary data suggest only about 80–85% of patients would choose to repeat common hand surgeries, underscoring the need to set realistic expectations for recovery time and potential minor complications [^112LrAeV] [^114rFGu1] [^116iHRuh].

> Let me not forget practical peri- and post-procedure considerations; steroid flare reactions are a known transient side effect with uncertain differences between specific steroid preparations, premature return to strenuous activity after steroid injection carries a small but real risk of tendon rupture and should be cautioned against, focused postoperative rehabilitation after percutaneous release can improve range of motion and workspace in patients with preoperative contracture, and while ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid has shown some promise versus steroid in small trials, steroid remains the standard given superior pain reduction at three months [^112jJWeK] [^114Unx9u] [^112w2e9E] [^115D3UtN].

> Pulling this together into a pragmatic algorithm, I should first stratify by severity and chronicity; for Quinnell grade 1–2 with under 3 months of symptoms, offer 6 weeks of night splinting with adjunctive NSAIDs as needed and escalate to injection if not resolved, whereas for grade 2–4 or symptoms beyond 3 months, offer a corticosteroid injection with a reasonable standard dose such as 20 mg triamcinolone, discuss the mixed data on adding lidocaine and tailor to patient preference, reassess at 6–8 weeks to consider a second injection if partially improved, and if there is persistent locking or high-risk features for injection failure such as concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome or significant PIP contracture, proceed to surgical consultation for open or percutaneous A1 release with preparedness for FDS slip excision when indicated, all while individualizing for diabetes, multiple digit involvement, patient preferences, and cost considerations [^113Zp1KW] [^116SAnLV] [^112pCgMd] [^115RsBF5] [^114LYyWB] [^111au7Vj] [^111pud97] [^117GutkD].

Treatment options for trigger finger include **conservative measures** (activity modification, NSAIDs, and splinting) [^113hikGE] [^113Zp1KW], **corticosteroid injections** (first-line for most, with 66–80% success) [^113HwnKX] [^114hbm8V], and **surgical release** (open or percutaneous) for refractory or severe cases [^115kaBnW]. Splinting is effective for **mild, recent-onset cases** [^113Zp1KW]; injections are less effective in patients with diabetes [^115GqP39] [^111b2Tns] and in severe disease. Surgery has a **high success rate (96–99%)** [^114fRBwQ] [^115qdw98] but carries risks, such as infection and nerve injury [^112L3Xbr] [^111g8VqJ]; percutaneous release offers faster recovery with outcomes comparable to open release. Treatment should be individualized based on **severity, comorbidities, and patient preference** [^111b2Tns].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **appropriate for mild or early-stage** trigger finger and includes:

- **Activity modification**: Reduce repetitive gripping or vibration exposure [^113hikGE] [^111b2Tns].

- **NSAIDs**: Oral or topical agents for pain and inflammation [^113hikGE].

- **Splinting**: Nighttime MCP extension splints for 6 weeks; effective in mild, recent-onset cases [^113Zp1KW].

---

## Corticosteroid injections

Corticosteroid injections are a **common first-line treatment** [^111b2Tns] [^114hbm8V], with success rates of 66–80% after one injection [^115hSwZJ] and 79–80% following a second [^113HwnKX]. They are less effective in patients with diabetes and in severe disease [^115GqP39], and may cause transient hyperglycemia, skin atrophy, and rare tendon rupture [^1159XUbH] [^114Unx9u].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgery is **indicated for refractory cases**, severe triggering, or patient preference [^111b2Tns]. Open and percutaneous releases have similar success (96–99%), with percutaneous release offering faster recovery and fewer wound complications. Risks include infection, nerve injury, and recurrence [^112L3Xbr] [^111g8VqJ].

---

## Emerging and adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive options include hyaluronic acid injections, physical therapy, and ultrasound-guided procedures; however, **evidence is limited** [^115D3UtN] [^112w2e9E] [^116ehLut].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Treatment decisions should consider **severity, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes), occupation, and preferences** [^111b2Tns]. Shared decision-making **improves satisfaction and outcomes**.

---

Trigger finger treatment spans conservative care, injections, and surgery, with the **choice guided by severity, comorbidities, and patient preference** [^111b2Tns].

### Night splinting for idiopathic trigger digits [^113Zp1KW]. Hand (2018). Low credibility.

This study assessed nighttime splinting for 6 weeks as a treatment for recent onset idiopathic trigger fingers.

- **Methods**: Patients over 18 years with a Quinnell grade 1 or 2, idiopathic trigger finger or thumb causing symptoms for less than 3 months were eligible for a custom-made hand-based orthoplast night orthotic. Improvement of symptoms and/or resolution of triggering were recorded. Patients also completed the short version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and a numerical rating scale for pain at the initial visit, after 6 to 8 weeks, and after 3 months.

- **Results**: Thirty-four patients wore a night orthotic for at least 6 weeks. At final evaluation, there was a substantial reduction in disability and pain. Symptoms of triggering resolved completely in 18 patients (55%). Sixteen patients did not resolve their triggering after splinting and therefore underwent a steroid injection.

- **Conclusion**: Night splinting is a noninvasive treatment option for idiopathic trigger fingers/thumb with symptoms for less than 3 months.

### Corticosteroid injection therapy for trigger finger or thumb: a retrospective review of 577 digits [^114hbm8V]. Hand (2013). Low credibility.

Stenosing flexor tenosynovitis of the digital flexor tendon, commonly referred to as trigger digit, is frequently encountered by hand surgeons. Our study aimed to determine the efficacy of corticosteroid injections and to review the demographic profile of patients with trigger digits.

- **Methods**: We reviewed records of 362 patients, comprising 577 trigger digits, who were treated with steroid injections (8 mg of triamcinolone acetonide in 1% lidocaine) from 1998 through 2011. The average follow-up period, from intervention to the last visit, was 66.4 months. We assessed patient demographics, including gender, age, diabetes mellitus, hand dominance, and trigger digit distribution, and determined the recurrence rate and duration of injection efficacy. If one injection failed, patients were offered additional injections or surgical A1 pulley release. Results were analyzed using Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test, with significance set at p < 0.05.

- **Results**: Women (258, 71.3%) were significantly more affected (p < 0.001) than men (104, 28.7%) and at a significantly younger age (average, 58.3 versus 62.1 years, respectively; p < 0.001). Eighty patients (22.1%) were diabetic. No correlation was observed between trigger digit and hand dominance. The most commonly affected digits were the right long finger (17.8%) and right thumb (17.7%). For 721 injections, the recurrence rate was 20.3%, with no major complications observed. For recurrences, the average duration of injection efficacy was 315 days. Surgery was required for 117 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Injection therapy is both safe and highly effective, with an effectiveness rate of 79.7%. Women were more frequently affected by trigger digits compared to men.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for trigger finger [^113hikGE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is a common hand condition that occurs when movement of a finger flexor tendon through the first annular (A1) pulley is impaired by degeneration, inflammation, and swelling. This causes pain and restricted movement of the affected finger. Non-surgical treatment options include activity modification, oral and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), splinting, and local injections with anti-inflammatory drugs.

- **Objectives**: To review the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus placebo, glucocorticoids, or different NSAIDs administered by the same route for trigger finger.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, www. ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO trials portal until 30 September 2020. We applied no language or publication status restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials of adult participants with trigger finger that compared NSAIDs administered topically, orally, or by injection versus placebo, glucocorticoid, or different NSAIDs administered by the same route.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two or more review authors independently screened the reports, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and GRADE certainty of evidence. The seven major outcomes were resolution of trigger finger symptoms, persistent moderate or severe symptoms, recurrence of symptoms, total active range of finger motion, residual pain, and patient satisfaction.

### Trigger digits: Principles, management, and complications [^115qdw98]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis, or trigger finger, is a condition commonly seen by hand surgeons. This issue is generally caused by a size mismatch between the flexor tendon and the first annular (A-1) pulley. Conservative management includes splinting, corticosteroid injection, and other adjuvant modalities. Surgical treatment consists of releasing the A-1 pulley by open or percutaneous techniques. Complications are rare but may include bowstringing, digital nerve injury, and continued triggering. Some patients require more extensive procedures to reduce the size of the flexor tendon. Comorbid conditions affect how trigger finger is treated. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis require tenosynovectomy instead of an A-1 pulley release. In children, trigger thumb resolves reliably with A-1 pulley release, but other digits may require more extensive surgery. In diabetic patients, trigger finger often is less responsive to conservative measures. An understanding of the pathomechanics, risk factors, and varied treatments for trigger finger is essential for appropriate care.

### Open versus percutaneous fixation of trigger finger: Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes [^111au7Vj]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). High credibility.

With variable and conflicting results at the time of writing, it remains unclear whether the percutaneous or open surgical A1 pulley release technique is superior regarding safety and efficacy. The goal of this meta-analysis was to compare the two techniques.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar (pages 1–20) were searched through August 2023. Eight randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Of the eight included studies and 548 total patients, there were 278 subjects in the percutaneous release group and 270 subjects in the open release group. There was no significant difference between the two surgical techniques in postoperative rates of revision, complications, or pain.

- **Conclusions**: This meta-analysis found no significant difference between open and percutaneous techniques regarding the need for revision procedures, complications, or postoperative pain. Therefore, both open and percutaneous releases are appropriate.

Therapeutic I level of evidence.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "successful" hand procedures [^114rFGu1]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Similarly, surgical trigger finger release has a wide range of reported success rates. In 1988, Thorpe reported a 60% "success rate", defined by a lack of triggering, in 43 patients followed for an average of 47 months. This was followed by a 1997 report from Turowski et al reporting a 97% success rate in 75 patients who underwent surgical trigger finger release and were followed for an average of 48 months. Satisfaction was defined as complete resolution of symptoms, while dissatisfaction was defined as partial or lack of improvement in symptoms. The 84% willingness to repeat surgery rate in our study population fell between the reported satisfaction rates of these two studies.

Overall, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure satisfaction after many common hand procedures, leading to wide variability in quoted rates. The data available are also not generalizable, as most studies are based on a small cohort with procedures performed by a single surgeon. As a result, surgeons may either share estimates of satisfaction rates hindered by their own recall and recency biases, or instead discuss complication rates as a surrogate for satisfaction. Complication rates do not tell the whole story, however, as patients can be unsatisfied for numerous reasons which may not be clear to the surgeon despite not being considered to have any identifiable complication. A recent study of wrist arthroplasty found that the procedure had a high satisfaction rate (87%) despite also having a high complication rate (29%). Studies in plastic surgery have further demonstrated this lack of consensus.

### A comparison of patient characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving flexor digitorum superficialis slip excision or isolated A1 pulley release for trigger finger [^111pud97]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Resection of the radial or ulnar slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon is a known treatment option for persistent trigger finger. However, risk factors for undergoing FDS slip excision are unclear. We hypothesized that patients who underwent A1 pulley release with FDS slip excision secondary to persistent triggering would have a higher comorbidity burden compared to those receiving A1 pulley release alone.

We identified all adult patients who underwent A1 pulley release with FDS slip excision because of persistent triggering, either intraoperatively or postoperatively, from 2018 to 2023. A 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group who underwent isolated A1 pulley release was selected. Charts were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, selected comorbidities, trigger finger history, and postoperative course. We performed multivariable logistic regression to assess the probability of FDS slip excision after adjusting for several variables that were significant in bivariate comparisons.

We identified 48 patients who underwent A1 pulley release with FDS slip excision and 144 controls. Our multivariable model showed that patients with additional trigger fingers and a preoperative proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture were significantly more likely to undergo FDS slip excision.

Patients who underwent A1 pulley release with FDS slip excision were significantly more likely to have multiple trigger fingers or a preoperative PIP joint contracture. Clinicians should counsel patients with these risk factors regarding the potential for FDS slip excision.

### Surgery for trigger finger [^115kaBnW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018).

Trigger finger is a common clinical disorder characterized by pain and catching as the patient flexes and extends the digits due to a disproportion between the diameter of flexor tendons and the A1 pulley. The treatment approach may include non-surgical or surgical treatments. Currently, there is no consensus about the best surgical treatment approach, whether open, percutaneous, or endoscopic.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different methods of surgical treatment for trigger finger — open, percutaneous, or endoscopic approaches — in adults at any stage of the disease.

- **Search methods**: A comprehensive search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS databases up to August 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials were included, assessing adults with trigger finger and comparing any type of surgical treatment with each other or with any other non-surgical intervention. The major outcomes considered were the resolution of trigger finger, pain, hand function, participant-reported treatment success or satisfaction, recurrence of triggering, adverse events, and neurovascular injury.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the trial reports, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. Measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes included calculating risk ratios (RRs) and for continuous outcomes, mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When possible, data were pooled into a meta-analysis using the random-effects model and GRADE was used to assess the quality of evidence.

### Injections of the hand and wrist: Part I. Trigger finger, first carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, and palmar fibromatosis [^116PnLw9]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients who have pain due to hand and finger conditions, especially when initial treatments such as splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are ineffective. Corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief; however, potential risks such as infection, cartilage damage, and skin depigmentation should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Corticosteroid injections for stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) can be performed with or without ultrasound guidance. To maximize benefits of corticosteroid injection for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other conservative treatment modalities should be used concurrently. Because of the risks of disease recurrence and adverse effects, corticosteroid injections for palmar fibromatosis should be approached with caution in the context of shared decision-making.

### Trigger finger corticosteroid injection with and without local anesthetic: A randomized, double-blind controlled trial [^112pCgMd]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

The first-line treatment for trigger finger is a corticosteroid injection. Although the injectable solution is often prepared with a local anesthetic, we hypothesize that patients receiving an injection with anesthetic will experience more pain at the time of injection.

- **Methods**: Patients with trigger finger were prospectively randomized into two cohorts to receive triamcinolone (1 mL, 40 mg) plus 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1 mL) or triamcinolone (1 mL, 40 mg) plus normal saline (1 mL, placebo). Both patient and surgeon were blinded to the treatment arm. The primary outcome was pain measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately following the injection.

- **Results**: Seventy-three patients with a total of 110 trigger fingers were enrolled (57 lidocaine with epinephrine and 53 placebo). Immediate post-injection pain scores were significantly higher for injections containing lidocaine with epinephrine compared with placebo (VAS 3.5 vs. 2.0). In the treatment of trigger finger, corticosteroid injections are effective and have relatively little associated pain. This study shows there is more injection-associated pain when lidocaine with epinephrine is included with the corticosteroid.

Therefore, surgeons looking to decrease injection pain should exclude the anesthetic, but they should discuss the trade-off of foregoing short-term anesthesia with patients. Using only a single drug (i.e. corticosteroid alone) is not only less painful but also more simple, efficient, and safe; this has therefore become our preferred treatment method.

### Corticosteroid injection with and without local anesthetic for the treatment of trigger finger: A randomized clinical trial [^115RsBF5]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to report pain during and following injection for trigger finger, as well as failure to resolve triggering. We hypothesized that a corticosteroid injection alone would be equally or less painful compared with the standard combination of corticosteroid and lidocaine for the treatment of trigger fingers, and there would be no difference in the resolution of triggering.

- **Methods**: Our study was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial at a single institution, comprising 76 patients with a diagnosis of trigger finger. Each treatment group consisted of 38 patients. Patients were randomized to receive either a betamethasone (1 mL, 6 mg) injection without lidocaine or a betamethasone injection (1 mL, 6 mg) with 1% lidocaine (1 mL). Patients were assessed during injection and at 1 hour, 6 hours, 2 days, and 6 weeks after the injection. The primary outcome was pain measured using a numerical rating scale. The secondary outcome was the rate of failure to resolve symptoms at 6 weeks.

- **Results**: There was a statistically significant difference in pain scores between the lidocaine and betamethasone versus betamethasone-only injections during administration (4.6 vs. 6.2) and after 1 hour (1.3 vs. 2.5). There was no statistically significant difference in pain scores after 6 hours (1.5 vs. 2.0) and 2 days (0.7 vs. 0.6) or in failure rate at the 6-week time point (21% vs. 18%).

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that there is a statistically significant difference in pain during and shortly after injection when using a steroid with lidocaine versus steroid alone.

### Comparing the intensity of pain and incidence of flare reaction following trigger finger injections using betamethasone and methylprednisolone: A double-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^112jJWeK]. Hand (2025). High credibility.

Considerable evidence supports corticosteroid injection as an effective treatment for trigger finger. One common side effect, the flare reaction, is a well-documented phenomenon of increased pain following steroid injections. Its incidence and intensity may be related to steroid composition. The purpose of this study was to determine whether betamethasone and methylprednisolone injections for trigger fingers have differing intensity of pain or incidence of flare reaction.

- **Methods**: Patients with symptomatic trigger finger were recruited during their hand surgery visits. They were randomized into two treatment groups: betamethasone (40 mg) and methylprednisolone (6 mg) mixed with 1% lidocaine. Treatment group assignment was blinded to the patients and investigators. Visual analog scale pain measurements were taken prior to injection, 5 minutes post-injection, and daily thereafter for 7 days.

- **Results**: Sixty-four patients were randomized into the two treatment groups. Patients in the betamethasone group reported slightly higher baseline pain compared with the methylprednisolone group, but lower pain on day 1. None of the following days showed a statistically significant difference.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of flare and severe flare reactions of betamethasone injections for trigger finger management was roughly double that of methylprednisolone, but this difference was not statistically significant. Further studies are required to evaluate the relative course of non-flare post-injection pain for different corticosteroid injections for trigger finger injections.

### The feasibility and usability of a ranking tool to elicit patient preferences for the treatment of trigger finger [^112LrAeV]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Shared decision making is an approach where physicians and patients collaborate to make decisions based on patient values. This requires eliciting patients' preferences for each treatment attribute before making decisions; a structured process for preference elicitation does not exist in hand surgery. We tested the feasibility and usability of a ranking tool to elicit patient preferences for the treatment of trigger finger and hypothesized that the tool would be usable and feasible at the point of care.

- **Methods**: Thirty patients with a trigger finger without prior treatment were recruited from a hand surgery clinic. A preference elicitation tool was created that presented three treatment options (surgical release, injection, and therapy and orthosis) and described attributes of each treatment extracted from a literature review (e.g. success rate, complications). We presented these attributes to patients using the tool, and patients ranked the relative importance (preference) of these attributes to aid in their decision making. The System Usability Scale and tool completion time were used to evaluate usability and feasibility, respectively.

- **Results**: The tool demonstrated excellent usability (System Usability Scale: 88.7) with a mean completion time of 3.05 minutes. Five (16.7%) patients chose surgery, 20 (66.7%) chose an injection, and 5 (16.7%) chose therapy and orthosis. Patients ranked treatment success and cost as the most and least important attributes, respectively. Twenty-nine (96.7%) patients were very to extremely satisfied with the tool.

### Utility of patient-reported outcomes in prognosis of corticosteroid injection treatment success for trigger finger and de Quervain's stenosing tenosynovitis [^116NPfvK]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections are a first-line treatment for trigger finger and de Quervain's tenosynovitis. However, little research has evaluated pre-injection patient-reported outcomes as predictive factors for treatment success following corticosteroid injection. We hypothesized that patients with less pretreatment impairment would demonstrate greater post-treatment improvement than those whose function was more severely impaired.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity (UE) scores in patients undergoing corticosteroid injection for trigger finger or de Quervain's tenosynovitis from 2017 to 2023. Independent variables included patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and baseline PROMIS UE scores. The primary outcome was treatment success between 30 days and 12 weeks, defined as achieving the minimal clinically important difference for PROMIS UE without undergoing surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 240 trigger finger and 74 de Quervain's tenosynovitis patients (N = 314) were analyzed. Following injection, 63 (20.1%) patients achieved treatment success, 86 (27.4%) underwent surgical release, and 165 (52.5%) did not significantly improve function or undergo surgery. Each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE was associated with 10% lower odds of treatment success (P < .001). Among nonoperative patients, each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE was associated with a 0.51-point decrease in PROMIS UE score (P < .001) and diabetes was associated with a 2.74-point decrease in scores.

### Does orthosis improve outcomes of conservative treatment in trigger fingers? A 3-arm prospective randomized controlled trial [^116D5tGL]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate whether the addition of an orthosis improves the efficacy of cortisone injection for the nonoperative management of trigger finger, a block randomized controlled trial was conducted.

The study was set in an outpatient hand clinic. Individuals aged 18–80 with Green severity grade 1–3 trigger finger, who were not previously treated with a splint or cortisone injection, and with no trigger thumb, more than two digits involved, grade 4 trigger, or an allergy to cortisone, were eligible for inclusion (N = 226). The final sample included 104 patients, representing 122 trigger fingers in 115 hands, with an average follow-up of 29 months.

- **Interventions**: Patients' hands were randomized to nighttime extension orthosis, cortisone injection, or combined treatment, stratified by Green severity score and comorbid diabetes.

- **Main outcome measures**: Patient-reported outcome measures and the number of triggering occurrences with 10 repeated grips were collected at 6 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results showed no significant difference at 6 weeks in the incidence of triggering, symptom relief, or the Patient-Reported Wrist and Hand Evaluation score between the injection and combined treatment groups. The overall success rate with conservative treatment was high, with 68.9% experiencing resolution or improvement of their symptoms. However, grade 3 trigger fingers had a significantly higher rate of surgical release compared with lower-grade trigger fingers (39.1% vs. 22.4%, P = 0.05).

Our study indicates no significant benefit of adding an orthosis to cortisone injection for managing trigger finger conservatively.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^114xgdSS]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The mainstay of trigger finger treatment is a corticosteroid injection of the affected digits and is associated with a very high success rate. However, some patients do not respond to nonsurgical management and undergo subsequent surgical release. The purpose of this study is to investigate the comorbidities that predispose patients to progressing from injection to surgical release.

- **Methods**: Patient data were obtained from a national insurance database. All patients aged 20 years or older who underwent trigger digit injection were included. Any injection that did not specify the digit was excluded. Subsequent procedures, including repeat injection and surgical release, were identified using relevant Procedural Terminology codes. A multivariate model was constructed to evaluate potential risk factors for requiring release after prior injection of the same digit. Stepwise backward selection was used to retain significant variables.

- **Results**: A total of 42,537 trigger digits were identified in 31,830 patients, most of whom were female. The right hand was affected more commonly than the left. The middle and ring fingers were the most commonly affected digits. Over 80% of all trigger digits underwent only a single injection, and approximately 90% of injected digits did not require subsequent release. In the multivariate model, factors associated with higher risk of release were male sex, involvement of additional digits, multiple injections of the same digit, chronic pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, obesity, alcohol abuse, and depression.

### Patient-perceived outcomes of recovery after trigger digit release [^111FT1Qt]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Trigger finger release (TFR) is one of the most commonly performed hand surgeries; nevertheless, the time until patients subjectively feel recovered has not been well documented. The limited literature on patient perceptions of recovery after any type of surgery has described that patients and surgeons may have differing views on the time until full recovery. Our primary study question was to determine how long it takes for patients to subjectively feel fully recovered after TFR.

In this prospective study, patients who underwent isolated TFR completed questionnaires before surgery and at multiple time points following surgery until they reported full recovery. Patients completed visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and QuickDASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) and were asked if they felt fully recovered at 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

The average time to self-reported full recovery was 6.2 months (SD 2.6), and the median time to self-reported full recovery was 6 months (IQR 4 months). At 12 months, four out of 50 patients (8%) did not feel fully recovered. QuickDASH and VAS pain scores improved significantly from preoperative assessment to final follow-up. All patients reported improvement in both VAS pain scores and QuickDASH scores greater than the minimal clinically important difference between 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Higher preoperative VAS and QuickDASH scores were associated with failure to fully recover by 12 months after surgery.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^115Z2keH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the digits, also known as trigger finger, is a common tendinopathy in the hand, with a recent reported prevalence of approximately 1%. Normal digit flexion requires the flexor tendons to smoothly glide through a pulley system. This phenomenon is facilitated by the presence of a double synovial sheath within the pulley system. Triggering can occur when inflammation contributes to a size discrepancy of the retinacular sheath and the flexor tendons. The exact etiology of trigger finger is still unknown, although it is thought to be multifactorial. Presenting symptoms can vary. Although many patients will complain of triggering, clicking, or catching of the involved digit, some patients may only complain of pain at the level of the A1 pulley or report the presence of a painful nodule over the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Initial management of trigger finger is often nonsurgical and can involve careful observation alone, activity modification, oral NSAIDs, splinting, corticosteroid injections, or NSAID injections. Some studies advocate for splinting alone as first-line treatment (especially for patients complaining of morning stiffness), with up to 66% of patients needing no further treatment at one year. Corticosteroid injections are also frequently used as first-line nonsurgical therapy due to their ease of use, low risk, and excellent treatment response, with complete symptom relief reported in 60% to 90% of patients. Open or percutaneous surgical release is a treatment option for patients with continued symptoms despite nonsurgical treatment.

### Trigger finger treatment: Identifying predictors of nonadherence and cost [^112expvW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Evidence-based practices in medicine are linked with higher quality of care and lower healthcare costs. For trigger finger, identifying patient factors associated with nonadherence to evidence-based practices will aid physicians in treatment decisions. The objectives were to determine patient factors associated with treatment nonadherence, examine the success rates of steroid injections, and evaluate the economic consequences of nonadherence to treatment recommendations.

- **Methods**: The authors used data from the Clinformatics DataMart database from 2010 to 2017 to conduct a population-based analysis of patients with single-digit trigger finger. They calculated rates of steroid injection success and examined associations between injection success and patient factors using chi-square tests. In addition, they analyzed differences in the cost to the insurer, the cost to the patient, and the total cost.

- **Results**: A total of 29,722 patients were included in this analysis. Injection success rates were similar for diabetic (72 percent) and nondiabetic patients (73 percent), as well as women (73 percent) and men (73 percent). Nonetheless, diabetics (OR, 1.4; 95 percent CI, 1.4 to 1.5; p < 0.001) and women (OR, 1.2; 95 percent CI, 1.1 to 1.2; p < 0.001) were significantly more likely to receive nonadherent treatment. In total, $23 million (U.S. dollars) were spent on nonadherent trigger finger care.

- **Conclusions**: Diabetics and women have increased odds of having surgery without a prior steroid injection, despite similar success rates of steroid injections.

### Effectiveness of interventions of specific complaints of the arm, neck, and/or shoulder: 3 musculoskeletal disorders of the hand. An update [^116ehLut]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

To provide an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of conservative and surgical interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases, several data sources were searched. These included the Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL.

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potentially relevant studies from titles and abstracts retrieved in the literature search. Relevant Cochrane reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.

Two reviewers also independently extracted the data and performed a methodological quality assessment. A best-evidence synthesis summarized the results of the included trials. The review included one Cochrane review on trigger finger and 13 RCTs: 6 on trigger finger, 4 on Dupuytren's, and 3 on De Quervain's diseases. The trials examined various treatments, including physiotherapy for De Quervain's, steroid injections for trigger finger and De Quervain's, surgical treatment for trigger finger and De Quervain's, as well as postsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's.

For trigger finger, moderate evidence was found for the short-term effectiveness (1–4 weeks) of steroid injections, but not for long-term outcomes. Limited evidence was found regarding the effectiveness of using staples compared to sutures for skin closure, and for intermittent compression after surgery to treat Dupuytren's disease. No evidence was found for other interventions.

Indications for the effectiveness of some interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases were reported.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^115hSwZJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Of the 158,705 patients with a diagnosis of trigger finger or trigger thumb in the database, 131,344 had a 1-year follow-up. From this group, a total of 31,751 patients met our inclusion criteria and were identified in the database. Of those patients, 1,009 (3.2%) had surgery within 1 year, 9,681 (30.5%) had a subsequent injection within 6 months, and 21,061 (66.3%) did not undergo subsequent treatment.

- **Figures**:
	- **Figure 1**: Flow diagram illustrating the outcomes of one, two, and three injections.
	- **Figure 2**: Pie charts illustrating the patients with success (blue), injection (grey), and surgery (orange) among those who received one (top), two (middle), and three (bottom) injections.

Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, obesity (univariate: OR 1.3, P < 0.0001; multivariate: OR 1.2, P < 0.0001), tobacco use (univariate: OR 1.2, P < 0.0001; multivariate: OR 1.2, P < 0.0001), carpal tunnel (univariate: OR 1.5, P < 0.0001; multivariate: OR 1.4, P < 0.0001), and hypothyroidism (univariate: OR 1.1, P = 0.045; multivariate: OR 1.1, P = 0.039) were found to be significantly associated with increased risk for failure of initial injection. The factors of age older than 65 years (univariate: OR 0.82, P < 0.0001; multivariate: OR 0.86, P < 0.0001) and ischemic heart disease (univariate: OR 0.94, P = 0.024; multivariate: OR 0.94, P = 0.037) were significantly associated with decreased risk for failure of the first injection. Diabetes was also associated with decreased risk for failure of the first injection in the univariate analysis.

### Finger movement function after ultrasound-guided percutaneous pulley release for trigger finger: Effects of postoperative rehabilitation [^112w2e9E]. Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop and test a postoperative rehabilitation protocol for individuals with trigger finger undergoing ultrasound-guided percutaneous pulley release.

- **Design**: Nonrandomized controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Hospital and local community.

- **Participants**: Individuals suffering from trigger finger with joint contracture (N = 21) were recruited and grouped into an intervention group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 12).

- **Interventions**: All the participants underwent the same surgical procedure performed by the same surgeon. A 4-week postoperative rehabilitation program was designed based on the wound healing process. The intervention group received postoperative rehabilitation after the surgery, whereas the control group received no treatment after the surgery.

- **Main outcome measures**: The finger movement functions were quantitatively evaluated before and 1 month after the surgery using a 3-dimensional motion capture system. The fingertip workspace and joint range of motion (ROM) were evaluated while the participant was performing a sequential 5-posture movement, including finger extension, intrinsic plus, straight fist, full fist, and hook fist.

- **Results**: The intervention group demonstrated significantly more improvements than the control group in the fingertip workspace (49% vs 17%), ROM of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint (16% vs 4%), ROM of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (21% vs 5%), and total active ROM (17% vs 5%).

Conclusions indicate that this pilot study evaluated a postoperative rehabilitation protocol for trigger finger, demonstrating its effects on various aspects of finger movement.

### Determining the optimal dosage of corticosteroid injection in trigger finger [^116SAnLV]. Hand (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroid injection is the mainstay of nonoperative treatment for trigger finger (stenosing tenosynovitis), but despite substantial experience with this treatment, there is minimal available evidence regarding the optimal corticosteroid dosing. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of three different injection dosages of triamcinolone acetonide for the treatment of trigger finger.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with a trigger finger were prospectively enrolled and treated with an initial triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) injection of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg. Patients were followed longitudinally over a 6-month period. They were assessed for duration of clinical response, clinical failure, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) scores.

- **Results**: A total of 146 patients (163 trigger fingers) were enrolled over a 26-month period. At 6-month follow-up, injections were still effective (without recurrence, secondary injection, or surgery) in 52% of the 5-mg group, 62% of the 10-mg group, and 79% of the 20-mg group. The Visual Analog Scale at final follow-up improved by 2.2 in the 5-mg group, 2.7 in the 10-mg group, and 4.5 in the 20-mg group. The QuickDASH scores at final follow-up improved by 11.8 in the 5-mg group, 21.5 in the 10-mg group, and 28.9 in the 20-mg group.

- **Conclusions**: Minimal evidence exists to guide the optimal dosing of steroid injection in trigger digits. When compared with 5-mg and 10-mg doses, a 20-mg dose was found to have a significantly higher rate of clinical effectiveness.

### Corticosteroid injections in the treatment of trigger finger: A level I and II systematic review [^1157oKQ4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). High credibility.

Trigger finger is tendinitis, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, with multiple management approaches. We conducted an evidence-based medicine systematic review of level I and II prospective randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroid injection in managing trigger finger. MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and secondary references were reviewed to locate all English-language prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating trigger finger treatment.

Four studies using injectable corticosteroids were identified based on the following inclusion criteria: all were prospective randomized controlled trials of adults with more than 85% follow-up. This review indicates that the incidence of trigger finger is greatest in women (75%) with an average patient age range of 52 to 62 years. Combined analysis of these four studies shows that corticosteroid injections are effective in 57% of patients.

### Long-term outcomes following a single corticosteroid injection for trigger finger [^1152VMzx]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

The outcomes of corticosteroid injection for trigger finger are well documented only with short-term follow-up. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the long-term effectiveness of a single injection and to examine predictors of success up to ten years after injection.

- **Methods**: This case series analyzed 366 first-time corticosteroid injections in flexor tendon sheaths from January 2000 to December 2007 with a minimum follow-up duration of five years. Two hundred and forty patients (66%) were female, 161 patients (44%) had multiple trigger fingers, and eighty-eight patients (24%) had diabetes at the time of injection. The primary outcome of treatment failure was defined as subsequent injection or surgical trigger finger release of the affected digit. Medical records were reviewed, and any patients without documented failure or a return office visit in 2012 to 2013 were contacted by telephone regarding symptom recurrence and the need for additional treatment. Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank test and Cox regression analysis assessed the effect of baseline patient and disease characteristics on injection success.

- **Results**: Forty-five percent of patients demonstrated long-term treatment success following a single injection. In the final regression model, the interaction of sex and the number of trigger fingers was the single predictor of treatment success. Exploring this association revealed a ten-year success rate of 56% for female patients presenting for the first time with a trigger finger compared with 35% in male patients.

### Comparison of 1-year outcome among different low dosage triamcinolone acetonide injections for trigger finger [^11536R2a]. Hand (2024). High credibility.

This study was designed to compare the 1-year outcome among the groups with different low-dosage triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injections for trigger finger.

- **Methods**: During the study period, trigger digits were initially injected with 2, 4, or 8 mg of TA. We checked whether they had a second injection or surgery during the following year through either patients' revisit or telephone interview. The groups with different injections were compared according to recurrence and symptom relief period. We also assessed the 6-week outcome to confirm short-term improvement.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-eight digits were enrolled. About 60% of the injected fingers required additional treatment in each group, without significant difference. The interval between the initial injection and additional treatment in recurring cases averaged 5 months in the 2 and 4 mg TA groups, extending to a short term of 1.5 months in the 8 mg TA group. All groups showed significant improvement in the patients' clinical severity 6 weeks after injection, with no differences among the groups. There were no adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: Low-dosage TA injection for trigger finger within 8 mg yielded satisfactory results, not inferior to those with higher dosages up to 40 mg when compared with previous reports. Our findings implied that increasing the TA dosage might bring short-term extended symptom relief. However, it did not reduce recurrence. While not offering significant benefit, lower dosage TA injections for trigger finger can be chosen, aiming for cost-effectiveness and safety.

### Treatment of trigger finger: Randomized clinical trial comparing the methods of corticosteroid injection, percutaneous release and open surgery [^114DXRGh]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroid (CS) injection, percutaneous pulley release, and conventional open surgery for treating trigger finger in terms of cure, relapse, and complication rates.

One hundred and thirty-seven patients with a total of 150 fingers were randomly assigned and allocated into one of the treatment groups, with treatments assigned to 150 opaque and sealed envelopes. We included patients over 15 years of age with a trigger on any finger of the hand (Types II-IV) and used a minimum follow-up time of 6 months. The primary outcome measures were cures, relapses, and failures.

Forty-nine patients were assigned to the conservative group to undergo CS injections, whereas 45 and 56 were assigned to undergo percutaneous release and outpatient open surgery, respectively. The trigger cure rate for patients in the injection method group was 57%, and wherever necessary, two injections were administered, which increased the cure rate to 86%. For the percutaneous and open release methods, remission of the trigger was achieved in all cases.

The percutaneous and open surgery methods displayed similar effectiveness and proved superior to the conservative CS method regarding the trigger cure and relapse rates. Trial registration: Controlled Trials, http://www.controlled-trials.com/, ISRCTN19255926.

### Do not rush to return to sports after trigger finger injection [^114Unx9u]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Trigger finger, or digital stenosing tenosynovitis, is a common hand problem. A widely accepted treatment is steroid injection into the flexor tendon sheath, which can cause rupture of the flexor tendon. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on tendon rupture following a single corticosteroid injection. Moreover, there are no guidelines for patients with tendinopathy who want to return to sports after corticosteroid injection. Clinicians who perform local steroid injections for tendinopathy treatment should be aware of the possible dangers of tendon rupture and should confirm that steroids are not administered into the tendon. Patients should also be warned about returning to sports prematurely and should be encouraged to gradually resume sports after the injection to prevent further damage. Herein, we report an unusual case of flexor digitorum profundus rupture following a single corticosteroid injection in a 57-year-old male golfer, and we also present a review of the literature.

### Trigger finger release using wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet versus local anesthesia with a tourniquet: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nVUBE]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Trigger finger (TF) is a widespread and potentially debilitating condition characterized by clicking and locking of an affected finger during tendon excursion, caused by a size discrepancy between the flexor tendon sheath and annular pulley. The lifetime prevalence of TF is 2.6% in the general population and is even higher in patients with risk factors such as diabetes mellitus. Currently, TF is one of the most common indications for referral to a hand surgery clinic and a major cause of hand pain and disability.

Operative treatment is routinely performed and is regarded as the gold standard for definitive TF resolution. Historically, trigger finger release (TFR) involved the administration of local anesthesia for analgesic effects as well as a tourniquet to achieve hemostasis. Although effective at producing hemostatic effects, tourniquets have the unfortunate consequence of causing patient pain, thus potentially necessitating sedation or general anesthesia due to the resulting discomfort. Besides pain, tourniquet use has additionally been associated with compression neuropathies, muscle tissue damage, and vascular injuries.

Alternatives to achieving hemostasis without tourniquet use have been proposed, including the wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet (WALANT) technique popularized by Lalonde in 2005. This approach forgoes the use of a tourniquet by injecting local anesthetic with epinephrine and has been shown to be a safe and effective option for maintaining a clear surgical field. The WALANT technique is gaining popularity in upper extremity surgeries.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^117X8AUm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Of the patients who failed treatment, 9.4% of patients with one failed injection, 23.1% of patients with two failed injections, and 30.4% of patients with three failed injections elected to undergo surgery instead of continuing management with corticosteroid injections.

### Shower emboli and digital necrosis following a single corticosteroid injection for trigger thumb: Case report [^111KrTik]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Local corticosteroid injection into the hand is the preferred initial step in the management of trigger finger due to its safety and efficacy. We report the case of a patient with shower emboli and digital necrosis following a local corticosteroid injection for the treatment of trigger thumb. Given the patient's subsequent negative hypercoagulability workup, we suspect that the symptoms resulted from the injection of steroids into the princeps pollicis artery, with subsequent retrograde flow into multiple other arteries of the hand. The patient was managed conservatively, and ultimately, her symptoms resolved. No new areas of digital necrosis have appeared in 8 years of follow-up.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^114LYyWB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of single and multiple corticosteroid injections used for symptomatic trigger finger. The rates of subsequent injections and tendon sheath release are reported along with the identification of risk factors correlated with the failure of injection.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of a national healthcare database was conducted, identifying patients with a diagnosis of trigger finger or thumb. Inclusion required a tendon sheath injection on the same day or within six weeks of diagnosis. Patient cohorts were further stratified based on treatment success and those requiring additional injections within 6 months or surgery within 1 year of initial diagnosis.

- **Results**: Thirty-one thousand seven hundred fifty-one patients met inclusion criteria and underwent an initial injection within the study period. The efficacy of initial, second, and third injection was 66.3%, 79.4%, and 79.6%, respectively. Of the patients who failed an injection, 9.4% had tendon sheath release following a primary injection, 23.1% had surgery following a second injection, and 30.4% had surgery following a third injection. Only obesity (OR 1.2; P < 0.0001) and concomitant diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (OR 1.4; P < 0.0001) were found to be significant for injection failure on multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Discussion**: Overall, corticosteroid injections were effective in greater than 65% of patients. This information may help guide treatment practice because there seems to be continued additional benefit to repeat corticosteroid injections.

### Long-term effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger and thumb [^115N7wTS]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the long-term response to corticosteroid injection in the management of trigger digit.

This observational study involved a prospectively recruited series of patients with first-time diagnosis of trigger finger. Efficacy of the injections, comorbidities, digit injected, and related complications were compared and statistically analyzed.

A total of 71 digits were included in the study. The median duration of follow-up was 8 years (interquartile range of 7.0–8.3 years). At final follow-up, complete remission of symptoms was obtained in 69% of cases. There were 37 trigger thumbs (52%), with a success rate of 81% compared with 56% in the other digits. There were 11 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 16 fingers developed trigger finger after carpal tunnel syndrome surgery. No complications were found.

Steroid injections were identified as an effective first-line intervention for the treatment of trigger finger. At long-term follow-up, the success incidence may be as high as 69%. In this study, the efficacy of this treatment increased when treating the thumb compared with other digits.

### Long-term effectiveness of repeat corticosteroid injections for trigger finger [^111GNYsy]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

To quantify the long-term success of repeat injections for trigger fingers and to identify predictors of treatment outcomes, a retrospective case series was conducted. It analyzed 292 repeat corticosteroid injections for trigger fingers administered by hand surgeons at a single tertiary center between January 2010 and January 2013. Of the 187 patients, 64% were female, 48% had multiple trigger fingers, and 22% were diabetic. The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as receiving a subsequent injection or surgical treatment. Patients without documented failure or a return office visit in 2015 or 2016 were surveyed by telephone to determine if they had required subsequent treatment.

Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank testing assessed the median time to treatment failure and the effect of demographic and disease-specific characteristics on the injection success rate. Predictors of injection outcome (success vs. failure) were assessed with multivariable logistic regression.

Second injections provided long-term treatment success in 39% (111 of 285) of cases, with 86 receiving an additional injection and 108 ultimately undergoing surgical release. Thirty-nine percent (24 of 62) of third injections resulted in long-term success, with 22 receiving an additional injection and 23 ultimately undergoing surgery. Median times-to-failure for second and third injections were 371 and 407 days, respectively. Success curves did not differ significantly according to any patient or disease factor.

### Corticosteroid injection for trigger finger in adults [^116QNeEb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is a disease of the tendons of the hand leading to triggering (locking) of affected fingers, dysfunction, and pain. Available treatments include local injection with corticosteroids, surgery, or splinting.

- **Objectives**: To summarize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults using the following endpoints: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, functional status of the affected fingers, and severity of pain of the fingers.

- **Search strategy**: The databases CENTRAL, DARE, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1956 to November 2007), CINAHL (1982 to November 2007), AMED (1985 to November 2007), and PEDro (a physiotherapy evidence database) were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized and controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The databases were searched for titles of eligible studies. After screening abstracts of these studies, full-text articles of studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were obtained. Data were extracted using a predefined electronic form. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed using items from the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We planned to extract data regarding information on the primary outcome measures: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, functional impairment of fingers, and severity of the trigger finger; and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with a successful treatment outcome.

### Trigger finger release using wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet versus local anesthesia with a tourniquet: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112zMEEY]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

The existing evidence appears to suggest that trigger finger release (TFR) under wide-awake local anesthesia with no tourniquet (WALANT), compared with local anesthesia with a tourniquet (LAWT), shows statistically nonsignificant improvements in pain on injection and statistically significantly decreased postoperative pain. A narrative summary of the evidence found higher patient and physician satisfaction scores, lower analgesic use, and no difference in functional outcomes or rates of adverse events using WALANT.

Preoperative time was statistically significantly longer, operative time was similar, postoperative recovery time was statistically significantly shorter, and procedure cost was lower in WALANT compared with LAWT. However, the moderate to high risk of bias in included studies, as well as limitations to cost calculations and generalizability of the results, ultimately diminishes the level of certainty in this evidence.

Overall, the existing randomized and observational study evidence does not establish the superiority of the WALANT approach over LAWT. Thus, the definitive answer can only be ascertained on the execution of further robust studies.

### Surgical treatment of the pediatric trigger finger [^113MmcCA]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this investigation is to assess the efficacy of a standardized surgical technique in the treatment of symptomatic trigger fingers in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was performed on 18 consecutive patients with 23 trigger fingers treated at our institution between 1996 and 2006. The average age at the time of presentation was 4.5 years (range, 1–12 years). Involved digits included 2 index, 12 long, 3 ring, and 6 small fingers. All patients underwent surgical treatment consisting of A1 pulley release and resection of a single slip of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon. The average clinical follow-up evaluation was 43 months (range, 3–111 months).

- **Results**: In almost half of the cases, triggering was noted to occur at the level of the FDS tendon decussation. In 9 cases, specific tendon pathology was observed, including fusiform thickening, nodular thickening, calcific tendonitis, and cyst formation. Overall, 21 of 23 (91%) fingers demonstrated successful resolution of triggering without recurrence after surgical treatment. One patient experienced retriggering, which was successfully treated by a second procedure to resect the remaining FDS slip. Another patient was successfully treated with excision of an aberrant muscle belly from the FDS. Both of these patients remained asymptomatic after their revision procedures. No other complications were observed. All patients returned to full activities, and 17 of 18 (94%) patients were satisfied with the results of surgery at the most recent follow-up evaluation.

### Clinical variation in the treatment of trigger finger: An international survey of orthopaedic and plastic surgeons [^111UqLyF]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is a common condition affecting the hand. Therapeutic variability surrounds the management of trigger finger, especially in mild cases. The aim of this study was to survey secondary care surgeons to describe the management of trigger fingers. The steering group developed a survey for hand surgeons. Following piloting, the survey was distributed to hand surgeons in the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. A total of 713 plastic surgeons and orthopaedic surgeons were invited to participate in the online survey, and 440 (62%) surgeons completed the survey.

In both mild and moderate cases of trigger finger, steroid injection was the preferred treatment option. Open surgery was the treatment of choice for severe cases. However, there was variation in the delivery of care, including type and dosage of steroid, site of injection, interval between injections, maximum number of injections, type of incision, and treatment of patients with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. This highlights the need for a better evidence base for the treatment of trigger fingers.

### Corticosteroid injections for trigger finger [^116v8nSo]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Trigger finger is a disease of the tendons of the hand that leads to triggering (locking) of affected fingers, dysfunction, and pain. Available treatments include local injection with corticosteroids, surgery, or splinting.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults using the following endpoints: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, functional status of the affected fingers, and severity of pain of the fingers.

- **Search strategy**: The databases CENTRAL, DARE, Medline (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1956 to November 2007), CINAHL (1982 to November 2007), AMED (1985 to November 2007), and PEDro (a physiotherapy evidence database) were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: The authors selected randomized and controlled clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The databases were searched for titles of eligible studies. After screening abstracts of these studies, full-text articles of studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were obtained. Data were extracted using a predefined electronic form. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed using items from the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. The authors planned to extract data regarding the primary outcome measures: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, functional impairment of fingers, and severity of the trigger finger.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^115XDuVR]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2023). High credibility.

Of the 8,121 patients who received a second injection within 6 months, 386 (4.8%) patients had surgery within 1 year of diagnosis, 1,284 (15.8%) obtained an additional injection within 6 months of diagnosis, and 6,451 patients (79.4%) did not undergo further treatment (Figure 2).

- **Univariate and multivariate analysis illustrating the effect of demographics on first injection outcomes**: In univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, only carpal tunnel (univariate: OR 1.7, P < 0.0001; multivariate: OR 1.7; P < 0.0001) was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk for failure of the second injection. By univariate analysis, obesity (univariate: OR 1.12, P = 0.018) and tobacco use (univariate: OR 1.13, P = 0.031) were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk for failure of the second injection, while age older than 65 years (univariate: OR 0.88; P = 0.011) was found to be associated with a decreased risk of second injection failure. In the multivariate analysis, hypertension (multivariate: OR 0.87, P = 0.016) was associated with a decreased risk of second injection failure.

Of the 1,002 patients who underwent a third injection within 6 months of diagnosis, 62 (6.2%) had surgery within 1 year, 142 (14.2%) received an additional injection within 6 months, and 798 (79.6%) experienced no further treatment (Figure 2).

- **Univariate and multivariate analysis illustrating the effect of demographics on second injection outcomes**: By univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, obesity (univariate: OR 1.6, P = 0.0008; multivariate: OR and statistics were provided in the excerpt.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^112aLbeT]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Our study is not the first to question the link between diabetes mellitus (DM) and trigger finger recurrence after injection. A recent, large investigation evaluated 366 trigger digits at 5 years of follow-up following a single corticosteroid injection, finding that diabetes was not a predictor for treatment success. Similarly, a retrospective study of 286 patients did not find diabetes to be a predictor of recurrence after corticosteroid injection.

In these studies and in ours, the large sample size offers the opportunity to differentiate diabetes from associated characteristics that may be confounders linked to true predictors of progression to surgical treatment. DM has been associated with multiple digit involvement. Triggering of multiple digits has been demonstrated by several studies to be a risk factor for lack of relief from nonsurgical treatment. Specifically, patients with multiple digit involvement have been shown to be 2.4 times more likely to require repeat injection. Although the effect in our patient population is slightly smaller (OR 1.64), our results support the conclusion that multiple digit involvement, not necessarily DM itself, is associated with surgical release after nonsurgical treatment. The number of times a given triggering digit was injected in patients with diabetes is presented in Supplemental Table 2.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^113HwnKX]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The rate of initial injection efficacy was 66.3%, whereas the rates of efficacy for second and third injections were 79.4% and 79.6%, respectively, suggesting that patients should consider additional corticosteroid injections after prior failure. Of the patients who failed corticosteroid management, 9.4% with an initial failed injection, 23.1% with two failed injections, and 30.4% with three failed injections decided to undergo tendon sheath incision; thus, patients are more likely to undergo surgery with each additional failed injection. Overall comorbidities do not seem to play a role in injection success rates; however, obesity and carpal tunnel may be associated with lower overall efficacy from corticosteroid treatment.

### Patient likelihood to repeat surgery after highly "successful" hand procedures [^116iHRuh]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Outcomes for routine hand procedures, such as carpal tunnel release, trigger finger release, and first dorsal compartment release, are typically reported as "highly successful" with "infrequent complications" based on classic literature. No contemporary study has utilized a large prospective registry to assess patient willingness to repeat surgery. We utilized a prospective hand registry to evaluate the proportion of patients that would repeat surgery after common hand procedures.

- **Methods**: We utilized a prospective hand surgery registry to collect postoperative patient likelihood to repeat surgery in patients undergoing surgery for 9 common hand procedures. All measures were reported at 12, 24, or 52 weeks. We analyzed the percentage of patients that would repeat the procedure for all diagnoses, as well as stratified by the most common 9 isolated diagnoses.

- **Results**: At the time of analysis, 1,905 patients met our inclusion criteria. The average percentage of patients across all procedures that would repeat surgery was 81.6%. When stratified by the most common 9 diagnoses, the percentage of patients that would repeat surgery ranged from 51.9% (ulnar nerve surgery at the elbow) up to 87.5% (endoscopic carpal tunnel release).

After undergoing routine hand procedures, a significant percentage of patients would choose not to repeat surgery. Hand surgeons can do better in setting clear and realistic preoperative expectations when counseling patients prior to even routine hand surgeries.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^113Y9Eq5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The discussion of previous studies evaluating persistent trigger digit after injection has demonstrated a success rate ranging from 40% to 90%. Our results, regarding the rate of surgical trigger finger release after injection, are consistent with these previously published studies, with slightly above 10% of the injected digits progressing to surgical release. The small finger injection was associated with a lower rate of future surgery, aligning with other studies that report ring, index, and middle fingers as independent predictors for trigger recurrence.

This is the largest study at the time of writing which evaluates risk factors and protective factors associated with progression to trigger finger release surgery after injection. A major finding of our study, in contrast to other published studies, is that neither complicated nor uncomplicated diabetes is significantly associated with requiring repeat injection or surgical release. Diabetes, particularly insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is frequently discussed as a risk factor for both an increased rate of trigger finger and decreased rates of successful treatment with corticosteroid injection. In a landmark, prospective study, IDDM was associated with a lack of response to injection alone in 124 trigger digits in 119 patients. The authors noted that the study was limited by a small number of patients with IDDM and a low number of the studied outcomes, both of which increased the chance of a false-positive error. Another small, well-designed prospective investigation found that the 30 patients with diabetes enrolled in their study were…

### Using evidence to minimize the cost of trigger finger care [^117GutkD]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Critics of U.S. health care cite both underuse and overuse of resources. With more than one-third of Americans paying for medical care out of pocket, optimizing the cost-benefit ratio of care is a high priority. Clinical trials have established the success of the different treatment options for patients who present with trigger finger. However, the economic impact of these differing strategies has not been established. The aim of this study was to perform a cost-minimization analysis to identify the least costly strategy for effective treatment of trigger finger using existing evidence in the literature.

- **Methods**: Five strategies for the treatment of trigger finger were identified:
	1. A steroid injection followed by surgical release for failure or recurrence.
	2. A steroid injection followed by a second injection for failures or recurrence, followed by definitive surgery if needed.
	3. Three steroid injections before definitive surgery if needed.
	4. Surgical release.
	5. Percutaneous release with definitive open surgery if needed.

	- **To reflect the costs, two sources of data were used**: our institution's billing charges to private payers and our institution's reimbursements from Medicare. A literature review identified median success rates of the different treatment strategies. A series of analyses was conducted to evaluate the effect of varying individual costs and success rates.

- **Results**: The second strategy is the least costly treatment of those considered in this study. The most costly treatment, surgical release, costs between 248% and 340% more than the second strategy.

### Cost of immediate surgery versus non-operative treatment for trigger finger in diabetic patients [^117188MZ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

As healthcare costs continue to rise, providers must increasingly identify and implement cost-effective practice measures without sacrificing quality of care. Corticosteroid injections are an established treatment for trigger finger; however, numerous clinical trials have documented the limited efficacy of these injections in the diabetic population. Furthermore, the most cost-effective treatment strategy for diabetic trigger finger has not been determined. The purpose of this study was to perform a decision analysis to identify the least costly strategy for effective treatment of diabetic trigger finger using existing evidence in the literature.

- **Methods**: Four treatment strategies for diabetic trigger finger were identified: (1) one steroid injection followed by surgical release, (2) two steroid injections followed by surgical release, (3) immediate surgical release in the operating room, and (4) immediate surgical release in the clinic. A literature review was conducted to determine success rates of the different treatment strategies. Costing analysis was performed using our institutional reimbursement from Medicare. One-way sensitivity and threshold analysis was utilized to determine the least costly treatment strategy.

- **Results**: The least costly treatment strategy was immediate surgical release in the clinic. In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, this strategy results in a 32% and a 39% cost reduction when compared with treatment with one or two corticosteroid injections, respectively.

### Management of pediatric trigger thumb and trigger finger [^115F9212]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Pediatric trigger thumb and trigger finger represent distinct conditions and should not be treated like adult acquired trigger finger. Over the last two decades, our understanding of the natural history of pediatric trigger thumb and the etiology and surgical management of pediatric trigger finger has improved. Pediatric trigger thumb may spontaneously resolve, although resolution may take several years. Open surgical release of the A1 pulley of the thumb is an alternative option that nearly uniformly restores thumb interphalangeal joint motion. Surgical management of pediatric trigger finger with isolated release of the A1 pulley has been associated with high recurrence rates. Awareness of the anatomic factors that may contribute to triggering in the pediatric finger and willingness to explore and address other involved components of the flexor mechanism can prevent surgical failure.

### Corticosteroid injection in diabetic patients with trigger finger. A prospective, randomized, controlled double-blinded study [^115GqP39]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

It is generally accepted that the initial treatment for trigger finger is the injection of corticosteroid into the flexor tendon sheath. In this study, the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of trigger finger in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded fashion, and the efficacy in nondiabetic patients was evaluated in a prospective, unblinded fashion.

- **Methods**: Thirty diabetic patients (thirty-five digits) and twenty-nine nondiabetic patients (twenty-nine digits) were enrolled. The nondiabetic patients were given corticosteroid injections in an unblinded manner. The cohort with diabetes was randomized into a corticosteroid group (twenty digits) or a placebo group (fifteen digits). Both of these groups were double-blinded. Additional injections, surgical intervention, and symptoms of trigger finger were recorded. Treatment success was defined as complete or nearly complete resolution of trigger finger symptoms such that surgical intervention was not required.

- **Results**: After one or two injections, twenty-five of the twenty-nine digits in the nondiabetic group had a successful outcome compared with twelve of the nineteen in the diabetic corticosteroid group (p = 0.03) and eight of the fifteen in the diabetic placebo group (p = 0.006). With the numbers studied, no significant difference was found between the diabetic groups. Surgery was performed on three of the twenty-nine digits in the nondiabetic group compared with seven of the nineteen in the diabetic corticosteroid group.

### Risk factors associated with progression to surgical release after injection of trigger digits [^111uwqQi]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our results suggest that nearly 90% of trigger digits may be successfully treated with steroid injections, whereas just over 10% of patients do not sufficiently respond to treatment with injections and undergo surgical release. Females, patients with multiple digit involvement, and patients requiring multiple injections were more likely to require surgical release. Medical comorbidities associated with increased odds of progression to surgery after injection include chronic pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDS, obesity, alcohol abuse, and depression. HIV/AIDS and alcohol abuse, in particular, demonstrated the highest odds for future release after injection. Although additional study is clearly needed on these risk factors, the data presented here can guide expectation management and treatment counseling. On the other hand, involvement of the small finger may be predictive of a better response to nonsurgical treatment. The multivariate model did not find diabetes to be a risk factor for progression to surgical care. Although injection can be the definitive treatment for many, identifying risk factors for patients who require multiple injections or surgical release can help guide patient care and expectations.

### Not just another trigger finger [^112PxjPM]. Hand (2025). Low credibility.

Open A1 pulley release for trigger finger is generally considered a minor procedure with infrequent complications. Most reported complications are minor, including scar pain and tenderness, mild extension lag, and recurrence of triggering. Rates of major complications, such as bowstringing, neurovascular bundle injury, and infection requiring reoperation, are less than 1% to 4%. We aimed to describe the potentially devastating sequelae of these major complications and the subsequent consequences.

- **Methods**: Three patients underwent open trigger finger release, all complicated by severe postoperative surgical site infection requiring multiple subsequent procedures. We reviewed our initial management, subsequent reconstructive options, and outcomes with up to 19 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: All three adult patients who underwent open A1 pulley release for trigger finger developed a surgical site infection, leading to flexor tenosynovitis requiring urgent operative debridement and multiple procedures. Two patients were poorly controlled diabetics, and the third patient was otherwise healthy. Each patient ultimately developed distinct postoperative consequences: finger stiffness and contracture, disabling bowstringing requiring the use of a pulley ring, and flexor tendon rupture requiring staged tendon reconstruction, respectively. At final follow-up, all three patients had a permanent functional deficit.

- **Conclusions**: Major complications after trigger finger release are infrequent. However, if left untreated, particularly in diabetic patients, these complications can lead to significant long-term functional deficits.

### Adverse events of open A1 pulley release for idiopathic trigger finger [^111g8VqJ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to classify and report adverse events of trigger finger release in a large cohort of patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 1,598 trigger finger releases performed by 12 surgeons in 984 patients between 2001 and 2011. Adverse events were classified based on a system derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and clinical experience. Risk factors for various adverse events were sought in bivariate and multivariable statistical analysis.

- **Results**: At the latest follow-up, 66 patients (7%), or 84 operated trigger digits (5%), experienced a documented adverse event. The most common adverse events were recovery issues in 46 patients (3%), such as postoperative symptoms treated with steroid injection or slow recovery of motion treated with hand therapy, wound problems in 30 patients (2%) consisting of suture abscess, superficial infection, or wound separation, persistent postoperative triggering in 10 patients (0.6%), and retriggering in 4 patients (0.3%). Diabetes mellitus was associated with wound problems, slow recovery of motion, and recurrence. Concomitant carpal tunnel release on the same side was associated with slow recovery.

- **Conclusions**: Fourteen patients, less than 1%, in this cohort experienced an adverse event, such as persistent or retriggering, requiring secondary surgery. No nerve injury or deep infection occurred in our cohort. One in 15 patients experienced a minor transient or treatable adverse event, and patients with diabetes were at greater risk.

Type of Study/Level of Evidence: Therapeutic IV.

### Common hand conditions: A review [^111b2Tns]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and basilar (carpometacarpal) joint arthritis of the thumb can be associated with significant disability.

- **Carpal tunnel syndrome**: Characterized by numbness and tingling in the thumb and the index, middle, and radial ring fingers, as well as weakness of thumb opposition when severe. It is more common in women and people who are obese, have diabetes, and work in occupations involving use of keyboards, computer mice, heavy machinery, or vibrating manual tools. The Durkan physical examination maneuver, consisting of firm digital pressure across the carpal tunnel to reproduce symptoms, is 64% sensitive and 83% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome. People with suspected proximal compression or other compressive neuropathies should undergo electrodiagnostic testing, which is approximately more than 80% sensitive and 95% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome. Splinting or steroid injection may temporarily relieve symptoms. Patients who do not respond to conservative therapies may undergo open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release for definitive treatment.

- **Trigger finger**: Involves abnormal resistance to smooth flexion and extension ("triggering") of the affected finger and affects up to 20% of adults with diabetes and approximately 2% of the general population. Steroid injection is the first-line therapy but is less efficacious in people with insulin-dependent diabetes. People with diabetes and those with recurrent symptoms may benefit from early surgical release.

- **de Quervain tenosynovitis**:

Additional comprehensive text missing for de Quervain tenosynovitis may need supplementing for a complete scholarly review, as the current text appears cut off.

### Prognostic factors related to recurrence of trigger finger after open surgical release in adults [^114fRBwQ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

ReTrigger finger after surgery is one of the major adverse events. However, studies to identify factors associated with recurrence after open surgical release in adult trigger finger patients are still limited.

- **Purpose**: To identify factors associated with reTrigger finger after open surgical release.

- **Methods**: This 12-year retrospective observational study included 723 patients with 841 trigger fingers who underwent open A1 pulley release. Patients were categorized into two groups: those with reTrigger finger after surgery and those without. Associations between potential predictors, including age, sex, duration of symptoms, occupation status, active smoker status, number of steroid injections before surgery, and types of comorbidities, and the outcome of interest, recurrence of trigger finger, were examined using univariable and multivariable analyses. The results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

- **Results**: The recurrence rate after trigger finger release was 2.39% (20 of 841 fingers). After adjusting for confounders, more than three steroid injections before surgery and manual labor were the independent predictors of reTrigger finger (HR = 4.87, 95% CI = 1.06–22.35 and HR = 3.43, 95% CI = 1.15–10.23, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: More than three steroid injections before surgery and manual labor increase the risk of reTrigger finger after an open A1 pulley release. There may be limited benefit in administering a fourth steroid injection.

### Complications and functional outcomes following trigger finger release: A cohort study of 1879 patients [^112L3Xbr]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Although trigger finger release is considered a safe procedure, large cohort studies reporting consistent complication rates and functional outcomes are scarce. Further insight into the outcomes of this commonly performed procedure is essential for adequate treatment evaluation and patient counseling. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the complication rates and functional outcomes following trigger finger release.

- **Methods**: This is an observational multicenter cohort study of patients undergoing trigger finger release. The primary outcome included the occurrence of complications. The secondary outcome was the change in hand function (Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire) from baseline to 3 months postoperatively.

- **Results**: Complications were observed in 17.1 percent of 1879 patients. Most complications were minor, requiring hand therapy or analgesics (7.0 percent of all patients), antibiotics, or steroid injections (7.8 percent). However, 2.1 percent required surgical treatment and 0.2 percent developed complex regional pain syndrome. The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire total score improved from baseline to 3 months postoperatively with 12.7 points, although the authors found considerable variation in outcomes with less improvement in patients with better baseline scores.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates that trigger finger release results in improved hand function, although complications occur in 17 percent. Most complications are minor and can be treated with nonsurgical therapy, resulting in improved hand function as well.

### National benchmarks for the efficacy of trigger finger and the risk factors associated with failure [^1159XUbH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

The relative rates of success increased after additional corticosteroid injections, and the absolute rates of success were high after all three injections. This finding suggests that continuing corticosteroid treatment can be an effective tool for ongoing symptoms and to avoid progression to surgical release. However, due to complications associated with corticosteroid injections, physicians typically do not perform more than two or three injections on a given finger, although variation in practice does occur. Complications of corticosteroid injections include the increase of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, skin or fat atrophy, and spontaneous rupture of fascia and tendons. Regardless, the more injections patients require for trigger digits, the more likely they are to proceed to surgical management following a failed injection. Our findings, however, suggest that perhaps a continued trial of corticosteroid management may be efficacious in a large portion of patients, preventing the need for surgery at the 1-year time point.

The majority of previous studies that have investigated risk factors for the failure of corticosteroid injections in stenosing tenosynovitis have focused on common comorbidities such as diabetes and patient age. This study determined that patients with carpal tunnel syndrome were markedly more likely to fail their first, second, or third corticosteroid injections, and obesity was a similar albeit smaller risk factor. The literature indicates that trigger finger may occur in combination with carpal tunnel surgery and that these two diagnoses are frequently associated.

### Ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injections for trigger finger: A double-blinded, randomized controlled trial [^115D3UtN]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). High credibility.

To investigate the effects of ultrasound-guided injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) versus steroid for trigger fingers in adults, a prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled study was conducted at a tertiary care center.

Subjects with a diagnosis of trigger finger (N = 36; 39 affected digits) received treatment and were evaluated. They were randomly assigned to HA and steroid injection groups. Both study medications were injected separately via ultrasound guidance with one injection.

The classification of trigger grading, pain, functional disability, and patient satisfaction were evaluated before the injection, as well as 3 weeks and 3 months after the injection. At 3 months, 12 patients (66.7%) in the HA group and 17 patients (89.5%) in the steroid group exhibited no triggering of the affected fingers (P = 0.124). The treatment results at 3 weeks and 3 months showed similar changes in the Quinnell scale (P = 0.057 and P = 0.931, respectively).

A statistically significant interaction effect between group and time was found for visual analog scale (VAS) and Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ) evaluation (p < 0.05). The steroid group had a lower VAS at 3 months after injection (steroid 0.5 ± 1.1 vs HA 2.7 ± 2.4; p < 0.001). The HA group demonstrated continuing significant improvement in MHQ at 3 months (change from 3 weeks: steroid -2.6 ± 14.1 vs HA 19.1 ± 37.0; p = 0.023; d = .78).

In conclusion, ultrasound-guided injection of HA demonstrated promising results for the treatment of trigger fingers. The optimal frequency and dosage are yet to be determined.
