## Question

What is the treatment for cellulitis of the toe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for cellulitis of the toe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess severity and decide on outpatient versus inpatient care. Next, I will identify predisposing factors, especially toe-web disease, and plan local care. After that, I will select empiric antibiotics based on purulence and MRSA risk, determine duration, and outline follow-up. Finally, I will address special scenarios like diabetes, immunocompromise, and recurrent disease, and close with a concise, practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because misdiagnosis is common and leads to overtreatment. Cellulitis of the toe presents with erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness, often spreading proximally, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical. I should double-check for mimics such as gout, venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, or deep vein thrombosis, and I should examine the interdigital spaces carefully for fissuring, scaling, or maceration that can harbor pathogens and drive recurrence [^111Mrdn1] [^111kKWVP].

> Next, I should review severity and disposition. If there are no systemic inflammatory response signs, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability, outpatient therapy is appropriate. Hospitalization is indicated for concern for deeper or necrotizing infection, poor adherence, severe immunocompromise, or failure of outpatient therapy, so I need to ensure I screen for these red flags before deciding on the setting of care [^114NgcMq] [^111ek3cL].

> Hold on, I should verify predisposing factors because treating the source reduces recurrence. In toe cellulitis, interdigital tinea pedis and maceration are common portals of entry, and colonization with beta-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus in the toe webs is a strong risk factor. I need to check for chronic edema, obesity, venous insufficiency, and eczema as well, and I should treat these proactively during the acute episode and beyond [^111Mrdn1] [^116kAcwu] [^117MYykE].

> I will now examine local care, because this is foundational and often overlooked. Elevation of the affected limb reduces edema and accelerates improvement, and meticulous foot hygiene with attention to drying between the toes, topical antifungal therapy for tinea, and emollients for dry, cracked skin are essential. Let me reconsider whether to add compression if edema is prominent, as compression can reduce recurrence risk in chronic edema, though I should tailor this to perfusion status and patient tolerance [^114NgcMq] [^1128Axfm].

> Now, antibiotic selection. For nonpurulent cellulitis of the toe without MRSA risk factors, streptococci predominate, so I should start with a beta-lactam active against streptococci such as cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or amoxicillin. Wait, let me verify the duration before I commit to 10 days; contemporary evidence supports 5 to 6 days if the patient is improving clinically, so a 5-day course with reassessment at 48 to 72 hours is reasonable, extending if there is slow response [^116QtZHg] [^111gsSaf] [^114pSATx].

> But wait, what if there is purulence, penetrating trauma, prior MRSA, injection drug use, or systemic toxicity? In those cases, I should broaden coverage to include MRSA. Oral options include clindamycin monotherapy, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX combined with a beta-lactam to ensure streptococcal coverage, while IV options include vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin. I should confirm local MRSA prevalence and patient-specific risks before choosing, and I will avoid rifampin monotherapy or as sole adjunctive therapy [^111zAoE9] [^112z7Dvu] [^1121WiRG].

> Let me think about duration and route. For most uncomplicated cases, 5 to 6 days of oral therapy suffices if improving, whereas severe infection or slow response may require 7 to 14 days, individualized to clinical trajectory. I should double-check that IV therapy is reserved for severe disease or when oral therapy is not feasible, and I should switch to oral as soon as the patient is clinically stable to minimize cost and complications [^111gsSaf] [^115KeBek].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment. I need to ensure improvement within 48 to 72 hours. If there is no improvement, I should verify adherence, reassess for an occult abscess requiring drainage, consider alternative diagnoses, and broaden antibiotics if MRSA was not initially covered. I should also remember that cultures are not routinely needed in uncomplicated nonpurulent cellulitis, but I will obtain cultures if there is purulence, immunocompromise, animal bites, or treatment failure [^114pSATx] [^114GHCWS].

> I will now consider special populations. In diabetes, I should maintain a lower threshold for hospitalization, evaluate for osteomyelitis if there is a chronic ulcer or probe to bone, and use standard soft-tissue infection durations of 1 to 2 weeks, adjusting based on response. Hold on, I should verify that MRSA coverage is not automatic unless risk factors are present, as MSSA remains common in community-acquired diabetic foot infections [^116Nf3FQ] [^1113RHL3].

> For immunocompromised patients, I should broaden empiric coverage and consider atypical pathogens, and I will extend therapy toward the longer end of ranges with close monitoring. Let me reconsider whether to add anti-inflammatory therapy; in nondiabetic adults, a short course of systemic corticosteroids may hasten symptom resolution, but I should avoid steroids in diabetics or those with contraindications [^112nmQ7K] [^116a7rCB].

> For recurrent cellulitis, I need to ensure aggressive management of predisposing factors and consider prophylaxis if there are three to four episodes per year despite optimal local care. Prophylactic oral penicillin or erythromycin for 4 to 52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2 to 4 weeks, reduces recurrence while in use, though benefits wane after cessation. I should confirm that patients understand this trade-off and revisit nonantibiotic strategies like compression and skin care [^116anE5J] [^1139Z69g].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with evidence and guidelines. No antibiotic has proven superiority for cellulitis, oral therapy performs as well as IV in many settings, and shorter courses are effective when patients improve clinically. I need to ensure I am not over-ordering labs or imaging unless indicated, and I should document clear return precautions for worsening erythema, fever, or new purulence [^111PYrVi] [^112JMiZb] [^115z6nqP].

Cellulitis of the toe is treated with **oral antibiotics active against streptococci** (e.g. cephalexin, dicloxacillin, or amoxicillin) for 5–6 days [^111gsSaf] if there is no purulence or systemic toxicity; extend to 10–14 days if slow response or comorbidities are present [^114LP8SG]. For purulent infection or MRSA risk, add MRSA coverage (e.g. clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX) [^111zAoE9] [^1166kUD4]. Hospitalize if there is **systemic illness**, **rapid progression**, or **immunocompromise** [^114NgcMq]. Essential adjuncts include elevation, warm soaks, and meticulous foot hygiene with treatment of interdigital tinea or maceration to prevent recurrence [^111Mrdn1] [^117MYykE].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and sometimes lymphangitis or systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) [^1119mx9Q].

- **Risk factors**: tinea pedis, toe-web maceration, minor trauma, diabetes, immunocompromise, chronic edema, or prior cellulitis [^1139SBEy] [^116kAcwu].

- **Diagnosis**: primarily clinical; cultures are not routinely indicated unless purulence, immunocompromise, or treatment failure is present [^114pSATx].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **purulence, MRSA risk, and severity** [^114pSATx]:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Nonpurulent, no MRSA risk | Oral beta-lactam (cephalexin, dicloxacillin, amoxicillin) for 5–6 days [^111gsSaf] [^116QtZHg] |
| Purulent or MRSA risk | Add MRSA coverage: clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX; combine with beta-lactam if streptococcal coverage is needed [^111zAoE9] [^1166kUD4] |
| Severe infection or systemic toxicity | Hospitalize; IV beta-lactam (cefazolin) ± MRSA coverage (vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin) [^114NgcMq] [^113PjKu3] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Standard duration is **5–6 days** for uncomplicated cases with close follow-up [^111gsSaf]; extend to 10–14 days for slow clinical response, severe infection, or comorbidities [^116PoWQe].

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Elevation**: reduce swelling and improve lymphatic drainage [^114NgcMq].

- **Warm soaks**: provide analgesia and may aid localization.

- **Foot hygiene**: treat tinea pedis, keep feet dry, and use emollients to prevent cracks [^111Mrdn1] [^1166SdXy].

- **Pain control**: acetaminophen or NSAIDs as tolerated.

---

## Indications for hospitalization

Hospitalize for **systemic illness** (fever, chills, tachycardia, hypotension), **rapid progression**, **immunocompromise**, **failure of outpatient therapy**, or **concern for necrotizing infection** [^114NgcMq] [^111cFv7N].

---

## Management of recurrent cellulitis

- **Identify and treat predisposing factors**: tinea pedis, edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency [^117MYykE] [^1139SBEy].

- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: consider oral penicillin or erythromycin for 4–52 weeks in patients with ≥ 3–4 episodes/year despite risk-factor control [^116anE5J] [^1139Z69g].

- **Patient education**: emphasize foot care, early recognition, and prompt treatment [^1166SdXy].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **abscess formation** requiring drainage, **osteomyelitis** if infection spreads to bone, **necrotizing fasciitis** (rare but life-threatening), and **sepsis**, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^1119mx9Q] [^112aNEXQ].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange reassessment within **48–72 hours** to confirm improvement; if there is no improvement, reassess the diagnosis, adherence, and consider alternative diagnoses or complications [^115fP7Gu].

---

Cellulitis of the toe is managed with **targeted antibiotics**, local care, and risk-factor modification, with escalation for severe disease or recurrence.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^115JcYR7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114pSATx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Risk factors for nonpurulent leg cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139SBEy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Nonpurulent cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermal and subdermal tissues that is not associated with purulent drainage, discharge or abscess. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to identify and appraise all controlled observational studies that have examined risk factors for the development of nonpurulent cellulitis of the leg (NPLC). A systematic literature search of electronic databases and grey literature sources was performed in July 2015. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess methodological quality of included studies. Of 3059 potentially eligible studies retrieved and screened, six case-control studies were included. An increased risk of developing NPLC was associated with previous cellulitis [odds ratio (OR) 40.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 22.6–72.0], wound (OR 19.1, 95% CI 9.1–40.0), current leg ulcers (OR 13.7, 95% CI 7.9–23.6), lymphoedema/chronic leg oedema (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.5–13.3), excoriating skin diseases (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.7–7.1), tinea pedis (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.9–5.3) and body mass index > 30 kg m -2 (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.0). Diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumption were not associated with NPLC. Although diabetics may have been underrepresented in the included studies, local risk factors appear to play a more significant role in the development of NPLC than do systemic risk factors. Clinicians should consider the treatment of modifiable risk factors including leg oedema, wounds, ulcers, areas of skin breakdown and toe-web intertrigo while administering antibiotic treatment for NPLC.

Key points
- Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the deeper layers of the skin.
- It causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area.
- If untreated, cellulitis can spread and cause serious health problems.
- Healthcare providers diagnose cellulitis by how it looks and treat it with antibiotics.
- Speak to a healthcare provider if you have concerns about cellulitis. What it is Different bacteria can cause cellulitis, which is an infection of the deeper layers of the skin. This page focuses on one of the most common causes of cellulitis: group A Streptococcus. Symptoms Generally, skin affected by cellulitis is
- Painful
- Red
- Swollen
- Tender to the touch
- Warm The skin may look pitted, like the peel of an orange. Blisters may appear on the affected skin. Other symptoms: Some people may also develop fever and chills. Cellulitis can appear anywhere on the body, but it's most common on the feet and legs.

Lymphedema happens when the lymphatic system doesn't drain the way that it should. As part of the body's immune system, the lymphatic system moves fluid containing infection-fighting cells throughout the body. A coronary artery bypass graft includes removing a healthy vein from the leg and connecting it to the coronary artery. This surgery helps to improve blood flow to the heart. Causes Group A strep bacteria are a common cause of cellulitis. In general, people cannot catch cellulitis from others. Keep ReadingCauses and How the Bacteria Spread Prevention There are things people can do to protect themselves and others from group A strep infections, including cellulitis. Keep ReadingPreventing Group A Strep Infection. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose cellulitis by looking at the affected skin during a physical examination. Blood or other lab tests aren't usually needed.

Treatment and recovery Healthcare providers treat cellulitis with antibiotics. They can be oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Healthcare providers use oral antibiotics to treat most cellulitis infections. IV antibiotics can be used to treat more serious infections. Keeping the affected limb elevated can help decrease swelling and speed up recovery.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

### Acute bacterial skin infections and cellulitis [^112NKwmd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute bacterial skin infections are very common, with various presentations and severity. This review focuses on deep skin infections. We separate acute nonnecrotizing infections of the hypodermis (erysipelas), forms with abscesses or exudates and necrotizing fasciitis. These three types actually differ in risk factors, bacteriology, treatment and prognosis.

Recent Findings

Leg erysipelas/cellulitis occurs in more than one person/1000/year. It remains mainly due to streptococci. Foot intertrigo is an important risk factor. Necrotizing fasciitis is much rarer and usually occurs in patients with chronic diseases. Staphylococci, especially community-acquired methicillin-resistant strains in some areas, play a growing role in the intermediate form of cellulitis with abscesses and exudates. For erysipelas or noncomplicated cellulitis, antibiotic treatment at home, when feasible, is much less expensive and as effective as hospital treatment. Intermediate cases with collections and exudates often require surgical drainage. For necrotizing fasciitis early surgery remains essential in order to decrease the mortality rate.

Summary

Antibiotic treatment of deep skin infections must be active on streptococci; the choice of a larger spectrum of activity depends on clinical presentation, risk factors and the burden of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in the environment.

### Culture of bone biopsy specimens overestimates rate of residual osteomyelitis after toe or forefoot amputation [^115eDxjH]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

The strength of our study lies in the prospective design, the rigorous protocol for retrieving bone samples from clearly defined sites, the systematic histological and microbiological analyses, and the complete follow-up. Nevertheless, our study has limitations. The study population was heterogeneous with regard to peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, gangrene, and cellulitis. Furthermore, there was no rigorous standardized preoperative assessment of whether osteomyelitis was already present. However, our treatment strategy meets prevalent accepted standards of care. Moreover, the study population was too small to rigorously investigate the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on clinical outcome. Finally, our study was not designed to investigate the correct indication for, or value of, antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis after toe amputation. It may well be reasonable to use a short period of antibiotic therapy for patients with culture-positive but histologically negative results since the documented intraoperative contamination of the bone may lead to propagation of the infection. Prospective randomized studies comparing treatment regimens are required to address this issue and determine whether osteomyelitis therapy should be restricted to patients with histologically proven residual osteomyelitis.

In conclusion, cultures of residual bone after toe or forefoot amputation are frequently positive without any histological evidence of osteomyelitis. We hypothesize that such false-positive results are due to contamination from adjacent infected soft tissue. The rate of residual osteomyelitis in patients who have undergone toe amputation appears to be much lower than postulated by studies that relied on culture of bone biopsy specimens alone. We recommend that both histological analysis and culture of bone biopsied from the resection margin be used to diagnose residual osteomyelitis after toe amputation. Histological analysis is useful to rule out osteomyelitis, whereas culture will permit guided antibiotic therapy. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the indications for, and duration of, antibiotic treatment according to these findings.

### Cellulitis [^117Sz9yf]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

### Cellulitis in children: a retrospective single centre study from Australia [^114gZXRt]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

A retrospective chart review was conducted at Perth Children's Hospital (PCH), the only tertiary paediatric centre in Western Australia (WA) with an estimated 60 000 presentations to the emergency department (ED) annually.

Records with a primary diagnosis of cellulitis were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10 coding (online supplemental table S1). At PCH, all inpatient records from 1 January to 31 December 2018 were screened for inclusion. Due to the time constraints of the study, ED presentations from 1 July to 31 December 2018 only were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were patients aged ≥ 16 years, alternative diagnosis more likely on detailed chart review or where insufficient documentation was available to assess for inclusion. Orbital cellulitis and odontogenic cellulitis were excluded from this review, as their management is considerably different from that of traditional cellulitis.

Cellulitis (ICD10 codes L03.01–L03.11 and H60.1–H60.13) is a bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the skin (epidermis, dermis and subcutaneous tissues) characterised by erythema, pain, warmth, swelling and rapid progression. Recurrent cellulitis was defined as an additional admission for cellulitis occurring > 30 days from the index diagnosis to exclude the possibility of counting relapses or treatment failure (representation within 30 days of hospital discharge). SSTI includes cellulitis, impetigo, skin abscess, scabies and fungal infections. Extremities are the hands and feet including the finger and toes. Geographical location was ascertained by postcode, grouped according to Australian Statistical Geography Standard Remoteness Structure on the basis of relative access to healthcare services.

The hospital in the home (HITH) service consists of a team of trained clinical nurses. It provides acute care at home for children who are medically stable and require ongoing regular medical care. They conduct daily home visits to provide treatments such as intravenous antibiotics, dressings and clinical assessments. Patients can be referred to HITH directly from ED in order to avoid an admission or from an inpatient unit to facilitate early discharge.

Data collection

Data were extracted from paper and electronic hospital records, including demographics, admission duration, clinical findings, investigations, management and outcomes. The characteristics assessed included age, Aboriginal status, geographical location, presence of common comorbidities and recurrent cellulitis. Data were captured and stored in a standardised purpose-built REDCap database by a medically trained abstractor. Adherence to treatment duration was assessed against the intravenous to oral switch guidelines.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^115JbHBX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prior experience of preventing cellulitis recurrence

Two‐thirds of survey respondents reported that they were not aware of any ways of trying to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis (66%; n = 159). However, when asked whether they were currently doing anything to prevent cellulitis from coming back, 46% (n = 110) reported that they were currently trying to prevent recurrence (Table 2). This higher proportion for the second question may seem inconsistent, yet free‐text comments suggested that participants were trying prevention through untested suggestions from friends, and it is also worth noting the lower response rate to this question.

Preventative behaviours that were reported most commonly among interviewees were cleaning wounds with antiseptic and using insect repellent. Some participants, particularly those who had experienced more than one episode of cellulitis, also reported moisturizing their legs and feet to treat or prevent dry skin; wearing compression stockings; leading a healthier lifestyle; taking long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics as a means of preventing cellulitis; and avoidance of environments that were thought to lead to infections.

It's just a little bit more awareness of being careful what you do, where you walk… I have been out once or twice, in the fields, and I've cut myself and I've got a medi‐wipe out straightaway and cleaned it all and so far it's no problem at all. I don't know what starts it off, to be quite honest. But, as I say, I've kept myself clean

Yes, I've got a big bottle of cream just to keep the skin supple and stop it from drying out. I use my cream if anything goes red and hot, even if it's my toes or anything, I've got cream between my toes so I don't get athlete's foot. So even if I end up with a crack, I've got cream on there to get rid of it straightaway

### Cellulitis and erysipelas [^117YVujD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellulitis is a common problem, caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, with redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected people have systemic illness. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis with marked superficial inflammation, typically affecting the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Cellulitis and erysipelas can result in local necrosis and abscess formation. Around a quarter of affected people have more than one episode of cellulitis within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for cellulitis and erysipelas? What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics, comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens, duration of antibiotics, and treatment of predisposing factors.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

### Fungal foot infection, cellulitis and diabetes: a review [^111d4HC4]. Diabetic Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the current evidence for the presence of fungal foot infection (tinea pedis and toenail onychomycosis) as a risk factor for the development of cellulitis within the lower limb, particularly for those individuals with diabetes.

Methods

A structured review of medline, embase and cinahl databases was undertaken to identify publications investigating fungal foot infection as a risk factor for the development of cellulitis.

Results

Sixteen studies were identified. Eight studies adopted a case-control methodology, with the remainder being cross-sectional surveys. The majority of studies established the presence of tinea infection by clinical rather than established microbiological methods. Although the majority of papers suggested a link, only two case-control studies employed microbiological diagnosis to demonstrate that fungal foot infection was a risk for the development of lower limb cellulitis, particularly when infection was located between the toes. There were insufficient data to suggest that fungal foot infection posed an increased risk to patients with diabetes.

Conclusion

There is some evidence to suggest that fungal infection of the foot is a factor in the development of lower limb cellulitis, but further robust research is needed to confirm these findings and quantify the risk that fungi pose, particularly to the diabetic foot. Meanwhile, improved surveillance and treatment of tinea infections on the foot by healthcare professionals should be encouraged to reduce potential complications.

Infection after foot and ankle surgery or trauma can range from the common superficial cellulitis to the less common deep soft tissue or bone infections that can have disastrous consequences. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms has made treatment of infection more difficult, even though promising new antibiotics are being developed. Prevention of infection, through proper patient selection and meticulous surgical technique, is essential to satisfactory outcomes.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. 1 Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123 644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. 2 While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one‐third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. 3, 4 Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics. 5 This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side‐effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments. 6

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dryness. 7 Previous research also suggests that there is a high rate of fungal foot disease in patients with recurrent cellulitis as skin breaks caused by fungal infection provide a 'portal of entry' for bacteria. 8, 9 Although fungal foot infection is common, many patients undertreat this as it can be asymptomatic, 10, 11 so it is possible that more active treatment of fungal foot disease may prevent recurrent cellulitis. In a recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) for cellulitis, patients and health professionals identified the need to determine the best nonantibiotic intervention for the prevention of cellulitis (e.g. skin care; foot care; moisturizers; antiseptics; lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise; compression garments/bandages; treating athlete's foot; complementary and alternative therapy) as a priority area for future research. 12

Non-limb-threatening diabetic foot infections — treatment of diabetic foot infections is guided by the severity of the infection, and non-limb-threatening infections involve superficial ulcerations without significant ischemia and they do not involve bone or joint. Typically, cellulitis does not extend 2 cm beyond the ulcer margins and there is an absence of systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, chills, nausea, vomiting). These less severe infections that frequently complicate diabetic foot ulcers may be initially treated in an outpatient setting.

### Oedema as a risk factor for multiple episodes of cellulitis / erysipelas of the lower leg: a series with community follow-up [^111CCM9D]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis of the lower leg is a common problem with considerable morbidity. Risk factors are well identified but the relationship between consequences of cellulitis and further episodes is less well understood.

Objectives

To review risk factors, treatment and complications in patients with lower leg cellulitis, to determine the frequency of long-term complications and of further episodes, and any relationship between them, and to consider the likely impact of preventive strategies based on these results.

Methods

Patients with ascending, presumed streptococcal, cellulitis of the lower leg were identified retrospectively from hospital coding. Hospital records, together with questionnaires to both general practitioners and patients, were used to record subsequent complications and identifiable risk factors for further episodes.

Results

Of 171 patients, 81 (47%) had recurrent episodes and 79 (46%) had chronic oedema. The concurrence of these two factors was strongly correlated (P < 0.0002). Based on 143 completed questionnaires, oedema was apparently due to or persistently asymmetrical after the cellulitic episode in 52 (37%), and 19 (13%) had ulceration attributed to, rather than causing, cellulitis. Of those with three or more episodes, half did not lead to hospital admission. Toeweb maceration was reported in only 15% of questionnaires. Use of antibiotic treatment for more than 28 days was associated with a reduced risk of leg ulceration or of prolonged oedema compared with shorter courses, but neither difference was statistically significant.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that the true frequency of postcellulitic oedema, as well as that of further episodes, is probably underestimated. Furthermore, there is a strong association between these factors, each of which is both a risk factor for, and a consequence of, each other, and for which intervention (reduction of oedema or more prolonged antibiotic therapy) may reduce the risk of recurrent infection. By contrast, self-reporting of toeweb maceration is low, so attempts to reduce the risk of recurrent cellulitis by treatment of tinea pedis or bacterial intertrigo may fail.

### Which outcomes are reported in cellulitis trials? Results of a review of outcomes included in cellulitis trials and a patient priority setting survey [^113ZgDBb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is an emerging need to develop consistent outcomes in clinical trials to allow effective comparison of treatment effects. No systematic review has previously looked at the reporting of outcome measures used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment and prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas).

Objectives

The primary aim of this review was to describe the breadth of outcomes reported from RCTs on cellulitis treatment and prevention. The secondary aim was to identify outcome themes from patients' and healthcare professionals' feedback from a cellulitis Priority Setting Partnership (PSP).

Methods

We conducted a review of all outcome measures used in RCTs from two recent Cochrane reviews. Free-text responses from a cellulitis priority setting survey were used to understand the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals.

Results

Outcomes from 42 RCTs on treatment of cellulitis and six RCTs on prevention of cellulitis were reviewed. Only 28 trials stated their primary outcome. For trials assessing treatment of cellulitis, clinical response to treatment was categorized in 25 different ways. Five of these trials used an outcome that was in accordance with FDA guidance and only four trials incorporated either quality of life or patient satisfaction. For trials assessing prevention of cellulitis, recurrence was the key outcome measure. From the cellulitis PSP, prevention of recurrence, clinical features and long-term disease impact were the most important outcome themes for patients.

Conclusions

We have shown that in cellulitis treatment and prevention research, there is significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, inadequate focus on patient-reported outcomes, and a disparity between what is currently measured and what patients and healthcare professionals feel is important. We recommend that future cellulitis treatment trials consider the use of longer-term outcomes to capture recurrence and long-term morbidity, as well as short-term resolution of acute infection.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^111kKWVP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high‐quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic?

Diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.
Approximately one in three patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis do not have cellulitis and are given another diagnosis on discharge. Consequently, this results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.
There are no diagnostic criteria available for lower‐limb cellulitis in the U.K.

What does this study add?

This systematic review has identified a key research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis.
There is a current lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice.

### Stopping antibiotics after surgical amputation in diabetic foot and ankle infections – A daily practice cohort [^112Mcg3T]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Objective

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections (DFI) after surgical amputations in toto is debated. There are discrepancies worldwide.

Methods

Using a clinical pathway for adult DFI patients (retrospective cohort analysis), we conducted a cluster‐controlled Cox regression analysis. Minimum follow‐up was 2 months.

Results

We followed 482 amputated DFI episodes for a median of 2.1 years after the index episode. The DFIs predominately affected the forefoot (n = 433; 90%). We diagnosed osteomyelitis in 239 cases (239/482; 50%). In total, 47 cases (10%) were complicated by bacteremia, 86 (18%) by abscesses and 139 (29%) presented with cellulitis. Surgical amputation involved the toes (n = 155), midfoot (280) and hindfoot (47). Overall, 178 cases (37%) required revascularization. After amputation, the median duration of antibiotic administration was 7 days (interquartile range, 1‐16 days). In 109 cases (25%), antibiotics were discontinued immediately after surgery. Overall, clinical failure occurred in 90 DFIs (17%), due to the same pathogens in only 38 cases. In multivariate analysis, neither duration of total postsurgical antibiotic administration (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99‐1.01) nor immediate postoperative discontinuation altered failure rate (HR 0.9, 0.5‐1.5).

Conclusion

According to our clinical pathway, we found no benefit in continuing postsurgical antibiotic administration in routine amputation for DFI. In the absence of residual infection (ie, resection at clear margins), antibiotics should be discontinued.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^117CGQ5R]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas… [^112JMiZb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event. Results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inform the production of evidence-based guidelines that cover antibiotic choice, route of administration, duration of treatment, the role of combinations of antibiotics, and gaps in research.

We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished. The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy. We found 5 trials that compared vancomycin alone with other antibiotics: daptomycin, 40, 41 ceftobiprole, 42 a new pleuromutilin, 43 and linezolid. 44 We found no evidence of a difference between the 2 treatments. The 2 studies by Daniel15 compared 5 days of azithromycin with 7 days of either cloxacillin or erythromycin. One study57 compared 5 days of oral levofloxacin with a 10-day regimen.

Another study45 compared 6 days of tedizolid with 10 days of linezolid. The use of oral therapy was supported by the limited data for oral vs IV antibiotics and by trials in which only oral antibiotics were used with good outcome. The earliest studies of antimicrobials for erysipelas administered the drugs orally with good outcomes. 21, 22 In this review, when oral antibiotics were compared with IV treatments, the oral treatments appeared more effective. 28, 29, 48, 58.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^112aNEXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### Management of common bacterial infections of the skin [^112kEBGe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bacterial skin infections commonly encountered in the community include impetigo, folliculitis/furunculosis, simple abscesses, erysipelas and other nonnecrotizing cellulitis. The review focuses on recent epidemiological, bacteriological and therapeutic advances.

Recent Findings

Impetigo and erysipelas occur in about 20 and 1 person/1000/year, respectively. Main risk factors for erysipelas are toe-web intertrigo and lymphedema. The true incidence of furunculosis is unknown, whereas outbreaks in small communities are reported worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen for impetigo and furunculosis, and methicillin-resistant strains play a growing role in both diseases. Erysipelas are mainly caused by streptococci, whereas local complications (i.e. abscesses or blisters) may be due to staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains in involved geographic areas. Recent trends for treating impetigo and furunculosis predate community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. For outbreaks of furunculosis, stringent decolonization measures are showing promise, whereas there is no validated therapeutic regimen for chronic furunculosis. Current trends for erysipelas involve ambulatory treatments and reduced duration of antibiotics.

Summary

Despite better epidemiological or bacteriological knowledge of common bacterial skin infections, the exact role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci needs regular surveys in involved geographic areas. Antibiotic treatment must be active on staphylococci and, to a lesser degree, on streptococci.

### Stopping antibiotics after surgical amputation in diabetic foot and ankle infections – A daily practice cohort [^115KNVRZ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections (DFI) after surgical amputations in toto is debated. There are discrepancies worldwide.

Methods

Using a clinical pathway for adult DFI patients (retrospective cohort analysis), we conducted a cluster-controlled Cox regression analysis. Minimum follow-up was 2 months.

Results

We followed 482 amputated DFI episodes for a median of 2.1 years after the index episode. The DFIs predominately affected the forefoot (n = 433; 90%). We diagnosed osteomyelitis in 239 cases (239/482; 50%). In total, 47 cases (10%) were complicated by bacteremia, 86 (18%) by abscesses and 139 (29%) presented with cellulitis. Surgical amputation involved the toes (n = 155), midfoot (280) and hindfoot (47). Overall, 178 cases (37%) required revascularization. After amputation, the median duration of antibiotic administration was 7 days (interquartile range, 1–16 days). In 109 cases (25%), antibiotics were discontinued immediately after surgery. Overall, clinical failure occurred in 90 DFIs (17%), due to the same pathogens in only 38 cases. In multivariate analysis, neither duration of total postsurgical antibiotic administration (HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99–1.01) nor immediate postoperative discontinuation altered failure rate (HR 0.9, 0.5–1.5).

Conclusion

According to our clinical pathway, we found no benefit in continuing postsurgical antibiotic administration in routine amputation for DFI. In the absence of residual infection (ie, resection at clear margins), antibiotics should be discontinued.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: a systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics. This can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019. Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic type, administration route, treatment duration or dose. LLC may be overtreated and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

### Cellulitis: a review [^1119mx9Q]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.
- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### Risk factors for acute cellulitis of the lower limb: a prospective case-control study [^116kAcwu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial cellulitis is a potentially serious infection that commonly recurs. The identification of preventable risk factors could reduce infection-related morbidity and cost and improve patient management. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with lower-limb cellulitis, including both analysis of risk factors associated with cellulitis in either limb and risk factors in a single limb associated with cellulitis in the same limb. We placed particular emphasis on dermatophytic infections of the foot and bacterial infection and colonization of the toe webs.

Methods

We conducted a prospective case-control study of 100 subjects with cellulitis and 200 control subjects, matched for age and sex, who were admitted to a university hospital during the period October 2000-February 2004. Data were obtained with a questionnaire and from examination of lower limbs and microbiological analyses of samples from the feet.

Results

The median age of the participants was 66.5 years (interquartile range, 48.8–77.0). The following risk factors were strongly and independently associated with cellulitis: previous history of cellulitis (OR, 31.04; 95% CI, 4.15–232.20), the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta -hemolytic streptococci in the toe webs (OR, 28.97; 95% CI, 5.47–153.48), presence of leg erosions or ulcers (OR, 11.80; 95% CI, 2.47–56.33), and prior saphenectomy (OR, 8.49; 95% CI, 1.62–44.52). Tinea pedis interdigitalis was associated with cellulitis only when toe web bacteria were excluded from the analysis (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.32–11.27).

Conclusions

Risk factors for acute bacterial cellulitis in hospitalized patients include predisposing factors and the presence of sites of pathogen entry on legs and toe webs. These findings indicate that improved awareness and management of toe web intertrigo, which may harbor bacterial pathogens, and other skin lesions might reduce the incidence of cellulitis.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Treatment of toes as an integrated part of infection control for advanced lower limb lymphedema [^111QkXSc]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of infection and verrucous hyperkeratosis in patients who underwent surgery for advanced lymphedema according to the algorithm designed by the senior author, and were treated concurrently with/without toe treatment. A case series (Between 2004–2015) of 46 patients with unilateral advanced lower limb lymphedema was reviewed. Lymphoscintigraphy was used for evaluation of lymphedema severity. The ICG lymphography was used for staging. Fibrosis and skin induration were reflected by the tonicity. They were divided into two groups: (1) patients who underwent further treatment of toes according to the algorithm, and (2) patients who did not have toe-related treatment. Infection episodes and verrucous hyperkeratosis were recorded. There were 21 and 25 patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. All lymphoscintigrams showed severe dermal backflow with severe stagnation by 2.5 h after injection of Tc-99 colloid. All patients were stage IV or V. Tonicity values of skin were < 60. Group 1 was reduced to an average of 0.6 episodes per year in the past year of follow-up, and Group 2 was reduced to an average of 1.5 episodes per year in the past year of follow-up (p < 0.001). The average frequency of preoperative cellulitis was 3.6 episodes per year. The occurrence of verrucous hyperkeratosis was observed in 14.3% and 32% of Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The incidences of cellulitis and verrucous hyperkeratosis were significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p < 0.001). To achieve successful control of infection, they should be treated carefully according to the strategy described above.

### Operative versus non-operative treatment in diabetic dry toe gangrene [^115xkvCU]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Diabetic foot is a major comorbidity of diabetes, with 15–25% of diabetic patients developing diabetic foot ulcer during their lifetime. Other major diabetic foot complications include cellulitis, abscess, wet gangrene, dry gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis. Dry gangrene involves tissue necrosis due to chronic ischemia whereby the tissue becomes numb, dry, wrinkled, and dead. Although diabetic foot complications have been extensively studied in literature, there is limited data on the management of dry gangrene.

Methods

We report a case series of 12 patients with diabetes-related dry gangrene in the toes, initially planned to be managed conservatively with autoamputation.

Results

One patient had an autoamputation, while eight patients underwent surgical amputations (six major amputations, two minor amputations) for better clinical outcomes. Two patients died, while no change was observed in one patient even after 12 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Managing diabetic dry toe gangrene by waiting for autoamputation may lead to worse clinical outcomes and should be practiced cautiously on a case-by-case basis. Early surgical intervention should be opted to improve patients' quality of life.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^116tagpq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — classification and management context — one well accepted method simply provides two categories: non-limb-threatening and limb-threatening infections, with non-limb-threatening infections usually seen with ulceration that is superficial, without significant ischemia, and a wound that does not probe to bone or joint; ulceration, however, does not need to be present and cellulitis in this category is 2 cm or less from the ulceration or portal of entry, with patients medically stable and usually without signs and symptoms of systemic involvement, and this relatively mild to moderate infection can be managed on an outpatient basis, with close supervision from the clinician. Limb-threatening diabetic foot infections have cellulitis that extends beyond 2 cm; additional clinical features may include fever, edema, lymphangitis, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis, and ischemia, and if an ulcer is present it may probe to bone or joint, which is highly predictive of osteomyelitis.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1113RHL3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections — empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient's response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1149CyRV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue that most commonly affects the lower extremities, although it can affect other areas. It causes local signs of inflammation, such as warmth, erythema, pain, lymphangitis, and frequently systemic upset with fever and raised white blood cell count. As already reported in a previous paragraph, cellulitis has been recently classified as an ABSSSI together with erysipelas, SSIs, and major abscesses.

In a large European multicenter study, Garau et al. analyzed a population of patients diagnosed with complicated SSTI hospitalized between December 2010 and January 2011 reporting that cellulitis was the most frequent diagnosis accounting for 59.1% of the total. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection; staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized.

Treatment should begin promptly with agents effective against the typical Gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci. If the cellulitis is very early and mild and no significant co-morbidities are present, oral beta-lactams might be sufficient in areas where CA-MRSA is not prevalent. Other available options are macrolides and lincosamides; however, resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin are increasing. Fluoroquinolones have been approved for the treatment of most uncomplicated cellulitis but are not adequate for treatment of MRSA infections. For more severe infections, parenteral route is the first choice.

If MRSA is suspected (both hospital acquired MRSA [HA-MRSA] and CA-MRSA), glycopeptides and newer antimicrobials are the best options. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its borders. Additionally, simple abscesses do not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension. Cutaneous abscesses are typically caused by bacteria that represent the normal regional skin flora of the involved area.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^113QXToi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

It wouldn't be a problem. I do put cream on my legs every day, I do both legs just from the ankle upwards, to the knee. Nothing on my feet, I put cream on my feet for something else. But that wouldn't be a problem

Yes, it would be useful to have more information because I'm one of those people who just sort of stands on a towel and dries my feet and then hope for the best. Yes, that would be something I would [do]… obviously I'm more aware of how you wash your hands now, but feet haven't really been mentioned very much: so that would be interesting to find out if that will prevent it

In contrast, some interviewees expressed negative views about enhanced skin care and foot hygiene. In particular, participants felt that applying foot creams would be messy, too time‐consuming and not necessary to do on a daily basis, but rather only once the skin is particularly dry or affected by cellulitis. Some interviewees also spoke about perceived difficulties of adopting these prevention strategies such as bending down to reach feet, while others felt that such difficulties could be overcome with support from significant others or carers, and/or other aids.

Well, because I have a chair to get in and out the bath and I do find it difficult sometimes drying. But what I do in there when I come out the bath and I come downstairs, I put my feet on a stool and I can do them, unless my granddaughters are here, they will do it for me

No, feet is a difficulty with me because of the arthritis, but I've always thought I've been very careful; I always make sure I get in between my toes and if I can't, even when I couldn't get down when I had my hip operation, I used to put cotton wool buds in my grabber, you know, I've got a grabber, so I used to put the cotton wool and then sort of put cream on

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — research priorities identify needs for rapid and specific diagnostic assays to identify cellulitis pathogens; development of inexpensive agents effective against groups A, B, C, and G streptococci and staphylococci including MRSA; investigations to determine the pathogenesis of streptococcal soft tissue infections, including the roles of toxins and host response molecules in redness, swelling, pain, and edema; clinical trials that include patients with severe soft tissue infections (eg, necrotizing fasciitis and gas gangrene) and immunocompromised patients; studies to determine host and pathogen factors that result in recurrent cellulitis; larger trials to assess whether anti-inflammatory agents are useful or detrimental in cellulitis and erysipelas; and determination of definitive treatment of SSTIs caused by staphylococci and streptococci regarding preferred agents, doses, and duration of therapy.

### Dilemmas when managing cellulitis [^117NfS13]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly seen in primary care. It is also a common reason for hospital admission accounting, for example, for around 3% of emergency medical consultations at one UK district general hospital. Here, we review the management of cellulitis, and try to resolve some common dilemmas: whether a patient with cellulitis should be treated in hospital; which antibacterial to use; whether it should be given orally or parenterally; and whether patients with recurrent cellulitis should take prophylactic antibacterials.

### IWGDF / IDSA guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes-related foot infections (IWGDF / IDSA 2023) [^111cFv7N]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2024). High credibility.

IWGDF/IDSA diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) — clinical features suggesting a more serious infection include wounds that penetrate subcutaneous tissues, cellulitis that is extensive (> 2 cm) or rapidly progressive, and local signs such as severe inflammation, crepitus, bullae, discolouration, necrosis or gangrene, ecchymoses or petechiae, and new anaesthesia or localised pain; general indicators include acute onset or rapid progression, systemic features (fever, chills, hypotension, confusion, volume depletion), laboratory abnormalities (leucocytosis, highly elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, severe or worsening hyperglycaemia, acidosis, or new/worsening azotaemia and electrolyte abnormalities), complicating factors (foreign body, puncture wound, deep abscess, vascular insufficiency, lymphedema, immunosuppression, acute kidney injury), and failure of treatment (progression despite apparently appropriate antibiotic and supportive therapy); factors that should lead to considering hospitalisation are severe infection, metabolic or haemodynamic instability, need for intravenous therapy or diagnostic tests not available as an outpatient, severe foot ischaemia, need for more than minor surgical procedures, failure of outpatient management, need for more complex dressing changes than patient/caregivers can provide, and need for careful, continuous observation.

### Cellulitis: diagnosis and management [^113EYPpq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute infection of the dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin, often occurring after a local skin trauma. It is a common diagnosis in both inpatient and outpatient dermatology, as well as in the primary care setting. Cellulitis classically presents with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness over the affected area. There are many other dermatologic diseases, which can present with similar findings, highlighting the need to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Some of the most common mimics of cellulitis include venous stasis dermatitis, contact dermatitis, deep vein thrombosis, and panniculitis. History, local characteristics of the affected area, systemic signs, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, skin biopsy can be helpful in confirming the correct diagnosis. Most patients can be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics, with dicloxacillin or cephalexin being the oral therapy of choice when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is not a concern.

### A single center retrospective review of hair tourniquet syndrome and a proposed treatment algorithm [^1132nyD9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hair tourniquet syndrome (HTS) is a rare disorder characterized by a hair becoming tightly wound around an appendage. There is little known about the epidemiology, optimal treatment, or indications for surgical intervention in HTS. We hypothesized that HTS could be readily diagnosed and treated in the pediatric emergency department and we sought out factors predictive of surgical intervention.

Methods

We performed a single center retrospective review of all patients who presented with a hair tourniquet from May 2004 till March 2014.

Results

Eighty-one patients were diagnosed with HTS, ranging in age from 2 weeks to 22 years. Of these patients, 69 were located on the toes, 5 on fingers, and 7 on genitalia. The average ages for each location were statistically different (p < 0.0001). Ninety-four percent of patients were successfully treated by nonoperative means. Cellulitis was found in two patients. Tissue necrosis occurred in one patient.

Conclusion

HTS is an uncommon disorder and location differs with age. Chemical depilatory agents should be a first line treatment for this condition in most patients. If chemical tourniquet release fails, then the patient should undergo mechanical tourniquet release. If edema, erythema and pain fail to resolve after tourniquet release, then persistent hair tourniquet should be investigated.

Regarding medical management for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, MRSA coverage, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to consider administering any of the following agents covering MRSA in hospitalized patients with complicated SSTI - such as deeper soft tissue infections, surgical/traumatic wound infection, major abscesses, cellulitis, or infected ulcers and burns - pending culture results, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics:

- IV vancomycin

- IV or PO linezolid 600 mg BID

- IV daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose once daily

- IV telavancin 10 mg/kg/dose once daily

- IV or PO clindamycin 600 mg TID.

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, 5 trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% CI were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

Results

A total of 43 studies with a total of 5999 evaluable participants, whose age ranged from 1 month to 96 years, were included. Cellulitis was the primary diagnosis in only 15 studies (35%), and in other studies the median(interquartile range) proportion of patients with cellulitis was 29.7% (22.9%-50.3%). Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, only low-quality evidence was found for the most appropriate agent, route of administration, and duration of treatment for patients with cellulitis; future trials need to use a standardized set of outcomes, including severity scoring, dosing, and duration of therapy.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^1171ENWw]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with Vibrio vulnificus infection, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to administer doxycycline PO/IV 100 mg BID for 7–14 days and a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftazidime 1–2 g IV/IM every 8 hours, as first-line therapy in patients with Vibrio vulnificus wound infections.
Recognize that a single-agent regimen with a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or gatifloxacin, has been reported to be at least as effective as a regimen with doxycycline and a cephalosporin in animal studies.

### Clinical overview of vibriosis [^113iffKH]. CDC (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with Vibrio vulnificus infection, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to administer TMP/SMX plus an aminoglycoside in pediatric patients with Vibrio vulnificus wound infections. Avoid using doxycycline or fluoroquinolones.

### Outcome assessment in cellulitis clinical trials: is telephone follow up sufficient? [^113Kcirx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration has scrutinized clinical trial methodology in cellulitis, partly because the definition and timing of cure are debatable. We analysed the validity of telephone self-report as a proxy for in-person follow up in a cellulitis treatment trial comparing cephalexin alone with cephalexin-plus-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Our results demonstrate poor agreement between these two methods of outcome determination and have implications for future cellulitis clinical trial design and clinical management.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112z7Dvu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^113c4h58]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Limb-threatening diabetic foot infection — definition, criteria, and urgent management are detailed: in the PEDIS system, limb-threatening infections are classified as grade 3 or 4, and because of diabetes-associated immunosuppression, up to 50% of patients with limb-threatening infections may exhibit no systemic symptoms or leukocytosis. Limb-threatening infections are recognized as having one or more of the following findings: greater than 2 cm of cellulitis around an ulcer, lymphangitis, soft tissue necrosis, fluctuance, odor, gangrene, osteomyelitis, and when such an infection is recognized, the patient requires emergent hospital admission for appropriate intervention. Radiographs are necessary to evaluate for evidence of osteomyelitis or soft tissue gas, and if gas is identified in the ankle or hindfoot, radiographs of the lower leg should be obtained to assess the extent of the gas formation. Blood cultures are required if clinical findings indicate septicemia, other appropriate laboratory studies, including CBC with differential and sedimentation rate, are obtained as warranted, glucose management must be initiated to optimize metabolic perturbations and improve leukocyte function, and the patient's nutritional and metabolic status must be assessed and properly maintained. Consultations are typically required in the risk assessment and management of these complex cases, a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these cases has been shown to significantly improve outcomes, and early surgical treatment of the affected site is typically necessary as an integral part of infection management; at the time of debridement, aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal tissue cultures should be obtained from the depth of the wound to provide reliability, and although many initial drainage procedures can be performed at the bedside for neuropathic patients, most require thorough debridement in the operating room.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^115z6nqP]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115vqqrL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cellulitis, more specifically with respect to patients with Vibrio vulnificus infection, IDSA 2014 guidelines recommend to administer doxycycline IV 100 mg every 12 hours plus a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone IV 1 g QID or cefotaxime IV 2 g TID) in patients with SSTI caused by Vibrio vulnificus. Consider administering this regimen in pediatric patients only in life-threatening situations.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qTzei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^114KLBse]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically-acquired cellulitis.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113nuWec]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^117EPjNH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is a common painful infection of the skin and underlying tissues that recurs in approximately one-third of cases. The only proven strategy to reduce the risk of recurrence is long-term, low-dose antibiotics. Given current concerns about antibiotic resistance and the pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing, other prevention strategies are needed.

Objectives

To explore patients' views about cellulitis and different ways of preventing recurrent episodes.

Methods

Adults aged ≥ 18 years with a history of first-episode or recurrent cellulitis were invited through primary care, hospitals and advertising to complete a survey, take part in an interview or both.

Results

Thirty interviews were conducted between August 2016 and July 2017. Two hundred and forty surveys were completed (response rate 17%). Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data showed that people who have had cellulitis have wide-ranging beliefs about what can cause cellulitis and are often unaware of risk of recurrence or potential strategies to prevent recurrence. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise and losing weight were more popular potential strategies than the use of compression stockings or long-term antibiotics. Participants expressed caution about long-term oral antibiotics, particularly those who had experienced only one episode of cellulitis.

Conclusions

People who have had cellulitis are keen to know about possible ways to prevent further episodes. Enhanced foot hygiene, applying emollients daily, exercise and losing weight were generally viewed to be more acceptable, feasible strategies than compression or antibiotics, but further research is needed to explore uptake and effectiveness in practice.

### Early response in cellulitis: a prospective study of dynamics and predictors [^115fP7Gu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of cellulitis, several nonpharmacological factors were associated with lack of early response. Such early nonresponse was rarely related to inappropriate therapy but strongly predictive of early treatment escalation, suggesting that broadening antibiotic treatment often may be premature.

### Cellulitis in chronic oedema [^1128Axfm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The novel findings from this publication are that one‐third of patients with chronic oedema are likely to develop cellulitis at some point. The worse the oedema, the more likely cellulitis is to occur; the better the oedema, the less likely cellulitis is to occur. The strengths of this publication are the large number of patients included for study and the international collaboration involving nine countries, indicating that chronic oedema predisposing to cellulitis is a global healthcare burden – at least in these countries. By targeting healthcare professionals with an interest in lymphoedema to identify patients, numbers may have been falsely elevated and more severe cases included compared with the population at large, but this does not undermine the value of the results. Unfortunately, data on recurrent cellulitis were not included and this is likely to be a common occurrence. As shown previously, cellulitis can be self‐perpetuating with past episodes making future episodes more likely. While prophylactic penicillin has been shown to be of value in preventing cellulitis, this study demonstrates the importance of controlling the chronic oedema in preventing cellulitis, a finding recently confirmed by the use of compression garments to prevent cellulitis. So often in healthcare, patients are treated for the acute episode of cellulitis and discharged without sufficient consideration being given to treatment of the risk factors, such as chronic oedema, skin disease and wounds. Dermatologists are well placed to manage such conditions and therefore should be more involved in cellulitis care. The Norwich model has shown the value of dermatological input for cellulitis, particularly as red legs do not always mean cellulitis and mismanagement frequently occurs.

### Fillet of toe flap coverage for non-traumatic foot amputations: a retrospective review of 70 patients [^117FEoXp]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Fillet of toe flap (FTF) leverages the "spare parts" algorithm in reconstructive surgery-utilizing tissue from amputated or otherwise non-salvageable body parts, thus avoiding donor-site morbidity. This study assesses the efficacy of FTF coverage in non-traumatic foot amputations. A retrospective review of patients undergoing foot amputation with FTF coverage between January 2013 to August 2023 was conducted. Patient characteristics, operative details, and outcomes were collected. Primary outcome was FTF survival (no necrosis ≤ 7 days postoperatively). Secondary outcome was acute complications (≤ 42 days postoperatively). A total of 70 patients were included. Mean age was 65.0 ± 13.7 years. Median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.0–7.0). The most common wound location was the hallux (n = 34). In 45 (64.2%) patients with preoperative angiography, the patency rates were: first dorsal metatarsal artery (n = 10, 22.2%), lateral plantar artery (n = 7, 15.6%), medial plantar artery (n = 6, 13.3%), and dorsalis pedis artery (n = 4, 8.9%). Mean follow-up duration was 9.0 (IQR: 32) months. Fifteen (21.4%) patients experienced at least one acute complication: deep surgical site infection (SSI; i.e., abscess, gangrenous necrosis; n = 13, 18.6%) and cellulitis (n = 7, 10.0%). Eleven (15.7%) patients required reoperation for debridement (n = 4, 5.7%), wound closure (n = 4, 5.7%), flap necrosis (n = 3, 4.3%), incision and drainage (n = 1, 1.4%), split-thickness skin grafting (n = 1, 1.4%), and foreign body exploration (n = 1, 1.4%). FTF survival was 94.2% (n = 66). FTF facilitates reconstruction in complex cases and should be integrated into each chronic LE wound algorithm to avoid additional donor-site morbidity, and to facilitate stump-length preservation or limb salvage.
