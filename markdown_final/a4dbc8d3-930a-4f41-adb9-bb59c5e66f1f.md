## Question

what is typhlitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what typhlitis is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why the cecum is uniquely vulnerable. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, followed by clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria. After that, I need to check imaging features and how they guide prognosis. Then, I will examine management principles, including antibiotics, nutrition, and when to operate. Finally, I should consider special populations, outcomes, and how to distinguish typhlitis from similarly named but unrelated entities like typhoid fever.

> Let me first confirm the definition and synonyms so I don't mislabel the entity. Typhlitis, also called neutropenic enterocolitis or ileocecal syndrome, is a life-threatening necrotizing inflammation of the cecum (and often terminal ileum and ascending colon) occurring in the setting of profound neutropenia, classically after cytotoxic chemotherapy, with risk of ischemia, necrosis, perforation, and sepsis [^e9f1b0d7] [^8703ef8b] [^99a7d221].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. The cecum is predisposed due to relatively poor arterial perfusion and high bacterial load; chemotherapy injures the mucosa, and with ANC near zero, bacteria invade the wall, producing edema, ulceration, ischemia, and necrosis that can progress to perforation and septic shock; this mechanistic triad of mucosal injury, neutropenia, and bacterial invasion is consistently described across sources [^e9f1b0d7] [^8703ef8b] [^7575b003].

> I need to check who gets this and how often. Historically tied to hematologic malignancies (AML, ALL, lymphoma), typhlitis is increasingly reported with solid tumors and newer agents; incidence varies by cohort and definition, with pediatric oncology series around 1–7% and adult series 0.8–26% in high-risk contexts, and it typically arises 1–2 weeks after chemotherapy initiation when neutropenia is deepest [^e691130f] [^a1b76246] [^e62ff13b] [^710ee3c2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about triggers; I should confirm drug associations. Beyond classic induction regimens, taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), topotecan, pemetrexed, and capecitabine have all been linked to typhlitis in regulatory labeling and case reports, sometimes despite G-CSF prophylaxis, underscoring that neutropenia alone does not fully explain risk and that mucosal toxicity contributes [^511de1ef] [^24044510] [^2377ae12] [^f8e65fe8].

> Next, I should review the clinical triad so I don't miss the diagnosis. The hallmark is fever, abdominal pain (often right lower quadrant), and profound neutropenia; diarrhea may be present but is not universal, and symptoms can be muted in immunosuppressed hosts, so a high index of suspicion is essential in febrile neutropenia with abdominal pain [^e9f1b0d7] [^8703ef8b] [^e72283cd].

> I will now examine imaging because it changes management. CT is the diagnostic modality of choice, showing bowel wall thickening (> 5–10 mm) in the cecum/terminal ileum, mesenteric stranding, pneumatosis, and free air if perforated; ultrasound can demonstrate wall thickening and complications but is operator-dependent; importantly, bowel wall thickness > 10 mm correlates with markedly higher mortality, which should escalate vigilance and supportive intensity [^e72283cd] [^bc64ca21].

> Let me think about management principles and make sure I align with guidelines. Conservative therapy is first-line: strict bowel rest (NPO/NGT as needed), aggressive IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics with antipseudomonal coverage (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem), adding antifungals only if fever persists without defervescence or if fungal disease is suspected; early surgical consultation is mandatory, but surgery is reserved for perforation, uncontrolled bleeding, or clinical deterioration despite optimal medical therapy [^e9f1b0d7] [^e62ff13b] [^c79ba1f8].

> But wait, what if the patient is deteriorating and I'm unsure whether to operate? I should double-check the mortality signal with surgery in this population. Emergency surgery in actively neutropenic, physiologically deranged patients carries extremely high mortality (up to 57–81% in some series), so a damage-control approach with staged procedures and delayed anastomosis is favored when operation is unavoidable; this reinforces the principle to avoid laparotomy unless absolutely indicated [^c79ba1f8].

> I need to ensure supportive care is comprehensive. Total parenteral nutrition is reasonable when enteral feeding is not tolerated for more than several days, particularly in children and those with prolonged mucositis; serial clinical reassessment and repeat imaging guide recovery, and neutrophil recovery strongly correlates with symptom resolution, which helps set expectations and timing for diet advancement [^6d796f15] [^e9f1b0d7] [^e72283cd].

> Let me consider special populations and nuances. In pediatrics, typhlitis is relatively more common and often managed successfully without surgery, though appendiceal thickening on imaging may herald complications and warrants closer monitoring; in stem cell transplant recipients, early broad-spectrum therapy including antifungal coverage is commonly used given the high risk of invasive fungal disease; and in older adults, comorbidities and delayed recognition increase risk, so a lower threshold for ICU-level care is reasonable [^a1b76246] [^4b88df65] [^ddc36428] [^e72283cd].

> I should confirm outcomes and prognostic factors. Mortality has fallen with earlier recognition and supportive care but remains substantial in high-risk cohorts, with mortality higher when bowel wall thickness exceeds 10 mm, when perforation occurs, or when surgery is required; conversely, rapid neutrophil recovery and response to antibiotics within 48–72 hours portend better outcomes, which should be communicated during family discussions [^e72283cd] [^e9f1b0d7].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating typhlitis with typhoid fever, which sounds similar but is entirely different. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella Typhi/Paratyphi with different epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management; typhlitis is a chemotherapy-associated neutropenic enterocolitis of the cecum. Keeping these entities separate prevents misdirected diagnostics and therapeutics [^f1662adf] [^44d24f33].

> In summary, typhlitis is a necrotizing cecal inflammation occurring in profound chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, driven by mucosal injury and bacterial invasion; it presents with fever, abdominal pain, and neutropenia, is confirmed by CT evidence of cecal/terminal ileal wall thickening, and is managed conservatively with bowel rest, fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, reserving surgery for perforation or refractory deterioration; early recognition and supportive care are the keys to reducing mortality in this high-risk oncology population [^e9f1b0d7] [^e62ff13b] [^e72283cd].

---

Typhlitis, also called **neutropenic enterocolitis**, is a life-threatening inflammation of the cecum and terminal ileum in immunocompromised patients — especially those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [^e9f1b0d7]. It presents with **fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea** [^8703ef8b], and is diagnosed by CT showing bowel wall thickening [^e72283cd]; colonoscopy is avoided due to perforation risk [^e9f1b0d7]. Management is **conservative**: bowel rest, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics [^e62ff13b]; surgery is reserved for perforation, uncontrolled bleeding, or clinical deterioration [^c79ba1f8]. Mortality is high (20–50%) [^notfound], so early recognition and aggressive supportive care are critical [^e9f1b0d7].

---

## Pathophysiology

Typhlitis arises from **chemotherapy-induced mucosal injury** [^8703ef8b] plus **profound neutropenia**, which allows bacterial invasion of the bowel wall, leading to inflammation, ischemia, and necrosis [^e9f1b0d7]. The cecum is especially vulnerable due to its relatively poor blood supply and high bacterial load [^7575b003].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Fever**: Universal [^c5310121].
- **Abdominal pain**: Often right lower quadrant [^bc64ca21].
- **Diarrhea**: May be bloody [^e9f1b0d7].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common [^8703ef8b].
- **Peritoneal signs**: Late, indicating perforation [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and imaging

Diagnosis is clinical plus imaging; **CT is the gold standard** [^e72283cd], showing:

- **Bowel wall thickening**: Especially cecum/terminal ileum [^bc64ca21].
- **Pericolonic fat stranding**: Suggesting inflammation [^bc64ca21].
- **Free air**: Indicates perforation [^bc64ca21].

Ultrasound can show bowel wall thickening but is less sensitive than CT [^e72283cd]. Colonoscopy is **contraindicated** due to perforation risk [^e9f1b0d7].

---

## Management

### Conservative management

First-line care includes:

- **Bowel rest**: NPO with NG decompression if ileus [^bc64ca21].
- **Broad-spectrum antibiotics**: Cover gram-negatives and anaerobes (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenem) [^e72283cd].
- **Supportive care**: IV fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition (TPN if needed) [^6d796f15].
- **G-CSF**: To hasten neutrophil recovery [^f879c3d8].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **absolute indications**:

- **Perforation**: Free air or peritonitis [^c79ba1f8].
- **Uncontrolled bleeding**: Transfusion-refractory [^e9f1b0d7].
- **Clinical deterioration**: Despite optimal medical therapy [^e9f1b0d7].

Given high surgical morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients, a damage-control approach with staged procedures is often used [^c79ba1f8].

---

## Prognosis

Typhlitis carries high mortality (20–50%) [^notfound], especially with perforation, delayed diagnosis, or persistent neutropenia [^e72283cd]. Early recognition and aggressive supportive care improve outcomes [^f879c3d8].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **risk stratification**, **monitoring**, and **supportive care**:

- **Risk assessment**: Identify high-risk patients (e.g. leukemia, high-dose chemotherapy) [^e62ff13b].
- **Prophylactic G-CSF**: Reduces neutropenia duration [^notfound].
- **Early symptom recognition**: Educate patients and clinicians [^notfound].
- **Prompt imaging**: Use CT early for suspected cases [^e72283cd].

---

Typhlitis is a **chemotherapy-related emergency** marked by cecal inflammation in neutropenic patients; **early CT and conservative therapy** are essential, with surgery only for complications [^e62ff13b].

### Pemetrexed-induced typhlitis in non-small cell lung cancer [^2377ae12]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Pemetrexed is U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved as a second line, single-agent treatment of recurrent metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Gastrointestinal side effects, including stomatitis, diarrhea, and vomiting are reported to be less than 1% and rarely severe. In the premetrexed clinical trial database of 1327 patients, various types of colitis were reported by a total of nine patients (0.6%). Typhilitis is a gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy, which presents as fever and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is supported by the findings of bowel wall thickening on computed tomographic imaging. Typhilitis is usually seen in the setting of severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia for acute leukemia. Nevertheless, it is increasingly recognized as a complication of therapy in solid tumors. We present the first documented case of typhilitis after treatment with pemetrexed and successful therapy with supportive treatment.

Typhlitis and neutropenic enterocolitis

Typhlitis and neutropenic enterocolitis carry a high mortality rate because of the risk of rapid progression to ischaemia, necrosis, haemorrhage, perforation and multisystem organ failure. Typhlitis follows chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and is characterised by inflammation localised to the caecal wall, possibly caused by bacterial invasion. If other parts of the GI tract are involved (eg, the terminal ileal wall or elsewhere), the term 'neutropenic enterocolitis' is more appropriate. Bowel wall thickening with or without dilation is usually seen on cross-sectional imaging. Clinical features include fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Colonoscopy is contraindicated as it carries a very high risk of perforation.

Data on the optimal management are limited. Bowel rest, intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, broad spectrum antibiotics and normalisation of neutrophil counts are usually recommended. When inflammation is limited to the caecum and terminal ileum, clinical experience suggests that most patients can be managed conservatively. The presence of a local mass needs repeated imaging to exclude abscess formation or perforation. Perforation, persistent GI bleeding and clinical deterioration may mandate surgical intervention. As in the management of any acute severe colitis, frequent clinical reassessment and early surgical consultation is advised.

### COVID-19-associated pancytopenia and typhlitis [^c1430a40]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Neutropenic enterocolitis is also known as typhlitis, is characterized by severe inflammation in the bowel loops. It is often seen in immunosuppressed patients, and it has high morbidity and mortality. Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory system and causes COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), it may affect hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems. Herein, we present a rare case of COVID-19-associated pancytopenia and typhlitis in a 60-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated the bowel wall thickening in the cecum and ascending colon compatible with enterocolitis. Moreover, the chest CT showed bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. We also aimed to emphasize the laboratory, clinical, and CT findings of the patient.

### Impact of usp18 and IFN signaling in Salmonella-induced typhlitis [^7bd2d0b4]. Genes and Immunity (2011). Low credibility.

In humans, Salmonella infection causes two major clinical diseases, typhoid fever and a self-limiting gastro-enteritidis. Salmonella transmission occurs by the fecal-oral route and the interactions between the bacteria and the digestive tract epithelium are central to the outcome of the infection. Using a mouse model of typhoid fever, we previously identified a mutation in USP18 affecting type I interferon (IFN) signaling resulting in increased susceptibility to systemic Salmonella infection. In this study, we demonstrate the effects of this mutation during the early response to Salmonella using a model of typhlitis. Mutant Usp18 mice showed a minimal inflammatory response early after Salmonella Typhimurium infection that was associated with low pathologic scores and low IFN-γ production. This resulted in an increased interaction of Salmonella with the cecal epithelium and earlier systemic dissemination of the bacteria. The global transcriptional signature in the cecum of mouse during Salmonella infection showed normal expression of tissue specific genes and upregulation of type I IFN pathway in mutant mice. In control mice, there was a significant over-representation of genes involved in cellular recruitment and antibacterial activity paralleling the histopathological features. These results show the impact of USP18 in the development of Salmonella-induced typhlitis.

### Neutropenic enterocolitis [^8703ef8b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Neutropenic enterocolitis, also known as typhlitis or ileocecal syndrome, is a rare but important complication of neutropenia associated with malignancy. It occurs as a result of chemotherapeutic damage to the intestinal mucosa in the context of an absolute neutropenia, and can rapidly progress to intestinal perforation, multisystem organ failure, and sepsis. Presenting signs and symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Rapid identification by emergency physicians and timely, aggressive medical and/or surgical intervention are the cornerstones of survival for these patients.

### Diagnosis, incidence, and outcomes of suspected typhlitis in oncology patients – experience in a tertiary pediatric surgical center in the United Kingdom [^a1b76246]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Typhlitis is clinically defined by the triad of neutropenia, abdominal pain, and fever. Radiologic evidence of colonic inflammation supports the diagnosis. We report a single United Kingdom tertiary center experience with management and outcome of typhlitis for 5 years.

Methods

Hospital computerized records were screened for ultrasound or computerized tomographic scan requests for abdominal pain for all oncology inpatients (2001–2005). Retrospective case note analysis was used to collect clinical data for patients with features of typhlitis.

Results

The incidence of typhlitis among oncology inpatients was 6.7% (40/596) among oncology inpatients and 11.6% (40/345) among those on chemotherapy. Eighteen children had radiologically confirmed typhlitis, and 22 had clinical features alone. Most (93%) patients responded to conservative management. Eighteen children had a variable period of bowel rest, including 12 patients who were supported with total parenteral nutrition. Three patients had laparotomy that revealed extensive colonic bowel necrosis (1), perforated gastric ulcer (1), and a perforated appendix (1). A single child died of fulminant gram-negative sepsis without surgical intervention.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of typhlitis was based on clinical features, supported by radiologic evidence in almost half of the study group. Surgical intervention should be reserved for specific complications or where another surgical pathologic condition cannot reasonably be ruled out.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^8b50e64e]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Examples of conditions likely to require parenteral nutrition (PN) — impaired absorption or loss of nutrients — include short bowel syndrome with bowel length — adults: 60 cm with colon in continuity and 120 cm without colon in continuity, neonate and pediatric inability to meet nutrient, electrolyte, and fluid requirements regardless of intestinal length, and high output intestinal fistula (more than 500 mL/d); related clinical features include typhlitis or opportunistic infection in an immune-compromised patient and intractable diarrhea, weight loss, failure to thrive, unresponsive to medical management.

### Typhlitis complicating induction therapy in adult acute myeloid leukemia [^f879c3d8]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

In a retrospective analysis of 161 consecutive adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia undergoing induction therapy, including cytarabine, etoposide and anthracyclines, seven patients (4.3%) developed typhlitis. All presented severe neutropenia, fever, abdominal pain and tenderness within 16 days from starting chemotherapy (median 11 days; range 5–16). Three patients underwent surgery and survived, four were treated only with supportive therapy: two recovered and two died. In our experience early recognition of typhlitis and rapid recovery of the neutrophils are the most important determinants of the results of surgical and/or medical approaches. The management of typhlitis, a life-threatening condition, is controversial and depends on many factors characterizing each patient, which must be evaluated in collaboration between the surgeon and the hematologist.

### Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) associated with infectious mononucleosis [^634801eb]. Pediatric Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) is an unusual acute complication of neutropenia, most often associated with leukaemia and lymphoma and characterized by segmental caecal and ascending colonic ulceration that may progress to necrosis, perforation, and septicaemia. We present a unique case of an 8-year-old girl with recently diagnosed infectious mononucleosis having findings consistent with typhlitis on abdominal CT.

### Successful nonoperative management of typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients [^f595c36e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

The optimal management for typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients has not always been clear from the medical literature. Trends have varied between operative and nonoperative approaches. The aim of this study was to review the successful nonoperative management of these patients at our institution over the last decade to further clarify management guidelines for this difficult problem.

Methods

Medical records of pediatric hematology and oncology patients up to 21 years of age with typhlitis diagnosed at the DeVos Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2000 were reviewed.

Results

Twelve patients were included. Ten patients (83%) with computed tomography (CT) scans suggestive of the diagnosis were treated successfully nonoperatively. Management usually included bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental parenteral nutrition. Two patients (17%) in whom CT scans were not obtained underwent surgery for presumed appendicitis and pneumoperitoneum, respectively. Typhlitis was found incidentally. In the latter patient, the pneumoperitoneum resulted from a perforated jejunum caused by graft-versus-host disease. This patient died of septic complications and was the only mortality in the series (8%).

Conclusions

Pediatric cancer patients with typhlitis can be treated carefully nonoperatively with bowel rest, antibiotics, and supplemental nutrition. Usual indications for surgery (ie, perforation, clinical deterioration) still should be used. The early use of CT scanning helps to facilitate the diagnosis and may provide the ability to differentiate typhlitis from other abdominal diseases for which surgery would be indicated.

### Neutropenic enterocolitis [^710ee3c2]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will cover the recent literature pertaining to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of patients with neutropenic enterocolitis.

Recent Findings

Neutropenic enterocolitis, also referred to as typhlitis, is a life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy, most often associated with leukemia or lymphoma. Recently, a larger number of reports have been published of individuals presenting with this syndrome after being treated with newer chemotherapeutic agents for solid tumors such as non-small cell lung, ovarian, and peritoneal cancer, as well as following autologous stem cell transplantation. Recent studies have also better characterized computed tomographic and ultrasonographic features of this entity that can help differentiate neutropenic enterocolitis from other gastrointestinal complications. A newly published systematic analysis of the literature, which included 145 articles, defines appropriate diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations.

Summary

Neutropenic enterocolitis is a serious, potentially lethal complication of anticancer therapy. The studies discussed in this review will help the practitioner make an appropriate, early diagnosis and implement a therapeutic program that would improve the outcome of these patients.

### Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) after pediatric bone marrow transplant [^ddc36428]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) is a common consideration after bone marrow transplantation. This study reviews the authors' experience with abdominal pain and typhlitis in an active pediatric bone marrow transplant program.

Methods

The Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program Database was reviewed for patients presenting with abdominal pain or typhlitis.

Results

From 1993 to 2000 a total of 142 transplants have been performed. Of these, 97 patients had abdominal pain, and 5 had radiologically proven typhlitis. Nonspecific abdominal pain developed on the 12 ± 11th day posttransplant, whereas patients in whom typhlitis developed were diagnosed on day 15.5 ± 7. All patients were treated with prophylactic antibiotics consisting of acyclovir, fluconazole, and septra. With the onset of abdominal pain, 73 of 97 patients were placed on therapeutic antibiotics; patients identified with typhlitis had amphotericin plus GCSF added. No clinical features differentiated abdominal pain patients from typhlitis. Oral feeding and time of discharge was similar in both groups. Surgical intervention was not required, and no patients died with typhlitis.

Conclusions

Abdominal pain is a common symptom after bone marrow transplant; however, typhlitis is relatively rare, and surgical intervention was not required in this series. Broad-spectrum (including fungal) antibiotic therapy appears to be an effective treatment for typhlitis in this patient population.

### British society of gastroenterology practice guidance on the management of acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and complications as a result of treatment for cancer [^74773608]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a wider differential diagnosis for these symptoms in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation and includes mucositis secondary to conditioning therapy, atypical infection, typhlitis, side effects of other drugs and GvHD. In the early post-transplant period before engraftment has occurred these symptoms usually relate to the conditioning regimen. Typhlitis is usually managed conservatively in the neutropenic patient and surgery should be reserved for patients with abdominal perforation. Acute GvHD can occur following engraftment of the donor cells and targets the skin, liver and GI tract. It usually occurs in the first 3 months following the transplant although later onset is possible.

Biomarkers are not widely used in clinical practice. Endoscopic investigations with biopsies can be helpful. Upper GI endoscopy with small bowel aspiration for microbiological analysis and biopsy should be considered in those with predominantly upper GI symptoms. Although the yield of diagnostic accuracy is slightly higher with a colonoscopy, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is significantly safer in this patient group. Small bowel capsule endoscopy is not specific for acute GvHD. Biopsies can be difficult to interpret in GvHD and a detailed clinical history as well as review by an expert histopathologist together with the haematologist and gastroenterologist is required.

Chronic GvHD is characterised by distinctive and diagnostic features and can include oral and oesophageal involvement. The diagnosis of oesophageal involvement includes oesophageal web or strictures seen on endoscopy or barium studies.

Treatment of both acute and chronic GvHD is determined by the severity of the disease and includes supportive measures as well as corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs. Recent European guidelines provide an overview of specific treatment options. Patients with severe acute GvHD are likely to need nutritional support with parenteral nutrition. If there is a delay in obtaining biopsy samples and results then corticosteroids should be started based on clinical assessment of the patient.

Patients are at higher risk of second cancers following a stem cell transplant and should be encouraged to participate in national bowel cancer screening programmes. There should be a low threshold for investigating new GI symptoms in order to exclude secondary malignancy.

### Typhlitis as a complication of alemtuzumab therapy [^f2828449]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against lymphocytes through the CD-52 receptor, an antigen being found on > 95% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes, and to a smaller extent on granulocytes. It is an effective immunotherapeutic agent in patients with malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T cell pro- lymphocytic leukemia. Adverse side effects are increasingly recognized in patients receiving alemtuzumab, mainly including fever, rigors, nausea/vomiting, skin rash; other severe alemtuzumab-related reactions have also been described, such as lymphopenia and neutropenia leading to both opportunistic (e.g. cytomegalovirus) and non-opportunistic infections. Digestive complications have more rarely been described, i.e.: gastroenteritis and peritonitis. We recently observed a case of particular interest as the patient with T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia treated with alemtuzumab, exhibited symptomatic reactivation of CMV infection and developed subsequently typhlitis.

### Gastrointestinal complications in children with acute myeloid leukemia [^9b357488]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2010). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal complications in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been systematically described in the literature. Our objective was to describe complications related to the small and large bowel in children with AML. Literature searches were conducted of Ovid Medline from 1950 to November 2009 and EMBASE from 1980 to November 2009. We included any study design that described gastrointestinal complications in children and/or adults with AML. Common gastrointestinal complications were typhlitis and enterocolitis. Less common complications included appendicitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, and perianal infections. Both leukemia infiltration and intensive chemotherapy likely play a role in the etiology of these conditions. There is a paucity of carefully conducted studies that describe the natural history of typhlitis and enterocolitis and evidence is needed to help guide the management of gastrointestinal complications. Gastrointestinal complications are relatively common in children with AML. Conduction of carefully performed cohort studies is needed to better understand the spectrum of symptoms and expected consequences of gastrointestinal complications. Randomized trials are required to develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of gastrointestinal complications in pediatric AML.

### Significance of appendiceal thickening in association with typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients [^4b88df65]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The management of pediatric oncology patients with imaging evidence of appendiceal thickening is complex because they are generally poor surgical candidates and often have confounding clinical findings.

Objective

We sought to determine the significance of appendiceal thickening in pediatric oncology patients who also had typhlitis. Specifically, we evaluated the impact of this finding on the duration of typhlitis, its clinical management, and outcome.

Materials and Methods

From a previous review of the management of typhlitis in 90 children with cancer at our institution, we identified 4 with imaging evidence of appendiceal thickening. We compared colonic wall measurements, duration of typhlitis symptoms, management, and outcome of patients with appendiceal thickening and typhlitis to patients with typhlitis alone.

Results

There was no significant difference in duration of typhlitis symptoms between patients with typhlitis only (15.6 ± 1.2 days) and those with typhlitis and appendiceal thickening (14.5 ± 5.8 days; P = 0.9). Two patients with appendiceal thickening required surgical treatment for ischemic bowel, and two were treated medically. Only one patient in the typhlitis without appendiceal thickening group required surgical intervention. There were no deaths in children with appendiceal thickening; two patients died of complications of typhlitis alone.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that appendiceal thickening does not predict a prolonged course of typhlitis in pediatric oncology patients, but it may indicate an increased risk of serious complications from this disease process.

### Complications and mortality of typhoid fever: an updated global systematic review and meta-analysis [^187a324b]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Updated estimates of the prevalence of complications and case-fatality ratio (CFR) among patients with typhoid fever are needed to inform typhoid fever prevention and control. To support country-level decisions on typhoid prevention and control with contemporary estimates of morbidity and mortality, we updated our 2020 review.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-surgical (typhoid fever) and surgical (typhoid intestinal perforation [TIP]) observational studies and control groups of vaccine trials that reported on typhoid fever complications or mortality. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and eight preprint repositories using the keywords Salmonella Typhi, mortality, case fatality, died, death, complications, perforation, and haemorrhage, for reports published from Jan 1, 1980, to June 11, 2025, inclusive. Summary data were abstracted from published reports. We synthesised the prevalence of individual predefined complications, pooled CFR estimates using random-effects meta-analysis, and stratified prevalences by UN region, subregion, setting of recruitment, and age groups. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020166998).

Findings

Of 167 included reports, 106 (63%) were included from the 2020 review and 61 (37%) from the updated searches. 119 (71%) non-surgical reports provided data from 160 study sites among 29933 patients with typhoid, and 48 (29%) surgical reports provided data from 62 study sites among 4486 patients with TIP. Delirium or confusion was the most prevalent typhoid fever complication, reported in 706 (26·5%) of 2662 typhoid cases. TIP was reported in 108 (1·7%) of 6362 typhoid cases. The overall pooled typhoid CFR was 2·1% (95% CI 1·7–2·7). The pooled typhoid CFR was 2·9% (1·1–7·1; I² = 70·0%) in the Americas, 4·7% (3·1–6·8; I² = 62·6%) in Africa, and 1·2% (1·0–1·7; I² = 57·6%) in Asia; 2·3% (1·8–3·0; I² = 77·7%) in facility-based recruitment sites; 0·9% (0·5–1·7; I² = 0·0%) in community-based recruitment sites; and 2·7% (1·8–4·0; I² = 73·4%) among patients aged 15 years or younger, and 1·8% (1·3–2·4; I² = 70·6%) for mixed ages. The overall pooled TIP CFR was 16·3% (13·4–20·0).

Interpretation

We identified substantial ongoing morbidity and mortality due to typhoid fever in Africa and Asia, in facility-based sites, and across age groups. This updated evidence can be used to support decisions on vaccine and non-vaccine measures to prevent and control typhoid fever and TIP.

### Typhoid fever: pathogenesis and disease [^ad87232c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Typhoid fever is an infectious disease of global distribution. Although there is a wealth of data on Salmonella typhimurium infection in the mouse and the interaction of this serovar with human cell lines in vitro, there is a relatively small amount of data on S. typhi and the pathogenesis of typhoid fever. In this review we focus on three areas: adherence to and invasion of gut epithelial cells, dissemination to systemic sites, and survival and replication within host cells. In addition, we attempt to put current salmonella research into the context of typhoid fever.

### Management of uncommon chemotherapy-induced emergencies [^613cd4e0]. The Lancet: Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy can induce various clinical emergencies. Prompt recognition and management of these adverse events are important for avoiding further morbidity and mortality. Some events such as hypersensitivity and extravasation are quite common, whereas emergencies such as neutropenic typhlitis, pancreatitis, and acute haemolysis are very rare. Little information exists on the management of rare chemotherapy-induced emergencies that affect fewer than 1% of patients. We review these uncommon chemotherapy-induced life-threatening emergencies, their pathogenesis and management, and recommendations for rechallenge with the offending chemotherapy.

5.4 Enterocolitis and Neutropenic Colitis

Enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis (typhlitis) have occurred in patients treated with docetaxel alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, despite the coadministration of G-CSF. Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. Enterocolitis and neutropenic enterocolitis may develop at any time, and could lead to death as early as the first day of symptom onset. Monitor patients closely from onset of any symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity. Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider with new, or worsening symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy. Do not rechallenge patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions with docetaxel [see Contraindications (4)].

Patients who have previously experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel that may include severe or fatal reactions such as anaphylaxis. Monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel closely during initiation of docetaxel therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^6d796f15]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition in other pediatric conditions — Outside of intestinal failure, PN use is limited to those who cannot tolerate adequate oral intake or enteral nutrition (EN) or who have preexisting malnutrition, including the critically ill and those with cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or renal failure. For patients receiving cancer treatment or after stem cell transplant, PN use is reserved for severe mucositis, typhlitis, intestinal obstruction, and intractable vomiting. In IBD, PN has little role except with fistula, obstruction, toxic megacolon, or bowel resection resulting in SBS. In pediatric chronic kidney disease, PN is indicated only if the child cannot take in enough enterally to prevent malnutrition when there is accompanying gastrointestinal dysfunction.

### Typhoid conjugate vaccines for preventing typhoid fever (enteric fever) [^98398c95]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Typhoid fever is a major cause of enteric disease-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccination reduces disease burden and prevents outbreaks, but policies and programmes should be informed by the most recent evidence as newer vaccines become available.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) compared to no vaccine, placebo, typhoid-inactive agents (vaccines for another disease) or other typhoid vaccines for preventing morbidity and mortality associated with typhoid fever in adults and children.

Search Methods

In April 2024, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the World Health Organization vaccine repository for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with no restrictions. We also searched clinical trial registries for ongoing trials (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), grey literature, bibliographic citations of reviews and key articles for additional studies. We contacted study authors for information about ongoing studies.

Eligibility Criteria

We included RCTs and cluster-RCTs of children and adults living in typhoid-endemic areas or travelling to typhoid-endemic areas. We included studies comparing TCVs to controls (i.e. no vaccine, placebo or vaccines for another disease), non-conjugated typhoid vaccines or other TCVs.

Outcomes

Outcomes included acute typhoid fever, defined by laboratory-confirmed isolation of Salmonella typhi, all-cause mortality, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

Risk Of Bias

Review authors independently assessed risk of bias for all outcomes, using the Cochrane RoB 2 tools. We resolved disagreements through discussion or adjudication. We assessed the intention-to-treat effect and used the overall RoB judgement to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Synthesis Methods

Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for eligible studies, followed by full-text assessment. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or adjudication by a fourth author. Four authors independently extracted characteristics of included studies and outcome data using a piloted, standardised data extraction form. We synthesised results for each outcome where possible, using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method and random-effects analysis model. Where meta-analysis was not possible due to the nature of the data, we planned to synthesise results based on direction of effect. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome, assessing risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and other bias.

Included Studies

We included 19 trials (17 RCTs and two cluster-RCTs). The 19 trials enrolled 395,650 participants, with ages ranging from six weeks to 60 years. Vaccines were delivered as a single dose in 14 studies; two doses, ranging from four to 24 weeks apart, in six studies; and three doses, four weeks apart, in one study. Comparators included: no vaccine, placebo and other vaccines. Seven studies compared TCV with non-conjugated typhoid vaccines. Six studies compared one TCV to another TCV.

Synthesis Of Results

TCV compared to control may result in a large reduction in acute typhoid fever (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.32; I² = 70%; 6 studies, 101,896 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.85; I² = 52%; 4 studies, 100,337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). TCV results in little to no difference in AEs when compared to control (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 29,465 participants; high-certainty evidence) and a slight reduction in SAEs compared to control (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 89,625 participants; high-certainty evidence). TCV compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines may result in little to no difference in acute typhoid fever (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.69; 1 study, 78 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no deaths in the included studies. When compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines, TCV likely results in little to no difference in AEs (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.31; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 244 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely results in a slight reduction in SAEs (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.88; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For TCV compared to another TCV, none of the studies reported on acute typhoid fever. Vi tetanus toxoid vaccine (Vi-TT) may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality compared to a different TCV (RR 5.19, 95% CI 0.54 to 49.80; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 2422 participants; low-certainty evidence). Vi-TT likely results in little to no difference in AEs compared to another TCV (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.51; I² = 39%; 4 studies, 2916 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in SAEs (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.74 to 8.36; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 2866 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was consistently reduced due to imprecision, indirectness and bias.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights that TCVs, compared to controls, are effective in preventing typhoid fever, and may confer protection for up to four years. TCVs compared to non-conjugated typhoid vaccines may result in little to no difference in acute typhoid fever and AEs, and likely result in a slight reduction in SAEs. Vi-TT compared to another TCV may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality or SAEs, and likely results in little to no difference in AEs.

### Is routine computed tomographic scanning justified in the first week of persistent febrile neutropenia in children with malignancies? [^00a909fb]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a common problem in pediatric oncology and often leads to empiric computed tomography (CT) of the sinuses, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Little evidence is available as to the diagnostic utility of CT in this setting.

Procedure

We performed a retrospective review of all oncology patients admitted to the hospital from January 2004 through December 2008 for FN who had daily fevers with neutropenia for 4 or more consecutive days prompting CT evaluation. Eligible patient charts were reviewed for symptomatology prior to imaging as well as antibiotic and antifungal regimens throughout therapy.

Results

Fifty-two patients had 68 unique episodes of prolonged FN that resulted in CT imaging. Positive findings occurred in 18%, 12%, and 25% of initial chest, abdomen, and sinus CTs, respectively. There were no positive findings on initial pelvic CT. Only two of the initial positive CT scans led to a change in management (6.5% of positive scans, 0.8% of all initial scans). These were both scans of the chest. All patients with concern for occult fungal infection had findings on chest CT. Patients with clinically important infections had no statistical difference in days of fever or neutropenia or type of underlying malignancy compared with those without infection. Clinical symptomatology was most helpful for typhlitis.

Conclusions

Treatment alteration rarely results from empiric CT imaging in the early days of prolonged FN. We therefore recommend limiting initial empiric CT imaging to the chest only in patients without localizing signs or symptoms and prolonged FN.

### Embolisation for caecal bleeding in a child with typhlitis [^4b840280]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old girl being treated for a relapse of promyelocytic leukaemia developed typhlitis of the caecum and ascending colon related to Klebsiella septicaemia during the neutropenic phase, 2 weeks after the start of induction treatment with chemotherapy. After 10 days of treatment with parenteral feeding and antibiotics, massive rectal blood loss occurred, causing haemodynamic instability. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed contrast extravasation in the caecal lumen. This life-threatening situation prompted visceral angiography, which confirmed a contrast blush in the caecum. Subsequent embolisation resulted in haemodynamic stability.

### Concomitant typhlitis and Clostridium difficile colitis developed after first R-CHOP chemotherapy in a non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient [^865866d0]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Typhlitis or neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening condition that occurs in neutropenic patients. Early recognition is crucial owing to high death rate. We present a case of a 54-year-old man, diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received a first cycle of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), oncovin (vincristine), prednisolone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy 10 days prior presenting. He developed fever, mucositis, watery diarrhoea and right lower quadrant pain with rebound tenderness. He also had neutropenia, with an absolute neutrophil count of zero. CT abdomen confirmed the diagnosis of typhlitis, demonstrating characteristic terminal ileum, caecal and right-sided colon involvement. Moreover, stool PCR was also positive for toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with concomitant typhlitis and C difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). He was empirically treated with intravenous cefepime, intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin. His symptoms resolved in 10 days. This case illustrated a successful medical treatment of typhlitis in concomitance with CDAD.

### Investigating neutropenic enterocolitis: a systematic review of case reports and clinical insights [^f5030d6c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The aOR of 0.60 suggests that patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics have approximately 40% lower odds of death compared to those who do not receive these treatments. This reduction is clinically meaningful, particularly in the context of typhlitis, which has a high mortality rate due to complications such as bowel perforation and septicemia. The timely administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can be life-saving, especially in immunocompromised patients who are at increased risk for severe infections. It should be mentioned that several confounding factors may influence the association between broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and mortality rates. For instance, patients with more severe infections are often more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, which could lead to an overestimation of their effectiveness if not adequately controlled. The specific underlying disease and the existence of comorbid conditions can also affect both the likelihood of receiving antibiotics and overall patient outcomes (for example, leukemic patients undergoing stem cell transplants who receive conditioning regimens involving high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as breast cancer patients receiving Taxane-based chemotherapy). Furthermore, research indicates that timely initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with lower mortality rates in patients with severe infections. Lastly, demographic factors such as age, sex, and genetic background can also play a role in treatment decisions and outcomes.

Notably, antifungal prophylaxis is significantly associated with an increased risk of death in patients with typhlitis. This unexpected result raises concerns about the indiscriminate use of antifungal agents in neutropenic patients, as it may lead to adverse outcomes owing to potential drug interactions or the development of resistant organisms. The complexities surrounding antifungal use underscore the need for careful patient selection and monitoring during treatment.

This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into NE. A major strength of this study is that it combined data from more than 200 individual case reports, representing one of the largest reviews on this topic to date. Aggregating findings from such a large number of cases allows for robust characterization of clinical features and outcomes that single reports cannot provide alone. Another important strength of this study was the rigorous methodology employed. The search strategy was well-defined and systematic, following published guidelines. Multiple databases were searched to minimize missing relevant reports. Data extraction and analysis were performed by independent reviewers to reduce bias. This lends credibility to our results. A key finding is that it identifies the risk factors for NE, such as underlying hematological malignancy and certain chemotherapeutic agents. This advances our understanding of who may be most vulnerable. A detailed description of the symptoms, microbiological findings, treatment approaches, and prognosis also enhances clinical awareness and management.

Specific acute abdominal infections in immunocompromised patient

Neutropenic enterocolitis

Statements are as follows:
Neutropenic enteritis and typhlitis have a high mortality rate if misdiagnosed or underestimated; accurate differential diagnosis is mandatory (GoR moderate based on low LoE).
Treatment of neutropenic enteritis and typhlitis should be nonoperative, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. Emergency surgery must be reserved only for those patients presenting with signs of perforation or ischemia (GoR moderate based on low LoE).
A damage control approach in complicated neutropenic enteritis and typhlitis should be adopted in severely sick patients with physiological derangement (GoR moderate based on low LoE).

Neutropenic enterocolitis (ileocecal syndrome or typhlitis) is the commonest cause of acute abdominal pain in neutropenic cancer patients. Typically, it occurs 1 or 2 weeks after chemotherapy is initiated and is more common in leukemic patients or patients after high-dose chemotherapy for solid organ cancer. Almost 1% of all cancer patients admitted to the emergency department yearly had neutropenia at the admission and 6.5% of neutropenic patients for myelosuppressive therapy have neutropenic enterocolitis. Four percent of cancer patients admitted to emergency departments had neutropenic fever. Up to 7% of cancer-related ICU admissions are for neutropenic patients. The real incidence of neutropenic enteritis ranges from 0.8 to 26%.

### Oncological emergencies associated with gastrointestinal tumors [^bc64ca21]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE, typhlitis)

NE is a life-threatening condition caused by mucosal injury by chemotherapy in combination with profound neutropenia and impaired host defense to invasion by microorganisms. The syndrome is most often associated with hematological malignancies but can also occur in patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy. The cause of death in these patients is usually sepsis and mortality rate is extremely high. NE must be considered in all severely neutropenic patients with fever and abdominal pain (usually right lower quadrant). A CT scan can reveal the characteristic findings such as bowel wall thickening, bowel dilatation, pneumatosis coli and mesenteric stranding. Treatment consists of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ex. piperacillin-tazobactam), nasogastric suction as well as fluid and nutritional support. In case of perforation, abscess formation or persistent bleeding, surgery is the only option.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

DIC is a potentially life-threatening condition, characterized by an abnormal activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis leading to thrombosis and hemorrhage simultaneously. It occurs in a variety of diseases, including cancer. About 10–15% of metastatic cancer patients have some evidence of DIC. It is mostly associated with acute leukemia, but can also occur in mucinous tumors such as pancreatic and gastric cancer. Some patients have only a mild clinical course with consumption of coagulation factors while others present with life-threatening bleeding. Treatment consists of treating the underlying cause in combination with supportive measures such as hemodynamic support, hydration and transfusion.

### Typhoid fever [^f1662adf]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Control of typhoid fever relies on clinical information, diagnosis, and an understanding for the epidemiology of the disease. Despite the breadth of work done so far, much is not known about the biology of this human-adapted bacterial pathogen and the complexity of the disease in endemic areas, especially those in Africa. The main barriers to control are vaccines that are not immunogenic in very young children and the development of multidrug resistance, which threatens efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists worldwide need to be familiar with shifting trends in enteric fever. This knowledge is crucial, both to control the disease and to manage cases. Additionally, salmonella serovars that cause human infection can change over time and location. In areas of Asia, multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) has been the main cause of enteric fever, but now S Typhi is being displaced by infections with drug-resistant S enterica serovar Paratyphi A. New conjugate vaccines are imminent and new treatments have been promised, but the engagement of local medical and public health institutions in endemic areas is needed to allow surveillance and to implement control measures.

In the 251 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received XELODA with docetaxel, 68% had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 2.8% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 10% had grade 3 or 4 anemia.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has been reported. Consider typhlitis in patients with fever, neutropenia and abdominal pain.

Monitor complete blood count at baseline and before each cycle. XELODA is not recommended if baseline neutrophil count < 1.5 × 10 /L or platelet count < 100 × 10 /L. For grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression, withhold XELODA and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue, based on occurrence [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Antimicrobials for treating symptomatic non-typhoidal Salmonella infection [^ea20c54a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) commonly causes diarrhoea, and is usually self-limiting, although sometimes people become ill with sepsis and dehydration. Routine antibiotic use for this infection could result in persistent colonization and the spread of resistant bacterial strains.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of giving antibiotics to people with NTS diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (up to August 2012), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (up to Issue 8 2012); and MEDLINE, African Index Medicus, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Science Citation Index, all up to 6 August 2012. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for both completed and on going trials and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea caused by NTS species with placebo or no antibiotic treatment. We selected trials that included people of all ages who were symptomatic for NTS infection. Examples of symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. We excluded trials where the outcomes were not reported separately for the NTS subgroup of patients. Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria prior to study inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on pre-specified outcomes and independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the presence of diarrhoea between two to four days after treatment. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants; very low quality evidence). No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoea at five to seven days after treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; two trials, 192 participants; very low quality evidence), clinical failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25; seven trials, 440 participants; very low quality evidence). The mean difference for diarrhoea was 0 days (95% CI -0.54 to 0.54; 202 participants, four studies; low quality evidence); for fever was 0.27 days (95% CI -0.11 to 0.65; 107 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence); and for duration of illness was 0 days (95% CI -0.68 to 0.68; 116 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). Quinolone antibiotic treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment (microbiological failure: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.56; 166 participants, four trials). Antibiotic treatment meant passage of the same Salmonella serovar one month after treatment was almost twice as likely (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.98; 112 participants, three trials), which was statistically significant. Non-severe adverse drug reactions were more common among the patients who received antibiotic treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in NTS diarrhoea in otherwise healthy people. We are uncertain of the effects in very young people, very old people, and in people with severe and extraintestinal disease. A slightly higher number of adverse events were noted in people who received antibiotic treatment for NTS.

### Predictive ability of CT findings in the differentiation of complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis: a retrospective investigation of 201 patients undergone appendectomy at initial admission [^d2808439]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of surgical abdomen with an incidence of 90–100 per 100,000 population or a lifetime prevalence of approximately 7%. Cross-sectional imaging is a very useful noninvasive method for the evaluation of patients suspected of having acute appendicitis as history and physical examination may not be specific. Many other possible causes of pain in the right iliac fossa that can be diagnosed with ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) are numerous, many of which are nonsurgical entities such as Crohn's disease, infectious enterocolitis, typhlitis, epiploic appendagitis, omental infarction, mesenteric adenitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, a definitive diagnosis — usually derived at imaging — becomes essential to establish the need for surgery.

Strategies for imaging patients with suspected appendicitis usually revolve around clinical probability of the disease (using one of many available clinical prediction/decision rules), in which — if imaging is to be performed — this may start with CT first, or US first with conditional CT when US is inconclusive. Specific patients' demographics put value of an US-first strategy in children and women of child-bearing age as differential diagnoses are often vast and also to reduce radiation burden. For the rest of population, CT is often considered the most appropriate first imaging test owing to its high accuracy for both diagnosis, characterization of appendicitis and strong ability to suggest alternative diagnosis, but value of the US-first strategy with conditional CT or even US re-evaluation after an equivocal CT cannot be understated.

### Complications and mortality of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^a68a00f0]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Results

Our search strategy returned 8770 records. We screened 5837 titles and abstracts for inclusion after 2933 duplicates were removed. Of 5837 titles and abstracts, 281 (4·8%) proceeded for full-text review. We excluded 201 (71·5%) studies, resulting in 80 eligible studies for analysis. When screening the citations of the 80 studies, we identified an additional four studies that met our inclusion criteria, yielding a total of 84 eligible studies for analysis (figure 1).

### Global typhoid fever incidence: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis [^85b437a3]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Contemporary evidence on the incidence of typhoid fever is essential to inform decision making for typhoid prevention by vaccine introduction and non-vaccine measures. We aimed to update our previous systematic review and meta-analysis on the global incidence of typhoid fever.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and preprint repositories up to and including Dec 14 or 15, 2024, that encompassed primary, prospective, population-based, or hybrid surveillance reports of incidence data for culture-confirmed typhoid fever; this review was an update to our previous review that included studies published up to and including Jan 19, 2018. We performed an inverse variance, random-effects meta-analysis with log transformation of reports published from database inception up to and including Dec 14 or 15, 2024, and of new reports published from Jan 19, 2018, up to and including Dec 14 or 15, 2024, to generate pooled estimates of typhoid incidence per 100000 person-years of observation (PYO). We conducted subgroup analyses by UN region, subregion, country, study quality, age group, and observation period, and performed meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018086198).

Findings

We included 46 reports, yielding 107 estimates; of 21673 records screened for this updated review, we included 14 reports, of which 13 were newer reports published since Jan 19, 2018, yielding 41 incidence estimates from 35 study sites in 15 countries. From new reports, the overall pooled incidence per 100000 PYO was 206·3 (95% CI 63·6–669·6; I² = 99·8%) from five population-based reports, and 132·5 (71·2–246·6; I² = 99·9%) from eight hybrid surveillance reports. Incidence from new hybrid surveillance reports was highest in southern Asia at 320·6 (185·3–554·7) per 100000 PYO (I 2 = 99·9%). Incidence was higher in the 2 years to < 5 years age group at 159·6 (60·3–422·1) per 100000 PYO (I 2 = 99·9%) compared with older age groups from new hybrid surveillance reports. Incidence from before 2010 was 127·4 (91·2–177·9) per 100000 PYO (I 2 = 97·4%) from population-based reports. Incidence from 2010 onwards was 118·8 (70·7–199·7) per 100000 PYO (I 2 = 99·9%) from hybrid surveillance reports. Meta-regression identified statistically significant moderators of effect size for population-based studies (p < 0·0001) and hybrid surveillance studies (p = 0·016). Egger's test for publication bias was statistically significant for population-based reports (p = 0·0041) but not for hybrid surveillance reports (p = 0·14). Of the 46 reports, we assessed six (13%) to be of high quality, 24 (52%) as moderate, and 16 (35%) as low quality.

Interpretation

Typhoid incidence was high in Africa and Asia, and among young children, thus affirming an ongoing need to prioritise vaccine and non-vaccine prevention of typhoid fever in this age group and for these UN regions.

### Visceral pain triggered by traction on the ileocecal ligament with ileitis [^21a26f6c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Visceral pain is a complex and common symptom in clinical practice that occurs as a result of gastrointestinal surgery or disorders, such as obstruction, intussusceptions, neoplasms, volvulus, ischemia, infarction, luminal compression, intra-abdominal abscess, intestinal foreign body, celiac, typhlitis, intestinal or biliary colic, incarcerated or strangulated hernia, and intestinal and mesentery infarct.–It may be accompanied by weight loss, bloating, diarrhea, diaphoresis, or any combination thereof, with changes in vital signs and emotional manifestations. Visceral pain is considered vague and often difficult to localize, and is more unpleasant than apparent intensity-matched somatic pain. Visceral pain produces a considerable negative impact on daily lives, causes a huge economic burden, and creates tremendous pressure on health care systems worldwide. The small intestine is more prone to intestinal disorders and pain than other segments of the gut, because of its greater length and enhanced peristaltic movement. The small intestine is the focus of common clinical presentations, and visceral pain remains a difficult entity to treat, because its etiopathogenesis is not completely understood. An animal model is needed to study the underlying pain mechanism and evaluate the efficacy of analgesics for the treatment of visceral pain originating from the small intestine.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7b84e0a1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Secondary peritonitis diagnostic evaluation — source identification and test selection are emphasized. The diagnosis of secondary peritonitis is dependent upon identifying a source for invading microorganisms — usually genitourinary or gastrointestinal microbiota, and unlike SBP, secondary peritonitis tends to be polymicrobic and may include anaerobic microbiota with organisms such as S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium spp. unusual in this setting. If typhlitis is suspected, C. difficile toxin testing, stool cultures for enteric pathogens, and blood cultures should be requested, and C. septicum should be considered in neutropenic enterocolitis; if other etiologies are ruled out and a parasitic cause is suspected, a request for ova and parasite examination could be considered. Peritoneal fluid should be sent in an anaerobic transport system for Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, and inoculation of blood culture bottles alone with peritoneal fluid is not appropriate in this setting. The microbiology laboratory should be contacted to arrange special processing if cytomegalovirus (CMV) is of concern and should also be contacted if N. gonorrhoeae is of concern; this specimen type has no FDA-cleared commercial platform for testing. Infectious complications following bariatric surgery are frequently due to gram-positive cocci and yeast (Candida spp.), and because many of these patients have had prior exposure to antibiotics, multiply resistant organisms are of concern.

### Acute abdomen in the immunocompromised patient: WSES, SIS-E, WSIS, AAST, and GAIS guidelines [^c79ba1f8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of neutropenic enteritis or typhlitis is nonoperative with antibiotics and bowel rest. Surgery must be reserved only for those presenting with signs of perforation or ischemia.

No studies investigated surgical vs. conservative management of patients with neutropenic enteritis, but it is widely accepted that conservative management should be preferred. Cancer patients developing neutropenic enteritis, usually after high-dose chemotherapy, are poor candidates for surgery, especially if unplanned. Neutropenic enteritis generally develops during the second-third week of chemotherapy (the period of the mucosal damage induced by drugs).

After chemotherapy, in a spot of 30 days, it has been shown that planned elective surgery does not carry excessively higher risk. Conversely, on chemotherapy, the reported mortality rate is up to 81%. Patients with leukemia who underwent emergency surgery and had chemotherapy in the previous 30 days presented a 57% mortality rate, with leukopenia being an adverse prognostic factor.

Comparing patients who had chemotherapy in the previous 30 days undergoing emergency surgery to those who had not, mortality and complication rates were higher in the chemotherapy group (22.4% vs. 10.3% and 44% vs. 39.2%, respectively). Leukopenia (WBC count < 4500 × 10 3 /mm 3) was associated with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity (24.4% vs. 10.8% and 45.4% vs. 26.9%, respectively).

Concerns may exist in admitting patients to the ICU with ongoing cancer progression or recurrence after emergency surgical intervention. Indication for ICU admission should be defined on a case-by-case basis, considering all the clinical, organizational, and even economic aspects. A large multicenter study on 717 cancer patients admitted to 28 different ICUs reported a rate of in-hospital mortality for emergency surgery of 37%. In contrast, ICU mortality for the same category was 23%. Mortality was related to the need for mechanical ventilation and performance status and not directly to cancer-related characteristics.

Enteric fever clinical course when unresponsive to therapy — expected fever duration and next steps: Patients treated with antimicrobial agents can continue to have fever for 3–5 days, but the maximum temperature generally decreases each day, and patients sometimes feel worse during the first few days after commencing antibiotic treatment. If fever in a person with typhoid or paratyphoid infection does not subside within 5 days of initiating antibiotic therapy, consider treatment with alternative antibiotics or begin looking for a persistent focus of infection.

### Neutropenic colitis in children [^e691130f]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neutropenic colitis (NC) or typhlitis has an incidence of approximately 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. The precise cause is unknown, but almost all patients are neutropenic; most profoundly so. We reviewed our experience with neutropenic colitis over the past 10 y to assess the incidence, management, and outcome.

Materials and Methods

Hospital records were reviewed after obtaining IRB approval (# 10-10-184E). There were 1224 children treated for cancer at our institution over the study interval. Neutropenic colitis was strictly defined as the presence of both clinical and radiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis, since there are no definitive diagnostic criteria. Patients with confirmed appendicitis were excluded. Medical management consisted of bowel rest and/or decompression, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and anti-fungal coverage, and serial clinical exams and radiographic studies. Clinical deterioration and free air were the primary indications for surgery. Demographic factors, signs, symptoms, clinical presentation, underlying disease process, white blood cell count (WBC), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) prior to the onset of the disease, treatment, and outcome were analyzed.

Results

Neutropenic colitis was confirmed in 17 children (1.4% incidence). Three patients had more than one episode. Leukemia was the most common underlying diagnosis (53%). There was no gender predominance, and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.4 y. Mean WBC and ANC at onset were 670 and 164, respectively. A sharp decline in the ANC usually immediately preceded the onset of NC; 2/17 (12%) underwent operation, but both patients had only pneumatosis at exploration. Overall survival was 9/17 (53%), but no deaths were directly attributable to the colitis.

Conclusion

Neutropenic colitis is an uncommon occurrence in children with neoplasia (1.4% in the current study). Leukemia is the most common cause. A precipitous decline in ANC usually occurs prior to the onset of NC. Most patients do not require operation and the overall mortality directly attributable to NC is low.

Invasive fungal infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The occurrence of two invasive fungal infections in one patient at the same time is quite rare. Here the authors report on two adolescent patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who developed combined invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and hepatosplenic candidiasis during chemotherapy. They were treated with liposomal amphotericin B, but one of them died due to massive pulmonary hemorrhage during recovery from neutropenia.

5.8 Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome

Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) can occur with capecitabine.

In patients with metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received capecitabine as a single agent, the median time to onset of grades 1 to 3 PPES was 2.6 months (range: 11 days to 1 year).

Withhold capecitabine and then resume at same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue based on severity and occurrence [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.9 Myelosuppression

Myelosuppression can occur with capecitabine.

In the 875 patients with metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received capecitabine as a single agent, 3.2% had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 1.7% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 2.4% had grade 3 or 4 anemia.

In the 251 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received capecitabine with docetaxel, 68% had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 2.8% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 10% had grade 3 or 4 anemia.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has been reported. Consider typhlitis in patients with fever, neutropenia and abdominal pain.

Monitor complete blood count at baseline and before each cycle. Capecitabine is not recommended if baseline neutrophil count < 1.5 x 109/L or platelet count < 100 x 109/L. For grade 3 to 4 myelosuppression, withhold capecitabine and then resume at same or reduced dose, or permanently discontinue, based on occurrence [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Antibiotics for treating scrub typhus [^4483296c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and management

Three review authors (IES, QL, and IW) independently extracted data onto a data extraction form (modified from previous versions of this review). We extracted information on study design, setting, population, diagnostic criteria, antibiotic regimen (dose, route, duration, timing, and frequency), total numbers randomized, number of participants in each group, numbers lost to follow‐up, duration of follow‐up, dates of the study, funding source, and withdrawals from each group. We encountered no disagreements.

For dichotomous data, we extracted the number of participants who experienced the event of interest and the number of participants randomized and analysed in each group.

For continuous outcomes, we extracted mean values, standard deviations, and number of participants in each group for whom the outcome was assessed. When medians were reported, we extracted ranges or interquartile ranges. When data were incomplete, we contacted trial authors to request additional data.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Three review authors (IES, QL, and IW) independently assessed potential biases of included studies using a prepared form and the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Higgins 2011). For each domain, we described what trial authors reported and made a subjective judgement for each domain as having 'high, low, or unclear' risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by discussion and reached agreement. We included all assessments in a 'Risk of bias' graph and a 'Risk of bias' summary figure. We provided in the Results section a narrative description of our risk of bias conclusions for each domain of all included studies.

We assessed the following domains for each study: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding or masking, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias.

Sequence generation

We described the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We considered trials as having low risk of bias if the investigator described a random component of sequence generation (for example, a random number table, a computer random number generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing lots, minimization); high risk of bias if sequence generation was non‐random (for example, sequence generated by odd or even date of birth, some rule based on date (or day) of admission, some rule based on hospital or clinic record number); or unclear risk of bias if the randomization process was not clearly described.

### Management and outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal typhoid: an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study [^cbd02646]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This international, multicentre, prospective study has demonstrated substantial post-operative morbidity following surgery for intestinal typhoid. We identified a 30-day post-operative mortality rate of 9.1%, which was higher in children, and a high surgical site infection rate of 67.0%. As typhoid and paratyphoid disproportionately affects patients in LMICs, this high complication rate following surgery has substantial repercussions for both patients and healthcare systems. Concerningly, children appear to have similarly poor outcomes following surgery for typhoid perforation. The incidence of typhoid and paratyphoid is widespread and remains a key public health issues across LMICs. With growing resistance to first-line antimicrobials, surgery for intestinal typhoid is likely to become more common and the healthcare burden of post-operative complications will continue to increase. Surgical site infection, for instance, is not only expensive for healthcare systems, but associated with serious complications and longer lengths of stay. In LMICs, prolonged hospital admissions after surgery for typhoid in patients of working age can result in the absence from work and societal commitments, which subsequently impacts on family units and communities. In children, this can mean time away from education, which is particularly important in the context of wider efforts to reduce inequalities in low- and middle-income countries. Patients and families who have lost earnings and are required to pay for a prolonged treatment are at risk of catastrophic impoverishment with dire long-term consequences.

We identified high morbidity rates associated with surgery for typhoid perforation. The reasons for this relate to the disease itself, as well patient and broader health system factors. Morbidity rates may reflect international variation in access to care and to supporting resources to enable clinical staff to deliver safe surgery. Several other reasons for this disparity should also be considered. Firstly, lack of timely access to high-quality medical care may lead to delays in presentation leading to more advanced disease requiring surgical care. Secondly, a lack of capacity in surgery and perioperative care in LMIC settings may compound risks of delay in presentation, leading to preventable SSI and death. Lack of appropriate post-operative care, including intensive care facilities, may contribute to this. Finally, shortages of facilities to perform routine microbiological testing may result in ineffectual prophylactic antibiotic usage where antimicrobial resistance exists.

### Neutropenic typhlitis in adults… [^7575b003]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Typhlitis is a necrotizing process of the cecum, occurring in neutropenic patients who are usually receiving combined chemotherapy. The atonic cecum is affected because of its poor arterial perfusion, the presence of colonic bacteria, and the milieu of immunosuppression. It is a serious but not inevitably fatal complication of the patient's basic illness. Resection of necrotic bowel is necessary. Because this will usually be done on an emergency basis in a very ill patient with unprepared bowel, a two-stage procedure rather than primary anastomosis is advisable. Surgical results may be better in adult than pediatric patients. The incidence of the problem has probably increased since the advent of aggressive drug therapy of the leukopathic states. Judging from the low number of reported adult cases and the apparent inaccuracy of preoperative diagnosis, there may be inadequate physician awareness of typhlitis. Ikard RW.

### Occurrence of typhoid fever complications and their relation to duration of illness preceding hospitalization: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^b3115396]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model assuming there were differences between the studies that were not caused by random chance, for example, differences in populations and context in which the studies took place. The I 2 statistic was used to measure the extent to which studies agreed with each other (heterogeneity). The estimated prevalence of typhoid fever complications and overlapping of their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were visually inspected using forest plots, and heterogeneity between studies was verified in the overall and in the subgroup analysis. An I 2 < 30% was considered as representing low or unimportant heterogeneity; an I 2 between 30% and 50% as moderate heterogeneity, and > 50% as substantial/high heterogeneity.

### Mucormycosis emboli: a rare cause of segmental bowel ischemia [^e803fca6]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

In retrospect, our patient's clinical presentation was consistent with mucormycosis. His acute presentation of left lower quadrant pain was distinct from what would be expected with typhlitis. Despite the fact that he underwent expeditious surgical resection of the affected small bowel with a rapid recovery, his antifungal coverage was not expanded to cover Mucor until POD 4 due to concern for drug toxicity. A higher degree of suspicion for disseminated mucormycosis infection might have promoted the early addition of amphotericin to his regimen. The expedited review of the resected bowel segment and the diagnosis of mucormycosis influenced downstream decisions to not proceed with a reoperation. We highlight this case because it represents a very rare cause of small bowel ischemia, where a high degree of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis and accurately predict prognosis. Surgeons must be familiar with the implications of this infection so as to be able to advise patients and families about management, treatment options and prognosis.

### Topotecan (Hycamtin) [^24044510]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 Myelosuppression

HYCAMTIN can cause severe myelosuppression. The following safety data are based on an integrated safety database from four trials in patients with lung cancer (N = 682) who received HYCAMTIN capsules at a dose of 2.3 mg/m2orally once daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.

The median day for neutrophil and platelet nadirs occurred on Day 15. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of the 682 patients, with a median duration of 7 days. Grade 4 neutropenia most commonly occurred during cycle 1 (20% of patients). Clinical sequelae of neutropenia included infection (17%), febrile neutropenia (4%), sepsis (2%), and septic death (1%). Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 6%, with a median duration of 3 days. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 25%.

HYCAMTIN can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain.

Administer the first cycle of HYCAMTIN capsules only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Monitor blood cell counts frequently during treatment. Withhold and reduce dose of HYCAMTIN capsules based on neutrophil counts, platelet counts and hemoglobin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.2 Diarrhea

Diarrhea, including severe and life-threatening diarrhea requiring hospitalization, can occur with HYCAMTIN capsules. Diarrhea can occur at the same time as drug-induced neutropenia and its sequelae. In the 682 patients who received HYCAMTIN capsules in the four lung cancer trials, the incidence of diarrhea caused by HYCAMTIN capsules was 22%, including Grade 3 (4%) and Grade 4 (0.4%). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea proximate (within 5 days) to Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 5%. The median time to onset of Grade 2 to 4 diarrhea was 9 days in the group receiving HYCAMTIN capsules.

Fever or bloody diarrhea — diagnostic and management recommendations state that people with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit, including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, or has laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In this document, Salmonella Typhi represents the more formal and detailed name Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi, and Salmonella Paratyphi corresponds to the Paratyphi serovar.

### Typhlitis… [^74680605]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

UNEXPLAINED febrile episodes and recurrent septicemia from unidentified sources occur in neutropenic patients. Patients with leukemias and lymphomas commonly are found to have gastrointestinal tract lesions at postmortem examination. 1, 2 These lesions may serve as portals of entry for bacteria. Typhlitis, ie, inflammation of the cecum, has been reported by Wagner et al3 to be present in approximately 10% of patients with leukemia at postmortem examination. Varki et al4 recently reported successful outcome of typhlitis treated in a patient with acute leukemia. The following case report suggests that recurrent bacteremia with different organisms may be a sign of early typhlitis, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first reported antemortem diagnosis of typhlitis in a patient with aplastic anemia.

5.1 Myelosuppression

HYCAMTIN can cause severe myelosuppression.

Single Agent

Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 78% of 879 patients, with a median duration of 7 days and was most common during Cycle 1 (58% of patients). Grade 4 neutropenia associated with infection occurred in 13% and febrile neutropenia occurred in 5%. Sepsis occurred in 4% of patients and was fatal in 1%. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 27%, with a median duration of 5 days. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 37% of patients.

Combination with Cisplatin

Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 48% and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 7% of 147 patients. Grade 3 or 4 anemia occurred in 40% of patients.

Topotecan can cause fatal typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis). Consider the possibility of typhlitis in patients presenting with fever, neutropenia, and abdominal pain.

Administer the first cycle of HYCAMTIN for injection only to patients with a baseline neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3.

### Management and outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal typhoid: an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study [^3e210162]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data collection and management

Data were collected on internationally relevant patient, disease and outcome data. This approach aimed to maximise case record completion and data accuracy. Patients were followed up for 30 days after surgery, with the day of surgery taken as day zero. Records were uploaded by local investigators to a secure online website provided using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system. The lead investigator at each site was responsible for data accuracy of all cases prior to data submission. Only data with high levels of completeness (> 95%) were accepted for analysis.

Patient variables included demographic details (age, gender, country, diabetes status, smoking status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade), operative details (time to operation, operative approach, WHO safer surgery checklist use, primary procedure performed) and outcomes (30-day mortality, 30-day reintervention, 30-day surgical site infection (SSI) and 30-day organ site infection (OSI) rates). Antibiotic prophylaxis was defined as antibiotics which were administered over the perioperative period, either at induction or during operation prior to opening a contaminated space, or antibiotic therapy that was commenced prior to operation but continued over the perioperative period. Due to the lack of microbiological data and resistance data, it was not feasible to collect data on which antibiotics were administered. As typhoid commonly affects children in low- and middle-income countries and paediatric surgery is commonly performed in separate units, we chose to compare outcomes across children and adults to provide further detail in these groups.

Outcome variables

The primary outcome measure was the 30-day post-operative mortality rate. The secondary outcome measures included the 30-day reintervention rate, the 30-day organ space infection rate and the surgical site infection rate, defined according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions for SSI.

SSI was defined as one of:
Purulent drainage from the superficial or deep (fascia or muscle) incision but not from within the organ/space component of the surgical site;
At least one of: pain or tenderness; localised swelling; redness; heat; fever; and the incision is opened deliberately or spontaneously dehisces;
Abscess within the wound (clinically or radiologically detected).

Organ space infections were recorded separately and defined as intra-abdominal/pelvic infections detected clinically/symptomatically, radiologically or intra-operatively. Online training modules were completed by collaborators prior to data collection.

### Management and outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal typhoid: an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study [^a0bf6939]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although the collaborative research methodology employed by this study has been characterised elsewhere in detail, this study to our knowledge is the first to use such an approach to study complications of communicable disease. Our study has shown such data can be collected accurately and reliably, demonstrated by validation which has found the data set to be 93.3% accurate. Collaborative working enables additional resources and research infrastructure to be made available in settings where resources may be otherwise limited.

There are several limitations which must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. The sample size is small, although 88 patients undergoing surgery are a large series of intestinal typhoid compared with the existing literature. Secondly, this is a study which pools together data from two of the GlobalSurg studies. A period of 12 months exists between the first and second GlobalSurg study, which may lead to a temporal bias from trends in typhoid incidence. However, in sensitivity analyses comparing both studies limited differences were seen. We did not collect data surrounding the serotype or other specific microbiological parameters of typhoid or paratyphoid as doing so would have been impractical within the confines of this study and limited access to diagnostic resources in included settings. This therefore made it impractical to collect information on antibiotic therapy, including type of antibiotics and administration patterns, as without knowing which bacteria are likely to be present it would not be possible to estimate whether this was appropriately targeted. Finally, as this study was purely observational in nature no causative inference can be drawn between factors associated with outcomes in this study.

Surgery for typhoid is accompanied by substantial morbidity and disproportionately affects a young LMIC population, as reported in the previous studies. Subsequently, funders and policymakers should identify means of reducing the overall burden of morbidity and impact of typhoid upon communities. This should aim to address three key areas: disease prevention, access to prompt surgical care and on improving outcomes. Children are a key group who we have demonstrated to have high mortality rates, and improving outcomes in this group should be a priority. Prevention of typhoid through improved sanitation and vaccination programmes should continue and efforts increased. Improving access to health care, particularly surgical care, at an earlier time in the disease process should be a priority. Future research should focus on identifying durable vaccinations for typhoid, addressing inequalities in access to health care and reducing morbidity rates following surgery for typhoid. Addressing these issues is particularly important, as resistance to antimicrobial agents is increasing. Preventing typhoid will reduce antibiotic usage and preserve current antibiotics for use in severe cases.

### Complications and mortality of typhoid fever: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^55a32f20]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Updated estimates of the prevalence of complications and case fatality ratio (CFR) among typhoid fever patients are needed to understand disease burden.

Methods

Articles published in PubMed and Web of Science from 1 January 1980 through 29 January 2020 were systematically reviewed for hospital or community-based non-surgical studies that used cultures of normally sterile sites, and hospital surgical studies of typhoid intestinal perforation (TIP) with intra- or post-operative findings suggestive of typhoid. Prevalence of 21 pre-selected recognized complications of typhoid fever, crude and median (interquartile range) CFR, and pooled CFR estimates using a random effects meta-analysis were calculated.

Results

Of 113 study sites, 106 (93.8%) were located in Asia and Africa, and 84 (74.3%) were non-surgical. Among non-surgical studies, 70 (83.3%) were hospital-based. Of 10,355 confirmed typhoid patients, 2,719 (26.3%) had complications. The pooled CFR estimate among non-surgical patients was 0.9% for the Asia region and 5.4% for the Africa region. Delay in care was significantly correlated with increased CFR in Asia (r = 0.84; p < 0.01). Among surgical studies, the median CFR of TIP was 15.5% (6.7–24.1%) per study.

Conclusions

Our findings identify considerable typhoid-associated illness and death that could be averted with prevention measures, including typhoid conjugate vaccine introduction.

### Acute therapy-related toxicities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^ef089efd]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and summary

The excellent cure rate of ALL comes with the cost of acute and chronic treatment toxicities. Principally, every organ may be affected and injured by ALL intensive therapy. This review focused on six systems involved in major treatment toxicities: the nerve system including PRES and MTX SLS, the bones with avascular necrosis, the vascular system with VTE, the kidneys with DME, the gastrointestinal system with pancreatitis, and, finally, toxicities of the new immunotherapies. Several other acute toxicities, such as infections, hepatotoxicity, typhlitis, mucositis, psychiatric, pulmonary, ocular, and musculoskeletal injuries, in addition to long-term cardiac, endocrine, cognitive, and metabolic toxicities and impaired quality, notwithstanding their importance, were not within the scope of this review. Most of the severe acute toxicities of ALL treatment can be reduced by patient-adjusted dose intensity and targeted therapy, considering the germline and somatic mutations, and the leukemia risk-based stratification. A comprehensive understanding of the risk factors for each toxicity, the clinical manifestations, preventive strategies, and early intervention will further optimize therapy outcomes.

Tailored therapy adaptations, considering individual gene polymorphism with incorporation of immunotherapy into front-line ALL therapy, would hopefully reduce the short and long-term toxicities of conventional chemotherapy, and further improve OS and quality of life for ALL patients.

### Salmonella typhi gut invasion drives hypoxic immune subsets associated with disease outcomes [^e0d6f849]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. More recently, human challenge models have been conducted, providing insight into immune correlates of infection outcomes, which are still incompletely understood. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in the blood of individuals who developed disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer's patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection-and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, we identified a hypoxia-associated immune signature that correlates with disease outcomes in humans. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that this signature is driven by bacterial invasion to the Peyer's patches, implicating a causal role in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever.

METHODS

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

We searched the PubMed database using the terms "typhoid fever," "enteric fever," " Salmonella Typhi," "complication," and "complications." Results were restricted to publications in English, listed from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 2018, where abstracts were available for review and research was conducted in human subjects. Publications with confirmed typhoid fever cases by blood, bone marrow, and/or stool culture and with disaggregated data on typhoid fever complications were selected for full review. Letters, reviews, editorials, case reports, case series reporting only one type of complications or one system affected, and studies not relevant to the subject of research, as well as publications where complication for nontyphoidal Salmonella or paratyphoid could not be disaggregated from typhoid fever complications and studies reporting complications exported to developed countries, were excluded. The selection criteria and search terms for the study are listed in Table 1.

By contrast, the typhoidal serotypes S Typhi and S Paratyphi A are entirely host restricted to people and cause invasive disease in immunocompetent hosts. Although once a substantial public health problem in developed countries, improvements in sanitation have led to near eradication, and most cases are imported. A large burden of disease remains in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Typhoid fever (also known as enteric fever) is an invasive, systemic clinical syndrome that is typified by high fever and complicated by sepsis and shock, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, encephalopathy, and focal metastatic complications such as cholecystitis or hepatitis. The untreated case fatality is 20%, but is less than 1% with appropriate antimicrobial treatment. S Typhi persist in the reticuloendothelial system and biliary tract, from where bacteria are intermittently shed into the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to transmission of the disease to other people, potentially over many years. Persistence of S Typhi in the biliary tract is associated with an increased incidence of gallbladder carcinoma in endemic regions.

Gallbladder cancer — risk factors: Cholelithiasis with chronic inflammation is the most prevalent risk factor and the risk increases with stone size. Calcification of the gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder) has been regarded as a risk factor with historical estimates of cancer in up to 22% of gallbladders with calcification, although subsequent reports suggest lower risk with gallbladder cancer present in 7% to 15% of these patients. Other risk factors include anomalous pancreatobiliary duct junction, gallbladder polyps (> 1 cm), chronic typhoid infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and prophylactic cholecystectomy is probably beneficial for high‑risk patients (eg, porcelain gallbladder, polyps ≥ 1 cm).

Abstract Purpose Methods Results Conclusion Introduction 1Patients with typhlitis are typically treated with antibiotics and bowel rest and occasionally require surgical intervention. 1, 2 3, 4who review the medical record to identify key words or data indicating the presence of an AE as described in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 5, 11, 12The presence of typhlitis was determined on the basis of meeting the following criteria: patient received antibiotics typically prescribed for typhlitis for at least 24 hours; absolute neutrophil count < 1, 000/mm.

3within the time period from 24 hours before the first antibiotic administration through the last administration; at least one non-negated mention of typhlitis or neutropenic colitis in a clinician progress note from 24 hours before the first antibiotic administration through the last administration; and at least one of the following: patient being nil per os for at least 24 hours during the antibiotic period and/or non-negated radiology result findings of typhlitis or neutropenic colitis. 17who developed a program that extracted EHR data and highlighted text of interest to identify radiation pneumonitis. This program removed the need for manual review in 22% of patients. The automated typhlitis algorithm could be applied to identify the subset of courses that might have typhlitis. Once identified by the algorithm, a CRA/RN could manually review the data to confirm if the course had a true episode of typhlitis.

19We also identified that definitive mention that an AE occurred may not happen until the discharge summary posthospitalization. To appropriately place the typhlitis episodes within a course, our algorithm required a mention in a clinician note to be within 24 hours of antibiotic initiation through the last antibiotic dose. Sensitivity for identification of any typhlitis could be increased by removing the timing requirement of the mention in the note relative to antibiotic administration, but this may reduce the ability to confidently place typhlitis in time and if the patient had multiple courses with the AE.

### Systemic treatment-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: incidence, clinical presentation and management [^5854b9e3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Tubulin poisons

Taxanes are mitotic inhibitors and work by disrupting polymerization. The principal mechanism through which the taxanes stabilize microtubules is the strengthening of the lateral interactions between protofilaments. It is difficult to compare docetaxel and paclitaxel in terms of gastrointestinal toxicity; however docetaxel seems to be associated with more side effects than paclitaxel. Taxanebased chemotherapy regimens have been associated with a wide spectrum of colitis (Table 1). The most frequent type of colitis is the ischemic. Severe complications including bowel necrosis, colonic perforation or typhlitis have been described. Ischemic colitis presents with a symptom complex of acute abdominal pain and direct or rebound tenderness and possibly associated neutropenia, fever and/or diarrhea, with or without blood. Septicemia frequently occurs and the most common causative organism is aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Colonoscopy is associated with an increased risk of perforation and, therefore, it should be discouraged. The histopathological analysis is compatible with a significant component of inflammatory changes, including mucosal and submucosal edema, hemorrhage, acute inflammatory infiltrates, mucosal ulceration and serositis (Fig. 1, 2). Early detection allows the majority of cases to be resolved with non-operative management and supportive care, such as administering anti-peristaltic agents, aggressive fluid of coagulopathy, and consists usually of bowel resection resuscitation, bowel rest and broad antibiotic coverage. Surgical and stoma creation (Table 3). Some authors argue that dose intervention is mandatory for peritonitis, bowel perforation, adjustments or discontinuation of the culprit agent may or gastrointestinal hemorrhage that persists despite correction successfully prevent recurrences of colitis.

### WITHDRAWN: azithromycin for treating uncomplicated typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever) [^d444c002]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Review status: Current question - no update intended. Azithromycin treatments are included in the review: Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever). (Thaver D, Zaidi AKM, Critchley JA, Azmatullah A, Madni SA, Bhutta ZA. Fluoroquinolones for treating typhoid and paratyphoid fever (enteric fever). Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD004530. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004530.pub3.) This latter review is being updated, and will be published in late 2011. Enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fever) is potentially fatal. Infection with drug-resistant strains of the causative organism Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi or Paratyphi increases morbidity and mortality. Azithromycin may have better outcomes in people with uncomplicated forms of the disease.

Objectives

To compare azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating uncomplicated enteric fever.

Search Strategy

In August 2008, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also searched conference proceedings, reference lists, and contacted researchers and a pharmaceutical company.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin with other antibiotics for treating children and adults with uncomplicated enteric fever confirmed by cultures of S. Typhi or Paratyphi in blood and/or stool.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Dichotomous data were presented and compared using the odds ratio, and continuous data were reported as arithmetic means with standard deviations and were combined using the mean difference (MD). Both were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Seven trials involving 773 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials used adequate methods to generate the allocation sequence and conceal allocation, and were open label. Three trials exclusively included adults, two included children, and two included both adults and children; all were hospital inpatients. One trial evaluated azithromycin against chloramphenicol and did not demonstrate a difference for any outcome (77 participants, 1 trial). When compared with fluoroquinolones in four trials, azithromycin significantly reduced clinical failure (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89; 564 participants, 4 trials) and duration of hospital stay (MD -1.04 days, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.34 days; 213 participants, 2 trials); all four trials included people with multiple-drug-resistant or nalidixic acid-resistant strains of S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi. We detected no statistically significant difference in the other outcomes. Compared with ceftriaxone, azithromycin significantly reduced relapse (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70; 132 participants, 2 trials) and not other outcome measures. Few adverse events were reported, and most were mild and self limiting.

Authors' Conclusions

Azithromycin appears better than fluoroquinolone drugs in populations that included participants with drug-resistant strains. Azithromycin may perform better than ceftriaxone.

### Global trends in typhoidal salmonellosis: a systematic review [^a2060a34]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever continue to significantly contribute to global morbidity and mortality. Disease burden is higher in low-and middle-income settings where surveillance programs are rare and little systematic information exists at population level. This review evaluates national, regional, and global trends in the incidence of typhoid fever and of related morbidity and mortality. A literature search in Medline, Embase, and Web of Science was conducted in June 2016, followed by screening and data extraction in duplicate. Studies reporting blood culture estimates of typhoid or paratyphoid morbidity and mortality were included in the analysis. Our search yielded 5,563 unique records, of which 1978 were assessed for relevance with 219 records meeting the eligibility criteria. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi was the most commonly reported organism (91%), with the occurrence of typhoidal Salmonella (either incidence or prevalence) being the most commonly reported outcome (78%), followed by typhoid fever mortality, ileal perforation morbidity, and perforation mortality, respectively. Fewer than 50% of studies stratified outcomes by age or urban/rural locality. Surveillance data were available from 29 countries and patient-focused studies were available from 32 countries. Our review presents a mixed picture with declines reported in many regions and settings but with large gaps in surveillance and published data. Regional trends show generally high incidence rates in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia and Pacific where the disease is endemic in many countries. Significant increases have been reported in certain countries but should be explored in the context of long-term trends and underlying at-risk populations.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^002e83ac]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Vincristine management in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) — dose holds and supportive care: Vincristine is an essential chemotherapeutic agent in many ALL regimens that is associated with dose-limiting neurotoxicity, and regimens to maintain bowel movements and prevent the occurrence of constipation may need to be considered if receiving vincristine. Consider holding vincristine dose for ileus or typhlitis, vocal cord paralysis, and severe neuropathic pain (grade > 3) that affects activities of daily living; then restart at half of the previous dose. Once symptoms resolve, the full dose may be resumed as tolerated. For pain control, consider use of gabapentin, pregabalin, or other gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog, and some patients may require additional pain medication including opioids.

### Appendicitis in childhood hematologic malignancies: analysis and comparison with typhilitis [^12ba8ee8]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Recognition of appendicitis in the child with hematologic malignancy may be difficult particularly in the setting of neutropenia and multiple medications causing an altered inflammatory response. Typhilitis may produce a similar constellation of clinical findings causing further diagnostic confusion. This review compares the relative frequency of these two conditions in children with hematologic malignancy with a focus on the clinical presentation, distinguishing features, surgical management, and outcome for patients with appendicitis.

Methods

This institutional review board-approved retrospective study evaluated 464 pediatric patients treated for hematologic malignancy at our institution from 1997 to 2003. From this cohort, we identified all children with a diagnosis of appendicitis or typhilitis. Data include demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and computed tomography (CT) scan findings. Groups were compared using the Fisher exact test. Significance was defined as P < .05.

Results

Eight (1.7%) of 464 children were diagnosed with typhilitis and 7 (1.5%) with appendicitis. There were no demographic differences between patients with appendicitis and typhilitis. Distinguishing clinical features in children with typhilitis included presence of fever and diarrhea. Clinical presentation in children with appendicitis was atypical in 5 of 7 cases yielding an incorrect preoperative diagnosis in all 5. Radiographic evaluation by CT scan accurately defined typhilitis, but not appendicitis. An operation was performed on all 7 children with appendicitis with no operative morbidity or mortality.

Conclusions

Appendicitis and typhilitis occur with similar frequency in children with leukemia and lymphoma. Typhilitis is accurately diagnosed with clinical findings of fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and typical CT scan findings. Appendicitis tends to present with atypical findings, but can be successfully managed with standard surgical care.

### The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^5cdc717c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

However, data about typhoid and paratyphoid fever are still relatively sparse and we have no data from much of sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and Latin America. The absence of data from Nigeria is a substantial source of uncertainty given the country's large population and potentially high burden. The absence of active surveillance data from high-burden countries is an important limitation. Moreover, the degree to which incidence from cohort studies represents incidence throughout a country is questionable, as many incidence studies were done in urban slum areas where typhoid fever burden can be greatest. This suggests a need for data covering both a larger geographical range and a greater diversity of sites within countries, which might help reduce the biases related to site selection. Similarly, data about case fatality are both sparse and of questionable quality. No gold standard data exist for typhoid fever case fatality: data from passive surveillance sources are likely to overestimate case fatality (ie, greater under-reporting of less-severe and non-fatal cases than of fatalities), data from active surveillance sources are likely to underestimate case fatality (because of early diagnosis and treatment), and hospital-based data contain conflicting sources of bias (over-representation of severe cases would tend to produce overestimates, whereas diagnosis and treatment would tend to produce underestimates). Our method for splitting the overall case fatality estimates into separate estimates for typhoid and paratyphoid fever is also limited by the sparse data. That said, our case fatality estimates, ranging from 0·3% to 1·6%, are in line with the widely held expert opinion that case fatality is approximately 1%, and also in line with estimates produced by Mogasale and colleagues, which ranged from 0·4% to 2·1%. Beyond data limitations, our unsafe water covariate is an imperfect proxy for microbiologically safe water, which would probably be a better measure of faecal contamination and typhoid fever risk. Moreover, our model does not capture the burden associated with chronic carriage, most notably the increased risk of gallstones and gallbladder cancer. Finally, our modelling framework is restricted to predefined GBD age groups, which precludes estimation of burden for finer age categories that might be informative for vaccine policy.

Pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma — P9425 ABVE-PC in intermediate/high-risk disease: In Pediatric Oncology Group (P9425), ABVE-PC was assessed in intermediate- or high-risk HL (n = 216; age < 22 years), with early response after 3 cycles guiding therapy: patients with RER received IFRT (21 Gy) and those with SER received 2 additional cycles (total of 5 cycles) followed by IFRT; among 209 evaluable patients, 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 84% (84% and 85% for intermediate- and high-risk, respectively; P = 0.87), EFS differed by large mediastinal adenopathy (LMA) status (80% ± 4% vs. 91% ± 3%; P = 0.03), dexrazoxane did not affect EFS but may increase risk for acute toxicity, especially typhlitis, 5-year overall survival (OS) was 95% and did not differ between RER and SER groups, and the trial allowed a reduction in alkylator and anthracycline exposure in 63% of patients.

### ED presentation of neutropenic enterocolitis in adult patients with acute leukemia [^c5310121]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the initial clinical features and subsequent outcomes in patients with adult leukemia with typhlitis or neutropenic enterocolitis. A retrospective review of 10 episodes of neutropenic enterocolitis in nine patients (age range, 21–71 years) with acute leukemia from March 1, 1990, through February 28, 2002, was conducted. In clinical presentations, fever appears in all patients, followed by abdominal pain or tenderness (90%) and diarrhea (60%), respectively. In particular, three cases were coincidentally diagnosed as leukemia before any chemotherapy. The most common diagnostic modality used for the diagnosis of neutropenic enterocolitis was computed tomography (CT) scan (seven episodes). Medical treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest, and total parenteral nutrition, were applied to seven patients. Laparotomy with bowel resection was performed on two patients with bowel necrosis and severe peritonitis. Of all nine cases, six were fatal as a result of sepsis, a common complication of neutropenic enterocolitis. As the incidence of neutropenic enterocolitis increases in patients with acute leukemia, EPs should be alert and make an early diagnosis of this rapidly deteriorated and life-threatening disease.

### A clinical, microbiological, and pathological study of intestinal perforation associated with typhoid fever [^72368843]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

One of the most serious complications of typhoid fever is intestinal perforation. Of 27 patients admitted to a provincial hospital in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam who had gastrointestinal perforation secondary to suspected typhoid fever, 67% were male, with a median age of 23 years and a median duration of illness of 10 days. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) was isolated from 11 (41%) of 27 patients; of 27 patients, only 4 (15%) had positive cultures from gut biopsies. S. Typhi DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction for all perforation biopsy samples. Detailed histological examination of the gastrointestinal mucosa at the site of perforation in all cases showed a combination of discrete acute and chronic inflammation. Acute inflammation at the serosal surface indicated additional tissue damage after perforation. Immunohistochemical results showed that the predominant infiltrating cell types at the site of perforation were CD68+ leukocytes (macrophages) or CD3+ leukocytes (T lymphocytes).

### Acute abdomen in the immunocompromised patient: WSES, SIS-E, WSIS, AAST, and GAIS guidelines [^e72283cd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Neutropenic enterocolitis generally presents with neutropenia associated with one or more of the following signs and symptoms: fever, bowel wall thickening, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

US signs that increase the risk of complications are fluid-filled bowel, ascites, free fluid between bowel loops, and hyperechoic septa floating inside the bowel's lumen (that correspond to bowel necrotic mucosa).

Half of the patients with signs and symptoms of neutropenic enteritis have an ultrasound positive for bowel wall thickening (> 5 mm), confirming the diagnosis. Up to 70% of patients with a positive US have a full recovery after a mean of 8 days; 100% of the patients without identified bowel wall thickening have a full recovery after an average of 4 days. Patients with US scan positive for bowel thickening > 10 mm had a higher death rate. Mortality in patients with US or CT scan positive for suggestive signs of neutropenic enteritis or typhlitis reaches 29.5%. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in patients undergoing conservative treatment with positive radiologic signs is mandatory (see diagnosis paragraph for high-risk radiological signs).

CT scan detection of right colon wall thickening is the best indicator of the diagnosis and a good predictor for the prognosis. Patients with bowel wall > 10 mm had a 60% risk of death compared to 4.2% if < 10 mm. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy must be initiated. The disease should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy according to the IDSA guidelines for "fever with neutropenia". They suggest monotherapy with an anti-pseudomonas B-lactam agent or a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam as the first choice. The addition of other antimicrobials may be suggested if no clinical improvement is observed and/or if a specific infection focus is suspected and/or in case of complications. No indications for the immediate administration of empirical antifungal therapy exist. Adjunct antifungal therapy may be added if fever failed to improve after empiric antibiotic therapy. Resolution is obtained in up to 86% of patients with conservative antibiotic treatment in a median of 6–8 days. Interestingly, a rise in the neutrophil count after nadir would directly correlate with the resolution of symptoms.

### Complications and mortality of typhoid fever: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^32b6121a]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review of published literature from 1980 through 2020 of predominantly hospitalized typhoid fever patients demonstrates a substantial prevalence of typhoid complications and death. We estimated a CFR of 2.0%, with significant variation by UN region. A considerable proportion of hospitalized patients with typhoid experienced complications. At the same time, delays in care, as measured by duration of fever or illness before presentation, were associated with increased CFR. However, we also identified significant differences in prevalence of complications and CFR between community-based and hospital-based studies, suggesting a bias towards poorer outcomes in hospital-based studies.

Among hospital-based non-surgical studies, the CFR of typhoid fever was significantly higher in Africa compared to Asia. Although there was no association between delay in care and CFR in Africa, our ability to detect an association was influenced by fewer data from Africa compared with Asia, where a statistically significant positive correlation was identified. Despite Africa comprising 39% of included study sites, it accounted for only 12% of all confirmed typhoid cases in our review. The limited data available on confirmed typhoid fever cases and smaller sample sizes of African studies may be due to lower typhoid incidence, compounded by the lack of capacity of many health care centers in Africa to obtain and perform blood cultures. Delays were longer in hospital-based sites compared to community-based sites, and such delays in diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and management of complications may contribute to the higher CFR identified among hospital studies. Others have linked duration of illness prior to hospitalization with increased prevalence of typhoid complications.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Salmonella typhi is the etiological agent of typhoid fever, an acute, febrile enteric disease. Typhoid fever continues to be an important disease in many parts of the world. Travelers entering infected areas are at risk of contracting typhoid fever following the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Typhoid fever is considered to be endemic in most areas of Central and South America, the African continent, the Near East and the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent (3). There are approximately 500 cases of typhoid fever per year diagnosed

in the United States (4). In 62% of these patients (data from 1975–1984) the disease was acquired outside of the United States while in 38% of the patients the disease was acquired within the United States (5). Of 340 cases acquired in the United States between 1977 and 1979, 23% of the cases were associated with typhoid carriers, 24% were due to food outbreaks, 23% were associated with the ingestion of contaminated food or water, 6% due to household contact with an infected person and 4% following exposure to S. typhi in a laboratory setting (6).

The majority of typhoid cases respond favorably to antibiotic therapy. However, the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains has greatly complicated therapy and cases of typhoid fever that are treated with ineffective drugs can be fatal (7). Approximately 2–4% of acute typhoid cases result in the development of a chronic carrier state (8). These non-symptomatic carriers are the natural reservoir for S. typhi and can serve to maintain the disease in its endemic state or to directly infect individuals (3).

### Typhoid fever with caecal ulcer bleed: managed conservatively [^9d8e80da]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Typhoid fever is caused by enteroinvasive Gram-negative organism Salmonella typhi. The well-known complications of typhoid fever are intestinal haemorrhage and perforation. In the pre-antibiotic era, these complications were quite common, but in the current antibiotic era the incidence of these complications is on the decline. We report a case of a patient with typhoid fever who developed haematochezia during the hospital stay and was found to have caecal ulcer with an adherent clot on colonoscopy. He was managed successfully with conservative measures without endotherapy and there was no rebleed.

### Global trends in typhoidal salmonellosis: a systematic review [^5f20f242]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Eligibility.

For a study or report to be eligible for inclusion in our review, it had to 1) report on blood culture–confirmed typhoid or paratyphoid fever; 2) report data from a period of at least 18 months, to account for any seasonality; and 3) report a valid population denominator (i.e. total population or total blood cultures), to allow for quantitative comparisons across time, populations, and settings. The one exception to the aforementioned criteria was the inclusion of government surveillance reports from national disease notification systems which sometimes incorporated other diagnostic methods such as serological testing and stool cultures. These data are presented as crude incidences and were included under the assumption that notification systems would use the reference standard for diagnosis available nationally. Eligible populations included the general population, hospitalized patients, and ambulatory care patients. Studies and reports focusing on a subpopulation with a preexisting morbidity (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], asthma, and cancer) were excluded. We also excluded studies or reports focusing on populations in which specific interventions had been evaluated (e.g. vaccines, WASH, or behavior change interventions); however, data from control arms of vaccine trials were included if the study was otherwise eligible. Our main goal was to assess changing incidence and prevalence trends of enteric fever in recent decades in endemic countries. For studies and reports from LMICs, we included only those published from 1990 onward, to assess recent trends. Robust, systematic blood culture data on enteric fever are scarce in developing countries before 1990 because of a lack of resources for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment; hence, we focused on 1990 onward where data collection was more robust. This cutoff was put in place to capture the most recent culture-confirmed data and the effects of earlier interventions implemented in the 1970s and 1980s that would begin to show their effects in the early 1990s. This time period also aligns with the Millennium Development Goals, allowing for potential comparisons with gains in maternal and child health. This relatively recent time period could also take into account advances in microbiological testing methodologies in these settings. At present, most typhoid and paratyphoid cases in high-income countries (HICs) are imported through travel; we thus applied no date restriction for inclusion of studies from HICs because historical data from these countries are needed to describe longitudinal typhoid trends. Initially, we extracted data on imported cases of enteric fever in HICs, but chose to exclude these studies during the synthesis phase as they do not shed light on disease trends and tend to remain quite low consistently. Finally, we restricted eligibility to studies or reports published or translated into English, as we did not have the capacity to systematically assess non-English texts.

### Venetoclax plus gilteritinib for-mutated relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia [^50d579d2]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2.
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 20% at Any Grade or ≥ 10% at Grade 3/4 in all Treated Patients Irrespective of Attribution

Forty-nine patients (80%) experienced a grade 3/4 cytopenia, leading to venetoclax and gilteritinib dose interruptions ≥ 7 days in 8 of 61 (13%) and 5 of 61 (8%) patients, respectively (Data Supplement). Twenty-five of 42 patients in mCRc (60%) experienced grade 3/4 cytopenias while in mCRc, leading to venetoclax and gilteritinib dose interruptions ≥ 7 days in six and five patients, respectively.

The 30-day and 60-day mortality rates were 0 and 13% (8 of 61), respectively, in all patients (0 and 13% [7 of 56] in FLT3 mut). Of 42 deaths on study, 29 were due to disease progression. Ten patients died of AEs (Data Supplement). Five of these 10 deaths occurred in patients while in mCRc (complicated fungal infection, aspergillus pneumonia, multiorgan failure, respiratory failure, and typhlitis), with 4 deaths occurring ≤ 30 days of stopping treatment and 1 death (complicated fungal infection) occurring > 30 days after treatment discontinuation. The other 5 of 10 AE-related deaths occurred in patients not in mCRc (sepsis, multiorgan failure, pseudomonas bacteremia, subdural hematoma, and death of unknown cause).
