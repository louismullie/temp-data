## Question

Patient has rectal cancer now has bloody stools. What labs should I order and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what labs to order for a patient with rectal cancer who now has bloody stools, and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is new-onset bleeding in a known rectal cancer patient. Then, I should verify which laboratory tests are guideline-recommended in the diagnostic and preoperative evaluation of rectal cancer. Next, I will consider the role of fecal immunochemical testing in symptomatic patients and whether it changes management here. After that, I should review how to interpret expected lab abnormalities in the setting of rectal bleeding. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized lab panel and explicitly state what not to order, anchoring to ASCRS and ESMO guidance and noting any nuances or exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. In a patient with established rectal cancer, new bloody stools most plausibly reflect tumor-related bleeding, but I need to ensure we do not anchor prematurely on benign causes like hemorrhoids without reassessing the disease status, because bleeding can signal progression, local recurrence, or simply ongoing tumor friability. Wait, let me verify the principle: even in primary care, rectal bleeding carries a nontrivial risk of colorectal cancer and warrants definitive evaluation, so in a known cancer patient, new bleeding merits prompt reassessment rather than reassurance [^d0ea8dfb] [^13e37d86].

> Next, I should review the core laboratory evaluation recommended for rectal cancer. ASCRS and ESMO both advise obtaining routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, and a baseline serum CEA, with CEA serving as a prognostic marker and a reference for surveillance rather than a diagnostic test per se. I should confirm that this applies across preoperative and ongoing care phases, and yes, both guidelines consistently include these elements in the initial workup and follow-up planning [^49021510] [^fc8e488d] [^d0842850] [^6de73f57].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stool testing. My first instinct is to consider a fecal immunochemical test because it is highly sensitive for colorectal cancer in symptomatic cohorts, but wait, I need to check the indication here. FIT is validated for triage of undiagnosed symptomatic patients and for screening, not for patients with known rectal cancer, so ordering FIT in this scenario would not change management and could delay definitive evaluation; I should correct that impulse and avoid FIT in a known cancer patient with new bleeding [^a60d9332] [^1093e4db] [^4e4df213].

> I will now examine the role of CEA more closely. Preoperative CEA is prognostically meaningful and establishes a baseline for surveillance; serial CEA can help detect recurrence, though it is not perfect and should be interpreted in clinical context. Let me verify that routine use of other tumor markers like CA 19–9 is not supported in rectal cancer, and indeed ASCRS notes insufficient evidence for CA 19–9 in this setting, reinforcing CEA as the primary marker when obtained [^6de73f57] [^fc8e488d].

> Next, I should review what to expect from the CBC and how to interpret it. Chronic rectal bleeding from a rectal tumor can cause iron deficiency anemia, so I anticipate low hemoglobin, low MCV, and low ferritin if measured; importantly, anemia modestly increases the likelihood of colorectal cancer in primary care cohorts, which underscores the need for timely endoscopic evaluation rather than relying on labs alone to exclude disease. I should double-check that this aligns with diagnostic accuracy data, and yes, anemia carries a pooled positive likelihood ratio around 3.7 in symptomatic primary care populations, which is clinically meaningful for triage even if it does not rule in or out cancer by itself [^7708cf7e] [^13e131be].

> Let me consider liver and renal function tests pragmatically. Liver chemistries help screen for metastatic disease and assess hepatic reserve if systemic therapy or surgery is planned, while renal function informs contrast use for imaging and chemotherapy dosing. I should confirm that these are standard in rectal cancer pathways, and both ASCRS and ESMO include them in the initial laboratory assessment, which supports ordering them now [^49021510] [^d0842850].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is brisk or the patient is unstable. I need to ensure I do not overlook acute blood loss physiology. In addition to CBC, I should consider a basic metabolic panel to evaluate for electrolyte disturbances, prerenal azotemia, and metabolic alkalosis that can accompany significant GI bleeding, and I should be ready to escalate to urgent endoscopic or surgical evaluation if hemodynamic compromise is present. This aligns with general principles of GI bleeding management and the urgency implied by new bleeding in a cancer patient [^notfound].

> I should also confirm what not to order. Stool DNA testing, urine or serum screening assays, and in-office digital rectal exam stool testing are not appropriate in a patient with overt rectal bleeding and known rectal cancer; these are either screening tools for average-risk populations or have poor diagnostic performance in symptomatic patients and should be avoided here. Let me verify guideline positions, and yes, multisociety guidance restricts stool-based tests to screening contexts and advises against in-office DRE stool sampling for screening, which reinforces avoiding these in this symptomatic, known-cancer scenario [^7bc00e25] [^f21de59c] [^5b050561].

> Synthesizing this, I should order a complete blood count with indices to assess for anemia and its chronicity, a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver and renal function tests to screen for metastasis and establish organ function baselines, and a serum CEA to establish a baseline for prognosis and surveillance. I should not order FIT, stool DNA, or other screening-oriented stool tests, and I should not rely on CEA alone to diagnose recurrence or progression. Next steps should include prompt clinical assessment, consideration of pelvic MRI for local staging if not recently done, and colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy to evaluate the bleeding source and obtain tissue for molecular profiling if indicated, consistent with rectal cancer pathways and the need to correlate labs with endoscopic and imaging findings [^49021510] [^d0842850] [^67cf6f77].

---

For a patient with rectal cancer and bloody stools, order a **complete blood count (CBC)** to assess for anemia and quantify blood loss, and a **basic metabolic panel (BMP)** to evaluate electrolytes, renal function, and hydration status. Add **liver function tests (LFTs)** to screen for hepatic metastases, and obtain a **carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)** level for baseline tumor marker and prognostic assessment [^49021510] [^d0842850]. These labs guide transfusion needs, perioperative risk, and surveillance planning; **do not use stool FIT or gFOBT** for evaluation because they are for screening, not diagnostic workup in symptomatic patients [^4e4df213].

---

## Essential laboratory tests and their clinical rationale

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | - Detect anemia (iron deficiency or acute blood loss) <br/> - Assess severity of bleeding <br/> - Guide transfusion decisions and perioperative planning [^387ce3d4] |
| Basic metabolic panel (BMP) | - Evaluate electrolyte disturbances (e.g. hypokalemia from diarrhea) <br/> - Assess renal function <br/> - Determine hydration status and guide fluid management [^notfound] |
| Liver function tests (LFTs) | - Screen for hepatic metastases <br/> - Assess hepatic reserve before surgery or chemotherapy [^notfound] |
| Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) | - Establish baseline tumor marker <br/> - Inform prognosis <br/> - Enable longitudinal surveillance for recurrence [^6de73f57] |

---

## Additional laboratory considerations

- **Coagulation profile (PT/INR, aPTT)**: Consider if bleeding is significant or if anticoagulation is present to guide correction before invasive procedures.
- **Type and crossmatch**: If anemia is severe or transfusion is anticipated, ensure blood products are available.
- **Ferritin and iron studies**: If anemia is suspected to be iron deficiency, confirm and guide replacement therapy.

---

## Laboratory tests not recommended

Avoid **fecal immunochemical test (FIT)** and **guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)** in symptomatic patients with overt bleeding; these are screening tools for asymptomatic populations and are not validated for diagnostic evaluation of known rectal cancer with active bleeding [^4e4df213].

---

## Clinical implications of laboratory results

- **Anemia**: Indicates chronic blood loss, may require transfusion, and can worsen tumor hypoxia; severity informs perioperative risk and need for optimization [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis from chronic diarrhea/vomiting require correction to stabilize cardiopulmonary function and enable safe surgery [^notfound].
- **Elevated LFTs**: Suggest possible liver metastases, prompting imaging (CT/MRI) and altering surgical or oncologic management [^67cf6f77].
- **Elevated CEA**: Associated with worse prognosis and higher recurrence risk; serial CEA aids surveillance and early detection of recurrence [^6de73f57].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Order a **CBC, BMP, LFTs, and CEA** for a patient with rectal cancer and bloody stools to assess anemia, electrolyte/renal status, hepatic involvement, and baseline tumor marker; add coagulation studies and type/crossmatch if bleeding is significant or procedures are planned. Avoid FIT/gFOBT because they are not for symptomatic diagnostic use. These labs inform transfusion, perioperative risk, and surveillance planning.

Discussion

Principal results

No individual symptom, sign or diagnostic test in patients with rectal bleeding is likely to shift the probability of colorectal cancer to the extent of 'ruling in' or 'ruling out' the diagnosis with any degree of certainty. Even the presence of anaemia (< 12.0 g per 100 mL for women and < 13.3 g per 100 mL for men) produces a shift in post-test probability to 21.6% (assuming a prior probability of 7.0%), a level that requires further diagnostic testing before colorectal cancer diagnosis is confirmed. 'Red flag' symptoms, such as weight loss and blood mixed with stool, seem to have only modest diagnostic value. Although the presence of these symptoms nearly doubles the post-test probability of colorectal cancer to about 13%, and their presence should ensure referral for further investigation, caution is needed when counselling patients about the possible reasons for their referral in terms of likely diagnoses. The fact that a presenting patient may be aged over 60 years also only provides modest diagnostic value in terms of probability of colorectal cancer (Table 3).

The findings from this systematic review have implications for clinical practice guidelines, showing that considerable diagnostic uncertainty is likely to exist in patients presenting to their general practitioner, even when they have additional symptoms, signs or test results that are conventionally associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The ideal threshold for referral is subject to several factors: individual patient's utilities or values regarding timely identification of colorectal cancer balanced against the iatrogenic harm and psychological damage of unnecessary investigation, and potential harm in patients free from disease. In addition, cost effectiveness of different referral thresholds in relation to probability of colorectal cancer also needs to be considered. To resolve these difficulties, formal cost utility estimates are required, which incorporate patient's utilities and cost at different referral thresholds.

Preoperative assessment — evaluation includes a graded directive for history and labs. A cancer-specific history should be obtained eliciting disease-specific symptoms, associated symptoms, family history, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including CEA level, should also be evaluated, as indicated; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence (1B). A cancer-specific history remains a cornerstone of the preoperative evaluation.

Future studies

There are considerable challenges with undertaking cohort studies of rectal bleeding in primary care, including recruitment of consecutive patients; eliciting full history of symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests; consenting 'low risk' patients to potentially unpleasant and invasive reference standard tests, and ensuring adequate follow-up of patients. Furthermore, the relative rarity of colorectal cancer in primary care makes it difficult to design a study large enough to yield adequate power to detected significant clinical predictors of colorectal cancer.

Despite these challenges, this systematic review shows that the evidence base is not substantial at present and that further studies are required, which assess the diagnostic accuracy of lower gastrointestinal symptoms in community settings. A study assessing the combined value of rectal bleeding and additional symptoms has been undertaken in secondary care, showing that patients presenting with rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habit without perianal symptoms are at highest risk of colorectal cancer (PLR: 4.2). Patients with rectal bleeding and perianal symptoms, but without a change in bowel habit had lowest risk of colorectal cancer (negative likelihood ratio: 1.3). Similar studies, focussing on patients presenting in primary care are needed.

Future studies should recruit consecutive patients, apply an agreed reference standard to all patients and evaluate the combined value of symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in the form of a clinical prediction rule. Future primary studies should also report their data completely, preferably using the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria as guidelines.

In conclusion, this systematic review shows that no individual symptom, sign or diagnostic test in patients with rectal bleeding is likely to conclusively raise the probability of colorectal cancer in primary care settings. Even conventionally stated 'red flag' symptoms, such as weight loss and blood mixed with stool, have modest diagnostic value. Future studies are needed to establish the diagnostic value of individual and combined symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests so that the evidence base for appropriate and timely referral is more secure.

### What methods are used to… [^f3565784]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Stool tests. Both polyps and colorectal cancers can bleed, and stool tests check for tiny amounts of blood in feces that cannot be seen visually. With these tests, stool samples are collected by the patient using a kit, and the samples are sent to a laboratory for testing. People who have a positive finding with these tests are advised to have a colonoscopy. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved several types of stool tests to screen for colorectal cancer, including: If FIT is the only type of colorectal cancer screening test performed, experts generally recommend testing every year or two. Multitarget stool DNA testing. sDNA-FIT detects hemoglobin, along with certain DNA biomarkers.

The DNA comes from cells in the lining of the colon and rectum that are shed and collect in stool as it passes through the large intestine and rectum. Experts generally suggest sDNA-FIT testing at least every 3 years. The barium helps to outline the colon and the rectum on the images. DCBE is rarely used for colorectal cancer screening; however, it may be used for people who cannot undergo standard colonoscopy — for example, because they are at particular risk for complications. Single-specimen gFOBT done in a doctor's office. Doctors sometimes perform gFOBT on a stool sample collected during a digital rectal examination as part of a routine physical examination. However, this approach is not an effective way to screen for colorectal cancer. Researchers are continuing to improve the sensitivity of stool-based screening for detecting advanced adenomatous polyps, which can potentially become colorectal cancer, by testing for the presence of other types of biomarkers.

For example, a multitarget stool RNA test that detects occult hemoglobin, along with levels of eight colorectal cancer–associated RNA markers was approved in 2024 for colorectal cancer screening. Researchers have also found that measuring three protein biomarkers in stool — hemoglobin, calprotectin, and serpin family F member 2 — improved the ability of FIT to detect advanced lesions without reducing its specificity.

Colorectal cancer is common. As many patients present with advanced disease, an effective screening test would have substantial clinical benefits. Recent progress in understanding the biology of colorectal cancer (and of cancer cells in general) has led to possible new approaches to screening. In particular, there are prospects of developing tests based on analysis of stool, which promise improved accuracy, safety, affordability and patient compliance.

Colorectal cancer surveillance — symptom triggers: During the course of surveillance, the development of suspicious symptoms should prompt investigation because these may be the first sign of CRC recurrence. In randomized studies, 16% to 66% of patients with CRC were symptomatic at the time of their diagnosis of recurrence, yet < 7% of patients with symptomatic CRC recurrence have resectable disease. Suspicious symptoms commonly include new-onset abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal mass, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms.

### Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer [^d0ea8dfb]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with symptoms of rectal bleeding commonly seek medical advice in primary care. A Dutch national survey on primary care revealed an incidence of rectal bleeding of 1.6 per 1000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4–1.8) people in the general population seeking medical help from their general practitioner. However, the majority of patients with rectal bleeding in primary care do not have serious disease, with estimates of the risk of colorectal cancer varying between 2.4 and 11.0%.

As rectal bleeding is a recognised early symptom of colorectal cancer, primary care has an important role in its early detection. Timely and efficient referral leading to early diagnosis of colorectal cancer may contribute to improved survival. Current UK guidelines recommend urgent referral of patients aged 40 years and older who report rectal bleeding with a change of bowel habit towards looser stools and/or increased stool frequency persisting for 6 weeks or more. Patients aged above 60 years should be urgently referred if they have rectal bleeding alone or changed bowel habit without anal symptoms for 6 weeks or more. Referring patients at low risk of colorectal cancer may lead to unnecessary harm (patient anxiety and iatrogenic harm from further diagnostic investigations) and longer waiting time for high-risk patients. An observational study in the United Kingdom reported an average time interval of 47 days between symptom presentation and diagnosis.

The incidence of colorectal cancer in people experiencing rectal bleeding in the general population is < 1 per 1000 people, and increases to 20–110 per 1000 patients in a primary care setting, and to 360 per 1000 patients in a secondary care setting. These differing incidences reflect the increasing probability of colorectal cancer in each community and hospital setting. In general, two selection processes occur as a patient seeks medical help and is assessed in primary care. First, a patient with rectal bleeding decides whether or not to visit a general practitioner regarding his/her symptom of rectal bleeding. About 28–41% of people experiencing rectal bleeding consult their general practitioner. Second, their general practitioner performs a gate-keeping function, prioritising patients in terms of probability of colorectal cancer.

The aim of this diagnostic accuracy systematic review is to assess the additional diagnostic value of concurrent symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in patients presenting to their general practitioner with rectal bleeding to stratify patients into low, medium or high probability groups of colorectal cancer and assist clinical decision making in primary care.

Diagnostic value of rectal bleeding and related symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests

In the primary studies, all patients had rectal bleeding and presented with additional symptoms. The pooled positive likelihood ratios (PLRs), sensitivities and specificities for individual symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests are presented in Table 3. Overall, the magnitudes of the pooled PLRs are modest, with no individual symptom, sign or diagnostic test able to alter the probability of colorectal cancer into a definite range of 'ruling in' or 'ruling out' the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Even classical symptoms, such as a history of weight loss and anaemia yield a modest pooled positive likelihood ratio of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.03–3.07) and 3.67 (95% CI: 1.30–10.35), respectively. Pooled sensitivities are low, varying from 0.17 to 0.62. Weight loss and anaemia yield a pooled specificity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83–0.96) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.96), respectively (Table 3).

### ESMO consensus guidelines for management of patients with colon and rectal cancer. a personalized approach to clinical decision making [^43b04fd8]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common tumour type in both sexes combined in Western countries. Although screening programmes including the implementation of faecal occult blood test and colonoscopy might be able to reduce mortality by removing precursor lesions and by making diagnosis at an earlier stage, the burden of disease and mortality is still high. Improvement of diagnostic and treatment options increased staging accuracy, functional outcome for early stages as well as survival. Although high quality surgery is still the mainstay of curative treatment, the management of CRC must be a multi-modal approach performed by an experienced multi-disciplinary expert team. Optimal choice of the individual treatment modality according to disease localization and extent, tumour biology and patient factors is able to maintain quality of life, enables long-term survival and even cure in selected patients by a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Treatment decisions must be based on the available evidence, which has been the basis for this consensus conference-based guideline delivering a clear proposal for diagnostic and treatment measures in each stage of rectal and colon cancer and the individual clinical situations. This ESMO guideline is recommended to be used as the basis for treatment and management decisions.

### 2017 WSES guidelines on colon and rectal cancer emergencies: obstruction and perforation [^1e4f16b5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Results

The results are hereby presented separately as O (obstruction) and P (perforation) when required; otherwise, the statements can be considered valid for both conditions.

Diagnosis

Statement 1.1: The clinical presentation is variable, except for lower rectal cancer, in which case digital examination could be diagnostic. Laboratory tests are not specific. Clinical evaluation and laboratory tests have high variability and low specificity; therefore, the escalation to further diagnostic tools, whenever available, is mandatory. LoE 3, GoR B.

Obstruction

Large bowel obstruction can present acutely, with colic-like abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and absence of bowel movement and flatus, while vomiting is less frequent than in small bowel obstruction, or subacutely, with gradual development of symptoms, changes in bowel habits and recurrent left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In a series of 150 consecutive patients suffering from acute mechanical bowel obstruction, 24% presented with large bowel obstruction. Absence of passage of flatus (90%) and/or faeces (80.6%) and abdominal distension (65.3%) were the most common symptoms and physical signs.

Abdominal examination shows tenderness, abdominal distension and hyperactive or absent bowel sounds.

Previous complaint of bloody stools and passage of blood per rectum, despite the absence of bowel movement, can be associated with colon cancer. A rectal cancer may be palpable as an intrinsic lesion.

Laboratory tests are directed at evaluating the electrolyte imbalances, elevated urea nitrogen and metabolic alkalosis that may occur as a consequence of vomiting and dehydration.

Perforation

When perforation occurs at the tumour site, peritoneal contamination is usually localised; at the opposite, when perforation is located proximal to the tumour site, the faecal spread results in diffuse peritonitis and septic shock.

In this setting, physical examination reveals an acutely ill patient characterised by fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and confusion.

The abdomen may be diffusely tender or may present localised tenderness, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are usually absent. The toxic symptoms of peritonitis are usually delayed, but are considered an ominous sign. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia, elevated amylase levels and lactic acidosis suggest perforation or necrosis. The suspicion of large bowel obstruction or perforation is based on aspecific symptoms, signs and laboratory findings: adjunctive diagnostic tests are mandatory, whenever available (Fig. 1).

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^e7b7a33d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Different pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with rectal and colon cancer and some associations are stronger among early-onset CRC patients, specifically blood in stool. With the rise of early-onset CRC and with the recognition of suboptimal screening adherence in the general population, it is crucial for providers to consider CRC in the differential. This evaluation of red flag symptoms by anatomic site can be used to inform subsequent diagnostic evaluation, which may decrease the latency of CRC diagnosis in affected individuals and/or rule out cancer in unaffected individuals with similar symptoms.

Laboratory Tests

Laboratory tests play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of CRC. A complete blood count is performed to detect anaemia, which can be indicative of chronic GI bleeding, and stool testing for occult blood is undertaken as it may indicate lesions in the GI tract. Additionally, liver and renal function tests are assessed to evaluate organ functionality.

In cases where CRC is suspected, tumour biomarkers are measured to aid in diagnosis and disease monitoring. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the most widely utilized biomarker for CRC, particularly for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), while primarily associated with liver cancers, may occasionally be measured to evaluate for potential liver metastases. Additionally, CA125 is used in cases where ovarian or peritoneal metastases are suspected.

Imaging

Initial imaging techniques are crucial for the detection and evaluation of CRC. CT imaging is the preferred modality for assessing intra-abdominal metastases due to its superior sensitivity and detailed visualization of abdominal organs and lymph nodes. For rectal cancer, rectal MRI is the preferred imaging technique where available, as it provides superior anatomical detail and accurately assesses tumour depth and potential involvement of surrounding structures. Furthermore, barium gas double X-ray is employed to identify filling defects and mucosal degradation in the intestine.

Endoscopy, Biopsy and Histopathology

Following laboratory tests and initial imaging, endoscopic procedures are conducted to evaluate CRC in detail. These procedures included sigmoidoscopy, rectoscopy, and colonoscopy, which help assess tumor size, depth, location, infiltration, and morphology. During endoscopy, biopsies of any suspicious lesions are taken for histopathological examination, which is essential for confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment plans.

Although colonoscopy is an invasive procedure, less invasive alternatives, such as capsule endoscopy, have been developed to examine nearly the entire GI tract. This technique offers a more patient friendly option while still providing valuable diagnostic information.

Genetic Testing

Several mutations in genes including APC, NRAS, KRAS, TP53 and BRAF contribute to CRC pathogenesis. While testing for these genetic mutations provides valuable information for guiding treatment strategies and assessing prognosis, it is not diagnostic of CRC. Testing for mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression or microsatellite instability (MSI) is often conducted to identify specific tumour characteristics and guide therapeutic decisions, such as the use of immunotherapy. Although research into chromosomal instability (CIN) and the use of microRNAs as prognostic or predictive markers is ongoing, these tools are not yet widely used in clinical practice.

Stool-Based Tests

Stool-based tests include the high-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and stool DNA test. Both high-sensitivity gFOBT and FIT detect blood in the stool; however, they use different methods. High-sensitivity gFOBT is based on chemical detection of blood, while FIT uses antibodies to detect blood.¹¹ Stool DNA tests detect DNA biomarkers for cancer in cells shed from the lining of the colon and rectum into stool.¹¹

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^5b050561]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Digital rectal examination (DRE) stool samples in fecal testing are addressed by noting that both the American Cancer Society and the United States Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommend against using a DRE during a clinical encounter for completion of gFOBT screening, and evidence suggests that the sensitivity of in-office testing for advanced neoplasia and colorectal cancer detection is very low. For FIT, a single stool sample can be used for screening, but one study showed significantly different test performance when comparing passed stool versus DRE-obtained samples, with a higher positivity rate using the DRE sample in patients presenting for a medical check-up (n = 1688; 5.4% vs 3.5% with a passed stool sample).

Other tumor markers and blood tests in colorectal cancer surveillance — evidence summary: The GILDA trial tested carbohydrate antigen 19–9 in addition to CEA in the intensive follow-up group but this testing did not improve outcomes. No randomized trial or meta-analysis has reported a significant survival effect from other common tests such as serum hemoglobin, liver function studies, or fecal occult blood. In a randomized controlled trial of 597 patients, serum hemoglobin and liver function tests had low sensitivities for detecting recurrence; therefore, these tests are not typically recommended, and the role of circulating DNA has not been established for surveillance after curative treatment.

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^b9a2519a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for research and practice

The results of this study show that different symptoms portend a diagnosis of rectal vs. colon cancer. Despite increasing adherence to CRC screening and the revision of the recommended screening age to 45 years old in 2020, there are still frequent cases of CRC being diagnosed after the development of symptoms. Additionally, there has been an increase in CRC incidence rates in those less than the age of 50 who have symptomatic CRC.

Given that rectal cancer most often presents with red flag symptoms, blood in stool and changes to stool, clinical providers should pay acute attention to a patient's symptoms when ordering screening tests that detect CRC. Knowing what symptoms are more likely to be associated with rectal or colon cancer could result in more targeted diagnostic screening practices. Screening with a FIT/FOBT has been shown to be effective in reducing the mortality from rectal cancer but not in reducing the mortality from colon cancer. FIT/FOBT is associated with early CRC diagnosis and may be an effective test for patients who are experiencing blood in stool or changes to stool.

Strengths and limitations

There are a few limitations of this study that should be considered. Participants who did not have data for receiving a screening test or symptoms leading to diagnosis were excluded from the analysis due to missing exposure status, which limited our sample size. These participants were slightly older than the study population (60.5 years) and were mostly diagnosed with colon cancer. We also excluded participants with hereditary CRC, diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, or who had a colectomy prior to their CRC diagnosis date because they may have different screening recommendations or be at higher risk for CRC and should be analyzed separately from average-risk participants. The small sample size negatively impacted our CIs, potentially biasing results. We relied on medical record completeness and there may be some misclassification of symptoms and missed symptoms (due to incomplete patient recall or misunderstanding by the physician) which would attenuate our results. We also did not have information on levels of symptom severity or duration. Lastly, this study only included cases of CRC which prevents us from comparing the prevalence of symptoms among people who do not have cancer. To know if this association is significant in the general population, future research on this topic should consider including patients without cancer diagnoses and account for the time between symptom onset and diagnosis.

Some strengths of this study are that it is a well characterized population-based study. We used a broad and robust dataset that included medical record data and data from baseline questionnaires that allowed for adjustment of confounding variables, however residual confounding may still be present.

### Combining faecal immunochemical testing with blood test results for colorectal cancer risk stratification: a consecutive cohort of 16, 604 patients presenting to primary care [^5dde609d]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Patient demographics, clinical indication, prevalence of abnormal blood tests, FIT score, and performance of FIT were largely consistent prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Additional file 1: Tables S4 and S5). The median age of persons undergoing FIT was older during COVID (64 vs. 59 years), but the interquartile range was similar (51 to 76 vs. 51 to 74). There were no significant differences in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, or NPV of FIT.

PPV was higher among males than females, but the confidence intervals for the two sexes overlapped at a threshold of 10 μg Hb/g faeces. At 2 μg Hb/g faeces, PPV and NPV decreased with increasing age. At 10 μg Hb/g faeces, PPV and NPV were largely consistent by age group (Additional file 1: Table S6).

There was no evidence that the PPV of FIT was significantly higher within subgroups defined by symptoms at presentation or blood test other than MCV (Additional file 1: Table S6). Sensitivity increased and specificity decreased in subgroups defined by increasingly severe anaemia (Additional file 1: Table S7). Fifty-seven percent of patients met the criteria for FIT under the DG30, which specifies use for patients without rectal bleeding and specific symptoms depending on age. The incidence of cancer was slightly lower in the DG30-qualifying group (0.8 vs. 0.9%), and specificity was marginally higher (84.3 vs. 82.5% in other, Supplementary Table 8). Results did not meaningfully change when the follow-up period was extended to 12 months (Additional file 1: Tables S9 and S10). The positive predictive value of an abnormal blood test in the FIT-negative population was consistently less than 1% (Additional file 1: Table S11).

World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus Topic: A. Epidemiology

Key Question 2. Screening strategies. In elderly patients with rectal cancer, how do the current screening strategies compared with no screening affect prognosis?

Statement. The potential benefits of screening for rectal cancer in elderly patients may vary broadly with age, life expectancy, and screening modalities. Life expectancy and comorbidity should be carefully considered in this context. Subject testing negative for screening, especially after negative colonoscopy, could consider discontinuing screening tests at the age of 75 years.

Recommendation. The experts' panel recommends against screening in patients older than 85 years. We suggest a careful selection on an individual basis for patients between the ages of 76 and 85 years, according to their health status (Strong recommendation, Moderate quality of evidence — 1B).

Agreement: 88.2%

Colorectal cancer screening is recommended for average-risk individuals between the ages of 50 and 75 years. Once patients are older than 75 years, the risk-to-benefit ratio of ongoing screening begins to shift. The potential benefits of screening for rectal cancer in elderly patients may vary broadly with age, life expectancy, and screening modalities (i.e. stool-based, radiological, blood testing, and endoscopic screening). Current guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American Cancer Society (ACS), recommend against screening patients for rectal cancer between the ages of 76 and 85. However, in this age group, screening could be suggested on an individual patient basis after personalized assessment. The USPSTF and the ACS also recommend against screening for individuals older than 85 years. Both the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines reported the potential benefits of screening in patients up to 86 years if they had not been screened before. The cost-effectiveness analysis performed by van Hees et al. to assess whether screening should be considered in unscreened elderly subjects aged 76 to 90 years found that screening was cost-effective up to age 86 years. Screening with colonoscopy was indicated up to age 83 years, sigmoidoscopy was indicated at age 84 years, and the fecal immunochemical test was indicated at ages 85 and 86. Nevertheless, comorbidity should be carefully considered in this context. In unscreened individuals with severe comorbid conditions, screening was cost-effective up to age 80 years (colonoscopy indicated up to age 77 years, sigmoidoscopy at age 78 years, and fecal immunochemical test at ages 79 and 80).

### Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer [^13e131be]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Rectal bleeding is a recognised early symptom of colorectal cancer. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in patients with rectal bleeding in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in primary care.

Methods

Diagnostic accuracy systematic review. Medline (1966 to May 2009), Embase (1988 to May 2009), British Nursing Index (1991 to May 2009) and PsychINFO (1970 to May 2009) were searched. We included cohort studies that assessed the diagnostic utility of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in primary care. An eight-point quality assessment tool was produced to assess the quality of included studies. Pooled positive likelihood ratios (PLRs), sensitivities and specificities were calculated.

Results

Eight studies incorporating 2323 patients were included. Average weighted prior probability of colorectal cancer was 7.0% (range: 3.3–15.4%, median: 8.1%). Age ≥ 60 years (pooled PLR: 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00–3.90), weight loss (pooled PLR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.03–3.07) and change in bowel habit (pooled PLR: 1.92, 95% CI: 0.54–3.57) raise the probability of colorectal cancer into the range of referral to secondary care but do not conclusively 'rule in' the diagnosis. Presence of severe anaemia has the highest diagnostic value (pooled PLR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.30–10.35), specificity 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.96), but still only generates a post-test probability of 21.6%.

Conclusions

In patients with rectal bleeding who present to their general practitioner, additional 'red flag' symptoms have modest diagnostic value. These findings have implications in relation to recommendations contained in clinical practice guidelines.

Figure 6
Use of faecal calprotectin in primary care.

Faecal calprotectin is generally raised in patients with bloody diarrhoea and patients with this presenting feature will need flexible sigmoidoscopy regardless of the calprotectin result. In acute diarrhoea due to infection, calprotectin is also likely to be raised and will not discriminate between IBD and gastroenteritis, thus stool culture and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are the appropriate diagnostic investigations. While there is limited evidence to support routine repeat testing, an evaluation of the York Faecal Calprotectin Care Pathway found that, in 243 patients with a faecal calprotectin ≥ 100 µg/g after a median of 18 (IQR 14–29) days, repeat testing identified a reduction in 53% of patients, either to < 100 µg/g or, if initially > 250 µg/g, into the 100–250 µg/g range.

Faecal calprotectin is not sensitive enough in the exclusion of advanced colorectal adenoma or colorectal carcinoma, and so in patients with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, or iron-deficiency anaemia, cancer pathway referral should be strongly consideredand calprotectin is not appropriate. In primary care, symptoms of change in bowel habit with rectal bleeding and abnormal haematology in patients under 50 years are strongly predictive of IBD or colorectal cancer, but generally do not discriminate between the two. IBD is significantly more common in younger age groups, so referral will generally be to medical gastroenterologists. However, if there are reasons to suspect malignancy, patients should be referred via a suspected cancer pathway, although both need rapid colonoscopy (figure 6).

Colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance and survivorship — epidemiology and care context are described, noting that more than 140,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually with CRC, and 5% to 40% of patients treated with curative intent develop a recurrence, typically within 5 years, with CRC survivors comprising ≈1.5 million individuals in the United States. Surveillance recommendations include periodically taking a history, performing a physical examination, and evaluating laboratory blood testing, imaging studies, and endoscopy, and an individual may be considered a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis, during and immediately after treatment, and for the rest of his or her life. Recognizing late and long-term effects, survivors should be assessed for these sequelae and treated to improve their QoL. The survivorship framework cited includes a 2006 Institute of Medicine report on survivorship needs, that the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer, updated in 2020, includes standards for survivorship care as part of cancer center accreditation, and that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) now has a comprehensive guideline for survivorship care.

Our analysis also has other limitations. First, we did not compare the tests directly with each other due to insufficient studies directly comparing devices; all three comparative studies identified concluded that there were differences in tests. Further head‐to‐head studies are needed. Second, we did not investigate the timing of the reference standard and cannot draw conclusions about what the optimal follow‐up should be to avoid interval cancers affecting the false‐negative rate, nor for how long a FIT test can be considered 'valid'. Thirdly, all studies were at some risk of bias.

We identified evidence gaps and uncertainties. There were insufficient and inconsistent data relating to patient characteristics (anaemia, age, sex, etc.) and, consistent with the ACPGBI/BSG guideline, no conclusions could be drawn on whether different thresholds should be used in these patients. The recently published COLOFIT studyhelps resolve some of these issues as it tested these and other factors in a predictive algorithm and found most made little difference. The COLOFIT authors recommend further external validation of their algorithm before implementation. None of the studies on dual FIT were conducted in primary care patients before their referral decision was made, creating uncertainty about return rates in that context, and potentially about test accuracy, since three studies recruited largely high‐risk patients. Reporting of the inclusion of patients with symptoms that historically led to immediate referral (rectal or anal mass or anal ulceration) was often missing, and some studies excluded patients with rectal bleeding. This should be borne in mind when interpreting the evidence base.

Impact on policy

The results of this analysis were used in a cost‐effectiveness analysis (to be reported in a subsequent publication) to assess both cost‐effectiveness and clinical effectiveness. This model also estimated the likely impact on waiting times for colonoscopies and time to diagnosis. It formed part of the NICE committee's deliberations and led to a change in policy (Diagnostic Guidance 56, which has been incorporated into the current version of NG12), which aligned with the ACPGBI/BSG guideline to use the test at a threshold of 10 μg/g, albeit in patients with specific signs and symptoms suggestive of CRC.

### Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer [^2dc537a2]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Context of previous studies

Our results differ from a recent UK case–control study that assessed the diagnostic value of clinical features of colorectal cancer before diagnosis. This study identified cases from a cancer registry and controls selected and matched in terms of age and registration with a general practice. In this case–control study, PLRs were considerably higher than found in this systematic review of cohort studies. For example, PLRs for weight loss (5.1), abdominal pain (4.5) and anaemia < 10 g per 100 mL (9.5) would all be associated with definitive shifts in the probability of colorectal cancer. The most likely explanation for this discordant finding is that recall bias amongst controls may have produced a comparison group that did not remember having colorectal symptoms in the past, thus inflating estimates of diagnostic utility for symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests when compared with individuals with colorectal cancer.

Our results are more consistent with a recent diagnostic accuracy review of cohort studies that included patients in both primary and secondary care presenting with 'alarm' features. In their systematic review the overall conclusion was that most alarm features of colorectal cancer had poor sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The presence of rectal bleeding (PLR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.19–1.47), weight loss (PLR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.25–3.08) or iron deficiency anaemia (PLR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.75–2.74) do raise the probability of colorectal cancer but only to a modest extent. The results from this systematic review of cohort studies in primary care, in which rectal bleeding was an inclusion criterion, are broadly similar in relation to diagnostic utility of symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests.

### Value of symptoms and additional diagnostic tests for colorectal cancer in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^781a6f36]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Signs

Five studies reported on the diagnostic performance of a palpable mass (table 5). Sensitivity ranged from 0.04 (abdominal tumour) to 0.25 (rectal mass), while specificity ranged from 0.89 to 0.99 (rectal mass). In the study of Flashman et al general practitioners identified in the same cohort of patients many more palpable abdominal or rectal masses than clinicians in the clinic (43 v 22 and 53 v 28, respectively). Of the 43 patients identified by the general practitioner as having an abdominal mass, seven (16%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer compared with four of the 22 (18%) identified in the clinic. Of the 53 patients identified by the general practitioner as having a rectal mass, 12 (23%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer compared with 13 of 28 (46%) identified in the clinic.

*Two week referral criterion.

Symptoms

Individual symptoms most commonly investigated included abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, (change in) bowel habit, and peri-anal symptoms. For abdominal pain (20 studies)test results were heterogeneous with sensitivity ranging from 0.00 to 0.73 and specificity from 0.19 to 0.91 (table 2). In four of the 13 secondary care studies (table 5) the risk for colorectal cancer was significantly lower among those with abdominal pain than among those without.

Table 6 shows data on rectal bleeding (13 studies). Sensitivity ranged from 0.25 to 0.86, while specificity ranged from 0.31 to 0.88 (table 2). Comparing the risk for colorectal cancer in those with a positive test result with those with a negative test result shows that patients with rectal bleeding, and also patients with blood mixed with stool have a somewhat higher risk (pooled estimates 0.07 and 0.06, respectively) than those without (pooled estimates 0.04 and 0.03, respectively) (table 2, fig 3). Confidence intervals, however, overlap each other. Patients with dark blood have a significantly higher risk than those without dark blood (pooled estimates 0.14, 0.09 to 0.21, and 0.05, 0.03 to 0.07, respectively) (table 2, fig 4).

Stool test collection and low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) use guidance — All manufacturers of stool tests recommend that CRC screening stool samples be collected at home, and because of low sensitivity and lack of validation when using an office-collected digital rectal examination sample, CRC screening guidelines recommend against in-office testing with stool collected during digital rectal examination. Due to poor performance, nonrehydrated, low-sensitivity gFOBT variants cannot be recommended and should not be used for CRC screening. National surveys indicate overall stool testing use is low; in 2015, 7.2% of US adults used an office test and 7.5% used a home test as part of stool testing in the United States.

Limitations of the present study

The validity of the results of this systematic review is determined by an independent, unbiased selection process. However, any systematic review may be susceptible to publication bias. The quality of the review is dependent on the quality of the included cohort studies. Several dimensions that relate to the quality of the included studies are unclear or inadequately reported (Table 2, online). This finding is not intended as a criticism of the original studies, but is more a reflection on the considerable challenges of undertaking cohort studies in primary care settings that rely on complete identification and follow-up of all eligible incident cases of rectal bleeding. For instance, in one included study, general practitioners were asked to include a maximum of three to four patients. This prior selection may lead to a preferential selection of more severe cases and subsequent spectrum bias, producing spurious clinical associations and overestimation of likelihood ratios.

The other feature of included studies was the application of a variety of different reference standards. In the detection of colorectal cancer, the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test is colonoscopy, followed by a flexible sigmoidoscopy in combination with a barium enaema. In the included studies, a variety of reference standard tests were used with a possibility of work-up bias in some studies as lower-risk patents were subject to less rigorous reference standard tests (Table 2). Other methodological problems include incomplete or inadequate blinding of outcome assessment and incomplete reporting on losses to follow-up (Table 2).

We found significant between-study heterogeneity for a range of symptoms and signs (Table 3). This might be due to whether or not rectal bleeding was the principal reason for consultation and also the duration of rectal bleeding. Three included studies report rectal bleeding as the primary complaint in 15%, 51% and 100% of patients, respectively, and in terms of duration two studies excluded patients with rectal bleeding longer than six and twelve months, respectively.

For age categories, we calculated sensitivities, specificities and likelihood ratios. However, primary studies use different age cut-off points, which complicate the generation of reference categories. In our review, there is a slight overlap in some of the age categories, which may have affected the precision of pooled estimates. In terms of dark red blood, the reference category includes both patients with bright red blood and a colour in between. For a history of rectal bleeding the reference category consists of patients having a first episode of rectal bleeding.

This editorial discusses the role of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in a diagnostic workup. Utility of FOBT in colorectal cancer screening is well documented in multiple clinical trials, although there continues to be a debate (and ongoing trials) on its merit relative to other screening tests. Over the years, FOBT has seen growth in its application for assessment of symptomatic gastrointestinal disease without clear guidelines on its use in this setting. The work of Lee et al. in this edition of the journal synthesizes evidence on diagnostic utility of FOBT and provides additional rationale to stop using FOBTs for symptoms evaluation or for diagnostic testing.

### The mortality of colorectal cancer in relation to the initial symptom at presentation to primary care and to the duration of symptoms: a cohort study using medical records [^8a5c965a]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical features studied

Ten clinical features had been identified as being independently associated with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer: rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, weight loss, abdominal tenderness, anaemia (haemoglobin below 13 g dL −1), abnormal rectal examination, a blood sugar level over 10 mm l −1, and a positive faecal occult blood testing. For this analysis, only the five symptoms and one investigation, anaemia, were included. For simplicity, these are called features from now on, with the index feature being the first one present. Three of the other four features: abdominal tenderness, a rectal mass, and a positive faecal occult blood test, would generally be expected to be identified only in patients who had described a symptom. It was therefore more appropriate to study the symptom itself. The final feature associated with colorectal cancer was a raised blood sugar. Clinically, this finding would be of little practical value in identifying symptomatic colorectal cancer, so it was not studied here. Furthermore, the six selected features mirror those used in previous studies, allowing comparisons to be made.

Preoperative assessment and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colon cancer — A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level should be obtained before elective surgery for colon cancer to establish a baseline value that is prognostic for recurrence and survival and to provide a reference value for use during surveillance; routine labs should include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a chemistry panel, and physical examination should include assessment for an abdominal mass or surgical scars. A multivariate analysis of more than 130,000 patients indicated that preoperative CEA is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I to III colon cancer, and patients with an elevated CEA had a 62% increase in the hazard of death compared with patients with a normal preoperative CEA, although the optimal cutoff value is not clear. In stage IV colorectal cancer, a decrease in CEA in response to treatment with chemotherapy has been associated with improved survival.

Comparison with existing literature

Recent studies have reported FIT to be an effective tool to triage for "high-risk" patients referred for definitive investigation. Our findings contribute to a growing literature suggesting that FIT also performs well in the "lower risk" primary care setting. This is the one of few studies to formally and systematically evaluate blood tests in addition to FIT in symptomatic patients, and one of few to analyse FIT supplemented with other variables. The f-Hb, age, and sex test score (FAST) was not superior to FIT alone in the primary care setting. COLONPREDICT included FIT, age, sex, rectal bleeding, benign anorectal lesions, rectal mass, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, blood haemoglobin, colonoscopy in the last 10 years, and treatment with aspirin. COLONPREDICT was derived and validated in a higher-risk referred population and at a threshold equivalent to approximately 90% sensitivity (f-Hb ≥ 20 μg Hb/g faeces and COLONPREDICT score ≥ 5.6) had a specificity of 78.7% compared to 69.6% in FIT alone.

A UK-based study of whether demographic, lifestyle (e.g. smoking, physical activity), or clinical factors (family history, symptoms) could add to the predictive value of FIT found that only family history of polyps showed a significant association once FIT was taken into account. In the current study, family history was not retained in stepwise models; however, the indicator was based on referral notes whereas in the aforementioned study, patients were prospectively asked about family history.

### Whole-colon investigation vs. flexible sigmoidoscopy for suspected colorectal cancer based on presenting symptoms and signs: a multicentre cohort study [^de9b7eb2]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

a NICE 2015 guideline symptoms/signs included CIBH, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, weight loss, anaemia and abdominal or rectal mass without any restriction by age; the broad definition of anaemia was used. Patients may have had multiple symptoms/signs

b Other symptoms include bloating/flatulence (n = 203), tiredness/weakness (n = 152), anal symptoms (n = 97), nausea/vomiting (n = 44), back pain (n = 13), and upper gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 10)

c In patients with blood count data, anaemia was defined by the WHO (broad) definition [haemoglobin (Hb) level < 13 g/dL in men or < 12 g/dL in women]. In patients without blood count data, anaemia was defined by whether the investigation of anaemia was indicated as a reason for referral

d Other signs include faecal occult blood test (FOBT) positivity (n = 113), family history (n = 117), history of polyps (n = 23), cancer antibodies (n = 3), elevated C-reactive protein (n = 4), and liver problems (n = 9)

We evaluated the combination of anaemia and/or abdominal mass in further detail, given the strong association with proximal cancer. Among the 2022 patients with anaemia and/or abdominal mass, proximal cancer yield was 4.8%, the NNE was 21 (95% CI 18–26), and 42.0% of the patients with cancer had proximal cancer. The sensitivity of anaemia and/or abdominal mass for proximal cancer was 76.4% (97/127) (Table 5).

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^38e2bd6a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Signs and red flag symptoms in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who are below the recommended screening age are often overlooked, leading to delayed diagnosis and worse prognosis. This study investigates how patient pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic site of their cancer and whether the association varies by age at CRC diagnosis.

Methods

We ascertained CRC patients' experienced symptoms and screening through medical abstractions from an ongoing population-based study of CRC patients identified through a SEER cancer registry (N = 626). We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between symptoms and CRC anatomic site. Additional analyses were stratified by age at diagnosis. Early-onset was defined as less than 50 years of age at CRC diagnosis.

Results

Participants who experienced blood in stool were more likely (odds ratio (95% confidence interval)) to have rectal (vs. colon) cancer (4.37 (3.02, 6.33)), as were patients who experienced changes to stool (1.78 (1.21, 2.60)). Patients diagnosed with colon cancer were more likely to present with abdominal pain (0.30 (0.19, 0.47)), anemia (0.40 (0.21, 0.75)), other symptoms (0.33 (0.19, 0.55)) and no symptoms (0.68 (0.44, 1.04)). When stratifying by age at diagnosis, we found that the association between blood in stool and rectal tumor location was particularly pronounced for patients with early-onset CRC (6.48 (2.73, 15.41)).

Conclusions

Common pre-diagnostic red flag symptoms are associated with CRC anatomic site. These findings can inform best practices for gastroenterologist triage of care and early evaluation of CRC and are of key importance given the rise of early-onset (pre-screening age) CRC.

### Development and external validation of a faecal immunochemical test-based prediction model for colorectal cancer detection in symptomatic patients [^c8923cc5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Risk prediction models for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection in symptomatic patients based on available biomarkers may improve CRC diagnosis. Our aim was to develop, compare with the NICE referral criteria and externally validate a CRC prediction model, COLONPREDICT, based on clinical and laboratory variables.

Methods

This prospective cross-sectional study included consecutive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms referred for colonoscopy between March 2012 and September 2013 in a derivation cohort and between March 2014 and March 2015 in a validation cohort. In the derivation cohort, we assessed symptoms and the NICE referral criteria, and determined levels of faecal haemoglobin and calprotectin, blood haemoglobin, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen before performing an anorectal examination and a colonoscopy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop the model with diagnostic accuracy with CRC detection as the main outcome.

Results

We included 1572 patients in the derivation cohort and 1481 in the validation cohorts, with a 13.6% and 9.1% CRC prevalence respectively. The final prediction model included 11 variables: age (years) (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.06), male gender (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.4), faecal haemoglobin ≥ 20 μg/g (OR 17.0, 95% CI 10.0–28.6), blood haemoglobin < 10 g/dL (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.2–10.3), blood haemoglobin 10–12 g/dL (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0), carcinoembryonic antigen ≥ 3 ng/mL (OR 4.5, 95% CI 3.0–6.8), acetylsalicylic acid treatment (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2–0.7), previous colonoscopy (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06–0.2), rectal mass (OR 14.8, 95% CI 5.3–41.0), benign anorectal lesion (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2–0.4), rectal bleeding (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.4) and change in bowel habit (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.5). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.91–0.94), higher than the NICE referral criteria (AUC 0.59, 95% CI 0.55–0.63; p < 0.001). On the basis of the thresholds with 90% (5.6) and 99% (3.5) sensitivity, we divided the derivation cohort into three risk groups for CRC detection: high (30.9% of the cohort, positive predictive value [PPV] 40.7%, 95% CI 36.7–45.9%), intermediate (29.5%, PPV 4.4%, 95% CI 2.8–6.8%) and low (39.5%, PPV 0.2%, 95% CI 0.0–1.1%). The discriminatory ability was equivalent in the validation cohort (AUC 0.92, 95% CI 0.90–0.94; p = 0.7).

Conclusions

COLONPREDICT is a highly accurate prediction model for CRC detection.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and other tumor markers in preoperative evaluation — key points are that routine laboratory bloodwork and a CEA level are part of the preoperative evaluation. The baseline CEA level before initiating elective treatment is prognostic of long-term survival and is used as a reference during posttherapy surveillance. Although CEA levels assessed at different time points during multimodality treatment can correlate with treatment response, CEA does not reliably predict pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of other tumor markers such as CA19-9 in the evaluation of patients with rectal cancer.

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^739d4ccd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this study, we observed statistically significant associations between CRC symptoms and CRC anatomic site. There was evidence that those who experienced blood in stool and changes to stool were more likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer, while those who experienced abdominal pain, anemia, and other symptoms were more likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer. The observed positive association between the experience of blood in stool and rectal cancer site were particularly pronounced for early-onset CRC.

Interpretation of findings

Rectal cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 (early-onset) are more likely to display symptoms for a length of time before they seek medical care perhaps due to a lack of risk awareness for their age or access to health services. Early onset rectal cancer patients are also more likely to present with a later disease stage. Furthermore, there is an average 6-month time to diagnosis from symptom presentation in early-onset CRC patients. Our study indicates that blood in stool is a more common pre-diagnostic symptom in patients who go on to a diagnosis of rectal vs. colon cancer. For early-onset CRC patients, the likelihood of being diagnosed with rectal cancer among those experiencing blood in stool increases. Because we know that patients with rectal cancer are more likely to display symptoms for a duration of time, this may differentially impact time to diagnosis in rectal cancer patients compared to colon cancer patients. The results also suggest that red flag symptoms may be predictive of early-onset rectal cancer. Specifically, blood in stool (a form of rectal bleeding) should be investigated further, as a common clinical scenario that is mistakenly attributed to hemorrhoids or other benign etiology and not generally evaluated further in a young patient.

### Pathways to the diagnosis of colorectal cancer: an observational study in three UK cities [^eb71e481]. Family Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer can present in a variety of ways, and with any of several symptoms. Different referral routes from primary to secondary care cater for these different presentations. The route that has received most investment in the UK National Health Service is the 2-week clinic, but the proportions of patients taking this and other routes to diagnosis are largely unknown.

Methods

We designed an observational audit in Exeter, Oxford and Sheffield, UK. Colorectal cancers diagnosed in 2002 from participating practices were identified and the presence and timing of seven important clinical features noted: diarrhoea, constipation, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, the finding of an abdominal or rectal mass on examination, anaemia and positive faecal occult blood tests. The referral pathways to secondary care were identified.

Results

Of the 151 patients studied, 112 (74%) were referred with at least one clinical feature of colorectal cancer to a specialist. Only 43 of these (28% of the total) were referred to a 2-week clinic; 39 patients (26% of the total) had an emergency admission, of whom 10 (7%) had their emergency admission after referral to a specialist for investigation but before a diagnosis had been established. The time intervals between the first consultation with a symptom of cancer and referral were mostly short.

Conclusion

Patients with colorectal cancer travel several different pathways to diagnosis. The pathway with the most resources-the 2-week clinic-is used by a minority of patients.

### Factors that influence the decision to do an adequate evaluation of a patient with a positive stool for occult blood [^525a6831]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The factors that influence the decision to do an adequate evaluation for a positive test for fecal occult blood in a middle-aged or elderly patient are largely unknown. Our study was undertaken to determine whether factors such as the number of positive Hemoccult II card windows, age, gender, family history of colon cancer, the patient's concern that he or she might have colon cancer, or history of rectal bleeding influence the evaluation performed.

Method

A mass screening program for colon cancer was performed using unrehydrated Hemoccult II cards in the Boston area.

Results

Among the 23,593 Hemoccult II cards returned to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, cards from 1,112 patients (4.7%) were found to be positive for one or more of the six possible card windows. Ninety percent, or 940 patients, over 40 yr of age had follow-up information available. As the number of positive windows increased from one to four, there was a significant trend (p < 0.001) for the adequacy of the evaluation to increase. Family history (p = 0.044) and a patient's worry that he or she might have colon cancer (p = 0.003) significantly improved a patient's chance for an adequate evaluation.

Conclusions

Hemoccult testing is not followed by an adequate evaluation in a significant proportion of patients. Our study points out for the first time that the number of positive Hemoccult windows significantly influences the decision-making.

### Clinical features of colorectal cancer before diagnosis: a population-based case-control study [^78708270]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhoea and constipation were both associated with cancer in the multivariable analyses. It is debatable whether the predictive values for diarrhoea of 0.63% in patients under 70, and 1.7% in those over 70, warrant investigation of this symptom on its own. However, the presence of any second variable increased the risk of colorectal cancer to a level when most doctors would consider investigation. Constipation is less of a risk, supporting the recommendations in the UK Referral Guidelines.

Abdominal pain is a difficult problem for the doctor in primary care; if anything our results compound this difficulty. It is a very common symptom, yet it is associated with colorectal cancer. Furthermore, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding are the two symptoms that retained their association with the cancer 180 days before diagnosis. Serious consideration should be given to the possibility of cancer with abdominal pain and no clear diagnosis. This would include asking about other symptoms, performing abdominal and rectal examinations, and testing of faecal occult blood and haemoglobin. Positive findings on any of these would suggest referral for investigation of possible colorectal cancer.

### Disparities in evaluation of patients with rectal bleeding 40 years and older [^1edb7b74]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Rectal bleeding is associated with colorectal cancer. We characterized the evaluation of patients aged 40 years and older with rectal bleeding and identified characteristics associated with inadequate evaluation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of records of outpatient visits that contained reports of rectal bleeding for patients aged 40 years and older (N = 480). We studied whether patient characteristics affected whether or not they received a colonoscopy examination within 90 days of presentation with rectal bleeding. Patient characteristics included demographics; family history of colon cancer and polyps; and histories of screening colonoscopies, physical examinations, referrals to specialists at the index visit, and communication of laboratory results. Data were collected from medical records, and patient income levels were estimated based on Zip codes.

Results

Nearly half of the patients presenting with rectal bleeding received colonoscopies (48.1%); 81.7% received the procedure within 90 days. A history of a colonoscopy examination was more likely to be reported in white patients compared with Hispanic or Asian patients (P = 0.012 and P = 0.006, respectively), and in high-income compared with low-income patients (P = 0.022). A family history was more likely to be documented among patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid or Medicare (P = 0.004). A rectal examination was performed more often for patients who were white or Asian, male, and with high or middle incomes, compared with those who were black, Hispanic, female, or with low incomes (P = 0.027). White patients were more likely to have their laboratory results communicated to them than black patients (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Sex, race, ethnicity, patient income, and insurance status were associated with disparities in evaluation of rectal bleeding. There is a need to standardize the evaluation of patients with rectal bleeding.

### Using the faecal immunochemical test in patients with rectal bleeding: evidence from the NICE FIT study [^a60d9332]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

The aim of this work was to investigate whether the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) could safely rule out colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with rectal bleeding (RB).

Method

This was a multicentre, double-blinded diagnostic accuracy study in 50 National Health Service hospitals. Patients referred from primary care with suspected CRC on an urgent 2-week-wait pathway were asked to perform a FIT prior to colonoscopy. The primary outcome measure was the sensitivity of the FIT for CRC in patients with RB versus nonrectal bleeding symptoms (NRB). The secondary outcome measures included the diagnostic accuracy of the FIT for CRC and other serious bowel disease.

Results

Of 9822 patients included in the study, 3143 (32.0%) were referred with RB. CRC was present in 4.7% of patients with RB versus 2.7% of patients with NRB (p < 0.05). Faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) was detectable (> 2 µg/g) in 44.1% of patients with RB and 33.9% with NRB (p < 0.05). In RB patients, CRC was present in 10.4% when f-Hb was > 2 µg/g compared with 0.1% when f-Hb was not detected. Flexible sigmoidoscopy in this group would further reduce the risk of CRC to 0.03%. The sensitivity of the FIT for CRC in RB versus NRB groups was 98.6% (95% CI 95.2%-99.8%) vs 95.6% (91.5%-98.1%) for f-Hb > 2 µg/g and 96.6% (92.2%-98.9%) vs 86.3 (80.4%-90.9%) for f-Hb > 10 µg/g.

Conclusion

Faecal haemoglobin is not always detectable in patients with RB; 56% of patients had undetectable f-Hb (< 2 µg/g) and CRC was present in 0.1%. The high sensitivity of the FIT can be used to rule out CRC in patients with RB and triage them more appropriately for investigation.

### The diagnosis of colorectal cancer in patients with symptoms: finding a needle in a haystack [^b9fd2cd2]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Commentary

Patients often see primary care physicians for symptoms that might signal colorectal cancer, raising difficult questions. Which patients should be evaluated? How aggressively should they be worked up? If another cause for the symptom is found, such as hemorrhoids for rectal bleeding, should that set the matter to rest or should a cancer diagnosis still be pursued?

Table 1 lists 15 symptoms of colorectal cancer that have been suggested in textbooks and supported by research evidence. Unfortunately, many of these same symptoms, especially constipation and fatigue, are common in patients who do not have colorectal cancer. True, some clinical presentations, such as bowel obstruction or severe abdominal or rectal pain, are sufficiently unusual and dramatic events that they would prompt quick evaluation in any case. However, most symptoms of colorectal cancer are not so compelling. As a result, first-contact physicians are in the familiar position of looking for a needle in a haystack.

Table 1
Presenting symptoms and signs for 194 patients with colorectal cancer

Adapted from Majumdar et al.

*Anemia = a hemoglobin of < 13.4 g/dl in men or < 12.3 g/dl in women.

The stakes are high on either side of the decision. If the diagnosis is missed the patient will undergo unnecessary testing, prolonged uncertainty, and continuing symptoms until the diagnosis is finally made. The clinician will suffer chagrin and in some settings he or she might also worry about malpractice claims. On the other hand, proper evaluation, which involves complete visualization of the large bowel by colonoscopy, is a big undertaking, with the inconvenience of a day off work, the discomfort of bowel cleansing if not the procedure itself, financial costs to the patients or society, and a small risk of perforation, bleeding, or other complications.

### Diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to primary care with rectal bleeding [^90b27aa5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Rectal bleeding is a common, frequently benign problem that can also be an early sign of colorectal cancer. Diagnostic evaluation for rectal bleeding is complex, and clinical practice may deviate from available guidelines.

Objective

To assess the degree to which primary care physicians document risk factors for colorectal cancer among patients with rectal bleeding and order colonoscopies when indicated, and the likelihood of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations.

Design

Cross-sectional study using explicit chart abstraction methods.

Participants

Three hundred adults, 40–80 years of age, presenting with rectal bleeding to 15 academically affiliated primary care practices between 2012 and 2016.

Main Measures

1) The frequency at which colorectal cancer risk factors were documented in patients' charts, 2) the frequency at which physicians ordered colonoscopies and patients received them, and 3) the odds of ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on patient demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations.

Key Results

Risk factors for colorectal cancer were documented between 9% and 66% of the time. Most patients (89%) with rectal bleeding needed a colonoscopy according to a clinical guideline. Physicians placed colonoscopy orders for 74% of these patients, and 56% completed the colonoscopy within a year (36% within 60 days). The odds of physicians ordering recommended colonoscopies were significantly higher in patients aged 50–64 years of age than in those aged 40–50 years (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.80), and for patients whose most recent colonoscopy was 5 or more years ago (OR = 4.04, 95% CI: 1.50, 10.83). The odds of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies were significantly lower for each primary care visit unrelated to rectal bleeding (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.96).

Conclusions

Diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to primary care with rectal bleeding may be suboptimal because of inadequate risk factor assessment and prioritization of patients' other concurrent medical problems.

Results

Descriptive

A total of 16,604 of 18,656 available FITs (89%) were included in the study. Included patients were representative of the overall sample (Table 1). Study subjects had a median age of 61 and were 58% female. One-hundred thirty-nine (139) cancers were diagnosed within 6 months of the FIT test (0.8%). Patients who were diagnosed with cancer were older (median age 72) and more likely to be male (60%), to have a FIT ≥ 10 μg Hb/g faeces, and/or to have abnormal blood tests (Table 1, Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S1).

### An audit of the utility of in-patient fecal occult blood testing [^1c17bfc6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent surveys of physician practice have suggested the existence of excessive, inappropriate use of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT). We studied the implementation of this test in hospitalized patients.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of 1000 randomly selected patients who had been discharged from the Medicine service at four teaching hospitals. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, presence or absence of overt GI bleeding, and use of medications that might affect the FOBT were recorded. Reviewers assessed whether patients who had FOBT would have been candidates for colon resection if asymptomatic colon cancer had been found.

Results

Digital rectal examination was documented in 44.8% of patients; the findings were recorded in only 9%. A total of 421 patients had FOBT on admission, usually on stool obtained at digital rectal examination. Of the patients with a positive FOBT, 17% had active GI bleeding. Only 41.1% of patients with a positive FOBT were referred to the gastroenterology service. In 70.5% of patients, FOBT could be considered inappropriate because of factors such as age, active GI bleeding, or use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Conclusions

The FOBT, which is validated only for colorectal cancer screening, is often performed inappropriately in patients admitted to the hospital. This test should be restricted in hospital practice. It would be preferable to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for colorectal cancer screening at the time of hospital discharge and to advise them about the appropriate performance of the FOBT at home.

### Colon cancer in cystic fibrosis patients: is this a growing problem? [^336d1343]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2008). Low credibility.

In the last decade, we have found an increased incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies among Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. We discuss the case of a 30-year-old woman of mixed descent, with CF, who was referred to the emergency department for persistent abdominal pain and constipation, complicated by blood-streaked stools. On physical examination, her abdomen was soft, nontender, and without organomegaly or palpable masses. Rectal examination was unrevealing. The patient's initial laboratory evaluation revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.7g/dl. A CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. A colonoscopy performed one day after admission showed an intraluminal mass in the proximal Sigmoid Colon, from which biopsies were taken. Pathology reports subsequently revealed invasive Adenocarcinoma of the Colon. The patient underwent tumor resection followed by initiation of chemotherapy. The pathophysiology underlying the increased risk of GI cancers in CF patients is unknown. Possible explanations include genetic mutations or persistent pathologic alterations in digestive tract structures. It is our hope that this case will bring to light the need to further delineate cancer risk among CF patients and to develop screening recommendations tailored to this population.

### Faecal immunochemical tests for patients with symptoms suggestive of colorectal cancer: an updated systematic review and multiple-threshold meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies [^40838033]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our analysis was conducted to high standards, including comprehensive searches across databases complemented with nominations from companies, NICE specialist committee members and clinical experts. The analysis used an advanced statistical model to synthesize available data across thresholds. This has several advantages over performing separate bivariate meta‐analyses at selected thresholds, including making use of all the available data, increasing precision, ensuring consistency of pooled results and producing summary estimates at all thresholds of interest. We excluded test accuracy studies with a case–control design, which are thought to be at high risk of overestimation of accuracy. We did not restrict ourselves to studies that recruited according to low‐ or medium/high‐risk criteria, or to studies that had used an imaging reference standard for all patients. We investigated the impact of these factors on results, and while these analyses indicated no detectible effect, we caution that in the presence of multiple sources of heterogeneity it is difficult to isolate the effects of these factors. We believe the question of the impact of population remains only partially investigated, and further caution that the generalizability of the study results to populations outside of the scope, especially very low‐risk patients and patients less than 50 years of age, should not be assumed.

### Combining faecal immunochemical testing with blood test results for colorectal cancer risk stratification: a consecutive cohort of 16, 604 patients presenting to primary care [^0a784b6f]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Statement of principal findings

In this large cohort of patients tested with FIT in primary care, neither age, nor blood test results remained strong enough predictors of colorectal cancer to improve on the performance of FIT. While the number of false positives could be reduced by taking into account blood tests, the large associated increase in false negatives outweighed the benefit. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that using clinical indication as a rule-out or rule-in factor would improve the efficiency of FIT triage. The lack of an apparent age-effect after taking into account FIT suggests that age-specific thresholds for FIT positivity would not improve test performance.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^dc1ae844]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Colon cancer presentation and preoperative evaluation — testing and optimization recommendations and symptom-detected incidence are noted as follows: Germline testing "should be strongly considered for all young-onset colon cancer patients," and "all newly diagnosed colon cancers should be evaluated for microsatellite instability (MSI) or mismatch repair protein (MMR) expression." Regarding presentation, "more than 75% of colon cancer diagnoses occurred after development of symptoms," and a German population-based study reported "nearly 70% of newly diagnosed cancers presenting with symptoms." For perioperative care, "Patients' medical fitness and nutritional status should be assessed to guide perioperative management and identify opportunities for optimization before surgery." Risk counseling is advised because "Inquiry about alcohol consumption and smoking is also advised, as these habits have been shown to both increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer and also the risk of postoperative complications," and "Early mortality is infrequent among resected colon cancer patients but is more prevalent among patients with advanced age."

### Inappropriate ordering of multitarget stool DNA tests for colon cancer screening [^6d386fd3]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

CRC screening is recommended for adults aged 45–75. Mt-sDNA is indicated for asymptomatic individuals between the ages of 45 and 85, but not for those with rectal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, adenomatous polyps, previous colonoscopy within 10 years, family history of CRC, positive results from CRC screening tests within the past 6 months, or age less than 45 and greater than 85. We aimed to determine the prevalence of mt-sDNA use when not indicated and factors associated with inappropriate testing.

Methods

7,345 patients underwent mt-sDNA testing and were randomized using EMERSE. Charts for the first 500 patients were reviewed to determine whether mt-sDNA was ordered appropriately according to the USPSTF criteria. Seven patients were excluded due to having more than one inappropriate ordering for mt-sDNA.

Results

Of 500 patients, 22.2% had an inappropriately ordered mt-sDNA test. The most common reason for inappropriate ordering was having a previous colonoscopy done within the past 10 years. Rates of inappropriate testing significantly varied by race and the specialty of the ordering provider, with internal medicine providers ordering the most mt-sDNA tests. Rates of inappropriate testing did not significantly vary by sex or type of insurance.

Discussion

Our study suggests that providers may not be familiar with guidelines for the indicated use of mtsDNA, leading to inappropriate referrals and increased costs. Patients at increased CRC risk would benefit from a more sensitive procedure such as a colonoscopy. Future studies could understand the motivation to order testing outside approved indications through provider surveys and interviews.

### Differential outcomes in colorectal cancer detection: a comparative study of Swedish nationwide screening and fast-track diagnostic pathways [^97470b5e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In Sweden, the nationwide CRC screening program was gradually implemented from 2019 to 2022, with a specific launch in Region Örebro County (RÖC) in August 2021. This program biennially invites individuals aged 60 to 74 to participate in CRC screening, utilizing FIT as the primary screening method.

The CRC screening process initiates with the distribution of testing kits through post to eligible individuals, accompanied by detailed instructions on how to use the test. Participants are required to collect a single stool sample and mail it back to the designated laboratory. If the test result is positive, the participant is referred for a colonoscopy. Conversely, if the test result is negative, they will remain in the screening program and receive a new FIT kit after 2 years. Should the time taken for the stool sample to reach the laboratory exceed 7 days, or if the date of the stool sample collection is unrecorded and the test result is negative, the participant will be asked to retake the test. During the colonoscopy, any detected adenomas are removed. If colorectal cancer is identified, the patient is referred to a colorectal surgeon for further treatment. All data from this nationwide CRC screening are systematically compiled in a national database, SveReKKs.

Implemented in 2016, the Swedish SCC-CRC aims to to shorten the time from symptoms of possible CRC to diagnosis and treatment initiation. The entry criteria for SCC-CRC colonoscopies, revised in 2019 and again in 2022, are designed to streamline access for health care professionals across both primary care centers and hospitals. These criteria include an abnormal rectal examination conducted via proctoscopy/rectoscopy or manual rectal palpation, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, visible blood in the stool without a clear source, persistent blood in the stool for more than 4 weeks despite treatment of a likely cause (typically hemorrhoids), altered bowel habits persisting for more than 4 weeks in patients over 40 years old in conjunction with a positive FIT test, and concerning radiologic findings. Following an SCC-CRC referral, a colonoscopy is mandated to be performed within 10 days. The rationale for comparing these 2 pathways lies in their differing methodologies and target populations. The nationwide screening program is aimed at early detection of CRC in asymptomatic individuals, primarily using FIT to identify candidates for colonoscopy. In contrast, the SCC-CRC pathway focuses on symptomatic individuals, utilizing a combination of clinical indicators such as anemia and abnormal rectal examination results to prioritize diagnostic colonoscopies. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach can help in refining screening strategies and improving patient outcomes.
