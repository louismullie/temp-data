## Question

Is ciprofloxacin effective against Gardnerella vaginalis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ciprofloxacin is effective against Gardnerella vaginalis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about current guideline-recommended therapies for BV and whether ciprofloxacin appears there. Then, I should verify any direct in vitro or clinical evidence of ciprofloxacin activity against Gardnerella. Next, I will examine related fluoroquinolone data, especially ofloxacin, to avoid over-extrapolation. After that, I need to consider mechanistic fit, including anaerobic coverage and biofilm issues. Finally, I should synthesize a recommendation grounded in antimicrobial stewardship and safety considerations [^116ecoQF].

> Let me first confirm the guideline landscape. CDC 2021, WHO 2024, and IUSTI/WHO 2018 consistently recommend nitroimidazoles (metronidazole, tinidazole, secnidazole) or clindamycin, given orally or intravaginally, as first-line or alternative BV treatments, and none of these guidelines list ciprofloxacin for BV management, which is an important initial signal against its use [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^116LmS3w] [^114n4Gn7]. I should confirm label-level support as well; the FDA labeling for metronidazole (oral and vaginal) specifically indicates BV, aligning with these recommendations and again not mentioning ciprofloxacin for BV [^116jSkoA] [^114gb27d].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is any direct evidence that ciprofloxacin inhibits Gardnerella. I will now examine susceptibility data within the provided materials. In vitro reports cited here identify penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin as active against Gardnerella isolates, with no assertion of ciprofloxacin efficacy and, notably, without listing ciprofloxacin among effective agents, which weakens the case for its use against Gardnerella [^113kn47Z] [^114QD1bf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, but in a treatment space so well covered by guidelines, lack of ciprofloxacin in both guidelines and susceptibility summaries is telling [^116ecoQF].

> I need to check whether fluoroquinolone class data might tempt extrapolation. The FDA labeling for ofloxacin notes activity against Gardnerella vaginalis, but it also emphasizes that many anaerobes are resistant and that ofloxacin is not positioned as BV therapy; extrapolating ofloxacin's in vitro list to ciprofloxacin would be inappropriate given spectrum and clinical positioning differences, so I should not infer class equivalence for BV from that single label point [^111sNMEN] [^1145yHY6]. But wait, what if ciprofloxacin's use in other urogenital infections implies relevance here? The presence of ciprofloxacin in guidelines for prostatitis or susceptible gonorrhea reflects pathogen- and site-specific roles, not BV, and does not support its use for Gardnerella-driven dysbiosis [^1156L46R] [^113NTprY].

> Let me consider mechanistic fit. BV is a polymicrobial, anaerobe-rich dysbiosis where agents with reliable anaerobic activity are preferred; fluoroquinolones generally have limited activity against strict anaerobes, and although Gardnerella can be facultative rather than strictly anaerobic, the BV consortium includes anaerobes that fluoroquinolones cover poorly, making ciprofloxacin a mechanistically weak choice for BV overall [^116jSkoA]. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially almost framed Gardnerella as a strict anaerobe; that would have been imprecise, as it is better characterized as facultative/anaerobe-associated, but the broader BV anaerobic milieu still argues for nitroimidazoles or clindamycin over ciprofloxacin based on spectrum [^114SCnVf].

> Next, I should review biofilm and recurrence considerations. Gardnerella-centric biofilms persist after standard therapy and are implicated in recurrence; even with metronidazole or clindamycin, biofilm disruption is limited, and recurrence rates remain high, yet these are still the best-supported options, whereas there is no evidence that ciprofloxacin improves biofilm-related outcomes in BV [^115xzm9X] [^1125B53B] [^116Ac4vJ]. Hold on, I should verify whether adjunctive strategies like DNase have any bearing here; experimental data suggest DNase can potentiate metronidazole and disrupt Gardnerella biofilms, but this supports optimizing established regimens rather than substituting ciprofloxacin [^11315XsG].

> I need to ensure stewardship and safety are weighed. Using a non-recommended fluoroquinolone risks treatment failure and fosters class-wide resistance; best practice is to reserve fluoroquinolones for indications with clear benefit and susceptibility support, which BV lacks for ciprofloxacin [^1115Cssm]. I should double-check pediatric and broader safety cautions as a reminder that indiscriminate fluoroquinolone use is discouraged, reinforcing the need to adhere to guideline-backed BV agents [^114Qh5w5].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. Ciprofloxacin is not recommended for BV and lacks supportive evidence against Gardnerella in this context; guideline-endorsed regimens are nitroimidazoles or clindamycin, with alternatives like tinidazole or secnidazole as appropriate. Even though ofloxacin's label lists Gardnerella, this does not translate to a role for ciprofloxacin in BV, and the overall anaerobic and biofilm biology of BV further argues against ciprofloxacin use here [^116ecoQF] [^114kX2MY] [^116LmS3w] [^111sNMEN]. I should confirm that the safest, most evidence-based approach is to follow CDC/WHO/IUSTI guidance and avoid ciprofloxacin for BV unless a compelling, culture-directed reason emerges, which would be atypical for this syndrome [^116ecoQF] [^114n4Gn7].

No, ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is **not recommended** for treating Gardnerella vaginalis or bacterial vaginosis (BV) because it lacks reliable anaerobic activity [^114SCnVf] and is not included in CDC [^116ecoQF] or WHO [^114kX2MY] guidelines. The **first-line treatments** are metronidazole or clindamycin [^116LmS3w], which target the anaerobes central to BV [^116jSkoA]. Ciprofloxacin should be considered only when standard therapies are contraindicated or unavailable, and even then it is **unlikely to be effective** against Gardnerella vaginalis.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **CDC and WHO guidelines** provide clear recommendations for treating bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition commonly associated with Gardnerella vaginalis [^116ecoQF] [^1126umut]. The following **first-line treatments** are recommended:

- **Metronidazole**: 500 mg orally twice daily [^114kX2MY] for 7 days [^116ecoQF].
- **Metronidazole gel**: 0.75% [^116ecoQF] intravaginally once daily for 5 days [^114gb27d].
- **Clindamycin cream**: 2% [^116ecoQF] intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days [^116LmS3w].

These agents are recommended because they **effectively target anaerobic bacteria** [^116jSkoA], including Gardnerella vaginalis, which are central to BV pathogenesis [^115sSA9Z].

---

## Ciprofloxacin's activity against Gardnerella vaginalis

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone primarily effective against aerobic gram-negative bacteria [^114SCnVf]. It inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA replication and cell division; however, its activity against anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, is **limited and inconsistent**. Gardnerella vaginalis is a facultative anaerobe whose role in BV is tied to anaerobic conditions, biofilm formation [^115xzm9X], and interactions with other anaerobes [^1125B53B], making ciprofloxacin an **unsuitable choice** for infections driven by anaerobic bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis.

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

There is a **lack of clinical evidence** supporting ciprofloxacin for treating Gardnerella vaginalis infections or bacterial vaginosis [^115sSA9Z]. In contrast, trials have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of metronidazole and clindamycin in BV [^115sSA9Z]. For example, an oral metronidazole study [^114RJEXq] showed significant reductions in Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes associated with BV. There is **no comparable evidence** supporting ciprofloxacin's effectiveness against Gardnerella vaginalis.

---

## Resistance patterns and recurrence rates

Resistance patterns and recurrence are key considerations in antibiotic selection. Gardnerella vaginalis can **form biofilms** [^115xzm9X] that contribute to antibiotic resistance and recurrent infection [^113XcAMa]; metronidazole and clindamycin reduce Gardnerella vaginalis concentrations [^114RJEXq] and disrupt biofilms, although recurrence remains a challenge [^116Ac4vJ]. In contrast, ciprofloxacin has **not been shown** to effectively disrupt Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms or prevent BV recurrence, and its limited anaerobic activity and lack of clinical evidence make it an inappropriate choice for managing Gardnerella vaginalis infections.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Ciprofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is associated with **potential risks and side effects**, including:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
- **Central nervous system effects**: Headache, dizziness, and insomnia.
- **Tendinitis and tendon rupture**: Particularly in older adults [^114Qh5w5].
- **QT interval prolongation**: Potential cardiac risk [^114SCnVf].

Given these risks and the lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness against Gardnerella vaginalis, ciprofloxacin **should not be used as a first-line treatment** for BV [^116ecoQF].

---

## Alternative treatments

If standard treatments such as metronidazole or clindamycin are contraindicated or ineffective, **guidelines recommend the following alternatives**:

- **Tinidazole** [^1143haob], which may be given as 2 g orally once daily for 2 days or 1 g orally once daily for 5 days [^114fsSas]
- **Secnidazole** [^115AobP5] 2 g orally as a single dose [^114fsSas]. These regimens have demonstrated effectiveness against anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis [^115sSA9Z] [^114n4Gn7].

---

## Conclusion

Ciprofloxacin is **not recommended** for treating Gardnerella vaginalis infections or bacterial vaginosis because of its limited activity against anaerobic bacteria [^114SCnVf] and the lack of supporting clinical evidence. Guidelines recommend metronidazole or clindamycin as first-line treatments [^116LmS3w], with tinidazole or secnidazole as alternatives when needed [^114n4Gn7]. Ciprofloxacin should be considered only when standard therapies are contraindicated or unavailable, and even then it is unlikely to be effective against Gardnerella vaginalis.

### Antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis [^1114xE4P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection with a prevalence between 10% to 50% worldwide. BV results in an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora. Microorganisms associated with BV have been isolated from the normal flora of the male genital tract, and their presence could be related to the recurrence of BV after antibiotic treatment. Therefore, treating sexual partners could decrease the recurrence of infection and possibly the burden of the disease.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness in women and the safety in men of antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register (23 July 2016), CENTRAL (1991 to 23 July 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to 23 July 2016), Embase (1974 to 23 July 2016), LILACS (1982 to 23 July 2016), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (23 July 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 July 2016), and the Web of Science™ (2001 to 23 July 2016). Additionally, we hand-searched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors, and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of any antibiotic treatment with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention by the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^111fRvnc]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Bacterial strains and culture conditions - _Lactobacillus iners_ ATCC 55195 and _Gardnerella vaginalis_ ATCC 14018 (group C) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained on Human Bilayer Tween Agar (BD) plates and New York City III (NYCIII) medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. Agar plates and liquid cultures were incubated at 37 °C with an anaerobic gas mixture of 80% N₂, 10% CO₂, and 10% H₂. Frozen stocks of strains were stored at −80 °C in 40% (v/v) glycerol.

- **Metronidazole quantification by tandem mass spectrometry**: MNZ concentrations were determined by validated LC-MS/MS assays. Sample aliquots were centrifuged at 3000 × g and divided between supernatant and cell pellet. Extracellular MNZ was extracted from the supernatant via protein precipitation using acetonitrile. For intracellular concentration measurements, cell pellets were lysed using sonication and re-suspended in 100 μL of sterile water. Samples were subjected to positive electrospray ionization (ESI) and detected via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a LC-MS/MS system (Agilent Technologies 6460 QQQ/MassHunter). Calibration standards were prepared with an inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy of ≤ 5% with an r² value of 0.9988 ± 0.0009. Quantification was performed using MRM of the transitions of m/z 172.2 → 128.2 and 176.2 → 128.2 for MNZ and MNZ-d4, respectively. Each transition was monitored with a 100-ms dwell time. Stock solutions of MNZ and MNZ-d4 were prepared at 1 mg/mL in acetonitrile-water and stored at −20 °C. Mobile phase A is 0.1% acetic acid.

### Time course of the regression of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy with and without treatment [^115PWbLC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of treatment over time for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and the probability of spontaneous resolution with placebo.

- **Study design**: Women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on Gram stain were randomly assigned at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation to receive two 2-g doses of metronidazole or placebo 48 hours apart. Participants were re-evaluated for changes in Gram stain score on one occasion at ≥ 2 weeks later.

- **Results**: Of 658 women who underwent metronidazole therapy, treatment was successful (score, or ≥ 10 weeks after treatment). In 683 women who underwent placebo therapy, spontaneous resolution increased significantly from 13% at 2 to 3.9 weeks of gestation to 36% at ≥ 10 weeks of gestation. Spontaneous resolution was more common with lower vaginal pH or the presence of lactobacilli on Gram stain at the time of random assignment.

- **Conclusion**: The effectiveness of metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis persists for ≥ 10 weeks. Women who underwent placebo therapy had significant remission of bacterial vaginosis over ≥ 10 weeks. Remission was more common when the initial vaginal microbiologic disturbances were less severe.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure approximately 70–85% of women with BV within one month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and/or BV on microscopy within six months. The low rate of sustained cure not only highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence but also compounds women's distress and frustration and leads to repeated presentation to health services or adoption of unproven home-remedies.

Factors including persistence of a BV-associated biofilm, failure to recolonize the vagina with lactobacilli, reinfection from an untreated partner, and host genetic and/or immune factors may all play a role in recurrence. Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be separated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical. Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence.

While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity. These data suggest that reinfection of women with patho…

### Gardnerella species and their association with bacterial vaginosis [^1119dzKJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition marked by high vaginal bacterial diversity. Gardnerella vaginalis has been implicated in BV but is also detected in healthy women. The Gardnerella genus has been expanded to encompass six validly named species and several genomospecies. We hypothesized that particular Gardnerella species may be more associated with BV.

- **Methods**: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed targeting the cpn60 gene of species groups including G. vaginalis, G. piotii/pickettii, G. swidsinskii/greenwoodii, and G. leopoldii. These assays were applied to vaginal swabs from individuals with (n = 101) and without BV (n = 150) attending a sexual health clinic in Seattle, Washington. Weekly swabs were collected from 42 participants for up to 12 weeks.

- **Results**: Concentrations and prevalence of each Gardnerella species group were significantly higher in participants with BV; 91.1% of BV-positive participants had three or more Gardnerella species groups detected compared to 32.0% of BV-negative participants (P < .0001). BV-negative participants with three or more species groups detected were more likely to develop BV within 100 days versus those with fewer (60.5% vs. 3.7%, P < .0001).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that BV reflects a state of high Gardnerella species diversity. No Gardnerella species group was a specific marker for BV.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1125B53B]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we identified specific vaginal taxa that were associated with BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Specifically, we found that a higher abundance of Prevotella spp immediately prior to treatment and of Gardnerella spp immediately following treatment were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence. Additionally, women who experienced recurrence had increased levels of BV-associated bacteria (primarily representing Gardnerella) relative to Lactobacillus spp (primarily representing L. iners) present in their vaginal microbiota immediately post-treatment compared to women who did not experience recurrence. Neither bacterial diversity nor the degree of compositional change following treatment were associated with BV recurrence. These data provide insight into key taxa that may play a role in treatment failure following recommended BV therapy.

Prevotella and Gardnerella are commonly recovered from the vaginal microbiome of women with BV, and species from both genera possess characteristics that are important for BV initiation and persistence. **In vitro**: Prevotella bivia has been shown to produce ammonia and amino acids which enhance the growth of other BV-associated bacteria including Gardnerella spp and Peptostreptococcus spp. Gardnerella, in turn, produces amino acids, which stimulate the growth of P. bivia. In addition, both Gardnerella spp and Prevotella spp produce sialidases, and there is evidence that Prevotella may be a dominant source of vaginal sialidase.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^115dnEGU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The selection of publications was guided by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles were peer-reviewed primary research publications of any study design that examined the efficacy and safety of therapeutic compounds in the treatment or prevention of BV biofilms. Publications were included only if they were available in Chinese, English, German, Russian, and Ukrainian, which we could review without requiring translation.

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Excluded were articles of nonprimary research, conference abstracts, ongoing clinical trials with no available results, and case studies or series, as well as studies of treatment cost, acceptability, or attitudes. Articles that did not report extractable data pertaining to the aim of this review were also excluded.

Primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full text was performed by two reviewers using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation). Disagreements were discussed and finalized. See PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1) for our selection process.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted into Microsoft Excel. Four groups of variables were extracted: publication description (journal, year of publication, country), study aim (prevention or eradication, population, age range, biofilm species), and research method (study design, sample size, therapeutic agent, comparison).

### Gardnerella species and their association with bacterial vaginosis [^1126umut]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women worldwide. It is characterized by high bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria, and a decreased abundance of lactobacilli in the vagina. BV has been linked to a wide range of negative health outcomes, such as an increased risk of preterm birth, acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The etiology of BV remains incompletely understood, and the heterogeneous, polymicrobial nature of this condition has made efforts to study it challenging. Hypothetical models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of BV.

Gardnerella has been implicated in the development of BV since the 1950s and was the first bacterium linked to nonspecific vaginitis, now known as BV. Previous studies have shown an increased abundance of vaginal Gardnerella in women with BV. Gardnerella has been associated with adherent biofilms in BV, and there is evidence suggesting that Gardnerella can be sexually transmitted. It may serve as a keystone species in the development of BV. However, Gardnerella has also been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in more than 50% of women without BV, calling its role in BV etiology into question. Formerly classified as Gardnerella vaginalis, the Gardnerella genus consists of at least 13 unique genomospecies, six of which have been validly named: Gardnerella vaginalis, Gardnerella piotii, Gardnerella swidsinskii, Gardnerella leopoldii, Gardnerella pickettii, and Gardnerella greenwoodii. Vaginal colonization by these species…

### Gardnerella species and their association with bacterial vaginosis [^116HXwR4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Many questions remain regarding diversity within the Gardnerella genus and its contributions to vaginal health. Additional studies exploring the Gardnerella pangenome, as well as in vitro characterization of different Gardnerella species and isolates, will be necessary to determine the genotypic and phenotypic variation within the genus. Given the increased Gardnerella diversity seen in BV, the development and utilization of molecular techniques to differentiate Gardnerella species will be vital in understanding the roles these species play in BV etiology. Unraveling the dynamics of competition and cooperation between different Gardnerella species, BV-associated anaerobes, and lactobacilli may lead to interventions that promote vaginal health.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^1165g122]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **What we can learn from past male-partner treatment trials**: More than 60 years ago, researchers and clinicians held the view that the syndrome of BV was sexually transmitted, or at least, associated with sex. The findings from the six male-partner treatment trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s have been extensively reviewed, but we briefly summarize the findings with the aim of understanding the outcomes.

One of the challenges when assessing the effectiveness of partner treatment is that the trials utilized very different combinations of antibiotic treatments for differing durations, and there was no published data to inform what treatments may be optimal for men. These trials had major trial-related limitations including small sample sizes, absence of power calculations, inconsistent and non-standard methods to diagnose BV in women, use of single-dose and non-standard treatments for women (which we now know are suboptimal), lack of data on treatment adherence, and high attrition.

Another key difference between the trials was that the clinical endpoints were measured anywhere from 7 to 10 days to 12 weeks post-randomization. The timing of the endpoint may be critical in determining if an intervention is efficacious. Among couples counseled to abstain from sex, BV endpoints measured immediately post-treatment are more likely to reflect the efficacy of female-only treatment rather than the effect of treating the male on BV. In contrast, endpoints measured following a longer period of time post-treatment may be undermined by the introduction of unexamined variables.

### Treatment of male sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112CQfWe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine if the treatment of male sexual partners of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) using oral metronidazole twice daily for 7 days (i.e. multidose metronidazole) significantly decreased BV recurrence rates in the female partners.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Women with recurrent BV, diagnosed by Amsel and Nugent criteria, were enrolled. Multidose metronidazole for 7 days was dispensed to women. Male partners were randomized to receive either placebo or multidose metronidazole for 7 days and were asked to refrain from unprotected sex for 14 days. Female follow-up visits were conducted on day 21 and at 8 and 16 weeks. Male follow-up visits occurred on days 14–21. BV cure was defined as having 0–2 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 0–6 in the female partner, with the primary endpoint at 16 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 214 couples were enrolled. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference between treatment arms for the primary outcome. BV treatment failure occurred in 81% and 80% of women in the metronidazole and placebo arms through the third follow-up visit, respectively (P > .999). However, women whose male partners adhered to the study medication were less likely to experience treatment failure (adjusted relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.99; p = 0.035). This finding persisted in post hoc comparisons in the metronidazole arm.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, this study did not find that male partner treatment with multidose metronidazole significantly reduces BV recurrence in female partners, although women whose partners adhered to multidose metronidazole were less likely to fail treatment.

### Mechanisms and therapeutic effectiveness of lactobacilli [^113PwbXk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Vaginal microbiota is dominated by lactobacilli. When the balance among bacterial species within this environment is altered, antibacterial defense mechanisms lose their efficacy, leading to pathogenic bacteria proliferation. For instance, a reduction in the number of vaginal lactobacilli and their antimicrobial properties, such as lysostaphin expression (which cleaves the cell wall of S. aureus, thus inhibiting its growth) and H₂O₂ production, can cause bacterial vaginosis, the most common symptomatic microbial imbalance. In patients affected by bacterial vaginosis, lactobacilli are replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida (C.) albicans, S. aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or other anaerobic bacteria.

Uncontrolled growth of anaerobic bacteria such as C. albicans and subsequent vaginal colonisation may lead to vulvovaginal candidiasis, which is estimated to occur at least once during the lifetime of 75% of the female population. Vaginal microbial imbalance may also represent an important risk factor for increased risk of urinary tract infections and pregnancy complications, such as endometritis, chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, and intrauterine death. Intravaginal colonisation by bacterial strains with high hemolytic activity and pigment production (e.g. group B streptococci [GBS]) is one of the most important risk factors for disease development in newborns.

Therefore, a murine model was proposed to determine if L. reuteri CRL1324 would exert a preventive effect on vaginal colonisation by Streptococcus (St.) agalactiae NH17. Following L. reuteri CRL1324 administration, the study aimed to observe potential protective effects.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114fsSas]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bacterial vaginosis, specifically in terms of antibiotic therapy, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend offering any of the following regimens as second-line therapy for patients with BV:

- **Clindamycin 300 mg PO**: Administered twice daily for 7 days.
- **Clindamycin ovules 100 mg**: Used intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days.
- **Secnidazole 2 g PO granules**: Taken as a single dose.
- **Tinidazole 2 g PO**: Administered once daily for 2 days.
- **Tinidazole 1 g PO**: Administered once daily for 5 days.

These guidelines provide a comprehensive approach to alternative antibiotic regimens for managing bacterial vaginosis.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1162WKXT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The observed association between recurrence and high abundance of Gardnerella spp and high BVAB:Lactobacillus ratio immediately post-treatment may suggest treatment failure due to the presence of a dense biofilm, or alternatively, resistance to first-line therapy, which has been documented for metronidazole. Our finding that high Gardnerella abundance post-treatment may contribute to recurrence is supported by a previous 16S rRNA gene sequencing study of 41 women, which found that a sustained cure was associated with lower relative abundance of Gardnerella post-treatment. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based analysis of the same samples showed that persistently high levels of Gardnerella genomospecies GS07 pre- and post-treatment predicted treatment failure. Furthermore, an analysis of 33 women found that sustained cure at one month post-treatment was associated with a marked decrease in Gardnerella vaginalis absolute abundance, quantified using qPCR, following intravaginal metronidazole. Collectively, these data suggest that post-treatment persistence of Gardnerella spp contributes to treatment failure. Metronidazole has limited ability to disrupt established Gardnerella biofilms. In vitro studies have found that the minimum inhibitory concentration for both metronidazole and clindamycin is higher for biofilm-forming G vaginalis isolates compared to planktonic isolates. Furthermore, two recent studies reported that while metronidazole and clindamycin had some in vitro activity against single-species Gardnerella biofilms, neither antibiotic significantly disrupted the biofilms.

### Revisited: Species heterogeneity, virulence factors, mucosal immune responses, and contributions to bacterial vaginosis [^115ecKYB]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Low credibility.

The role of Gardnerella in reproductive health remains incompletely understood. Gardnerella is a core component of bacterial vaginosis (BV) biofilms, yet it has also been isolated from healthy individuals. Advances to resolve Gardnerella strains into pathogenic and non-pathogenic categories have proven challenging. Recently, the Gardnerella genus was emended to include several different species and genomospecies, which appear to possess different virulence potentials. The regulation of these virulence factors and their effects on the mucosal epithelia remain ambiguous and are currently being investigated through systems biology approaches and in vitro models.

Given that the biofilm form of Gardnerella appears to be the most problematic for reproductive health, identifying bacterial components involved in adhesion and biofilm formation will be beneficial for designing more targeted interventions. Perhaps the most significant gaps in knowledge concern Gardnerella effects on cervicovaginal mucosal immune responses and how those differ among the different genomospecies and the biofilm and planktonic growth states.

We reviewed findings from in vitro and murine-controlled Gardnerella challenge studies, which mostly used G. vaginalis isolates and showed some upregulation in proinflammatory responses in some models but not in others. With respect to chemokines such as IP-10, in vitro studies seem to show discrepant results in response to Gardnerella, potentially due to differences in models and/or Gardnerella species.

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114gb27d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis.

- **Clinical diagnosis**: A clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that has a pH greater than 4.5, emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with this diagnosis include markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and absent or few white blood cells.

- **Pathogen exclusion**: Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

### In vitro activity of secnidazole against Atopobium vaginae, an anaerobic pathogen involved in bacterial vaginosis [^115AobP5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. In this study, the in vitro susceptibilities to metronidazole and secnidazole of 16 strains of A. vaginae were tested using the agar dilution method.

- **Findings**: We observed an MIC range for metronidazole of 4–64 mg/L (MIC(50), 8 mg/L; MIC(90), 32 mg/L) and an MIC range for secnidazole of 4–128 mg/L (MIC(50), 16 mg/L; MIC(90), 64 mg/L). According to these findings, we can conclude that the activity of secnidazole is similar to that of metronidazole.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115gKorY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis, but cure rates are suboptimal and recurrence rates remain high.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the impact of a standard course of oral metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice per day for 7 days) on the vaginal microbiota of Rwandan bacterial vaginosis patients using microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and to evaluate correlates of treatment failure.

- **Study design**: HIV-negative, nonpregnant women aged 18–45 years with bacterial vaginosis and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (N = 68) were interviewed and sampled before and after metronidazole treatment. They were also screened and treated if applicable for other urogenital infections. The vaginal microbiota was assessed by Gram stain Nugent scoring, Illumina 16S rRNA HiSeq sequencing (relative abundances), and BactQuant 16S gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (estimated concentrations). Only women with a pretreatment Nugent score of 7–10 and a valid posttreatment Nugent score (N = 55) were included in metronidazole treatment failure analyses, with treatment failure defined as a posttreatment Nugent score of 4–10.

- **Results**: The bacterial vaginosis cure rate by Nugent scoring was 54.5%. The mean total vaginal bacterial concentration declined from 6.59 to 5.85 log 10 /μL (P < .001), which was mostly due to a reduction in mean bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes concentration (all bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobe taxa combined) from 6.23 to 4.55 log 10 /μL (P < .001). However, only 16.4% of women had a bacterial vaginosis anaerobes concentration reduction.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117DFYcd]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally; however, an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within six months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence. This has been attributed to the possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials, and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners.

There is a robust body of evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity. The hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, yet the failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed at women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure, and the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection is justified.

This manuscript presents the molecular and epidemiological evidence supporting the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted and summarizes why research considering sexual partnerships is necessary. Additionally, it outlines the significant barriers and challenges identified while undertaking partner treatment studies and discusses the factors impacting our ability to determine their effectiveness. Ultimately, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is likely to be multifaceted.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1166sJ5S]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Results:

- **Participant characteristics and factors associated with BV recurrence**: Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics and sexual practices of the 121 women included in the analyses. The pooled cohort had a median age of 28 years (interquartile range, 25–32 years). Approximately half of the participants were born in Australia or New Zealand (56/121 [46%]), 24% were born in Europe (most commonly the United Kingdom and Ireland), and 22% were born in Asia (most commonly China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia). At baseline, 87 women (72%) reported having a regular sexual partner (RSP), most of whom were male (83 out of 87). Additionally, 26 participants (21%) reported hormonal contraceptive use, and 13 (11%) had an intrauterine device in situ. Most women (89/121 [74%]) had a history of BV. Some characteristics differed between the StepUp and SToPBV cohorts (e.g. having an RSP at baseline, baseline contraceptive practices, and post-treatment sexual practices), primarily due to differences in the eligibility criteria for each study.

- **BV recurrence**: Of the 121 women, 16 (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%–21%]) experienced BV recurrence. Only one characteristic differed significantly between recurrence and cure cases. Women who reported sex with an untreated RSP during follow-up were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared to women who had no RSP (9/28 [32%] vs. 3/44 [7%], P = 0.008) and women who had an RSP treated through StepUp-1/2 (9/28 [32%] vs. 4/49 [8%], P = 0.011).

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^114Cnv2i]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first review to detail research evidence on different anti-BV biofilm treatments. These findings inform clinicians about developments in the field and, in turn, offer their patients hope for a long-term cure.

- **Strengths and limitations of this review**: Several limitations of this review should be acknowledged. While publication bias was not specifically assessed, it was noted that the majority of publications reported on effective compounds. It is quite likely that significant research work finding investigative compounds ineffective remains unpublished and was consequently not captured by this review. Additionally, the heterogeneity of study designs made comparisons among findings difficult, as observations in laboratory cultures and animal models are not often reflected in human subject research.

### Revisited: Species heterogeneity, virulence factors, mucosal immune responses, and contributions to bacterial vaginosis [^115c9XH3]. Infection and Immunity (2023). High credibility.

Cytokine responses of reproductive epithelia and fetal membranes to Gardnerella challenge are critical for understanding bacterial vaginosis. Pivotal sites of Gardnerella colonization include the stratified squamous epithelium of the vagina and ectocervix, and the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix and uterus, particularly in cases of ascending infection. The majority of in vitro and murine studies have focused on the immune responses of these sites to Gardnerella.

Cytokine responses appear to differ depending on the cell model and Gardnerella species tested. For example, results from in vitro studies using the same G. vaginalis isolates have been inconsistent. Stimulation of HeLa cells with a large dose of live bacteria induced significant increases in IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8, whereas treatment of the same cell line with lysates from the same isolate did not. Similarly, the challenge of cervical and uterine carcinoma cell lines with heat-inactivated G. vaginalis isolates did not cause significant changes in these cytokines, though a lower challenge dose was used.

Some studies suggest increased IL-8 production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells; however, bacterial vaginosis is not typically associated with an increase in neutrophil counts. In murine models, inoculation with G. vaginalis does increase vaginal myeloperoxidase activity. One possible explanation for this is the lysis of neutrophils by vaginolysin in some settings. This IL-8 response also seems to differ depending on the Gardnerella species used, as do other chemokine responses. In the lower female genital tract, the impact of these differing responses requires further exploration to fully elucidate species-specific contributions to bacterial vaginosis.

### Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia in a premature neonate [^114QD1bf]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Gardnerella vaginalis is a normal component of the human vaginal flora and is commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis. Invasive infection in obstetrical patients due to G. vaginalis has also been reported. In the pediatric age range, infection due to G. vaginalis is extremely rare and limited to neonates. We describe a 23-week premature infant with G. vaginalis bacteremia and review the characteristics of neonatal G. vaginalis infection reported in the literature. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of G. vaginalis isolates has shown that penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin are effective in vitro.

### Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from patients with bacterial vaginosis and from patients with healthy vaginal ecosystems [^113kn47Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The differences in the phenotype and genotype of Gardnerella vaginalis isolates from patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and from patients without BV are unknown. In our study, 43 isolates of G. vaginalis were examined for biotype, including hippurate hydrolysis, lipase, and beta-galactosidase activity, sensitivity to metronidazole, and genotype. Of the 117 women visiting the gynecology clinic at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center who were included in the study, 27.4% were found to have BV. G. vaginalis was found in samples from 87.5% of women with BV, from 34.0% of women with intermediate BV, and from 26.4% of women with healthy vaginal ecosystems.

Among patients with G. vaginalis, biotypes 7 and 8 were isolated from 32% and 20% of patients, respectively. Biotype 5 was predominantly associated with a healthy vaginal ecosystem (P = 0.0004). Biotypes 5 and 7 were the most resistant to metronidazole. No specific phenotype or genotype of G. vaginalis causes BV.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111wBKTy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We explored the relationship between bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence and the ratio of nonoptimal to optimal bacteria present in the vaginal microbiota both pretreatment and immediately posttreatment. Before treatment, the ratios of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) to Lactobacillus and Gardnerella to L. iners were not linked to BV recurrence. However, immediately posttreatment, higher levels of total BVAB relative to Lactobacillus spp and higher levels of Gardnerella relative to L. iners were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence (AOR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.81], P = 0.017 and AOR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.09–1.95], P = 0.012). The ratio of pathobionts to Lactobacillus was not associated with recurrence at either timepoint.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^114Qh5w5]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Appropriate prescribing practices for fluoroquinolones, as well as all antimicrobial agents, are essential as evolving resistance patterns are considered, additional treatment indications are identified, and the toxicity profile of fluoroquinolones in children has become better defined. Earlier recommendations for systemic therapy remain; expanded uses of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of certain infections are outlined in this report. Prescribing clinicians should be aware of specific adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones, and their use in children should continue to be limited to the treatment of infections for which no safe and effective alternative exists or in situations in which oral fluoroquinolone treatment represents a reasonable alternative to parenteral antimicrobial therapy.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112u1cXw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

There is long-standing evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterized BV and hypothesized that "… husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge was transferred from women with BV to those without, 11 out of 15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the infectious nature of the BV syndrome.

Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and was hypothesized to be a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) responsible for the syndrome. However, when 13 'healthy' women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis (incubated for 24 hours prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth), only one developed BV. In a subsequent study, which used fresh cultures of G. vaginalis incubated for 12 hours prior to inoculation and in the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5 out of 9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that the phase of growth and environmental signals may control the expression of bacterial virulence factors, conferring a greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis, a conclusion supported by more recent evidence.

In support of the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91 out of 101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1 out of 38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV.

### Ofloxacin [^111sNMEN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ofloxacin exhibits activity against various microorganisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. However, it is not effective against Treponema pallidum, as noted in the WARNINGS section. Many strains of other streptococcal species, Enterococcus species, and anaerobes are resistant to ofloxacin.

- **Dilution techniques**: Quantitative methods are employed to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC values), which provide estimates of bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds. These MIC values should be determined using a standardized procedure based on a dilution method (broth or agar) or equivalent, with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ofloxacin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to specific criteria for different bacteria:

	- For Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
	- **For Haemophilus influenzae**: The absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any results other than "Susceptible". Strains yielding MIC results suggestive of a "nonsusceptible" category should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.
	- For Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
	- For Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.

A report of "Susceptible" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of "Intermediate" requires further context to determine therapeutic efficacy.

### Metronidazole [^116jSkoA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome that results from the replacement of the normal, Lactobacillus-dominant flora with several other organisms including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes like Peptostreptococcus spp and Bacteroides spp.

Metronidazole extended-release tablets were studied in patients with BV through two randomized, multicenter, well-controlled, investigator-blind clinical trials. A total of 557 otherwise healthy nonpregnant patients with BV were randomized to treatment with metronidazole extended-release tablets once a day for 7 days (n = 270) or 2% clindamycin vaginal cream, one applicator full (5 grams) once a day for 7 days (n = 287).

The primary efficacy endpoint for each treatment regimen was defined as clinical cure assessed at 28 to 32 days post-therapy. Clinical cure was defined as a return to normal of the vaginal pH (≤ 4.5), absence of a "fishy" amine odor, and absence of clue cells.

- **Clinical cure rates at one month**: At one month post-therapy, the pH of the vagina returned to normal earlier and in a greater percentage of patients in the metronidazole extended-release tablets treatment group compared to the 2% clindamycin vaginal cream group; 72% vs. 65%, respectively. Likewise, metronidazole extended-release tablets restored the normal Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora in a larger percentage of patients at one month post-therapy compared to the 2% clindamycin treated group; 74% vs. 63%, respectively.

### Tindamax [^1143haob]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

- **Usage**: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tindamax and other antibacterial drugs, Tindamax should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Tindamax is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for the following conditions:

- **Trichomoniasis**
- **Giardiasis**: In patients age 3 and older
- **Amebiasis**: In patients age 3 and older
- **Bacterial vaginosis**: In non-pregnant, adult women

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tindamax and other antibacterial drugs, it should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

### DNase inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms in vitro and in vivo [^11315XsG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a highly prevalent and poorly understood polymicrobial disorder of the vaginal microbiota, with significant adverse sequelae. Gardnerella vaginalis predominates in bacterial vaginosis. Biofilms of G. vaginalis are present in human infections and are implicated in persistent disease, treatment failure, and transmission. Here we demonstrate that G. vaginalis biofilms contain extracellular DNA, which is essential to their structural integrity. Enzymatic disruption of this DNA specifically inhibits biofilms, acting on both newly forming and established biofilms. DNase liberates bacteria from the biofilm to supernatant fractions and potentiates the activity of metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Using a new murine vaginal colonization model for G. vaginalis, we demonstrate > 10-fold inhibition of G. vaginalis colonization by DNase. We conclude that DNase merits investigation as a potential nonantibiotic adjunct to existing bacterial vaginosis therapies in order to decrease the risk of chronic infection, recurrence, and associated morbidities.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Trichomonas vaginalis antimicrobial drug resistance in 6 US cities, STD surveillance network, 2009–2010 [^117ACqaE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Inconsistency does exist between in vitro susceptibility results and clinical outcomes of treatment, particularly for infections with low-level in vitro resistance. Clinical resistance and treatment failure have occurred with T. vaginalis isolates for which minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) of nitroimidazoles were as low as 12.5 µg/mL, and treatment success has occurred in infections with T. vaginalis isolates for which MLCs of nitroimidazoles were 100–200 µg/mL. In general, however, elevated MLCs are associated with a greater likelihood of treatment failure. A recent evaluation of the utility of susceptibility testing in women for whom clinical treatment has failed found that treatment recommendations based on susceptibility results may have a beneficial role in informing the clinical management of some women with persistent infection. T. vaginalis susceptibility testing is not available routinely; such testing should be conducted by a qualified laboratory and is available at CDC (1–800-INFO).

As a cross-sectional evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial drug susceptibility, the study was not designed to detect clinical treatment failures. Multiple isolates were collected from 17 women. However, we did not systematically collect data on sexual re-exposure after treatment or adherence, so we were not able to determine whether any of these cases resulted from treatment failure. The MLCs of metronidazole for the initial isolates were low, suggesting that clinical resistance was unlikely. In two cases, the initial isolate exhibited low-level resistance (MLC of metronidazole 50 µg/mL).

There seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of BV. Many studies have suggested that the presence of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against BV, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. In-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli can inhibit the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce H2O2, lactic acid, and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV.

Clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6–12 days, or oral administration of L. acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of BV (defined as a 0–1 positive score according to Amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of BV, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid, or no treatment. However, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of BV and the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. Thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of BV are mostly positive, it remains to be fully confirmed.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^112uReir]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a neglected and poorly treated condition with a significant burden for women worldwide. In Australia, a BV prevalence of 12% was reported, as compared with 30% in North America and over 50% in Southern and Eastern Africa. Most affected are women of reproductive age.

BV is a polymicrobial condition with a complex pathophysiology where the native vaginal microbiome, mainly Lactobacillus sp, is disrupted by increased numbers of Gardnerella species, such as G vaginalis and G swidsinskii/leopoldi, which grow together in biofilms with Prevotella species, such as P bivia. Significant adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes are associated with BV, such as miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

BV treatment has changed very little since metronidazole was first introduced 40 years ago. Due to teratogenic concerns with metronidazole during that time, clindamycin was added as an alternative in the late 1980s. Standard-of-care treatment with one of these antibiotics can achieve an initial cure rate between 80% and 90%. However, more than half of all patients experienced recurrence within 6 months and up to 80% within 9 months of treatment. With the general increase in antimicrobial resistance, repeated use of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent BV is clearly unsustainable.

Several factors are believed to play a role in the high recurrence rates, such as ineffective penetration of these antibiotics.

### No. 211-screening and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^114pLHUK]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bacterial vaginosis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 7 days or clindamycin 300 mg PO BID for 7 days if treatment for the prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes is used. Do not use topical (vaginal) therapy for this indication.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^11135yEL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Prevotella spp are also commonly detected in the cutaneous penile and male urethral microbiota, and prior studies conducted by our group and others have reported the relative abundance of specific Prevotella spp to be moderately to strongly correlated between the vaginal and male genital microbiota of couples. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis for our findings is that the high abundance of Prevotella spp pretreatment may also reflect women who are at increased risk of recurrence due to ongoing exposure to an untreated regular sexual partner (RSP). There is now substantial microbiological and epidemiological evidence that supports a role for sexual transmission in both the acquisition and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Notably, a recent study demonstrated that detection of several BV-associated bacteria in the penile urethra, including Prevotella amnii and Gardnerella vaginalis, was contingent upon prior penile–vaginal sex, and that these organisms could persist in the urethra for more than 60 days after exposure.

In our study, women who reported sex with an untreated RSP during follow-up experienced BV recurrence more frequently compared to women with no RSP or women who had an RSP who received partner treatment. Of note, the proportion of women with a treated RSP who experienced recurrence (8%) was comparable to women with no RSP (7%). These findings suggest that combined oral and topical male partner treatment reduces BV recurrence at 1 month postenrollment to the level of a woman without an RSP. A multisite randomized controlled trial evaluating this intervention is ongoing (ACTRN12619000196145) and will provide the necessary data.

### Revisited: Species heterogeneity, virulence factors, mucosal immune responses, and contributions to bacterial vaginosis [^111xBqjd]. Infection and Immunity (2023). High credibility.

Gardnerella species are associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and have been investigated as etiological agents of the condition. Nonetheless, the isolation of this taxon from healthy individuals has raised important questions regarding its etiological role. Recently, using advanced molecular approaches, the Gardnerella genus was expanded to include several different species that exhibit differences in virulence potential. Understanding the significance of these different species with respect to mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis and complications of BV could be crucial to solving the BV enigma.

We review key findings regarding the unique genetic and phenotypic diversity within this genus, virulence factors, and effects on mucosal immunity as they stand. We also comment on the relevance of these findings to the proposed role of Gardnerella in BV pathogenesis and in reproductive health, and identify key gaps in knowledge that should be explored in the future.

### Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation [^1166JtZJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Practitioners and patients alike widely recognize the limitations of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Options remain extremely limited, and our inability to prevent the frequently, often relentless symptomatic recurrences of BV and to reduce serious sequelae such as preterm delivery remains an acknowledged but unresolved shortcoming. Our incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this unique form of vaginal dysbiosis has been a significant impediment to developing optimal treatment and prevention approaches. New drugs have not been forthcoming and are not likely to be available in the immediate future; hence, reliance on the optimal use of available agents has become essential as improvised, often unproven regimens are implemented.

In this review, we will explore the limitations of currently recommended therapies, with a particular focus on the contribution of reinfection and pathogen persistence to BV recurrence and the development of interventions that target these mechanisms. Ultimately, to achieve sustained cure and effectiveness against BV-associated sequelae, it is possible that we will need approaches that combine antimicrobials with biofilm-disrupting agents and partner treatments in those at risk of reinfection.

### The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women [^115sSA9Z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a very common cause of vaginitis that has been associated with a high incidence of obstetric and gynecologic complications and an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. This has led to renewed research interest in its treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents on BV in non-pregnant women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and African Healthline (as of December 2007); and proceedings of relevant international conferences (from 1981).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing any two or more antimicrobial agents, or antimicrobial agents with placebo or no treatment, in women with clinical or Gram-stain criteria of BV.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from the original publications, while a third author cross-checked the data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials involving 4422 participants were reviewed. Most examined symptomatic women only. Only seven trials analyzed results by intention to treat; we re-analyzed the remainder. Compared with placebo, clindamycin showed a lower rate of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.37). Clindamycin and metronidazole showed identical rates of treatment failure, irrespective of regimen type, at two and four-week follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.46; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.18, respectively). Clindamycin tended to cause a lower rate of adverse effects.

### 2020 European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea in adults [^113NTprY]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gonococcal urethritis, specifically in the context of antibiotic therapy, the IUSTI/WHO 2020 guidelines recommend administering a single dose of ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg or single doses of gentamicin IM 240 mg and azithromycin PO 2 g as an alternative option for patients with gonococcal urethritis confirmed to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Consider administering gentamicin IM 240 mg plus azithromycin PO 1 g, followed by an additional dose of azithromycin PO 1 g 6–12 hours later if gastrointestinal side effects are anticipated. Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance testing or validated and quality-assured molecular gyrA-based fluoroquinolone resistance testing should be obtained (only for anogenital samples due to potential cross-reactions with commensal Neisseria species in pharyngeal samples).

### Revisited: Species heterogeneity, virulence factors, mucosal immune responses, and contributions to bacterial vaginosis [^114hKR1G]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, possibly due to ascending infection and/or stimulation of inflammation. Treatment of fetal membranes with Gardnerella isolates, mostly G. vaginalis, promoted secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β, mostly from the choriodecidual compartment, and the immune-modulatory cytokine IL-10. Production of beta-defensins such as HBD-1 also increased following Gardnerella stimulation.

With respect to pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling, TLR-2 and TLR-7 were somewhat upregulated in fetal membranes in response to G. vaginalis, although this was not statistically significant. Gardnerella has been detected more frequently in the cervix of women who underwent premature rupture of membranes with evidence of intraamniotic microbial invasion but without accompanying intraamniotic inflammation. In support of this, the increase in IL-6 in response to Gardnerella challenge of fetal membranes was accompanied by increased production of gp130 and mIL-6R. This suggests that the IL-6 response to Gardnerella occurs through the gp130 and mIL-6 membrane receptor, which induces anti-inflammatory action. This supports the hypothesis that, as biofilms, Gardnerella species either do not induce or somehow suppress some inflammatory responses.

Adding to this evidence, Gardnerella biofilms within the endometrium and fallopian tubes have been reported in vivo. The presence of these biofilms was more likely in pregnant and BV-positive individuals. Stimulation of in vitro 3-dimensional endometrial epithelial cell models with G. vaginalis further corroborates these findings.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: Review of influencing factors [^1115Cssm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The fluoroquinolone class of antimicrobial agents is increasingly used empirically as resistance has developed to more traditional antimicrobial agents. Guidelines now recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line empiric therapy for urinary tract infections in regions where trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance is greater than 10% to 20%. Fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative empiric regimens in some patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Although increased use of these agents would be expected to lead to increased resistance, a targeted approach to fluoroquinolone prescribing, emphasizing their appropriate use, may reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance and maintain class efficacy.

Evidence is mounting that suggests a link between inappropriate fluoroquinolone use, the development of antimicrobial resistance against the entire fluoroquinolone class, and clinical failure. To maintain the activity of the fluoroquinolone class, clinicians need to implement an evidence-based approach to antimicrobial selection, particularly a strategy in which the most pharmacodynamically potent fluoroquinolone is matched, on an empiric basis when required, to anticipated bacterial pathogens.

Three major factors are associated with increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones:

- **Underdosing**: Use of a marginally potent agent whose MIC is barely reached in serum or infected tissues.
- **Overuse of agents known to encourage resistant mutants**.
- **Inability to readily detect and respond to changes in antimicrobial susceptibilities**.

### An adherent Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm persists on the vaginal epithelium after standard therapy with oral metronidazole [^115xzm9X]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of standard treatment with oral metronidazole in the eradication of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

- **Study design**: We conducted an interventional follow-up study in which 18 patients with bacterial vaginosis were treated with oral metronidazole for one week. Subsequently, a single random follow-up assessment was conducted at one-week intervals, up to five weeks, with three patients representing each point in time. Follow-up assessment included conventional scoring of the vaginal microflora and determination of bacterial biofilm characteristics on a vaginal biopsy through bacterial 16/23S recombinant DNA-based fluorescence in-situ hybridization.

- **Results**: Although all patients recovered, we consistently observed a resurgence of a dense and active bacterial biofilm on the vaginal mucosa, primarily consisting of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae, upon treatment cessation.

- **Conclusion**: A large reservoir of the core bacteria contributing to bacterial vaginosis persists as a biofilm after metronidazole treatment.

### Ofloxacin [^1145yHY6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ofloxacin is prescribed for treating various infections with specific guidelines for use:

- **Acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea**: Due to *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (see WARNINGS).

- **Nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis**: Due to *Chlamydia trachomatis* (see WARNINGS).

- **Mixed infections of the urethra and cervix**: Due to both *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (see WARNINGS).

- **Acute pelvic inflammatory disease**: Including severe infection due to *Chlamydia trachomatis* and/or *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (see WARNINGS).

	*Note: If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected, appropriate therapy for anaerobic pathogens should be administered.*

- **Uncomplicated cystitis**: Caused by *Citrobacter diversus*, *Enterobacter aerogenes*, *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Proteus mirabilis*, or *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Given that fluoroquinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with serious adverse reactions (see WARNINGS), and since uncomplicated cystitis may be self-limiting, ofloxacin should be reserved for treatment when no alternative treatment options are available.

- **Complicated urinary tract infections**: Caused by *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Proteus mirabilis*, *Citrobacter diversus*, or *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

- **Prostatitis**: Due to *Escherichia coli*.

It is recommended that before initiating treatment with ofloxacin, appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed to isolate and identify the causative organisms and determine their susceptibility to ofloxacin, USP. However, therapy with ofloxacin, USP may start before the test results are known. Once results are available, appropriate therapeutic adjustments should be made.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116c6dEb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal dysbiosis that often recurs following first-line antibiotics. We investigated if vaginal microbiota composition was associated with BV recurrence. We analyzed samples and data from 121 women who participated in three published trials evaluating novel interventions for improving BV cure, including concurrent antibiotic treatment of regular sexual partners (RSPs). Women diagnosed with BV received first-line antibiotics and self-collected vaginal swabs before treatment and immediately after finishing antibiotics. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on vaginal samples. Logistic regression explored associations between BV recurrence and features of the vaginal microbiota pre- and posttreatment.

Sixteen women (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%-21%]) experienced BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Women with an untreated RSP were more likely to experience recurrence than women with no RSP (P = 0.008) or an RSP who received treatment (P = 0.011). A higher abundance of Prevotella pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05–1.91]) and Gardnerella immediately posttreatment (AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) were associated with increased odds of BV recurrence.

Having specific Prevotella species prior to recommended treatment and persistence of Gardnerella immediately posttreatment may contribute to the high rates of BV recurrence. Interventions that target these taxa are likely required to achieve a sustained BV cure.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^116UhLau]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a condition associated with adverse reproductive outcomes and characterized by a shift from a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota to a polymicrobial microbiota, consistently colonized by strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Metronidazole is the first-line treatment; however, treatment failure and recurrence rates remain high. To understand complex interactions between *Gardnerella vaginalis* and *Lactobacillus* involved in efficacy, we developed an ordinary differential equation model that predicts bacterial growth as a function of metronidazole uptake, sensitivity, and metabolism. The model shows that a critical factor in efficacy is *Lactobacillus* sequestration of metronidazole, and efficacy decreases when the relative abundance of *Lactobacillus* is higher pre-treatment. We validated results in *Gardnerella* and *Lactobacillus* co-cultures and in two clinical cohorts, finding women with recurrence have significantly higher pre-treatment levels of *Lactobacillus* relative to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. Overall, the results provide mechanistic insight into how personalized differences in microbial communities influence vaginal antibiotic efficacy.

### Gardnerella species and their association with bacterial vaginosis [^114RJEXq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

There were 44 episodes of symptomatic BV with subsequent metronidazole treatment. Of these, 24 episodes were treated with Metrogel once a day at bedtime for 5 days, 19 with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days, and 1 with both. This occurred in 26 of 42 weekly longitudinal participants. Sixteen participants experienced additional or continuing episodes of symptomatic BV during the 12-week follow-up period and had more than 1 BV episode represented.

G. vaginalis, G. piotii/pickettii, G. swidsinskii/greenwoodii, and G. leopoldii were detected in 44, 38, 42, and 20 BV episodes, respectively. Concentrations of each Gardnerella species group were significantly lower in the week after metronidazole treatment compared to the prescription date. Of the BV episodes, 8.9%, 23.7%, 4.8%, and 35.0% with G. vaginalis, G. piotii/pickettii, G. swidsinskii/greenwoodii, and G. leopoldii detection, respectively, resulted in no detection by week 2 post-prescription, and redetection by week 3 occurred in 75.0%, 44.4%, 0.0%, and 28.6% of those episodes, respectively.

- **Changes in Gardnerella concentration**: Log-transformed Gardnerella species group cpn60 gene concentrations were observed at antibiotic prescription (day 0), week 1 (days 1–7), week 2 (days 8–14), and week 3 (days 15–21). There were 44 episodes of BV and subsequent antibiotic prescription in 26 participants in the 12-week period examined. Only episodes with detection of each Gardnerella species group at prescription are shown in each plot.
