## Question

If a patient has a hemoglobin of 10.2 with an iron of 40, TIBC of 472, percent saturation at eight. Transferrin at 380, percent transferrin saturation at 7.5 and ferritin at seven what would be the best therapy?￼

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best therapy for a patient with iron deficiency anemia, given laboratory values including hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL, ferritin 7 ng/mL, transferrin saturation 8%, and TIBC 472 µg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of iron deficiency anemia. Then, I should verify the indications for intravenous versus oral iron and choose the route. Next, I will calculate the iron deficit and select a dosing regimen. After that, I need to outline pre-infusion safety steps, monitoring, and response targets. Finally, I should address the underlying cause and special scenarios like CKD, IBD, pregnancy, and heart failure, and close with a concise plan summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. Hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL is below typical adult lower limits and, together with ferritin 7 ng/mL and transferrin saturation 8%, establishes absolute iron deficiency anemia. The markedly elevated TIBC of 472 µg/dL is consistent with iron deficiency physiology, and the low ferritin confirms depleted stores rather than functional iron deficiency, which would show ferritin > 100 ng/mL with low TSAT in inflammatory states [^116RmEyQ] [^1162718v]. I should double-check that ferritin is not being confounded by inflammation; in the absence of an elevated CRP or known inflammatory disease, ferritin 7 ng/mL is unequivocally diagnostic of absolute iron deficiency anemia, and the anemia is moderate in severity given Hb around 10 g/dL [^115bHVQo].

> Next, I should review the route of iron administration. Wait, let me verify the thresholds that push toward IV therapy: ferritin < 30 ng/mL, TSAT < 20%, or Hb < 10 g/dL are commonly cited triggers for IV iron as first-line because of faster and more reliable repletion, especially when a prompt hematologic response is desired or oral absorption is uncertain. Here, ferritin is 7 ng/mL and TSAT is 8%, so IV iron is preferred over oral iron [^113xmMC9]. Hold on, I should also consider patient-specific factors: if there is active gastrointestinal disease, prior intolerance to oral iron, or a need for rapid correction, IV iron is favored. Conversely, in very mild anemia with good tolerance, oral iron can be tried, but that is not this case [^116FymGj].

> I will now examine dosing options and calculate the iron deficit. Let me think about practical IV regimens: ferric carboxymaltose allows complete repletion in 1–2 infusions. For a 70 kg adult, a total of 1,500 mg is typical, given as 750 mg IV with a second 750 mg dose ≥ 7 days later, or as a single 15 mg/kg dose up to 1,000 mg if weight-based dosing is preferred. This aligns with FDA-labeled dosing for IDA and is supported by guideline preference for formulations that complete repletion in 1–2 infusions [^111ju52C] [^113xmMC9]. I should confirm the deficit calculation: using the simplified Ganzoni-style approach, deficit ≈ (15 − observed Hb) × weight × 2.4 + 500 mg for stores; for 70 kg and Hb 10.2 g/dL, that is roughly (4.8 × 70 × 2.4) + 500 ≈ 1,306 mg, which fits within the 1,500 mg total commonly administered with ferric carboxymaltose, supporting the two-dose 750 mg strategy [^117Xszw9] [^111ju52C].

> Before infusion, I need to ensure safety steps are not overlooked. I should confirm that any oral iron is held prior to IV administration, obtain baseline hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT, and administer a test dose when using iron dextran. For ferric carboxymaltose, a formal test dose is not required, but I should still observe for infusion reactions and be prepared to manage complement activation–related pseudo-allergic reactions, which are far more common than true anaphylaxis with modern formulations [^117Xszw9] [^111ju52C] [^113xmMC9]. Wait, let me verify that I am not overcalling anaphylaxis risk; contemporary data show very low rates of true anaphylaxis, and most reactions are mild infusion reactions, so premedication is not routinely needed unless there is a prior reaction history [^113xmMC9].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response targets. I will check hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks expecting a rise of about 1–2 g/dL if repletion is adequate; a ≥ 10 g/L rise within 2 weeks is highly suggestive of iron deficiency and a robust response, which helps confirm the diagnosis retrospectively if studies were equivocal at baseline [^114J4SK1]. I need to ensure iron indices are reassessed 4–8 weeks after completion to document repletion; ferritin should rise above 100 µg/L and TSAT into the 20–30% range, recognizing ferritin may overestimate stores transiently after IV iron and should be interpreted with TSAT and clinical context [^1177mVnZ] [^114DruxY]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not chasing a falsely high ferritin immediately post-infusion; waiting several weeks before checking ferritin avoids misinterpretation of redistribution artifacts [^1177mVnZ].

> I will now examine the underlying cause and concurrent conditions that modify management. Iron deficiency in men and postmenopausal women warrants evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss; colonoscopy and, when appropriate, upper endoscopy should be arranged, with urgency guided by age and severity, because GI malignancy is a key concern in new IDA without an obvious cause [^115bHVQo]. But wait, what if the patient has CKD, IBD, heart failure, or is pregnant? In CKD not on dialysis, a trial of oral iron can be considered, but IV iron achieves higher Hb response rates and is reasonable when TSAT is low and ferritin is < 500 ng/mL; in IBD, IV iron is preferred, especially with active disease or Hb < 10 g/dL; in heart failure, IV iron improves symptoms when ferritin is < 100 µg/L or 100–300 µg/L with TSAT < 20%; in pregnancy, IV iron is increasingly used in the second and third trimesters when anemia is more severe or oral iron is not tolerated, with careful risk–benefit assessment [^116QRdA2] [^116FymGj] [^114uBJZz] [^116dVjra] [^113Aqm9F]. I should double-check that these condition-specific nuances are documented in the plan to avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.

> Let me consider oral iron as an alternative if IV therapy is unavailable or declined. Standard dosing uses 40–65 mg elemental iron once daily or every other day to improve tolerability; alternate-day regimens can reduce hepcidin-mediated inhibition and may enhance fractional absorption, though the clinical Hb response remains the key endpoint [^1156JPSv] [^114DruxY]. I should confirm expectations: with adequate absorption, hemoglobin typically rises by about 1 g/dL within 2–4 weeks; if there is no meaningful rise by 4 weeks, I need to reassess adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or an alternate diagnosis, and pivot to IV iron promptly in that scenario [^114DruxY] [^1177mVnZ].

> Finally, I should summarize the actionable plan and ensure it is internally consistent. Diagnosis: absolute iron deficiency anemia of moderate severity. Route: IV iron preferred. Regimen: ferric carboxymaltose 750 mg IV now, repeat 750 mg IV in ≥ 7 days for a total of 1,500 mg. Safety: hold oral iron, monitor during infusion, treat infusion reactions supportively. Monitoring: check hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks expecting a 1–2 g/dL rise, and recheck ferritin and TSAT 4–8 weeks after completion to confirm repletion. Etiology: arrange age-appropriate GI evaluation for occult blood loss. Special contexts: tailor to CKD, IBD, HF, or pregnancy as above. This aligns with BSG diagnostic confirmation, AGA guidance on IV-first in significant IDA, and FDA-labeled dosing for ferric carboxymaltose, and it sets objective response targets to verify treatment efficacy [^115bHVQo] [^113xmMC9] [^111ju52C].

---

The best therapy for this patient is **intravenous iron** (preferably ferric carboxymaltose 1,000–1,500 mg total, given as 1–2 infusions) [^111ju52C] because the severe iron deficiency anemia (ferritin 7 ng/mL, TSAT 8%) warrants rapid, reliable repletion and oral iron is unlikely to be effective or tolerated given the low TSAT and high TIBC [^113xmMC9]. IV iron is **superior to oral iron** for faster hemoglobin recovery, fewer GI side effects, and better adherence [^113Aqm9F] [^116FymGj]. Monitor hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT at 2–4 weeks; expect a hemoglobin rise of about 1–2 g/dL within 4 weeks if repleted [^114DruxY]. Address the underlying cause of iron deficiency to prevent recurrence [^115bHVQo].

## Clinical interpretation of laboratory results

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hemoglobin (Hb) | 10.2 g/dL | 12.0–16.0 g/dL (women); 13.5–17.5 g/dL (men) | Moderate anemia |
| Serum iron | 40 µg/dL | 60–170 µg/dL | Low |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | 472 µg/dL | 250–370 µg/dL | High |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | 8% | 20–50% | Severely low |
| Ferritin | 7 ng/mL | 15–150 ng/mL (women); 30–300 ng/mL (men) | Severely low |

---

These findings confirm **severe iron deficiency anemia**, characterized by low serum iron, high TIBC, low TSAT, and low ferritin [^114Jezfm].

## Rationale for intravenous iron therapy

Intravenous iron is **indicated** in patients with severe iron deficiency anemia who require rapid correction — particularly when oral iron is unlikely to be effective or tolerated — owing to poor absorption, gastrointestinal side effects, or poor adherence [^113xmMC9] [^1177mVnZ]. IV iron achieves **faster hemoglobin recovery**, fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and improved adherence compared with oral iron [^113Aqm9F] [^116FymGj].

---

## Recommended intravenous iron formulation and dosing

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is preferred for its **convenience and efficacy**, allowing complete repletion in 1–2 infusions. Recommended dosing is **1,000–1,500 mg total**, administered as a single dose or two doses separated by 7 days, depending on body weight and clinical judgment [^111ju52C].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting intravenous iron therapy

Multiple studies and guidelines support IV iron for **severe iron deficiency anemia**:

- **Faster hemoglobin recovery**: IV iron achieves a hemoglobin rise of about 1–2 g/dL within 4 weeks [^notfound].
- **Fewer gastrointestinal side effects**: IV iron is better tolerated than oral iron [^113Aqm9F].
- **Improved adherence**: Single or two-dose regimens improve adherence compared with daily oral therapy [^116FymGj].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT** 2–4 weeks after infusion to assess response and adjust therapy. Expect a hemoglobin rise of about 1–2 g/dL within 4 weeks if iron repletion is adequate [^114DruxY].

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identify and treat the cause of iron deficiency — such as gastrointestinal bleeding, malabsorption, or chronic blood loss — to prevent recurrence [^114ZYX35].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Intravenous iron therapy, preferably ferric carboxymaltose, is the **best treatment** for this patient with severe iron deficiency anemia. It provides rapid, reliable repletion with better tolerability and adherence than oral iron.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^114LPdNF]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^117G1BYP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### Upper limit of serum ferritin: misinterpretation of the 2006 KDOQI anemia guidelines [^111tsQJW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron treatment in hemodialysis patients improves response to recombinant human erythropoietin and facilitates achievement of targets for hemoglobin and hematocrit. Excessive treatment, however, could expose patients to risks related to iron overload and oxidative stress. Therefore, international treatment guidelines generally recommend that intravenous (i.v.) iron be discontinued when serum ferritin is > 500–1,000 ng/ml. In the current review, relevant issues that inform decisions as to what levels of serum ferritin should be used as the upper limit for treatment are considered. A conclusion is reached that the current published literature is inadequate for developing evidence-based guidelines on this issue. Instead, clinical judgment is critical to properly weigh risks and benefits of i.v. iron treatment, and to determine whether iron treatment is appropriate for a given patient with higher levels of iron tests.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) iron therapy — IV ferric carboxymaltose receives a strong recommendation for adults in this CPG, and routine screening of iron indices is an essential component of RLS patient care. Other IV iron formulations are not suggested for RLS due to less robust evidence for each comparison; nevertheless, 1 RCT using IV iron sucrose did show efficacy in adults with RLS and ESRD with a transferrin saturation < 20%, and this form of IV iron is conditionally recommended. Oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate is suggested with a conditional recommendation based on limited RCT data.

### Anemia diagnosis and therapy in malignant diseases: implementation of guidelines-a representative study [^111CZTzv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics

The following parameters were considered necessary for an adequate diagnosis of anemia and iron metabolism: hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), percent hypochromic red cells (%HRC), reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr), serum ferritin (SF), transferrin (TF), transferrin saturation (TSAT), and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). In addition, folic acid and B12 should be determined if needed.

The following definitions were used:
Iron deficiency (ID): TSAT < 20% or SF < 100 ng/mL
Absolute ID (AID): SF < 100 ng/mL
Functional ID (FID): TSAT < 20%, SF ≥ 100 ng/mL
No ID: TSAT ≥ 20%; SF ≥ 100 ng/mL
Signs of anemic hypoxia: tachycardia, hypotension, ECG ischemia, lactic acidosis
Risk factors: coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular insufficiency

Treatment

Guideline-compliant anemia management was defined by the following criteria:
Restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion policy: Hb ≥ 10 g/dL: no RBC transfusion indicated Hb ≥ 8– < 10 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated only if there is evidence of anemic hypoxia Hb ≥ 7– < 8 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated: Yes: in the presence of signs of anemic hypoxia Yes: in the presence of other risk factors/insufficient compensation No: no risk factors and adequate compensation Hb < 7 g/dL: RBC transfusion indicated
Iron replacement and ESAs in patients receiving chemotherapy:

- Oral iron replacement is not recommended and should only be considered in patients with ferritin < 30 ng/mL, non-inflammatory disease (C-reactive protein (CRP) < 5 mg/L) and only in patients in complete remission.
- Intravenous (IV) iron replacement in case of ID. - Absolute ID: IV iron and ESA if Hb remains < 10 g/dL during follow-up. - Functional ID: IV iron and ESA.
- No existing ID.
- ESA and IV iron if ID during follow-up
Iron replacement in patients not receiving chemotherapy:

- Oral iron replacement is not recommended and should only be considered in patients with ferritin < 30 ng/mL, non-inflammatory conditions (CRP < 5 mg/L) and only in patients in complete remission.
- IV iron replacement in case of ID.
- **Absolute or functional ID**: IV iron. ESAs are only recommended in patients receiving chemotherapy. Appropriate substitution in case of proven vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Oral iron for patients receiving dialysis: what is the evidence? [^114KXEyX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

This review aims to summarize the available evidence of the effectiveness of oral iron in patients receiving dialysis. Four small randomized controlled trials (105 evaluated patients) compared oral iron supplements with placebo or no treatment; hemoglobin and ferritin levels did not differ significantly between groups at the end of the studies, while transferrin saturation levels fell in the placebo group in two studies. One trial (46 evaluated patients), comparing different ferrous iron preparations, found that hemoglobin levels and iron indices were maintained, but not increased. Another trial (54 evaluated patients) compared heme iron polypeptide with ferrous sulfate; hemoglobin and transferrin saturation levels remained stable with both agents, but ferritin levels fell with heme iron polypeptide, but not ferrous sulfate. Two observational studies found that iron supplements can maintain hemoglobin and iron indices. Oral iron supplements were poorly tolerated. These sparse data suggest that oral iron is of little or no benefit in raising hemoglobin and iron indices in patients receiving dialysis. Further data are required to determine if oral iron can maintain adequate iron indices following iron replenishment using intravenous iron supplements.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: a systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

Objective

We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

Design

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE and in main professional association websites, limited to documents published between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2014.

Results

Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations and issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1). A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. To define ID, all guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin. One-half of them (10 of 22) proposed transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test. To treat ID, most of the guidelines (18 of 27) recommended preferentially the oral route if possible, particularly in children and in women in the pre- or postpregnancy period. Iron supplementation should be administered intravenously according to 13 of 27 guidelines, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5). Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, ferritin concentrations should not exceed 500 μg/L (n = 5) or 800 μg/L (n = 5). Only 9 guidelines recommended TSAT as a target, proposing various thresholds ranging from 20% to 50%.

Conclusions

It appears that for the diagnosis of ID, a cutoff of 100 μg/L for serum ferritin concentration should be considered in most conditions and 20% for TSAT, except in particular situations, including young healthy women with heavy menstrual flow. New indications of intravenous iron supplementation are emerging.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117N3uM6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Non-ID anemia in IBD patients

As described above, there are several additional important causes of Hb deprivation in patients with IBD. Especially in cases of macrocytic anemia, vitamin B12 and folic acid level measurements should be performed during screening visits. Additionally, myelosuppressive medication, including thiopurines and sulfasalazine, should always be considered in the diagnostic workup of anemia.

Treatment of anemia in IBD

Given that anemia significantly affects patients' QOL and increases disease severity and mortality rates, therapeutic interventions aiming to normalize Hb levels play a crucial part in the clinical management of IBD patients. Physicians should be aware of anemia in IBD patients and should treat the underlying causes.

Iron therapy in IBD

Recent guidelines strongly recommend iron supplementation in patients with confirmed ID anemia. The normalization of Hb levels and repletion of iron stores are considered as final therapeutic goals. More specifically, a Hb increase of > 2 g/dL and a transferrin saturation of > 30% within 4 weeks are regarded as adequate therapeutic responses. Iron supplementation in IBD patients without manifest anemia is still debated and should be further evaluated in clinical trials, especially with regard to tolerance of therapy.

Normal diets usually provide sufficient iron supplies in the form of elemental and heme iron. As already discussed, in patients with active IBD, the inflammation of the mucosa leads to maldigestion, malabsorption and changing nutrition habits, which may aggravate ID and make exclusive nutritional supplementation impossible. Nevertheless, oral iron substitution can be effective in IBD patients with mild disease activity and mild anemia. For reasons of widespread availability, low cost and established safety profile, many physicians tend to favor oral iron substitution as first-line therapy. Frequently used oral iron supplements are ferrous fumarate (325 mg tablets containing 106 mg elemental iron per tablet), ferrous sulfate (325 mg tablets containing 65 mg elemental iron per tablet), and ferrous gluconate (325 mg tablets containing 36 mg elemental iron per tablet).

### Diagnostic value of iron indices in hemodialysis patients receiving epoetin [^113EtyQd]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency remains a common cause of hyporesponsiveness to epoetin in hemodialysis patients. However, considerable controversy exists regarding the best strategies for diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

As part of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of intravenous versus subcutaneous administration of epoetin, we made monthly determinations of serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percentage transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin. If a patient had serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL or the combination of serum ferritin < 400 ng/mL and a transferrin saturation < 20%, he/she received parenteral iron, given as iron dextran 100 mg at ten consecutive dialysis sessions. We analyzed parenteral iron use during the trial, the effect of its administration on iron indices and epoetin dose, and the ability of the iron indices to predict a reduction in epoetin dose in response to parenteral iron administration.

Results

Eighty-seven percent of the 208 patients required parenteral iron to maintain adequate iron stores at an average dose of 1516 mg over 41.7 weeks, or 36 mg/week. Only two of 180 patients experienced serious reactions to intravenous iron administration. Two thirds of the patients receiving parenteral iron had a decrease in their epoetin requirement of at least 30 U/kg/week compared with 29% of patients who did not receive iron (P = 0.004). The average dose decrease 12 weeks after initiating iron therapy was 1763 U/week. A serum ferritin < 200 ng/mL had the best positive predictive value (76%) for predicting a response to parenteral iron administration, but it still had limited clinical utility.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency commonly develops during epoetin therapy, and parenteral iron administration may result in a clinically significant reduction in epoetin dose. The use of transferrin saturation or serum ferritin as an indicator for parenteral iron administration has limited utility.

Implementation issues: In clinical practice, individualized anemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) requires selection of the starting Hb level, initial erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose/route/frequency, Hb monitoring frequency, the aspirational threshold or target Hb, and rules for sequential ESA dose adjustments, but available randomized controlled trials used either a range or a discrete value for the target Hb and published reports include little additional information to assist decision making; information is lacking about how ESA and iron therapy were actually adjusted and about comparative data to determine optimum monitoring frequency and the number of Hb results needed to reliably measure clinical performance.

### A phase III, randomized, open-label trial of ferumoxytol compared with iron sucrose for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy [^112R4UeJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common form of anemia worldwide. Although oral iron is used as first-line treatment, many patients are unresponsive to or cannot take oral iron. This Phase III, open-label, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of ferumoxytol, a rapid, injectable intravenous (IV) iron product with low immunological reactivity and minimal detectable free iron, with IV iron sucrose in adults with IDA of any cause. Patients (N = 605) were randomized 2:1 to receive ferumoxytol (n = 406, two doses of 510 mg 5 ± 3 days apart) or iron sucrose (n = 199, five doses of 200 mg on five nonconsecutive days over 14 days) and followed for 5 weeks. Ferumoxytol demonstrated noninferiority to iron sucrose at the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2 g/dL at any time from Baseline to Week 5 (ferumoxytol, 84.0% [n = 406] vs. iron sucrose, 81.4% [n = 199]), with a noninferiority margin of 15%. Ferumoxytol was superior to iron sucrose (2.7 g/dL vs. 2.4 g/dL) in the mean change in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5 (the alternative preplanned primary endpoint) with P = 0.0124. Transferrin saturation, quality-of-life measures, and safety outcomes were similar between the two treatment groups. Overall, ferumoxytol demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy to iron sucrose, suggesting that ferumoxytol may be a useful treatment option for patients with IDA in whom oral iron was unsatisfactory or could not be used.

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^112We6uT]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the institutional review board of the Central Virginia US Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare system. A waiver of informed consent was granted because the study was a retrospective analysis. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data Collection

Using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified patients with IDA who received their first outpatient oral iron prescription (324 mg or 325mg of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous fumarate) for 90 days, with at least 1 refill within 120 days of the first index prescription date between 2009 and 2019. IDA was defined as hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and either (1) iron saturation (ISAT) less than 20% or (2) ferritin less than 50 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). There was no official clinical practice guideline by the Veterans Health Administration on management of IDA, and oral iron was prescribed as per treating physician clinical discretion. Patients were classified into 3 dose groups: daily (once a day), multiple doses per day (MDD; ≥ 2 times per day), and alternate day dose (ADD) based on their oral iron dosing schedule.

Baseline laboratory data consisted of data collected closest to the index prescription date, but not older than 180 days. Follow-up laboratory data were collected from 30 to 180 days following the first oral iron prescription date (index prescription date). We have only included patients who had at least 1 follow-up hemoglobin measurement during this time. Ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC; calculated in micrograms per deciliter [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179]), and ISAT were collected in those who met the aforementioned inclusion criteria. Therefore, every patient in the final cohort had continuous hemoglobin data, and within these patients, a subset had follow-up data on the other 3 iron indices.

Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR)were collected. Patients with an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m², patients receiving dialysis, and patients with kidney transplants were excluded. Patients were further classified based on baseline eGFR into the cohort with NKF (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and the cohort with CKD (eGFR ≥ 15 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²).

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. View values < 12 mcg/L indicative for absent iron stores.
Do not exclude the possibility of functional iron deficiency in case of values as high as 1,200 mcg/L in patients with CKD, and recognize that some such patients may respond to IV iron therapy. View a serum ferritin concentration of < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis patients or < 200 mcg/L in chronic hemodialysis patients as predictive of iron deficiency and potentially good response to IV iron therapy.
Do not use values above the suggested cut-offs to guide iron therapy. Use serum ferritin values > 1,200 mcg/L to ascertain obtaining evaluation for potential iron overload.

### Parenteral versus oral iron therapy for adults and children with chronic kidney disease [^112Gb166]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The anaemia seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be exacerbated by iron deficiency. Iron can be provided through different routes, with advantages and drawbacks of each route. It remains unclear whether the potential harms and additional costs of intravenous (IV) compared with oral iron are justified.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of IV iron supplementation compared with oral iron for anaemia in adults and children with CKD.

Search Methods

In March 2010 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in which oral and IV routes of iron administration were compared in adults and children with CKD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and for continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) was used or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were performed to investigate between study differences.

Main Results

Twenty eight studies (2098 participants) were included. Risk of bias attributes were poorly performed and/or reported with low risk of bias reported in 12 (43%) studies for sequence generation, incomplete outcome reporting and selective outcome reporting and in 6 (16%) studies for allocation concealment. No study was blinded for participants, investigators and outcome assessors but all were considered at low risk of bias because the primary outcome of haemoglobin was a laboratory outcome and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. Haemoglobin (22 studies, 1862 patients: MD 0.90 g/dL, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.37); ferritin (24 studies, 1751 patients: MD 243.25 μg/L, 95% CI 188.74 to 297.75); and transferrin saturation (18 studies, 1457 patients: MD 10.20%, 95% CI 5.56 to 14.83) were significantly increased by IV iron compared with oral iron. There was a significant reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose in patients receiving dialysis who were treated with IV iron (9 studies, 487 patients: SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.30). There was a high level of heterogeneity in all analyses. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity did not differ significantly, but were reported in few studies. Gastrointestinal side effects were more common with oral iron, but hypotensive and allergic reactions were more common with IV iron.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels, together with a small increase in haemoglobin, in patients with CKD who were treated with IV iron compared with oral iron. From a limited body of evidence, we identified a significant reduction in ESA requirements in patients treated with IV iron, and found no significant difference in mortality. Adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. We therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of IV iron is justified on the basis of reductions in ESA dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects.

### Intravenous iron in patients with heart failure and iron deficiency: an updated meta-analysis [^1129YjNe]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Ten trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified that provided data on 3373 participants (IV iron: n = 1759; standard of care or placebo: n = 1614) (online supplementary Figure S1). Length of follow‐up ranged from 12 to 52 weeks with a median length of follow‐up in IRONMAN of 140 weeks (Table 1). The most common definition of iron deficiency applied was a serum ferritin < 100 μg/L regardless of transferrin saturation (TSAT) or a TSAT < 20% if ferritin was 100–300 μg/L. IRONMAN had similar inclusion criteria but allowed inclusion of patients with a TSAT < 20%, provided ferritin was < 400 μg/L. Four trials compared ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) to placebo, three compared FCM to standard care, one trial compared ferric derisomaltose (FDI) to standard care, one trial compared iron sucrose to placebo and another to standard care. Trials generally excluded patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 9 g/dl), because their clinical need for correction of iron deficiency was considered too great, and those with a haemoglobin > 14–15 g/dl, in whom iron deficiency appears uncommon.

Patients

Boys and girls eligible for enrollment at study sites in Poland were 1–17 years of age and those in Russia were 6–17 years of age. At screening, eligible patients had a hemoglobin concentration < 11 g/dL and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Therapy with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent was permitted, provided that the dose had been stable for more than 8 weeks prior to screening and that no changes in the dose or product were anticipated for the duration of the trial.

Patients were excluded with a ferritin level > 300 ng/mL at screening, with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 5th percentile for age, or, for individuals who were enrolled while 1 year of age, with body weight < 12 kg. Other exclusion criteria included active infection; anemia for reasons other than iron deficiency; receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, other than steroid therapy, that could exacerbate anemia; receipt of IV iron and/or a blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to screening; history of acquired iron overload, hemochromatosis, or other iron accumulation disorder; severe diseases of the liver or the hematopoietic or cardiovascular system; CKD treated with hemodialysis; and/or evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis B or C viruses with evidence of active hepatitis.

Study design and treatment

Patients who met the selection criteria entered a ≤ 14-day screening period to assess eligibility. Eligible patients were enrolled sequentially in one of two dose groups in which they received a single IV dose of FCM (Vifor Pharma Ltd. St. Gallen, Switzerland) (either 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg, with a maximum total dose of 750 mg). Enrollment in the group to receive the higher dose of FCM (15 mg/kg) began after all patients in the lower dose group (FCM 7.5 mg/kg) had received study drug and been observed for 4 weeks post-dose with no safety concerns as determined by the DSMB on the basis of an interim analysis of the FCM 7.5 mg/kg cohort.

FCM was administered as an undiluted solution at a rate of 100 mg/min. Doses less than 100 mg were administered as a slow undiluted IV push injection within 1 min. All patients were followed for 35 days. After infusion of FCM on Day 0, patients returned to the clinic at 24, 48, and 72 h post-dose, and subsequently on study Days 14, 28, and 35 for safety, PK, and PD assessments.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 Important Pre-Treatment Information

Discontinue administration of any iron-containing products prior to administration of INFeD.

Assess baseline hematologic (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin) to monitor response to therapy.

Administer a test dose of INFeD prior to administration of therapeutic dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Iron Deficiency Anemia

Calculate the INFeD dose based upon Table 1 and formulas below. Continue INFeD until hemoglobin is within the normal range and iron stores are replete.

Administer daily doses of no more than 2 mL of INFeD until the total required dose is administered. Monitor response to therapy by evaluating hematologic parameters (hemoglobin and hematocrit) and iron storage parameters (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin). Iron storage parameters may improve prior to hematologic parameters. Serum ferritin may not be an accurate measure of body iron stores in patients on chronic dialysis.

Table 1: Total INFeD Requirement for Hemoglobin Restoration and Iron Stores Replacement in Patients with Iron Deficiency Anemia*

Alternatively, the total dose may be calculated using the formulas below:

Adults and Children over 15 kg (33 lbs)

Dose (mL) = 0.0442 (Desired Hb − Observed Hb) × LBW + (0.26 × LBW)

Anemia parameters and use of ESA and iron

According to the K-DOQI and the European Best Practices Guidelines (EBPG), anemia was present in 51.3% and 30.5% of the total subjects, respectively. The mean hemoglobin for the cohort as a whole was 12.8 g/dL and the majority of patients (87.8%) had hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dL (Table 5). The percentage of patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) was 1.6% and the percentage of patients with hemoglobin between 9 and 11 g/dL was 11.5%. About 25% of the total cohort was receiving ESA and the mean hemoglobin in this group while receiving this therapy was 12 ± 1.5 g/dL and the range was wide (Table 5). The mean ferritin level was 150 ng/mL (range 5–1500) and the percentage of patients with transferrin saturation < 20% was 26.3%. The percentage of patients on oral and IV iron supplementation were 31.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Table 5
Anemia parameters and the use of ESA and iron

The mean hemoglobin was significantly lower in stage 4 when compared to stage 3 CKD patients (12.4 ± 1.6 vs. 13.2 ± 1.7 g/dL). The percentage of patients with hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dL was significantly higher in stage 3 than stage 4 CKD patients (91.1 vs 85.5% p < 0.001). Conversely, the percentage of patients with hemoglobin < 9 g/dL was significantly lower in stage 3 than stage 4 CKD patients (0.5 vs 2.3% p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted in the percentage of patients with hemoglobin between 9 and 11 g/dL between CKD stage 3 and 4 patients (Table 5).

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^1156eU7K]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, the majority being due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, pica and, in neonates, delayed growth and development. In adolescents, ID is associated with decrements in learning and behavioral abnormalities. In the absence of a clear cause, search for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is diagnostic of ID unless the serum ferritin is low or the percent transferrin saturation is low with an elevated total iron binding capacity. Oral iron is considered front line therapy except for conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Oral iron has many unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route. While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to use IV iron due to a misunderstanding of the safety of the available formulations. IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances including pregnancy. The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized and we believe that IV iron should be moved forward in the treatment of ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA).

Guideline 2.4 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy - upper limit for iron therapy

We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron, and to achieve this iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is > 500 microgram/L. (1B)

Rationale

- Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction.

- There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content.

- An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content.

- Magnetic resonance imaging provides a reliable assessment of tissue iron content in HD patients regularly treated with parenteral iron. However, the clinical relevance of increased liver iron remains unclear.

- Elevated serum ferritin together with elevated serum transferrin saturation remain the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in CKD patients.

- Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual's ferritin is > 500 microgram/L produces a population mean that straddles the 500microgram/L ceiling. Ongoing iron therapy in patients with ferritin > 500 microgram/L results in a higher median ferritin outcome.

- Interpretation of iron status results and deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include a concomitant assessment of changes in Hb level and ESA dose over time. Examples:

- A dropping ferritin as well as decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss e.g. on HD or bowel related anaemia: iron therapy is indicated; further investigation may be required depending on the clinical scenario.

- A decreasing ferritin level after initiation of ESA therapy, with a concomitant rise in Hb level indicates a response to ESA with a shift of iron from stores to bone marrow: further iron therapy is guided by target ferritin level.

- An increasing ferritin level after reduction of ESA dose to bring Hb level down to target range indicates ferritin level is rising as Hb synthesis is dropping: further iron therapy may be postponed.

IV iron in combination with ESA

According to the current evidence, it is recommended to optimize the available iron stores with IV iron before or during therapy with ESA (Table 2).

Table 2
Overview of the available studies with IV iron in combination with ESA. Hematopoietic response was defined as Hb increase ≥ 2 g/dL, Hb ≥ 11g/dL, Hb ≥ 12 g/dL or Hb ≥ 13 g/dL in the different studies

In contrast to studies mentioned in Table 2, Steensma et al did not find any difference in hematopoietic response rate, ESA dose requirements, transfusion needs, and QoL in 502 patients receiving darbepoetin every 3 weeks randomized to the combination with oral placebo, oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg per day and ferric gluconate 187.5 mg every 3 weeks. The negative results might be explained by the low dose of ferric gluconate, which was about 50% of the recommended single dose.

Overall, the available studies are heterogeneous in study design (different oncologic profiles, different iron formulations, different prevalence in ID and different endpoints), which makes the generalization of the results complicated. In general, there is compelling evidence that the response to ESA is better when IV iron is added.

IV iron as monotherapy

A body of evidence shows that IV administration of iron routinely in absence of ESA is favorable. Kim et al showed in cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy that giving iron sucrose every chemotherapy cycle reduces the need for transfusion (40% vs. 64% of the patients, and fewer units needed: 1.87 vs. 3.58 units). Dangsuwan showed a significant reduction in transfusion need in the next chemotherapy cycle by giving iron sucrose in comparison to oral iron (22.7% vs. 63.6%).

A large German prospective, non-interventional 12-week study showed that patients with baseline Hb up to 11.0 g/dL and serum ferritin up to 500 ng/mL benefited from FCM treatment (stable Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL). Also patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL but low transferrin saturation benefited from FCM treatment. FCM was well tolerated, 2.3% of patients reported putative drug-related adverse events.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^114DruxY]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe²⁺ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy, and their use is not recommended.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view ferritin levels of 30–100 mcg/L with a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency in the context of inflammation that may benefit from iron supplementation.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

Criteria for updating KDOQI anemia guidelines — triggers and surrogate endpoint considerations: An update is prompted when there is new evidence on important clinical outcomes, when evidence comes from studies adequately powered for the outcomes of interest, and when the new evidence would be likely to change the magnitude of the estimate of the effect or change the assessment of the balance of benefits and harms. Evidence from surrogate end point trials can prompt an update if criteria from the Users' Guide for a Surrogate End Point Trial are met, but the Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) study did not initiate an update because it examined a surrogate outcome (change in Hb) after short follow-up duration (6 weeks).

### Efficacy and safety of IV ferumoxytol for adults with iron deficiency anemia previously unresponsive to or unable to tolerate oral iron [^113NyL4B]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Although oral iron is the initial treatment approach for iron deficiency anemia (IDA), some patients fail to respond to or cannot tolerate oral iron. This double-blind safety and efficacy study of the intravenous (IV) iron, ferumoxytol, randomized patients with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy, or in whom oral iron could not be used, to ferumoxytol (n = 609) or placebo (n = 203). The proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint (hemoglobin increase ≥ 2.0 g/dL at Week 5) was 81.1% with ferumoxytol versus 5.5% with placebo (P < 0.0001). The mean increase in hemoglobin from Baseline to Week 5, a secondary endpoint (also the alternative preplanned primary efficacy endpoint for other health authorities), was 2.7 versus 0.1 g/dL (P < 0.0001). Achievement of a hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL, time to a hemoglobin increase ≥ 2.0 g/dL, and improvement in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue score also significantly favored ferumoxytol over placebo at Week 5 (P < 0.0001). Ferumoxytol treatment-emergent adverse events were mainly mild to moderate. Ferumoxytol was effective and well tolerated in patients with IDA of any underlying cause in whom oral iron was ineffective or could not be used. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01114139.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^116uyCh6]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia (IDA) management includes trying oral iron first in children with Hb ≥ 10 g/dL and/or quiescent disease, with response to oral therapy determined by repeating Hb in 2 to 4 weeks; adequate response is an increase in Hb ≥ 1 g/dL in 2 weeks or ≥ 2 g/dL in 4 weeks, and reticulocyte response can be observed as early as 4 days with maximal response at 7 to 10 days; parenteral iron is indicated when oral iron is ineffective and/or poorly tolerated, in patients with moderate-severe anemia and/or active inflammation, and according to ECCO guidelines an IV replacement goal of achieving a ferritin level of up to 400 μg/L is more likely to prevent recurrence of anemia, while a transferrin saturation < 50% and serum ferritin of 800 μg/L should not be exceeded.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115bHVQo]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Erythropoietin therapy in pre-dialysis patients with chronic renal failure: lack of need for parenteral iron [^114mcW6h]. American Journal of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

During erythropoietin therapy, scant information exists regarding the optimal target percent saturation of transferrin (TSAT), ferritin and the mode and amount of iron supplementation in pre-dialysis patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Hypothesis

Pre-dialysis CKD patients may have different needs for iron supplementation than end-stage renal disease subjects during erythropoietin therapy.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of pre-dialysis CKD subjects (n = 31) treated with erythropoietin at our institution.

Results

In this population our results showed that target hematocrit (33–36%) was achievable with erythropoietin (mean subcutaneous dose 86 ± 17 [SD] units/kg/week) without parenteral iron therapy. The hematocrit increased from a mean baseline value of 28.4 ± 2.7 to 33.6 ± 3.4% at time 1 (4–9 weeks, p < 0.0001), and to 37.7 ± 4.5% at time 2 (10–20 weeks, p < 0.0001). The hemoglobin concentration increased from 9 ± 0.9 g/dl at baseline to 10.7 ± 1.1 g/dl at time 1 (p < 0.0001) and to 12 ± 1.5 g/dl at time 2 (p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses of patients prescribed < 200 mg oral elemental iron per day (n = 10), those with TSAT < 20% and/or ferritin < 100 ng/ml (n = 19), and those prescribed erythropoietin < 80 units/kg/week (n = 12), all showed a significant increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin.

Conclusions

Our data show that pre-dialysis CKD subjects respond adequately to erythropoietin at or lower than recommended erythropoietin doses without parenteral iron. This response extends even to subgroups with TSAT and/or ferritin levels deemed to indicate iron deficiency in CKD subjects, and may be due to lack of existence of functional iron deficiency in this group of patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^112T6aP2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) phlebotomy regimen and monitoring — Initial treatment is typically done with weekly removal of 500 mL of blood, with larger volumes, usually 1,000 mL, if tolerated, whereas those who do not tolerate weekly phlebotomies may have smaller volumes removed or increased intervals. Hemoglobin should be checked before and during treatment to ensure it is above 11 g/dL. Serum ferritin (SF) should be checked monthly during phlebotomy until a goal SF level of 50–100 ng/mL is reached. After the SF goal is achieved, the goal of maintenance is to maintain SF levels near 50 ng/mL, and phlebotomy frequency typically is 3–4 times per year.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^115zSigh]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — anaemia and iron management defines iron deficiency by serum ferritin < 100 μg/L, or serum ferritin 100–299 μg/L and transferrin saturation < 20%, and recommends regular monitoring of iron status. In patients with severe iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] < 7–8 g/dL), i.v. supplementation is recommended, while oral ferrous formulations are often poorly tolerated and efficacy may be impaired; one small open-label study suggested good tolerability and efficacy of ferric maltol in severe pulmonary hypertension with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency and anaemia, but two small, 12 week, randomized, cross-over trials in PAH without anaemia showed no significant clinical benefit, and randomized controlled trials comparing oral vs i.v. iron are lacking.

### Comparison of the safety and efficacy of 3 iron sucrose iron maintenance regimens in children, adolescents, and young adults with CKD: a randomized controlled trial [^114Fgygj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in young persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Iron repletion with intravenous (IV) iron formulations has been studied in children; maintenance IV iron regimens have not been reported extensively.

Study Design

A multicenter randomized trial of IV iron sucrose.

Setting & Participants

145 children, adolescents, and young adults with CKD receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were stratified by dialysis category (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or non-dialysis dependent) and weight (< 50 and ≥ 50 kg).

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dosing arms: 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg (maximum single dose, 100 mg), stratified into hemodialysis versus nonhemodialysis (peritoneal dialysis or non-dialysis-dependent CKD) groups. Patients treated with hemodialysis received study medication once every other week for 6 doses. Patients in the nonhemodialysis group received study medication once every 4 weeks for 3 doses.

Outcomes

We assessed adverse event rates between dosing groups. The main clinical end point was a composite of hemoglobin level ≥ 10.5–14.0 g/dL, inclusive; transferrin saturation ≥ 20%-50%, inclusive; and stable ESA dosing (± 25% of baseline dose).

Results

Between-group difference for composite clinical end point rate attainment was -3.9% (95% CI, -21.4% to 13.7%) for the 1.0-mg/kg group versus 0.5-mg/kg group, +3.9% (95% CI, -15.1% to 23.0%) for the 2-mg/kg group versus 0.5-mg/kg group, and +7.8% (95% CI, -10.9% to 26.5%) for the 2-mg/kg group versus 1-mg/kg group. No differences were noted between regimens in reported adverse effects, which were all minor.

Limitations

Absence of a control group receiving no IV iron. Short duration of intervention and observation. A small proportion of patients having achieved the primary clinical outcome.

Conclusions

IV iron sucrose at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg at the intervals prescribed is noninferior to higher doses in maintaining hemoglobin levels > 10.5 g/dL in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving ESA therapy.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^116F1JPL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease — oral iron initiation, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: In children, the recommended dose is approximately 2 to 3 mg/kg/day, and based on ECCO guideline, goal dose of an adult dose of 100 mg of elemental iron per day should not be exceeded. Oral iron should be tried in patients with mild anemia, especially in those with Hgb ≥ 10 g/dL, inactive disease. A follow-up Hgb and reticulocyte count should be checked in 14 to 28 days to assess the adequacy of response, which is defined as an increase in Hgb of 1 g/dL in 2 weeks or 2 g/dL in 4 weeks. The treatment can be switched to parenteral iron if there are side effects and/or poor response to oral iron therapy. Adult data suggest improved efficacy and tolerability when oral iron is given at a lower dose (40–80 mg/day) or on alternate days, and multiple doses per day can paradoxically decrease iron absorption.

Adults with congenital heart disease — cyanosis, iron deficiency, and erythrocytosis management: The guideline clarifies usage that "cyanosis" is used to denote hypoxemia from right-to-left shunting and emphasizes hematologic assessment in cyanotic patients: "Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals", and "Iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels, because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test". Limited evidence supports iron repletion when "treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely". Regarding hyperviscosity management, "Phlebotomy is, therefore, rarely necessary in patients with secondary erythrocytosis, and routine phlebotomy is not supported by data".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^113xmMC9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

The commentary highlights data that intravenous iron given to patients with ferritin > 500 ng/mL reduced ESA doses and costs, and states a therapeutic trial of IV iron (or oral iron in CKD ND) "should be considered when TSAT is low (≤ 30%), even if ferritin concentration is above 500 ng/mL". It also states "there are currently no data available that suggest long-term IV iron administration in moderate doses causes worse outcomes", and that "Hb response to iron therapy, TSAT, and ferritin should be monitored closely and further iron therapy titrated accordingly".

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116riGh1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline 2.4 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy - Upper limit for iron therapy

For people not on HD, we recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 600 mcg/L in those treated with iron. To achieve this, iron management should be reviewed when ferritin is > 500 mcg/L, recognising that a level of > 800 mcg/L may reflect iron toxicity. (1B)

Guideline 2.4.1

For people receiving HD, we recommend that proactive high-dose IV iron, initially 600 mg in divided doses in the first month and then 400 mg every month (or equivalent) should be given unless ferritin > 700 mcg/L or TSAT > 40%. (1 A)

Guideline 2.4.2

We suggest a tailored approach by clinicians to assess the risk and benefit of starting a proactive IV iron protocol in people who have been established on HD for > 12 months. (2B)

Rationale

Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction. There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content. An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content. Elevated serum ferritin together with elevated serum transferrin saturation remain the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in people with CKD.

Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual's ferritin is > 500 mcg/L produces a population mean that straddles the 600 mcg/L ceiling.

Deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include concomitant assessment of changes in iron status, Hb and ESA or HIF-PHI dose over time. For example:

A decreasing ferritin as well as decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss. Iron therapy is indicated, and further investigation may be required.
A decreasing ferritin after initiation of ESA therapy with a concomitant rise in Hb indicates a response to ESA with a shift of iron from stores to bone marrow. Further iron therapy is guided by serum ferritin.
An increasing ferritin after a reduction in ESA dose to reduce Hb to target range indicates a reduction in Hb synthesis. Iron therapy may be postponed.
A rising ferritin and reducing TSAT suggests an inflammatory condition e.g. sepsis, vascular access, surgery or recent hospitalisation. Further iron therapy depends on serum ferritin and clinical scenario.
Ongoing high IV iron doses to maintain ferritin indicated blood loss which may require further investigation.

### 40th international symposium on intensive care&emergency medicine 2021 [^115wfEzW]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods: Patients with serious CR infections were randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous CFDC, 2 g, q8h, or best available therapy (BAT; ≤ 3 antibiotics with Gram-negative activity) for 7–14 days [1]. Hemoglobin levels were measured in protocol-defined routine laboratory analyses. Specific iron homeostasis-related laboratory tests were performed at randomization and test of cure [TOC; end of treatment + 7 days) to determine serum levels of total iron, hepcidin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS%). Normal iron level ranges were defined as 59–178 µg/mL (males) and 37–173 µg/mL (females).

Results: Of 150 randomized patients (CFDC 101, BAT 49), 71 (47.3%) had anemia in their medical history (CFDC 44.6% [45/101], BAT 53.1% [26/49]) and 134 (CFDC 91, BAT 43) had serum iron data available at baseline. Most patients had iron levels below the lower limit of normal (CFDC 76.2% [77/101], BAT 57.1% [28/49]), and fewer patients had iron levels in the normal range (CFDC 13.9% [14/101], BAT 30.6% [15/49]). Between baseline and TOC, mean hemoglobin level increased from 9.6 to 9.9 g/dL in the CFDC arm and from 9.0 to 9.5 g/dL in the BAT arm (Fig. 1). Changes in all four specific iron homeostasis parameters between baseline and TOC were similar between treatment arms (Fig. 1).

Conclusions: CFDC therapy did not lead to increased anemia or reduced serum iron level in patients with serious CR infections.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for the treatment of anemia in CKD: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Aqm9F]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Iron supplementation is crucial for the treatment of anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although intravenous (IV) iron is preferred for patients with CKD receiving dialysis (CKD stage 5D), the method of iron replacement for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 is controversial.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed until October 2015 of MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings in nephrology, and reference lists of included trials.

Setting & Population

Patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 or 5D.

Selection Criteria For Studies

All randomized controlled trials, regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

IV versus oral iron supplementation.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was defined as percentage of patients reaching an elevation in hemoglobin (Hb) concentration > 1g/dL. Secondary end points included percentage of patients who reached Hb levels > 11g/dL, absolute Hb concentration, change in Hb concentration, transferrin saturation, ferritin levels, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and blood transfusion requirement, and quality of life. Safety analysis included all-cause mortality and serious and all adverse events.

Results

24 trials were identified, 13 including 2,369 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 and 11 including 818 patients with CKD stage 5D. Patients treated with IV iron were more likely to reach an Hb response > 1g/dL (risk ratios [RRs] of 1.61 [95% CI, 1.39–1.87] for CKD stages 3–5 and 2.14 [95% CI, 1.68–2.72] for CKD stage 5D). Safety analysis showed similar rates of mortality and serious and any adverse effects. IV iron replacement was associated with higher risk for hypotension (RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.74–7.94) and fewer gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28–0.67).

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity between trials; follow-up was usually limited to 3 months.

Conclusions

Our results agree with current recommendations for IV iron replacement for patients with CKD stage 5D and support increased use of IV iron for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.

### Are we giving too much iron? Low-dose iron therapy is effective in octogenarians [^114bQEUu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Elderly patients are vulnerable to the dose-dependent adverse effects of iron replacement therapy. Our study examines whether low-dose iron therapy can efficiently resolve iron-deficiency anemia in patients over the age of 80 years and reduce adverse effects.

Subjects and Methods

Ninety hospitalized patients with iron-deficiency anemia were randomized to receive elemental iron in daily doses of 15 mg or 50 mg as liquid ferrous gluconate or 150 mg of ferrous calcium citrate tablets for 60 days. Thirty control patients without anemia were given 15 mg of iron for 60 days. A 2-hour iron absorption test was performed after the initial dose. Hemoglobin and ferritin levels were measured on day 1, 30, and 60 after initiating therapy. Each patient completed a weekly questionnaire regarding drug-induced adverse effects.

Results

Serum iron rose significantly in the anemic patients beginning 15 minutes after the first dose but not in nonanemic patients. Two months of iron treatment significantly increased hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations similarly in all 3 groups of iron-deficiency anemia patients (for example, hemoglobin levels rose from 10.0 g/dL to 11.3 g/dL with 15 mg/d of iron therapy and from 10.2 g/dL to 11.6 g/dL with 150 mg/d). Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, and black stools were significantly more common at higher iron doses.

Conclusions

Low-dose iron treatment is effective in elderly patients with iron-deficiency anemia. It can replace the commonly used higher doses and can significantly reduce adverse effects.

2.1	Pre-Treatment and On-Treatment Evaluations of Anemia, Iron Stores, and Liver Tests

Evaluation of Anemia and Iron Stores

Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiation of VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy.

Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

Liver Testing

Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months and then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2	Important Dosing Information

Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL.

VAFSEO can be taken with or without food.

VAFSEO should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

VAFSEO can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

If a dose of VAFSEO is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it is the same day as the next dose. In this case, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose taken at the usual time. Double doses should not be taken to make-up for a missed dose.

### Iron dextran [^113M5a7A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115umD7P]. Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Comparison of iron dosing strategies in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis: a randomized controlled trial [^1143r8oC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Whether iron supplementation in patients on hemodialysis could be delivered by less frequent but higher single doses compared with the currently more common higher-frequency schedules of lower single iron doses is unknown.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We carried out an open-label, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial over 40 weeks in patients on prevalent hemodialysis (n = 142). We administered in total 2 g iron as 100 mg iron sucrose biweekly in a continuous (20×100 mg) fashion or 500 mg ferric carboxymaltose every 10 weeks in a periodic (4×500 mg) fashion. The primary end point was the change in hemoglobin at week 40 from baseline with a noninferiority margin of -0.8 g/dl. Secondary end points were changes in ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use.

Results

In total, 108 patients completed the study. At 40 weeks, hemoglobin changed by -0.27 g/dl (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 0.09) in the iron sucrose arm and by -0.74 g/dl (95% confidence interval, -1.1 to -0.39) in the ferric carboxymaltose arm compared with baseline. Noninferiority was not established in the per-protocol population as hemoglobin changes compared with baseline differed by -0.47 g/dl (95% confidence interval, -0.95 to 0.01) in the ferric carboxymaltose arm compared with the iron sucrose arm. Proportional changes from baseline to week 40 differed by -31% (98.3% confidence interval, -52 to -0.1) for ferritin, by 1% (98.3% confidence interval, -7 to 10) for transferrin, and by -27% (98.3% confidence interval, -39 to -13) for transferrin saturation in the ferric carboxymaltose arm compared with the iron sucrose arm. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dosing did not differ between groups. The overall number of adverse events was similar; however, more infections were observed in the iron sucrose arm.

Conclusions

An equal cumulative dose of ferric carboxymaltose administered less frequently did not meet noninferiority for maintaining hemoglobin levels compared with iron sucrose administered more frequently.

### Serum ferritin in chronic kidney disease: reconsidering the upper limit for iron treatment [^11213rcc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2004). Low credibility.

Intravenous iron treatment in hemodialysis patients improves the response to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and facilitates achievement of targets for hemoglobin and hematocrit. Excessive treatment, however, could expose patients to risks related to iron overload and oxidative stress. Therefore international treatment guidelines generally recommend that intravenous iron be discontinued when serum ferritin is greater than 500–1000 ng/ml. In this article we explore the relevant issues that inform the decisions as to what levels of serum ferritin are used as the upper limit for treatment. We conclude that the current published literature is inadequate for developing evidence-based guidelines. Clinical judgment is critical to properly weigh the risks and benefits of intravenous iron treatment in the context of the individual patient.

Study Population

We screened patients newly diagnosed with IDA who had not received any iron supplement therapy in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2017. Some of these patients were found to have anemia during a routine checkup. Most patients presented because of symptoms such as dizziness and palpitation. The nurse prechecked first. If the patients were found to have anemia, the nurse would recommend them to the anemia clinic to receive examination and treatment. Then our team screened these patients for enrollment.

The inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, voluntarily signing the informed consent form, and meeting the diagnostic criteria for IDA, which include a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dL for men or less than 12 g/dL for women (to convert hemoglobin to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) less than 80 μm 3 (to convert MCV to femtoliters, multiply by 1.0), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) less than 27 pg/cell, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) less than 32 g/dL (to convert MCHC to grams per liter, multiply by 10), serum ferritin level less than 14 ng/mL for women or 30 ng/mL for men, serum iron less than 39 μg/dL for women or 56 μg/dL for men, transferring saturation less than 20%, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) exceeding 428 μg/dL (to convert TIBC to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179). Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, severe uncorrectable bleeding, identified stomachache or intestinal ulcers, any inflammatory diseases, or identified gastrointestinal tumors.

Study Monitor

Patients were treated for 3 months and assessed with a complete blood count every 2 weeks for 2 months; iron metabolism was measured at week 8. The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin level from baseline to the 2-week follow-up. The secondary outcomes included the change in the reticulocyte percentage after 2 weeks of treatment, the increase in hemoglobin after 4 weeks of treatment, the increase in serum ferritin after 8 weeks of treatment, and adverse events. Exploratory outcomes included MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels every 2 weeks at all time points and serum iron level, transferring saturation, and TIBC at 8 weeks. The Department of Laboratory Medicine in Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, conducted the measurements and biochemical analyses.

### Dietary nonheme iron is equally bioavailable from ferritin or ferrous sulfate in thalassemia intermedia [^1118TrGd]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Transfusion-independent patients with thalassemia intermedia (TI) develop fatal iron overload from excessive iron absorption triggered by ineffective erythropoiesis. More information about iron pharmacokinetics and nonheme, dietary iron absorption in such patients is needed to optimize management. To obtain more information, different forms of supplemental nonheme iron sources (ferritin and ferrous sulfate) were compared in 4 TI (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) and 6 control (hemoglobin 12–16 g/dL) patients. Serial serum iron concentrations were measured during the 24 hours following consumption of 1 mg/kg of elemental iron as ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Serum iron concentrations were also measured for one TI patient and one control patient 2 hours after the ingestion of 2 mg/kg of dietary iron in ferritin or ferrous sulfate. Maximum serum iron concentrations were observed 4 hours after the consumption of either dietary iron source. However, the serum iron values were unchanged for either dietary iron source, even at the higher doses of consumed iron. Thus, the bioavailability of dietary iron, either as ferritin or ferrous sulfate, was equivalent in both groups of patients. The pilot data support ferritin as an alternative dietary iron supplement to ferrous sulfate.

Methods

Patients

The RESCUE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial conducted in the United States. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible if they had an eGFR > 10 and < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2009 creatinine equationand systemic inflammation, which was defined as an hsCRP level of 2 mg/L or greater. Patients with an absolute neutrophil count of < 2.0×10⁹ per L, a platelet count of < 120×10⁹ per L, and a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio > 4.0 g/g were excluded. Those who tested positive for active tuberculosis, HIV, or hepatitis B or C, as well as those with active infections or chronic use of immunosuppressive therapies, were also excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive placebo or subcutaneous ziltivekimab at doses of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg once every 4 weeks, up to 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified by baseline Hb levels (< 11 and ≥ 11 g/dl) and CKD stage (stages 3 and 4/5). This study was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at the study sites. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before study participation. All research activities adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Study Outcomes

Exploratory outcomes presented here were changes from baseline to week 12 in levels of Hb, iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, reticulocyte Hb, ferritin, and hepcidin. A post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for levels of Hb, stratified by the baseline Hb level (< 11 and ≥ 11 g/dl).

Safety parameters included anemia as an adverse event, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Full information on safety parameters assessed during the RESCUE trial have been published previously.

Case 1

An 80-year-old man with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) who had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction a year ago, underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and was on dual-antiplatelet therapy was referred for evaluation of anemia. He has had anemia for > 10 years with hemoglobin of ∼12 g/dL. He tolerated exercise by bicycling without any change in endurance over the past several years. He denied history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has had a negative fecal occult blood test (FOBT). No family members had hematologic disorders. He had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy 3 years ago, which showed no active bleeding sites. Colonoscopy only revealed diverticulosis and nonbleeding internal hemorrhoids.

Laboratory tests showed hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 93 fL, platelet count of 206 × 10⁹/L, white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.5 × 10⁹/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 55 mL/min per 1.73 m², vitamin B12 at 408 pg/mL (reference 123–730 pg/mL), folate at 39 ng/mL (reference > 5.2 ng/mL), iron at 69 μg/dL (reference 45–150 μg/dL), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) of 270 μg/dL (reference 261–478 μg/dL), ferritin at 91 ng/mL (reference 11–204 ng/mL), transferrin saturation (TSAT) of 26% (reference 15% to 55%), and normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) at 3.06 μIU/mL (reference 0.34–5.66 μIU/mL).

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in CKD: a summary of the NICE guideline recommendations and their rationale [^11536fLC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The UK-based National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has updated its guidance on iron deficiency and anemia management in chronic kidney disease. This report outlines the recommendations regarding iron deficiency and their rationale. Serum ferritin alone or transferrin saturation alone are no longer recommended as diagnostic tests to assess iron deficiency. Red blood cell markers (percentage hypochromic red blood cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, or reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent) are better than ferritin level alone at predicting responsiveness to intravenous iron. When red blood cell markers are not available, a combination of transferrin saturation < 20% and ferritin level < 100ng/mL is an alternative. In comparisons of the cost-effectiveness of different iron status testing and treatment strategies, using percentage hypochromic red blood cells > 6% was the most cost-effective strategy for both hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis patients. A trial of oral iron replacement is recommended in people not receiving an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) and not on hemodialysis therapy. For children receiving ESAs, but not treated by hemodialysis, oral iron should be considered. In adults and children receiving ESAs and/or on hemodialysis therapy, intravenous iron should be offered. When giving intravenous iron, high-dose low-frequency administration is recommended. For all children and for adults receiving in-center hemodialysis, low-dose high-frequency administration may be more appropriate.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two clinical studies (Studies A and B) were conducted in adults and one clinical study was conducted in pediatric patients (Study C) to assess the efficacy and safety of Ferrlecit.

Study A

Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of Ferrlecit administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of Ferrlecit (25 mg of elemental iron) and were then randomly assigned to receive Ferrlecit at cumulative doses of either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) of elemental iron. Ferrlecit was given to both dose groups in eight divided doses during sequential dialysis sessions (a period of 16 to 17 days). At each dialysis session, patients in the low-dose group received Ferrlecit 62.5 mg of elemental iron over 30 minutes, and those in the high-dose group received Ferrlecit 125 mg of elemental iron over 60 minutes. The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 40.

Eligibility for this study included chronic hemodialysis patients with a hemoglobin below 10 g/dL (or hematocrit at or below 32%) and either serum ferritin below 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation below 18%. Exclusion criteria included significant underlying disease or inflammatory conditions or an epoetin requirement of greater than 10,000 units three times per week. Parenteral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed for two months before the study. Oral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed during the study for Ferrlecit-treated patients.

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: clinical opinion [^116dVjra]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin-an acute phase reactant-may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority-a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequellae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentrations are less than 10.5g/dL and for all iron-deficient women in their third trimester.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^114vL6Nn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

5 BENEFITS OF MAINTENANCE IV IRON THERAPY < 250 MG/MONTH IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS, WITHOUT LOSS OF EFFICACY ON HEMOGLOBIN OR INCREASED ESA REQUIREMENT

Two recent publications highlight the possibility of drastically reducing the amount of iron infused for maintenance therapy without a detrimental effect on hemoglobin levels or ESA cost. 71, 72 In light of recent literature, a team at the Nancy academic hospital in France performed a proof of concept study, changing their iron maintenance strategy over a period of 8 months, and greatly reducing infused iron in 45 stable hemodialysis patients. 71 Their former strategy targeted a transferrin saturation between 30% and 50% irrespective of serum ferritin. With the new strategy, IV iron was only administered if transferrin saturation was below 20% and ferritin below 200 μg/L. Routine ESA practices were unchanged with a hemoglobin target between 10 and 12 g/dL; ESA (methoxy‐polyethylene glycol‐epoetin‐beta) was administered monthly, 71 and the dose was corrected by 25% as necessary and discontinued temporarily if hemoglobin was over 13 g/dL. 71

Over the 6 months of follow‐up, the mean monthly iron dose declined from 310 mg to 97 mg (P = 0.0003)(Figure 1), mean serum ferritin decreased from 948 ± 1056 to 571 ± 424 μg/L (P = 0.0001) and transferrin saturation decreased from 42% ± 22 to 33% ± 14 (P = 0.01) (Figure 2). Most importantly, hemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the study (11.1 g/dL ± 1.05 vs 11.0 g/dL ± 1.2, P = 0.54) as did the ESA dosage (126 μg/28 days ± 92 vs 108 μg/28 days ± 113, P = 0.07) (Figure 2).

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^116FymGj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron binding capacity — by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the per cent of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron and TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L (which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory activation), the diagnosis of ID is more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal/slightly increased intracellular iron stores and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells (reduced Tsat < 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia (thresholds), BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to view ferritin levels of 30–100 mcg/L with a low transferrin saturation (< 20%) as indicative of possible iron depletion or deficiency in the context of inflammation that may benefit from iron supplementation.

Transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) — key diagnostic parameters: transferrin normal values can vary between 200 and 400 mg/dL, and TSAT reflects iron availability with normal transferrin saturation ranging from 16% to 45%; a saturation below 16% indicates suboptimal iron for erythropoiesis and levels above 50% suggest iron overload. TSAT performance for iron deficiency shows sensitivity of 50% to 88% and specificity of 63% to 78%. TIBC is the amount of iron needed to saturate plasma transferrin and, while high in functional or true iron deficiency, has reported diagnostic sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 97%.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.
