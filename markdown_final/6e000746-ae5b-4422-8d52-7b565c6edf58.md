## Question

If both atria are dilated and ventricules are normal, is it called dilated cardiomyopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether isolated biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles is considered dilated cardiomyopathy, and if not, what the correct diagnosis and workup should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of dilated cardiomyopathy and whether it requires ventricular dilation or dysfunction. Then, I should verify whether atrial enlargement alone can qualify as a cardiomyopathy and which entities specifically describe that phenotype. Next, I will review the differential diagnoses that can present with biatrial enlargement and normal ventricles, including restrictive cardiomyopathy, isolated atrial cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia-induced remodeling. Finally, I will outline a practical, guideline-based diagnostic approach and synthesize a clear conclusion with next steps.

> Let me first confirm the definition of dilated cardiomyopathy so I don't jump to conclusions. Contemporary definitions consistently require left ventricular or biventricular dilation and/or systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or ischemia sufficient to explain the remodeling, and some modern statements also include hypokinetic non-dilated cardiomyopathy as part of the DCM spectrum, but none accept isolated atrial enlargement without ventricular involvement as DCM [^115JSDer] [^113KFJA7].

> Wait, let me verify the ventricular requirement more explicitly. The Lancet review emphasizes LV or biventricular dilation or systolic dysfunction as the core phenotype, and the ESC working group similarly anchors DCM in ventricular abnormalities, while recognizing early hypokinetic non-dilated disease. Neither source permits a diagnosis of DCM based on atrial enlargement alone with normal ventricles, so isolated biatrial enlargement does not meet DCM criteria [^115JSDer] [^115hJxk6].

> Hold on, I should consider whether there is a recognized entity for primary atrial disease. The EHRA/HRS consensus defines atrial cardiomyopathy as structural, architectural, contractile, or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria with potential clinical manifestations, and it explicitly notes that although some processes may selectively affect the atria, most cardiomyopathies that involve the atria also involve the ventricles to some degree; isolated atrial cardiomyopathy does exist but is uncommon and often genetic, with atrial enlargement and arrhythmias as predominant features [^111Zo7ef] [^112nnM4w].

> I need to check the restrictive cardiomyopathy angle because RCM frequently shows marked biatrial enlargement with nondilated ventricles. Modern RCM definitions hinge on persistent restrictive physiology with nondilated ventricles and prominent atrial enlargement; importantly, restrictive filling on a single study is insufficient, and persistence should be confirmed on serial evaluations to avoid misclassification due to transient hemodynamics, so biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles can be the RCM phenotype when restrictive physiology is documented [^113RhCaA].

> But wait, what if the atrial enlargement is secondary to arrhythmia rather than a primary myocardial disorder. Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy can be ventricular or atrial in origin; chronic tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter can drive atrial remodeling and enlargement, and in some cases the ventricles remain preserved early on, so I should confirm rhythm history and burden before labeling this as primary atrial disease [^111wdK2k] [^111pt3zp].

> Let me think about the differential more broadly so I don't miss mimics. Valvular disease with chronic volume overload, longstanding hypertension with concentric remodeling and secondary atrial enlargement, congenital heart disease such as an atrial septal defect, and systemic infiltrative or inflammatory diseases can all produce biatrial enlargement with relatively normal ventricles at early stages, so I should systematically exclude these before concluding there is a primary atrial cardiomyopathy or early restrictive disease [^111ZAwdk].

> Next, I should review a guideline-based diagnostic approach to keep this clinically actionable. The ESC cardiomyopathy guidelines recommend a multiparametric evaluation including detailed clinical history, pedigree analysis, ECG, ambulatory rhythm monitoring, laboratory testing, and multimodality imaging with echocardiography and, when indicated, cardiac MRI to define structure, function, tissue characterization, and coronary anatomy; restrictive physiology should be confirmed on serial studies, and genetic testing is reasonable when features suggest heritable disease or conduction system involvement [^112r82Va] [^117AGPp8] [^116M2ya9] [^113RhCaA] [^117DEg1k].

> I should double-check the imaging priorities. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to quantify atrial size, ventricular dimensions and systolic function, and Doppler patterns of diastolic filling; cardiac MRI adds tissue characterization, detection of fibrosis, and superior atrial and ventricular volumetrics, which can help distinguish restrictive pathophysiology and uncover infiltrative or fibrotic substrates that explain biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles [^117AGPp8] [^111ZAwdk].

> Let me reconsider the rhythm piece because it changes management. If atrial fibrillation or flutter is present with a high burden, I should treat the arrhythmia aggressively and reassess atrial size and ventricular function after rhythm control or rate optimization. Improvement in atrial size and function with arrhythmia suppression would support an arrhythmia-related atrial cardiomyopathy rather than a fixed structural myopathy [^111wdK2k] [^111pt3zp].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Isolated biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles does not meet the definition of dilated cardiomyopathy, which requires LV or biventricular dilation and/or systolic dysfunction. Instead, this phenotype should prompt evaluation for restrictive cardiomyopathy with confirmed persistent restrictive physiology, isolated atrial cardiomyopathy particularly when genetic or arrhythmic, or secondary atrial remodeling from chronic tachyarrhythmias or other systemic causes, using a structured, guideline-directed workup to establish etiology and guide therapy [^115JSDer] [^113KFJA7] [^113RhCaA] [^111Zo7ef] [^112r82Va].

No, isolated biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles is **not dilated cardiomyopathy** [^115JSDer]. DCM is defined by **ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction** [^113KFJA7] in the absence of abnormal loading or ischemia [^115JSDer]. Biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles suggests an **atrial cardiomyopathy** [^111Zo7ef] or an alternative diagnosis such as restrictive cardiomyopathy [^113RhCaA], valvular disease, or chronic atrial arrhythmias [^111pt3zp]. Accurate diagnosis requires echocardiography [^117AGPp8], cardiac MRI [^113gAwpX], and exclusion of secondary causes [^113gAwpX].

## Definition and diagnostic criteria of dilated cardiomyopathy

DCM is characterized by **ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction** [^113KFJA7], typically with LVEF < 50% [^1112UjPA], and is diagnosed after excluding abnormal loading conditions (e.g. valvular disease, hypertension) and ischemic heart disease [^115JSDer]. Key features include:

- **LV dilation**: Increased LV end-diastolic volume/diameter [^115LhXhU].
- **Systolic dysfunction**: Reduced LVEF [^114CSTPq].
- **Exclusion of secondary causes**: No significant valvular, hypertensive, or ischemic disease [^115JSDer].

---

## Clinical significance of isolated biatrial enlargement

Isolated biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles is **not consistent with DCM** and suggests other pathologies, such as:

- **Atrial cardiomyopathy**: Primary atrial structural/electrical changes with minimal ventricular involvement [^111Zo7ef] [^112nnM4w].
- **Restrictive cardiomyopathy**: Normal ventricular size with impaired filling and biatrial enlargement [^113RhCaA].
- **Valvular heart disease**: Chronic mitral or tricuspid regurgitation causing atrial enlargement [^notfound].
- **Chronic atrial arrhythmias**: Persistent AF or flutter leading to atrial remodeling [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach to isolated biatrial enlargement

A **structured evaluation** is essential to determine etiology and guide management:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Role in evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Echocardiography | - Assess atrial size <br/> - Ventricular size/function <br/> - Valves <br/> - Diastolic function [^117AGPp8] |
| Cardiac MRI | - Tissue characterization <br/> - Fibrosis <br/> - Exclude infiltrative/ischemic disease [^115fQJNf] |
| Electrocardiography | - Rhythm disorders <br/> - Conduction disease <br/> - LV hypertrophy [^116xMg3Q] |
| Laboratory tests | - Thyroid <br/> - Renal <br/> - Liver function <br/> - Autoimmune serologies [^1112UjPA] |
| Genetic testing | Consider if familial or early-onset disease suspected [^117DEg1k] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Atrial cardiomyopathy**: Treat arrhythmias, anticoagulation for AF, and address risk factors [^111xeA5D].
- **Restrictive cardiomyopathy**: Manage heart failure, treat underlying cause, and consider transplantation [^113VRbbf].
- **Valvular disease**: Surgical or transcatheter intervention as indicated [^112wcP7j].
- **Chronic atrial arrhythmias**: Rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation [^115sfDAr].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by etiology. Atrial cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause **significant morbidity** — notably atrial arrhythmias and thromboembolism [^notfound] — whereas valvular disease prognosis depends on lesion severity and intervention timing [^notfound]. Chronic atrial arrhythmias carry an increased risk of stroke and heart failure [^notfound].

---

Isolated biatrial enlargement with normal ventricles is **not DCM**; it indicates an alternative diagnosis such as atrial cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, or chronic atrial arrhythmias. A **comprehensive workup** — echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and exclusion of secondary causes — is required to define etiology and direct management [^117AGPp8] [^115fQJNf] [^1112UjPA].

LMNA (lamin A/C)-related dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a life-threatening condition arising from penetrant LMNA gene variants that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The estimated prevalence of DCM is 1:250 to 1:2500, with ≈35% of cases being familial. Among adult-onset DCM cases, LMNA variants have been identified in ≈0.5% to 5% of patients and are associated with a high risk of arrhythmias and progression to heart failure (HF). The typical onset of LMNA -related DCM is around 30 to 40 years, commonly presenting with atrioventricular conduction disease and atrial arrhythmias that later progress to DCM, ventricular arrhythmias that are poorly correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and refractory HF. Sudden cardiac death may be the presenting symptom in some patients. – One study showed that, by the age of 45 years, 69% of patients with symptomatic LMNA -related DCM had experienced a major cardiac event, received a heart transplant, or died.

### Genetic atrial cardiomyopathies: common features, specific differences, and broader relevance to understanding atrial cardiomyopathy [^112nnM4w]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atrial cardiomyopathy is a condition that causes electrical and contractile dysfunction of the atria, often along with structural and functional changes. Atrial cardiomyopathy most commonly occurs in conjunction with ventricular dysfunction, in which case it is difficult to discern the atrial features that are secondary to ventricular dysfunction from those that arise as a result of primary atrial abnormalities. Isolated atrial cardiomyopathy (atrial-selective cardiomyopathy [ASCM], with minimal or no ventricular function disturbance) is relatively uncommon and has most frequently been reported in association with deleterious rare genetic variants. The genes involved can affect proteins responsible for various biological functions, not necessarily limited to the heart but also involving extracardiac tissues. Atrial enlargement and atrial fibrillation are common complications of ASCM and are often the predominant clinical features. Despite progress in identifying disease-causing rare variants, an overarching understanding and approach to the molecular pathogenesis, phenotypic spectrum, and treatment of genetic ASCM is still lacking. In this review, we aim to analyze the literature relevant to genetic ASCM to understand the key features of this rather rare condition, as well as to identify distinct characteristics of ASCM and its arrhythmic complications that are related to specific genotypes. We outline the insights that have been gained using basic research models of genetic ASCM in vitro and in vivo and correlate these with patient outcomes. Finally, we provide suggestions for the future investigation of patients with genetic ASCM and improvements to basic scientific models and systems. Overall, a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of ASCM will not only provide a better understanding of this condition but also promises to clarify our appreciation of the more commonly occurring forms of atrial cardiomyopathy associated with ventricular dysfunction.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — management notes that radiofrequency ablation is reportedly successful in reducing PVC burden in patients with LV dysfunction, improving ventricular function in both structurally normal and abnormal hearts, and PVC radiofrequency ablation in patients with LV dysfunction improves LV dilatation, mitral regurgitation, and EF. PVC suppression with antiarrhythmic drugs typically has been associated with increased mortality; however, in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, antiarrhythmic drugs, including β-blockers, have been reported to be successful. Typically, PVCs are not suppressed unless they are symptomatic; however, because improvement in EF can be seen in those with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, consideration can be given to those with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause and a high burden of PVCs, although this has not been studied prospectively. Radiofrequency ablation can be effective in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (Level of Evidence B).

### Results of comprehensive diagnostic work-up in' idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy [^113PdjFJ]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterised by left ventricular dilation and dysfunction in the absence of coronary disease, valvular disease or hypertension. Approximately 20% of admittances for decompensated heart failure are due to dilated cardiomyopathy, which probably represents the end-stage phenotype of almost any kind of global insult to the myocardium. Accordingly, the list of potential causes of dilated cardiomyopathy is long. The diagnostic work-up is usually limited to physical examination, blood tests, echocardiography and coronary angiography. More often than not, these tests fail to reveal the aetiology of the disease, and the patients are diagnosed with 'idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy. They then receive generic treatment for heart failure, leaving the question of causality unanswered and the potential for tailored treatment unmet in a disease with high mortality and morbidity.

Outcome in dilated cardiomyopathy depends on aetiology. Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by systemic inflammatory disease requires specific treatment, and some causes of dilated cardiomyopathy predispose to malignant arrhythmia, strengthening the indication for cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Identification of a heritable cause allows for family screening, possibly allowing for early phenotype detection and appropriate treatment. Establishing the aetiology may thus influence the way we inform and treat patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

In a seminal paper by Felker et al, an endomyocardial biopsy identified the underlying cause in 15% of patients referred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for diagnostic evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy. Over the recent years, imaging techniques have improved, and techniques for detecting monogenetic and viral causes have been introduced. The value of employing each of these modalities in patients with initially unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy, and in particular the value of a comprehensive, multimodality work-up, has not been systematically investigated. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield and therapeutic consequences of a multimodality diagnostic investigation, beyond physical examination, echocardiography, coronary angiography and blood tests, in a contemporary cohort of patients with 'idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy. We assumed that a thorough diagnostic evaluation would yield an aetiological diagnosis in a substantial number of patients, with considerable impact on therapeutic and follow-up strategies.

### Clinical significance of left atrial geometry in dilated cardiomyopathy patients: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study [^114CSTPq]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a myocardial disease typically diagnosed by impaired left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and LV dilation. 1 Guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) improved the prognosis of patients with DCM. 2 However, some patients with DCM still have poor outcomes. 3, 4 It is important to reveal the factors that predict the prognosis to determine appropriate GDMT in patients with DCM.

The roles of the left atrium include modulating LV filling and cardiovascular performance by functioning as a reservoir for pulmonary venous return during ventricular systole, serving as a conduit for pulmonary venous return during early ventricular diastole, and providing a booster pump that augments ventricular filling during late ventricular diastole. 5 Left atrial (LA) enlargement is associated with cardiac events in patients with LV diastolic dysfunction 6 and atrial fibrillation. 7 LA enlargement is also associated with cardiac events in patients with DCM. 8 However, the clinical significance of LA function and geometry in patients with DCM remains uncertain. 9 To our knowledge, although the previous study has found that the LV sphericity index was prognostic predictor in patients with DCM, 10 there is no paper on the sphericity of the left atrium in patients with DCM. We believed that LA function and geometric change, especially spherical change, might be related to prognosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a suitable modality for investigating the properties, functions, and geometry. In addition, CMR is the current gold standard modality to assess LA function and geometry. 11, 12 Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the prognosis and LA parameters assessed by CMR in patients with DCM.

### EHRA / HRS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus on atrial cardiomyopathies: definition, characterization, and clinical implication [^111Zo7ef]. Europace (2016). Medium credibility.

EHRA/HRS/APHRS/SOLAECE consensus — definition and scope of atrial cardiomyopathy — highlights that the atria contribute importantly to cardiac function and are affected by many cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, with atrial cells reacting briskly to pathological stimuli and showing responses such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, contractile dysfunction, arrhythmogenic ion‑channel/transporter changes, fibroblast proliferation, hyperinnervation, and thrombogenic changes. The report notes the prior lack of a detailed definition and sets the purpose to define atrial cardiomyopathy, review relevant literature, and consider impacts on arrhythmia management and stroke. The working group proposes the definition: "Any complex of structural, architectural, contractile or electrophysiological changes affecting the atria with the potential to produce clinically-relevant manifestations". It further states that many diseases or conditions can induce or contribute to an atrial cardiomyopathy, that induced changes are not necessarily disease‑specific, that the extent of changes varies over time and location, that although some processes may affect the atria selectively most cardiomyopathies that affect the atria also involve the ventricles to a greater or lesser extent, and that there is no presently accepted histopathological classification of atrial pathologies.

Summary of dilated cardiomyopathy — dilated cardiomyopathy is an important cause of heart failure with a common phenotype of ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance, and its pathogenesis varies significantly across metabolic, endocrine, autoimmune, rheumatologic, infiltrative, genetic, infectious, and cardiotoxin causes. Demographics and treatment also vary significantly according to the cause. Treatment should be individualized and should target the underlying cause, in addition to the standard systolic heart failure therapies. In certain cases, with elimination of the cause and the appropriate treatment, reversal of myocardial remodeling and recovery of cardiac dysfunction can occur. Future studies targeting specific cardiomyopathies will be critical for detection and treatment of specific cardiomyopathies.

### EMD missense variant causes X-linked isolated dilated cardiomyopathy with myocardial emerin deficiency [^116dg1M6]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study provides new support for an association between the EMD gene and DCM without muscular dystrophy, by presenting evidence of co-segregation in a large family, emerin deficiency in the myocardium and skeletal muscle, and normal neuromuscular examinations.

Currently, the EMD gene is only established as causative for DCM as a feature of EDMD1. However, DCM is rarely seen in EDMD1 and the cardiac phenotype is generally dominated by atrial pathology due to fibroadipose tissue remodeling of the atria. This results in atrial enlargement, predominantly of the right atrium, as well as atrial arrhythmias and cardiac conduction defects in the second and third decade, which progress to atrial stand-still in the fourth. In general, ventricular dilatation is less severe and precedes ventricular arrhythmias which develop in the sixth decade. Importantly, even in EDMD1 cases with mild or no neuromuscular symptoms, the cardiac phenotype is usually consistent, with predominantly atrial pathology.

Our results indicate that isolated DCM might be a separate EMD phenotype, as opposed to an instance of phenotypical variability. Firstly, neuromuscular symptoms were completely absent in all six males harboring the EMD variant c.23C > G. Detailed neuromuscular examination in adulthood excluded even subtle signs of muscular dystrophy, which was emphasized by normal skeletal muscle morphology on histopathological examination. Secondly, the progression of cardiac symptoms in the six affected males differed from that of EDMD1. The atrial pathology in the transplanted males, with predominantly left-sided dilatation and atrial fibrillation and flutter, was considered secondary to ventricular dilatation, and no early atrial manifestations were present in the three males who had not reached end-stage DCM.

Instead, the cardiac phenotype was characterized by severe arrhythmogenic DCM with onset in the fourth or fifth decade in males. In one affected male, V:24, disease progression was documented 8 years before DCM diagnosis. He initially showed an ischemic LGE pattern on CMRI and a high frequency of PVCs and nsVT on ECG, several years before dilatation of the left ventricle, corresponding to non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy preceding DCM development. Given the ischemic pattern of LGE, early stages of disease progression could easily be misdiagnosed as ischemic cardiomyopathy, emphasizing the need for coronary angiography and for the clinician to be alert to differential diagnoses. Myocardial fibrosis was also seen in the two other affected males examined with CMRI, including septal intramural LGE which has been associated with greater arrhythmic risk than other patterns. Furthermore, malignant ventricular arrhythmias were prominent in one male and the family history revealed several cases of suspected SCD.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — cardiac assessment imaging and echocardiographic parameters: Cardiac imaging should be performed to assess the presence and extent of LV dysfunction, to assess dilatation, and to evaluate for intracardiac thrombus, with echocardiography most commonly used to evaluate suspected PPCM and demonstrate characteristic structural and hemodynamic abnormalities. Proposed strict echocardiographic parameters included EF < 45% or fractional shortening < 30% and increased LV end-diastolic dimension > 2.7 cm/m², and although evidence of systolic dysfunction is necessary for generally accepted PPCM diagnosis, LV enlargement is not required.

Atrial fibrillation with associated heart disease — specific cardiovascular conditions associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) include valvular heart disease (most often, mitral valve disease), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension, particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is present; AF may also be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy, or congenital heart disease (especially atrial septal defect in adults), with additional potential etiologies such as restrictive cardiomyopathies (including amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and endomyocardial fibrosis), cardiac tumors, and constrictive pericarditis; other heart diseases include mitral valve prolapse with or without mitral regurgitation, calcification of the mitral annulus, and idiopathic dilation of the right atrium (RA), and AF is commonly encountered in patients with sleep apnea syndrome.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^115JSDer]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is conventionally defined as the presence of left ventricular or biventricular dilatation or systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions (eg, primary valve disease) or significant coronary artery disease sufficient to cause ventricular remodelling. This definition has been recognised as overly restrictive, as left ventricular hypokinesis without dilation could be the initial presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy. The causes of dilated cardiomyopathy comprise genetic (primary dilated cardiomyopathy) or acquired factors (secondary dilated cardiomyopathy). Acquired factors include infections, toxins, cancer treatment, endocrinopathies, pregnancy, tachyarrhythmias, and immune-mediated diseases. 5–15% of patients with acquired dilated cardiomyopathy harbour a likely pathogenic or pathogenic gene variant (ie, gene mutation). Therefore, the diagnostic tests and therapeutic approach should always consider both genetic and acquired factors. This Seminar will focus on the current multidimensional diagnostic and therapeutic approach and discuss the underlying pathophysiology that could drive future treatments aiming to repair or replace the existing gene mutation, or target the specific inflammatory, metabolic, or pro-fibrotic drivers of genetic or acquired dilated cardiomyopathy.

### Atrial cardiomyopathy: a useful notion in cardiac disease management or a passing fad? [^111nbMo2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The term atrial cardiomyopathy, which has been used sporadically in the medical literature, was recently the subject of a detailed Consensus Document prepared by representatives of the European Heart Rhythm Association, Heart Rhythm Society, Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, and Sociedad Latinoamericana de Estimulación Cardiaca y Electrofisiología. They discussed aspects of the definition, histopathology, atrial-specific physiology, atrial pathology, impact on arrhythmia occurrence, imaging, mapping, and ablation. Here, the authors consider critically the added clinical value of this concept and its meaningfulness. They review evidence implicating atrial cardiomyopathy as an independent contributor to the risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation and as a determinant of arrhythmia progression. The issue of classification is considered and the authors discuss how atrial cardiomyopathic properties might guide stroke prevention, rhythm maintenance, and rate control in atrial fibrillation. Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate these potential applications, and will ultimately define the value of this terminology.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: causes, mechanisms, and current and future treatment approaches [^116x9AJc]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dilated cardiomyopathy:

- **Definition**: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heart disease characterized by LV dilation and contractile dysfunction, leading to cardiac remodeling and ultimately HF.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy involves myocardial damage and dysfunction, leading to ventricular dilation and impaired contractility. This results in secondary neurohormonal changes that contribute to reverse remodeling and ongoing myocyte damage.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy globally is estimated at 0.00029 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for dilated cardiomyopathy include a family history of the condition, as genetic mutations account for up to 35% of cases. Other risk factors include myocarditis, exposure to alcohol, drugs and toxins, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, dilated cardiomyopathy presents with symptoms related to congestive HF, such as fatigue, breathlessness, and edema. It can also cause circulatory collapse, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present acutely with decompensated HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy varies, with the worst outcomes seen in individuals with the lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction.

### Evolving concepts in dilated cardiomyopathy [^114dZAa6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a particular aetiology of systolic heart failure that frequently has a genetic background and usually affects young patients with few co-morbidities. The prognosis of DCM has improved substantially during the last decades due to more accurate aetiological characterization, the red-flag integrated approach to the disease, early diagnosis through systematic familial screening, and the concept of DCM as a dynamic disease requiring constant optimization of medical and non-pharmacological evidence-based treatments. However, some important issues in clinical management remain unresolved, including the role of cardiac magnetic resonance for diagnosis and risk categorization and the interaction between genotype and clinical phenotype, and arrhythmic risk stratification. This review offers a comprehensive survey of these and other emerging issues in the clinical management of DCM, providing where possible practical recommendations.

### State of the art: multimodality imaging in dilated cardiomyopathy [^113gAwpX]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy represents a common phenotype expressed in individuals with a family of overlapping myocardial diseases due to acquired and/or genetic susceptibility. Disease trajectory, response to therapy and outcomes vary widely; therefore, further refinement of the diagnosis can help guide therapy and inform prognosis. Multimodality imaging plays a key role in this process, as well as excluding alternative causes which may mimic a primary myocardial disease. The following article discusses the role of different imaging modalities as well as what the future may look like in the context of recent research innovations.

### An adult with a sinus venosus atrial septal defect and dilated cardiomyopathy [^115mxSrr]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure and atrial septal defects are well-recognised entities in isolation, but are rarely seen together. Now that 90% of children with congenital heart disease survive into adulthood, such combinations of disease are increasingly seen in adult cardiology. While most young patients with dilated cardiomyopathy respond well to medical therapy, some do not, and require more invasive management. We describe a 32 year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy and a sinus venosus-type atrial septal defect associated with a remarkable pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 5:1. We propose that the atrial septal defect blunted his heart failure symptoms by serving as a 'pop-off' valve and limiting pulmonary congestion. The patient ultimately failed medical management and received a left ventricular assist device. The case is presented along with a discussion of this unique pathophysiology and a brief review of the literature in this rapidly evolving field.

### Cardiomyopathy: an overview [^113VRbbf]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The definition and classification of cardiomyopathy have evolved considerably in recent years. Cardiomyopathy can be separated into primary (genetic, mixed, or acquired) and secondary categories, which result in varied phenotypes including dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive patterns. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common primary cardiomyopathy and can cause exertional dyspnea, presyncope, atypical chest pain, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Dilated cardiomyopathy can be genetic or acquired and typically presents with classic symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is much less common and often associated with systemic disease. Family physicians should be alert for acquired variants of cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, as well as rare variants, such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia and left ventricular noncompaction. In addition to history and physical examination, diagnosis of cardiomyopathy includes electrocardiography and echocardiography testing. Treatment may include appropriately staged therapy for heart failure, appropriate activity restriction, evaluation for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement, and consideration of heart transplantation in refractory cases. Genetic testing of families is an emerging modality with some potential to augment traditional screening performed by family physicians.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115hJxk6]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Definition of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — dilated cardiomyopathy refers to heterogeneous myocardial disorders characterized by ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial performance in the absence of hypertension, valvular, congenital, or ischemic heart disease. In clinical practice, the pathogenesis of heart failure is often placed into ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and the term nonischemic cardiomyopathy has been interchangeably used with DCM, but this approach fails to recognize nonischemic cardiomyopathies caused by volume or pressure overload that are not conventionally accepted under the definition of DCM. In general practice and clinical trials, ischemic cardiomyopathy is defined as cardiomyopathy caused by ischemic heart disease, and current use of this terminology implies ventricular dilation and depressed myocardial contractility caused by ischemia or infarction.

### Atrial cardiomyopathy: from healthy atria to atrial failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^111xeA5D]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The importance of atrial cardiomyopathy (AtCM) as a specific clinical entity is increasingly recognized. Past definitions have varied, and the lack of consistent cut-offs for imaging parameters and biomarkers have limited clinical utility to diagnose and track AtCM progression. While research has mainly focused on AtCM in the context of atrial fibrillation, emerging evidence underscores its relevance in remodelling and development of heart failure. The aim of this consensus document was to provide a contemporary framework for AtCM, evolve the definitions of AtCM and atrial failure for more widespread clinical use, and help to direct emerging research and future clinical trials. Supporting the work of early career researchers, this consensus document evaluates diagnostic markers and summarizes the underpinning mechanisms, clinical characteristics and prognostic impact of AtCM. Our objective was to bring together new translational scientific progress, catalyse future research and enable clinical application to facilitate better management, for example in patient groups where aggressive control of risk factors or comorbidities could prevent AtCM progression. We redefined AtCM as a graded disorder that includes electrical dysfunction of the atria along with evidence of either mechanical atrial dysfunction, atrial enlargement and/or atrial fibrosis. Atrial failure is the end-stage manifestation of AtCM, characterized by progressive structural, electrophysiological and functional changes. Earlier identification, risk stratification and ongoing research into therapeutic options have the potential to prevent the clinical consequences of AtCM and atrial failure, including adverse patient outcomes and poor quality of life associated with atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy: from epidemiologic to genetic phenotypes: a translational review of current literature [^111cXyLG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by left ventricular dilatation and, consecutively, contractile dysfunction. The causes of DCM are heterogeneous. DCM often results from myocarditis, exposure to alcohol, drugs or other toxins and metabolic or endocrine disturbances. In about 35% of patients, genetic mutations can be identified that usually involve genes responsible for cytoskeletal, sarcomere and nuclear envelope proteins. Due to its heterogeneity, a detailed diagnostic work-up is necessary to identify the specific underlying cause and exclude other conditions with phenotype overlap. Patients with DCM show typical systolic heart failure symptoms, but, with progress of the disease, diastolic dysfunction is present as well. Depending on the underlying pathology, DCM patients also become apparent through arrhythmias, thromboembolic events or cardiogenic shock. Disease progression and prognosis are mostly driven by disease severity and reverse remodelling within the heart. The worst prognosis is seen in patients with lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction, leading to terminal heart failure with subsequent need for left ventricular assist device implantation or heart transplantation. Guideline-based heart failure medication and device therapy reduces the frequency of heart failure hospitalizations and improves survival.

### Clinical features of the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in comparison with those of dilated cardiomyopathy [^112MitUK]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (D-HCM) characterized by left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and cavity dilatation has been reported to be a poor prognosis, this is now in contrast to the improved prognosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the era of advancements in heart failure management. There has been no investigation of the clinical features of D-HCM compared with those of DCM from the point of management of systolic dysfunction.

Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features of D-HCM in comparison with those of DCM in a single institute.

Methods

We studied 20 consecutive patients with D-HCM (global ejection fraction < 50%) and 115 consecutive patients with DCM.

Results

At diagnosis of D-HCM, 8 (40%) of the D-HCM patients already experienced dyspnea (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≥ III). Left atrial diameter was larger and prevalence of atrial fibrillation was higher in the D-HCM group, although LV size was larger and LV ejection fraction was lower in the DCM group. During the follow-up period (4.0 years), 11 (55%) of the patients with D-HCM died. The 5-year survival rate from all-cause mortality including cardiac transplantation was 45.6% in patients with D-HCM vs 81.6% in patients with DCM (log-rank P = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Patients with D-HCM were more symptomatic at diagnosis, although LV dilatation and impaired fractional shortening seemed more severe in patients with DCM. The prognosis for D-HCM patients was worse than that for patients with DCM despite similar or even more intensive treatment for heart failure.

The clinical calculator "ESC diagnostic criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy in relatives" for dilated cardiomyopathy.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) diagnostic criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy in relatives is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy in family members of patients with known disease. The tool is particularly useful in identifying individuals who may be at risk of developing the disease, allowing for early intervention and management.

The ESC diagnostic criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy in relatives incorporates both major and minor criteria. Major criteria include an unexplained decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50% but > 45% and unexplained left ventricular end-diastolic dilatation according to nomograms. Minor criteria encompass a range of cardiac abnormalities such as complete left bundle branch block, unexplained ventricular arrhythmia, segmental wall motion abnormalities in the left ventricle, late enhancement of nonischemic origin on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, evidence of nonischemic myocardial abnormalities on endomyocardial biopsy, and presence of serum organ-specific and disease-specific anti-heart antibodies. Additionally, carrying the causative mutation identified in the proband is also considered.

The score is determined by the presence of these criteria, with a higher score indicating a higher likelihood of disease. A score of ≥ 7 is indicative of probable disease, while a score of ≥ 2 suggests possible disease. If the score does not meet these thresholds, the diagnostic criteria are not met.

The diagnostic tool for assessing dilated cardiomyopathy in relatives involves evaluating several clinical criteria through yes/no questions, each contributing to a calculated score.

Here's how it breaks down:

Responses to the following conditions are assessed:

- Unexplained decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 50% or less but above 45%
- Unexplained dilation of the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension or volume exceeding normal by more than 2 standard deviations plus 5%
- Existence of complete left bundle branch block or atrioventricular block with PR interval over 200 ms
- Unexplained ventricular arrhythmia characterized by over 100 premature beats per hour or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
- Segmental wall motion abnormalities in the absence of intraventricular conduction issues
- Late enhancement without ischemic origin on cardiac MRI
- Evidence of inflammation, necrosis, or fibrosis on endomyocardial biopsy not associated with ischemia
- Presence of serum-specific anti-heart antibodies

Each "yes" response contributes a specific point value to the total score:

- LVEF decrease and ventricular dilation both score 6 points.
- The remaining criteria each add 1 point for a "yes".

A simple scoring mechanism compiles the total points from the user's responses. The total score then reflects the likelihood of disease presence:

- A score of 7 or higher signals "Probable disease", indicating a strong likelihood of dilated cardiomyopathy.
- A score ranging from 2 to 6 suggests "Possible disease", indicating a moderate likelihood.
- A score below 2 means the "Diagnostic criteria are not met", suggesting insufficient evidence for diagnosis.

This process aligns medical data with a quantitative method for estimating disease probability through straightforward user input, providing clear insights into potential dilated cardiomyopathy in relatives.

### The electrocardiogram in the diagnosis and management of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^116xMg3Q]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The term dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) defines a heterogeneous group of cardiac disorders, which are characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. In approximately one third of cases, DCM is familial with a genetic pathogenesis and various patterns of inheritance. Although the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been considered traditionally non-specific in DCM, the recently acquired knowledge of the genotype-phenotype correlations provides novel opportunities to identify patterns and abnormalities that may point toward specific DCM subtypes. A learned ECG interpretation in combination with an appropriate use of other ECG-based techniques including ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise tolerance test and imaging modalities, such as echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, may allow the early identification of specific genetic or acquired forms of DCM. Furthermore, ECG abnormalities may reflect the severity of the disease and provide a useful tool in risk stratification and management. In the present review, we discuss the current role of the ECG in the diagnosis and management of DCM. We describe various clinical settings where the appropriate use and interpretation of the ECG can provide invaluable clues, contributing to the important role of this basic tool as cardiovascular medicine evolves.

### Results of comprehensive diagnostic work-up in' idiopathic' dilated cardiomyopathy [^117BfgPQ]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In our cohort of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, in whom patient history and routine work-up carried no clues to the aetiology of their disease, the diagnostic and therapeutic yield of extensive additional testing was moderate. Testing for monogenic causes established possible aetiology in 10% of cases. Cardiac MRI should probably be considered in selected cases guided by patient history, or when echocardiographic assessment is difficult due to poor sonographic imaging conditions. Our results support a restrictive use of endomyocardial biopsy.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^111iA6Po].

Mitral E/A ratio — mitral inflow E/A ratio and deceleration time (DT) are used to identify filling patterns (normal, impaired relaxation, PN, and restrictive filling); it is feasible and reproducible, provides diagnostic and prognostic information, and in dilated cardiomyopathy correlates better with filling pressures, functional class, and prognosis than LVEF, with restrictive filling plus left atrial dilation in patients with normal ejection fractions associated with poor prognosis; limitations are a U-shaped relation with LV diastolic function that complicates differentiating normal from PN without additional variables, reduction in E/A when mitral flow velocity at the start of atrial contraction is > 20 cm/sec due to fusion, non-applicability in AF/atrial flutter, and age dependence with decreases with aging.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy [^113KFJA7]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and contractile dysfunction. Genetic mutations involving genes that encode cytoskeletal, sarcomere, and nuclear envelope proteins, among others, account for up to 35% of cases. Acquired causes include myocarditis and exposure to alcohol, drugs and toxins, and metabolic and endocrine disturbances. The most common presenting symptoms relate to congestive heart failure, but can also include circulatory collapse, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. Secondary neurohormonal changes contribute to reverse remodelling and ongoing myocyte damage. The prognosis is worst for individuals with the lowest ejection fractions or severe diastolic dysfunction. Treatment of chronic heart failure comprises medications that improve survival and reduce hospital admission-namely, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and β blockers. Other interventions include enrolment in a multidisciplinary heart failure service, and device therapy for arrhythmia management and sudden death prevention. Patients who are refractory to medical therapy might benefit from mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation. Treatment of preclinical disease and the potential role of stem-cell therapy are being investigated.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111pt3zp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias coexist in patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions are known to trigger a reversible dilated cardiomyopathy referred as arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AiCM). It remains unclear why some patients are more prone to develop AiCM despite similar arrhythmia burdens. The challenge is to determine whether arrhythmias are fully, partially, or at all responsible for an observed LV dysfunction. AiCM should be suspected in patients with mean heart rate > 100 beats/min, atrial fibrillation, and/or premature ventricular contractions burden ≥ 10%. Reversal of cardiomyopathy by elimination of the arrhythmia confirms AiCM. Therapeutic choice depends on the culprit arrhythmia, patient comorbidities, and preferences. Following recovery of LV function, patients require continued follow-up if an abnormal myocardial substrate is present. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of AiCM is likely to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes and to reduce hospital admission and health care spending.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1154Ee5z]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy — definition and pathophysiology — is a reversible cause of heart failure (HF) characterized by left ventricle (LV) myocardial dysfunction caused by increased ventricular rate, first described in 1913. The degree of dysfunction correlates with the duration and rate of the tachyarrhythmia, and reversibility with treatment of the arrhythmia is the rule, although this may not be complete in all cases. Virtually any supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid ventricular response can induce cardiomyopathy, and ventricular arrhythmias including frequent premature ventricular complexes can also induce cardiomyopathy; experimental models show detrimental cardiac effects of chronic atrial and ventricular pacing in dogs and pigs.

### Criterion for fetal primary spongiform cardiomyopathy: restrictive pathophysiology [^111SFGZD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Most cardiomyopathies recognizable in utero are the dilated type-with dilated, poorly contractile left ventricle. We propose a diagnostic criterion for the rare spongiform (noncompacted) cardiomyopathy.

Cases

Three perinatal cases with echocardiography and autopsy are presented. The apical ventricular myocardium was thickened and markedly trabeculated. The ventricles were not dilated in two, and the atria were enlarged in all. Hydrops and bradycardia were present in all three despite normal or only mildly diminished contractility. Although the cardiomyopathy was familial in two siblings, two of three cases were female, ruling out Barth syndrome (with sex-linked recessive inheritance). Although all three of our cases with hydrops died, rare survivors have been reported in the eighth decade.

Conclusion

Although spongiform cardiomyopathy may eventually develop into a dilated cardiomyopathy, its early characteristic is relatively diagnostic: a restrictive cardiomyopathy with no enlargement of the ventricles and prominent atria.

### The diagnosis and evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy [^112wcP7j]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is best understood as the final common response of myocardium to diverse genetic and environmental insults. A rigorous work-up can exclude alternative causes of left ventricular (LV) dilation and dysfunction, identify etiologies that may respond to specific treatments, and guide family screening. A significant proportion of DCM cases have an underlying genetic or inflammatory basis. Measurement of LV size and ejection fraction remain central to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment, but other aspects of cardiac remodeling inform prognosis and carry therapeutic implications. Assessment of myocardial fibrosis predicts both risk of sudden cardiac death and likelihood of LV functional recovery, and has significant potential to guide patient selection for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Detailed mitral valve assessment is likely to assume increasing importance with the emergence of percutaneous interventions for functional mitral regurgitation. Detection of pre-clinical DCM could substantially reduce morbidity and mortality by allowing early instigation of cardioprotective therapy.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111wdK2k]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias frequently accompany heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. Tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions can induce a reversible form of dilated cardiomyopathy (CM) known as arrhythmia-induced CM (AiCM). The intriguing question is why certain individuals are more susceptible to AiCM, despite similar arrhythmia burdens. The primary challenge is determining the extent of arrhythmias' contribution to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. AiCM should be considered in patients with a mean heart rate of > 100 beats/min, atrial fibrillation, or a PVC burden of > 10%. Confirmation of AiCM occurs when CM reverses upon eliminating the responsible arrhythmia. Therapy choice depends on the specific arrhythmia, patient comorbidities, and preferences. After left ventricular function is restored, ongoing follow-up is essential if an abnormal myocardial substrate persists. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of AiCM have the potential to enhance patients' quality of life, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce hospital admissions and overall health care costs.

Epidemiology and natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) — Determining the incidence and prevalence of DCMs has been challenging because of geographic variations, patient selection, and diagnostic criteria changes. In Olmsted County, MN, the incidence of idiopathic DCM, which is defined as a cardiomyopathy when the exact cause remains initially unknown, doubled from 3.9 per 100 000 person-years between 1975 and 1979 to 7.9 per 100 000 person-years between 1980 and 1984. In Sweden, the incidence of clinical and postmortem diagnoses remained 5 per 100 000 per year, where the autopsy rates were 90%. In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of DCM has been reported to be ≈36 cases per 100 000 population. In most multicenter randomized trials in heart failure (HF), ≈30% to 40% of the enrolled patients have nonischemic HF, and according to ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry), 47% of the patients admitted to the hospital with HF had nonischemic cardiomyopathy. DCM can occur at any age but most commonly occurs in the third or fourth decade of life, and advancing age is an independent risk factor for mortality in DCM.

Conclusions

The current classification of cardiomyopathies has deeply transformed our approach to the diagnosis of disease and has improved our understanding of this heterogeneous field. The attempt to dissect the heterogeneous variety of cardiomyopathies with a clinically relevant and feasible approach represents one of the hardest challenges of the contemporary era. Based on these premises, we carried out a critical revision of the current definition of RCM, starting from the ESC recommended approach, to shed light upon the grey zone of this cardiomyopathy model, following major advances in knowledge achieved over recent years.

The essence of RCM is the coexistence of persistent restrictive physiology, commonly with atrial dilatation, and nondilated ventricles, regardless of ventricular wall thickness and systolic function. A restrictive filling pattern on echocardiography at a single time is not sufficient to diagnose RCM, as this finding might result from transient haemodynamic alterations. Unlike the ventricular thickness and dilatation that define HCM and DCM, respectively, the restrictive filling pattern can be dynamic and reversible over short time intervals (i.e. severe congestion relieved with diuretics). Therefore, it would be reasonable to consider 'persistent' restrictive pathophysiology as the presence of a restrictive filling pattern on at least two repeated Doppler echocardiograms: (i) at clinical presentation and (ii) after an appropriate period (e.g. at least six months). In the time window between clinical presentation and confirmation of a persistent restrictive pathophysiology, patients might be defined as having a 'possible RCM', and undergo a search for the disease substrate. In general, we believe that a useful and clinically feasible classification based on cardiac phenotype on echocardiogram should simply provide a 'nosographic box' for each patient rather than a presumptive diagnosis. In this perspective, the identification of the predominant phenotype at presentation should be considered to classify patients in one of the following 'boxes': dilated phenotype, hypertrophic phenotype, or restrictive phenotype. This approach would provide a clinical guide but would also maintain a broad and open horizon of the possible final diagnosis. A clear example is provided by 'restrictive pathophysiology' which can be the very essence of cardiomyopathy (RCM) or an accompanying feature (HCM or DCM with restrictive pathophysiology). Patients with mild increases in ventricular wall thickness and restrictive filling pattern should be considered as possible RCM rather than HCM at first clinical evaluation, as the predominant feature is diastolic impairment. On the other hand, patients with severe increase in ventricular wall thickness and restrictive filling pattern should be considered as HCM with restrictive pathophysiology as 'cardiac hypertrophy' is the predominant feature. This approach might be reasonable and provide an initial nosographic box to classify patients without the claim that a definitive diagnosis can be made at the first clinical evaluation (Figure 5).

Left ventricular dilation in CA — initial chamber volume assessment should be performed using TTE, and among CA with suspected pathologic dilation, CMR should be performed to confirm dilation and to characterize structure and function; the magnitude of LV and LA dilation in CA cannot be used in isolation to differentiate EICR from pathology and integration of clinical history, myocardial function, and additional diagnostic testing are generally required; endurance-trained CA with corollary EICR may demonstrate mild reductions in LV ejection fraction (45–50%) with preserved resting stroke volume; low normal to mildly reduced (45–55%) LV ejection fractions in asymptomatic CA with LV dilation are common and can be considered physiologic when accompanied by normal indices of diastolic function and concomitant dilation of the RV and both atria; assessment of LA size in the context of LV dilation or hypertrophy is of limited value for differentiating heart disease from EICR because LA enlargement is extremely common among healthy CA.

Hyperthyroidism — hemodynamics and heart failure: Hyperthyroidism produces decreased systemic vascular resistance, increased resting heart rate and left ventricular (LV) contractility, and enhanced isovolumic ventricular relaxation, with circulating blood volume that can increase up to 25% and a cardiac output that is increased by up to 300% from a euthyroid state. Pulmonary artery hypertension is increasingly recognized in hyperthyroidism and may increase load on the right ventricle (RV), leading to RV dilatation and a rise in right atrial and central venous pressures. Occasionally, severe, long-standing hyperthyroidism has poor cardiac contractility, low cardiac output, and symptoms and signs of heart failure (HF), most often with persistent sinus tachycardia or rapid ventricular rates from atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter causing rate-related or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Prompt recognition and effective management in patients > 50 years of age are important because cardiovascular complications are the chief cause of death after treatment of hyperthyroidism.

DISCUSSION

Genotype‐phenotype correlations in familial DCM have largely focused on genotype effects, with phenotypic differences often considered to be attributes of the underlying disease genes. It has been proposed that patient‐specific factors that affect the myocardial milieu (ie, myocardial environmental factors) might influence genetically driven effects on ventricular function, but evidence for this has been lacking. Here, we provide compelling new data that clearly define a role for environmental factors in the variable penetrance and natural history of familial DCM. We identified 2 main groups of environmental factors that affect DCM onset and outcomes. Moreover, we show that there is a vulnerable period in the DCM disease trajectory in which myocardial function can be reversibly altered by changes in environmental exposures. Collectively, our data have important clinical implications, highlighting the key role of risk factor surveillance in family management.

On the basis of literature evidence, we dichotomized environmental risk factors into 2 main groups: DCM‐promoting factors and HF comorbidities. Differentiation between these 2 risk groups is highly relevant as there are distinctive causes, functional impacts, and consequences. The first group, DCM‐promoting factors, can directly impair ventricular function. Accordingly, we found that DCM‐promoting factors were relatively enriched in G+ individuals who had developed DCM. In our cohort, the most common DCM‐promoting factors were alcohol excess and atrial tachyarrhythmias. Both of these conditions may contribute to a DCM substrate with chronic exposure or acutely trigger ventricular decompensation with new DCM diagnoses or HF episodes. Atrial arrhythmias were included as a DCM‐promoting factor but are acknowledged to be part of the phenotypic spectrum of many DCM genotypes. Indeed, new evidence suggests that TTN tv produce an early tendency to atrial fibrillation. However, atrial arrhythmia was a common trigger for LV dysfunction in our cohort, and its management improved LV function, supporting its classification as a modifiable risk factor as well as a consequence of disease.

### MRI of the cardiomyopathies [^111ZAwdk]. European Journal of Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We examined the potentialities of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of the main cardiomyopathies: hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive and arrhythmogenic right ventricular. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is generally adequately investigated by echocardiography, that well defines the myocardial thickening and the obstruction of the left ventricular output. However, by echocardiography we still have difficulties in the evaluation of the apex of the left ventricle and the right ventricle involvement. MRI provides a complete evaluation of the heart with a clear evidence also of the echocardiographic dark zones by means of a clear evidence of the apex of the right ventricle. The dilated form is also well investigated by MRI that provides a clear evaluation of the volumes, mass and ejection fraction by means of the 3D analysis including conditions of the ventricular remodelling. Moreover, this technique helps in the differential diagnosis of acute myocarditis. In the acute phase of myocarditis (first 2 weeks), in fact, the myocardium produces high signal intensity on the T2 weighted sequences due to the presence of oedema. The third form of cardiomyopathy is the restrictive one, characterised by reduced diastolic filling and diastolic volume, normality of the systolic function and parietal thickness, interstitial fibrosis and enlargement of both atria. The mean potentiality of MRI is related to the differential diagnosis with constrictive pericarditis. Only in the former, the pericardium appears irregularly thickened with areas exceeding 4 mm of pericardial thickness. Finally, the right ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy represents the main indication to MRI evaluation. With this imaging modality we are can obtain a clear morpho-functional evaluation of the right ventricle and distinguish the intramyocardial adipose substitution characterised by areas of high signal in the myocardium.

### Persistent recovery of normal left ventricular function and dimension in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy during long ‐ term follow ‐ up: does real healing exist? [^112M4DKW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications and Conclusions

In optimally treated DCM, a remarkable number of patients (60% of normalized patients at midterm; 9% of the initial population) experienced persistent apparent healing during long‐term follow‐up. This favorable condition was associated with persistent normalization of main clinical and laboratory parameters, but no early features emerged as being able to predict the stability of the apparent healing condition. Despite the apparent resolution of the disease, a non‐negligible proportion of patients died or had a worsened clinical and instrumental condition over the very long‐term. These patients cannot be considered to be effectively healed and should be carefully and systematically followed and treated over the long‐term to identify early clues of disease progression.

Echocardiographic Study

Comprehensive M‐mode, 2‐dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed at baseline and at mid‐term and long‐term follow‐up. Systolic and diastolic functions were evaluated according to international guidelines. Right ventricular areas and fractional area contraction and the end‐systolic left atrial area were measured with the same approach. Mitral regurgitation was semiquantitatively graded considering the regurgitant jet area at color Doppler imaging and/or the vena contracta width. Mitral regurgitations with jet area > 4 cm² and vena contracta ≥ 0.4 cm were considered significant.

The transmitral flow velocity curve was obtained by pulsed Doppler imaging, positioning the sample volume between the tips of the mitral leaflets; the LV filling pattern was classified as restrictive in the presence of E‐wave deceleration time < 120 ms or E/A ≥ 2 associated with E‐wave deceleration time ≤ 150 ms. For patients with atrial fibrillation, only data from the E wave were considered. All measurements were obtained from the mean of 3 beats for the patients with sinus rhythm and 5 beats for those with atrial fibrillation. Chamber diameters, areas, and volumes were normalized for body surface area. Reproducibility of Doppler echocardiographic data in our echo laboratory has been published previously.

Study Design

Apparent healing was defined as the combined presence at mid‐term follow‐up (mean 19 ± 4 months) of normal LVEF (≥ 50%) and normal indexed LV end‐diastolic diameter (≤ 33 mm/m²). Apparent healing was considered persistent if the normalization of both LV function and dimension were maintained at long‐term follow‐up (mean 103 ± 9 months).

The primary outcome measure was either death or urgent HTx. The indication for HTx was considered in patients with refractory HF requiring inotropic treatment and/or mechanical support (status I). Information regarding the end points was obtained directly from the patient, from the patient's physician, or from the register of death for the municipality of residence.
