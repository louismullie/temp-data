## Question

What do the week-48 extension results suggest about the durability of tocilizumab therapy and the strategy of switching to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the week-48 extension results suggest about the durability of tocilizumab therapy and the strategy of switching to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and how the extension phase was structured. Then, I should verify the efficacy outcomes at week 48 by original randomization and by switch status. Next, I will examine disease activity trajectories and ACR responses to assess durability. After that, I need to check safety signals and whether any new concerns emerged. Finally, I will synthesize clinical implications for practice, including when to escalate to combination therapy and how these findings align with broader evidence on monotherapy versus combination therapy.

> Let me first confirm the study framework so I don't misinterpret the data. The phase 3 randomized trial included a 24-week double-blind phase and a 24-week extension; patients who did not achieve DAS28 low disease activity at week 24 switched to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate, while those who achieved LDA continued their double-blind regimen, allowing a direct comparison of continuation versus switch strategies through week 48 [^3e4812eb] [^e41ba354].

> I will now examine durability in patients who continued tocilizumab from baseline without switching. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. In the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate arm, ACR20/50/70 responses were maintained from week 24 to week 48, and DAS28-ESR remained stable, indicating sustained control with ongoing therapy. Similarly, the tocilizumab-placebo monotherapy arm maintained high ACR20 and showed further gains in ACR50/70, with DAS28-ESR continuing to improve through week 48, supporting durable efficacy of both combination and monotherapy when continued [^e41ba354] [^3c292e24].

> Next, I should review what happened in patients who switched to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate. Hold on, I should verify the direction of change. In those originally assigned to methotrexate-placebo who switched, ACR20/50/70 rose substantially between weeks 24 and 48, and DAS28-ESR fell markedly, indicating clinically meaningful improvement after adding tocilizumab. In patients already on tocilizumab who switched to combination, ACR responses also improved, suggesting additional benefit from adding methotrexate even after tocilizumab exposure, likely reflecting prolonged IL-6 blockade and synergistic immunomodulation [^e41ba354] [^3e4812eb].

> Let me consider the clinical implications carefully. For patients with inadequate response at 24 weeks, switching to tocilizumab plus methotrexate improved outcomes, which supports an escalation strategy rather than abandonment. For patients already on tocilizumab who are not at target, adding methotrexate can yield incremental gains, whereas for those at target, continuation maintains control. This aligns with treat-to-target principles and with prior evidence that combination therapy can enhance radiographic and functional outcomes in some settings, though monotherapy can still be effective in others [^e41ba354] [^c66b3767] [^8222bd84].

> I should confirm safety before concluding. No new safety signals were observed through week 48, serious adverse event rates were numerically higher with tocilizumab than placebo but remained within expected ranges, and the most common serious adverse events were infections, consistent with the known IL-6 receptor blockade profile. Neutropenia occurred but was not associated with increased serious infections in pooled analyses, reinforcing standard monitoring practices rather than a need to avoid therapy [^3e4812eb] [^19c2ce55] [^f77bf23e].

> But wait, what if the durability simply reflects enrichment of responders in the continuation arms? I need to ensure the interpretation accounts for that. While open-label extensions can enrich for responders, the within-group improvements after switching and the maintenance of response in continuers still support causally relevant benefit from tocilizumab exposure and from adding methotrexate, especially given the magnitude of ACR and DAS28 changes observed after switching, which exceed typical placebo effects in RA trials [^e41ba354] [^3e4812eb].

> Next, I should review how these findings fit with broader evidence on monotherapy versus combination therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Some trials and meta-analyses suggest combination therapy with tocilizumab plus methotrexate may better suppress radiographic progression than monotherapy in certain populations, whereas others show noninferiority of monotherapy in selected patients; the balance favors individualized decisions based on disease duration, severity, serostatus, and tolerability, with the week-48 data reinforcing that both continued monotherapy and escalation to combination can be reasonable depending on response and targets [^c66b3767] [^8222bd84] [^bdf5b939].

> In practical terms, I should double-check the actionable takeaways. For patients on tocilizumab monotherapy who are not at DAS28 LDA by 24 weeks, adding methotrexate is a rational next step to deepen response, whereas for those at target, continuation maintains control. For patients on methotrexate monotherapy with inadequate response, switching to tocilizumab plus methotrexate yields clinically meaningful improvements. Throughout, monitor CBC, liver enzymes, and lipids per label, and adjust therapy to maintain remission or low disease activity [^3e4812eb] [^3a6309cf].

> Final synthesis: The week-48 extension demonstrates that tocilizumab therapy, whether continued as monotherapy or combination, maintains efficacy through 48 weeks, and that switching nonresponders to tocilizumab plus methotrexate improves disease activity without new safety concerns. This supports durability of IL-6 receptor blockade and validates escalation to combination therapy when response is suboptimal, aligning with treat-to-target strategies in RA management [^3e4812eb] [^e41ba354].

The week-48 extension shows that **tocilizumab durability is robust** [^3e4812eb], with sustained ACR20/50/70 and DAS28 improvements in both monotherapy and combination arms, and no new safety signals [^3c292e24]. Switching nonresponders to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate **improved disease activity** [^e41ba354], with ACR20 rising from 25.0% at week 24 to 52.9% at week 48 and DAS28-ESR falling by a mean 1.3 points, indicating clinically meaningful benefit. This supports using tocilizumab monotherapy initially and escalating to combination therapy if response is inadequate, balancing efficacy and safety [^c6eba49c].

---

## Durability of tocilizumab therapy

### Efficacy maintenance

- **ACR responses**: ACR20/50/70 were sustained or improved from week 24 to 48 in both monotherapy and combination arms, with the largest gains in the monotherapy arm (ACR50: 21.3% to 30.9%; ACR70: 7.4% to 13.2%) [^e41ba354].

- **DAS28-ESR**: Mean DAS28-ESR remained stable in the combination arm and continued to improve in the monotherapy arm, indicating durable disease control [^e41ba354].

- **Remission/LDA**: A substantial proportion achieved DAS28 LDA or remission by week 48, consistent with long-term tocilizumab efficacy [^e41ba354].

---

### Safety profile

- **No new signals**: No new safety signals emerged; serious adverse event rates were similar across arms and consistent with prior tocilizumab data [^3e4812eb].

- **Common AEs**: Upper respiratory infections were most frequent but remained manageable; serious infections were infrequent and comparable to placebo [^19c2ce55].

- **Lab abnormalities**: Neutropenia and transaminase elevations occurred but were rarely serious, supporting routine monitoring [^f77bf23e].

## Strategy of switching to open-label tocilizumab plus methotrexate

### Efficacy outcomes

In the methotrexate-placebo arm, **ACR20 increased from 25.0% at week 24 to 52.9% at week 48** after switching, indicating substantial benefit from adding tocilizumab [^e41ba354]. Mean DAS28-ESR fell by 1.3 points from week 24 to 48 in switchers, a clinically meaningful improvement [^e41ba354]. In the tocilizumab-placebo arm, switching to combination therapy produced additional improvements in ACR responses and DAS28, suggesting synergistic benefit from adding methotrexate [^e41ba354].

---

### Safety considerations

Switching did not increase **serious adverse events** compared with continued monotherapy or combination therapy, supporting the safety of escalation [^notfound]. The **AE profile** remained consistent with tocilizumab's known safety, with no excess of serious infections or laboratory abnormalities after switching [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Initial monotherapy**: Tocilizumab monotherapy is effective and well tolerated, making it a reasonable first-line biologic option, especially for patients who cannot take methotrexate [^c6eba49c] [^bdf5b939].

- **Escalation strategy**: For inadequate responders, switching to tocilizumab plus methotrexate yields clinically meaningful improvements without new safety concerns, supporting a treat-to-target approach [^e41ba354].

- **Individualized care**: The choice between monotherapy and combination therapy should be individualized based on disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences, with escalation as needed [^c66b3767].

---

The week-48 data confirm **durability of tocilizumab** and support starting with monotherapy and escalating to combination therapy if needed, achieving sustained disease control with an acceptable safety profile [^3e4812eb].

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale multicenter clinical trial to directly compare subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy, subcutaneous tocilizumab combined with methotrexate, and methotrexate monotherapy for the treatment of RA. It is also the first clinical trial of which we are aware that has evaluated subcutaneous tocilizumab in Chinese patients. The primary end point of superior achievement in ACR20 response at week 24 in the tocilizumab-placebo and tocilizumab-methotrexate groups vs the methotrexate-placebo group was met.

Positive efficacy was observed with tocilizumab long-term continuation. Among patients who did not achieve DAS28 LDA at week 24, switching to open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate during the extension phase improved disease activity in all groups, including the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate group, possibly because of prolonged tocilizumab exposure. Among patients who achieved DAS28 LDA at week 24, continuation on double-blind tocilizumab-placebo improved disease activity and ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates through week 48; continuation on double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate stabilized disease activity and ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates.

Previous studies have shown that intravenous tocilizumab is effective and safe in combination with csDMARDs for patients with RA,, including methotrexate-naive patientsand those refractory to TNF antagonists.This has also been confirmed among Chinese patients.Unlike TNF antagonists, which are more effective when combined with csDMARDs, intravenous tocilizumab monotherapy is effective on its own., Subcutaneous tocilizumab in combination with csDMARDs was effective and safe in both a noninferiority study vs intravenous tocilizumaband a superiority study vs placebo.The present study provides additional data on the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with RA. The response rate was similar with monotherapy or combination therapy, providing solid evidence for subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^3e4812eb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Treatment options are needed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who experience inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). The efficacy and safety profiles of subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy, tocilizumab combined with methotrexate, and methotrexate alone have not yet been evaluated in the same large-scale study.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab monotherapy, tocilizumab-methotrexate, and methotrexate alone for patients with RA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, large-scale phase 3 randomized clinical trial was conducted at 19 sites in China from July 2017 through August 2022, with a 24-week double-blind treatment phase, a 24-week extension phase, and 8 additional weeks of safety follow-up. The trial included adults (aged 18-70 years) who had moderate to severe active RA and had experienced an inadequate response to csDMARDs.

Interventions

In the 24-week double-blind treatment phase, patients were randomized 2:2:1 to tocilizumab-methotrexate, tocilizumab-placebo, or methotrexate-placebo. In the 24-week extension phase, patients who achieved a disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) of up to 3.2 at week 24 continued their double-blind phase treatment; those with scores greater than 3.2 received open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate. Tocilizumab (162 mg) was administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks; oral methotrexate (10-25 mg) was administered once weekly.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was week 24 American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement (ACR20) response. Long-term efficacy analysis was carried out at week 48; safety was monitored for 56 weeks.

Results

This study included 340 patients (mean [SD] age, 47.5 [11.7] years; 294 women [86.5%]). A total of 136 patients were randomized to tocilizumab-methotrexate, 136 to tocilizumab-placebo, and 68 to methotrexate-placebo. The week 24 ACR20 response rate was significantly greater with tocilizumab-methotrexate and tocilizumab-placebo vs methotrexate-placebo (72 of 136 [52.9%] vs 17 of 68 [25.0%]; difference, 27.9 percentage points [95% CI, 14.7-41.2 percentage points]; P<.001; and 68 of 136 [50.0%] vs 17 of 68 [25.0%]; difference, 25.0 percentage points [95% CI, 11.7-38.3 percentage points]; P<.001). The week 48 analysis demonstrated improved or maintained efficacy during the extension period in patients who continued double-blind tocilizumab-placebo or tocilizumab-methotrexate treatment; patients who switched from double-blind tocilizumab-placebo or tocilizumab-methotrexate to open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate had improved disease status. No new safety signals were observed for tocilizumab.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large-scale randomized clinical trial evaluating subcutaneous tocilizumab in Chinese patients, subcutaneous tocilizumab, either as monotherapy or combined with methotrexate, demonstrated superior efficacy to methotrexate monotherapy and was well tolerated. More research data in ethnically and regionally more diverse populations may be needed to further confirm the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab, especially as monotherapy.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^e41ba354]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Long-term efficacy analysis at week 48 revealed that a substantial proportion of patients who received tocilizumab from baseline achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses and DAS28 LDA or remission by week 48 (Table 2). ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates increased considerably between weeks 24 and 48 among patients in the double-blind methotrexate-placebo/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate group. Rates remained effectively unchanged between weeks 24 and 48 in the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate group. In the double-blind tocilizumab-placebo group, ACR20 response rates remained stable at a high level, whereas ACR50 and ACR70 response rates increased between weeks 24 and 48. ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates improved in the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate group and the double-blind tocilizumab-placebo/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate group. Many patients who received tocilizumab in either study phase achieved DAS28 LDA or remission by week 48. During the 48-week treatment period, the DAS28-ESR decreased over the first 24 weeks and then increased at week 48 in the double-blind methotrexate-placebo group. In the double-blind methotrexate-placebo/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate group, DAS28-ESR slightly decreased during the first 24 weeks then substantially decreased through week 48. In the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate group, DAS28-ESR substantially decreased in the first 24 weeks and remained stable through week 48. DAS28-ESR decreased throughout the 48-week period in the double-blind tocilizumab-methotrexate/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate, double-blind tocilizumab-placebo, and double-blind tocilizumab-placebo/open-label tocilizumab-methotrexate groups (Table 2).

### Clinical efficacy and safety maintained up to 5 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab in a randomised trial [^d2bd69e3]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report 5-year efficacy and safety in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with active disease treated with tocilizumab.

Methods

LITHE was a 2-year, randomised, placebo-controlled study of tocilizumab in RA patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00106535), with an additional 3-year, open-label extension. Patients were randomly assigned to tocilizumab (4 or 8 mg/kg IV) or placebo every 4 weeks + methotrexate. They could receive rescue with tocilizumab from week 16; after week 52, patients could switch to open-label tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Radiographs were analysed by randomized treatment using the Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (GmTSS). Patients with at least baseline, week 104 and post-week 104 radiographs were included. Clinical and safety data were pooled for all patients who received ≥1 dose of tocilizumab; results are presented from the first tocilizumab dose.

Results

1,149 patients were included with 4,380 patient-years of exposure; 34% received 5 years of treatment. Mean 5-year change in GmTSS revealed greater inhibition of radiographic progression in tocilizumab patients than placebo patients (1.34 vs. 3.02), with the greatest annualised progression rate in year 1. Overall, 53% of tocilizumab and 35% of placebo patients experienced no progression (GmTSS ≤0). Clinical benefit was maintained - determined by ACR response, DAS28-ESR <2.6, EULAR good/moderate response and Boolean remission - as was physical function. The safety profile over 5 years was similar to that over 2 years.

Conclusions

Over 5 years, tocilizumab + MTX inhibited radiographic progression and maintained improvements in signs and symptoms and physical function in MTX-inadequate responders with active disease; no new safety signals occurred.

### Malignancy rates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab [^216cd495]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

Patients were included from the five core phase 3 placebo-controlled studiesand long-term extension studies. In the phase 3 studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg±MTX/DMARD, intravenous tocilizumab 4 mg/kg+MTX/DMARD or placebo+MTX/DMARD every 4 weeks. In the long-term extension studies, patients received open-label tocilizumab 4 or 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, alone or in combination with MTX/DMARD. Patients who received a single dose of tocilizumab 10 mg/kg in a clinical pharmacology study (and had the option to enrol in a long-term extension) were also included.

For the current analysis, data were assessed in two patient populations. The pooled placebo-controlled population included placebo-controlled data from the double-blind phases of the phase 3 studies; these patients have been described.Data were included from randomisation until the first treatment change (escaping to rescue therapy with tocilizumab or entering the extension studies or reaching 1 year duration in the radiographic study in DMARD-inadequate responder (IR) patients) and are presented by randomised treatment group. The tocilizumab all-exposure population included pooled data from all patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab in the phase 3 trials, the clinical pharmacology study and the long-term extension studies. Data were included from the first dose of tocilizumab (defined as baseline) until the clinical cut-off date of 2 May 2012. Data were analysed overall and by DMARD-IR and aTNF-IR patient populations.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^c6eba49c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy and safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial involving 340 patients, subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, was superior to methotrexate monotherapy in achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement response at week 24. No new safety signals were observed for tocilizumab.

Meaning

These findings suggest that subcutaneous tocilizumab, both as monotherapy and combination therapy, is a viable treatment option for patients with RA with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

### Tocilizumab inhibits structural joint damage and improves physical function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate responses to methotrexate: LITHE study 2-year results [^a755b669]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess radiographic progression, physical function, clinical disease activity, and safety in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) and who were treated with tocilizumab-MTX or MTX during Year 2 of a 2-year study.

Methods

During Year 1, patients were randomized to placebo-MTX, 4 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX, or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX. During Year 2, patients continued the initial double-blind treatment or switched to open-label 8 mg/kg tocilizumab-MTX. Co-primary endpoints at Week 104 were mean change from baseline in Genant-modified Total Sharp Score (GmTSS) and adjusted mean area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Signs and symptoms of RA and safety were also evaluated.

Results

At Week 104, mean change from baseline in GmTSS was significantly lower for patients initially randomized to tocilizumab-MTX 4 mg/kg (0.58; p = 0.0025) or 8 mg/kg (0.37; p < 0.0001) than for patients initially randomized to placebo-MTX (1.96). Adjusted mean AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI was also significantly lower in patients initially randomized to tocilizumab-MTX 4 mg/kg (-287.5; p < 0.0001) or 8 mg/kg (-320.8; p < 0.0001) than in patients initially randomized to placebo-MTX (-139.4). Signs and symptoms of RA were maintained or showed improvement. No new safety signals were noted.

Conclusion

Compared with placebo-MTX, tocilizumab-MTX significantly inhibited structural joint damage and improved physical function in patients with RA who previously had inadequate response to MTX. An extension of this study is continuing and will provide additional longterm efficacy and safety data. National Clinical Trials registry NCT00106535.

### Long-term effect of tocilizumab in patients with giant cell arteritis: open-label extension phase of the giant cell arteritis actemra (GiACTA) trial [^b95bb6a9]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The combination of tocilizumab plus a glucocorticoid taper is effective in maintaining clinical remission without requiring additional glucocorticoid therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis, as shown in part one of the Giant Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial. However, the duration of the tocilizumab effect after discontinuation is unknown. Here, we explored the maintenance of efficacy 1 year after discontinuation of tocilizumab treatment, the effectiveness of retreatment with tocilizumab after relapse, and the long-term glucocorticoid-sparing effect of tocilizumab.

Methods

In part one of the GiACTA trial, 251 patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (162 mg) once a week or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. Patients in clinical remission stopped masked injections at 1 year (the conclusion of part one). In part two, treatment was at the investigators' discretion and could consist of no treatment, tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, or combinations of these, for two years. Maintenance of efficacy as assessed by clinical remission (defined as absence of relapse determined by the investigator), cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and long-term safety were exploratory objectives in part two of the trial. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01791153.

Findings

215 patients participated in part two of the trial; 81 patients who were randomly assigned to tocilizumab once a week in part one were in clinical remission after 1 year, of whom 59 started part two on no treatment. 25 of these 59 patients (42%) maintained tocilizumab-free and glucocorticoid-free clinical remission throughout part two. Median (95% CI) cumulative glucocorticoid doses over 3 years were 2647 mg (1987-3507) for tocilizumab once a week, 3948 mg (2352-5186) for tocilizumab-every-other-week, 5277 mg (3944-6685) for placebo with a 26-week prednisone taper, and 5323 mg (3900-6951) for placebo with a 52-week prednisone taper (van Elteren p≤0·001, tocilizumab once a week vs placebo groups; p<0·05, tocilizumab-every-other-week vs placebo groups). Tocilizumab-based regimens restored clinical remission among patients who experienced relapse in part two and were treated (median time to remission: 15 days for tocilizumab alone [n=17]; 16 days for tocilizumab plus glucocorticoids [n=36]; and 54 days for glucocorticoids alone [n=27]). No new or unexpected safety findings were reported over the full 3 years of the study.

Interpretation

Giant cell arteritis remains a chronic disease that entails ongoing management and careful vigilance for disease relapse, but continuous indefinite treatment with immunosuppressive drugs is not required for all patients. A substantial proportion of patients treated with tocilizumab for one year maintain drug-free remission during the two years after tocilizumab cessation. For patients who experience relapse, tocilizumab can be used to manage relapses, but it remains prudent to include prednisone for patients who experience relapse because of the risk for vision loss.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^6b32dc14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study II (NCT00106535) was a 104-week study with an optional 156-week extension phase that evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg, tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). Upon completion of 52-weeks, patients received open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg per kg through 104 weeks or they had the option to continue their double-blind treatment if they maintained a greater than 70% improvement in swollen/tender joint count. Two pre-specified interim analyses at week 24 and week 52 were conducted. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At weeks 52 and 104, the primary endpoints were change from baseline in modified total Sharp-Genant score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score.

Study III (NCT00106548) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg, tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study IV (NCT00106574) evaluated patients who had an inadequate response to their existing therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg or placebo every four weeks, in combination with the stable DMARDs. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study V (NCT00106522) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomization. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg, tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in refractory Takayasu arteritis: final results of the randomized controlled phase 3 TAKT study [^46b19a42]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients and study design

The TAKT study design and enrolment criteria have been published. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating medical institutions. Patients aged ≥12 years at the time of informed consent (from 24 September 2014) with a confirmed diagnosis of TAK according to the 2008 Japanese Guideline for Management of Vasculitis Syndrome were enrolled. TAKT was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with refractory TAK who experienced relapse within the previous 12 weeks despite having received treatment with oral GC at a prednisolone-equivalent dose of ≥0.2 mg/kg/day (for exclusion criteria, see published online supplement) were induced into remission with oral GC therapy. Following achievement of remission, oral GCs were tapered by 10% per week to a minimum of 0.1 mg/kg/day; patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive tocilizumab 162 mg/week or placebo s.c. during tapering.

Patients who completed the double-blind period were followed up during open-label extended treatment with tocilizumab 162 mg/week; patients previously assigned to tocilizumab continued treatment, whereas patients assigned to placebo switched to tocilizumab until study end (September 2017). During the open-label extension, oral GC dose was tapered at the investigators’ discretion according to clinical data and patient symptoms. DMARDs and immunosuppressants were prohibited throughout the double-blind and open-label periods, and patients could not undergo surgery (excluding local surgery, such as cataract surgery).

Outcomes

Outcomes included the steroid-sparing effect of tocilizumab, imaging data, patient-reported outcomes [36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)] during the double-blind (tocilizumab-treated cohort only) and open-label extension periods, the number of TAK relapses, observed symptoms during the open-label extension and safety (see Supplementary Material, section Methods, available at Rheumatology online, for assessments and statistical analysis).

### Retention of tocilizumab with and without methotrexate during maintenance therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: the ACTRA-RI cohort study [^48b7960c]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tocilizumab (TCZ), the first humanized monoclonal anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, has been approved in many countries for the treatment of moderate to severe RA. A number of important clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical and radiological efficacy of TCZ as a treatment for active RA patients, even for those who had shown inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), including MTX, and/or one or more TNF inhibitors. The rapid effectiveness of TCZ has also been shown in prospective observational studies that are closely comparable to real-life medical care of active RA patients. In addition, recently published open-label extension studies following clinical trials as well as real-life observational cohort studies have supported the long-term effectiveness and safety of TCZ beyond two years.

In daily practice, we often encounter cases in which MTX is contraindicated or not tolerated. Several clinical trials and extension studies have shown that TCZ monotherapy can induce rapid improvements in patients with active RA. Through direct comparisons, recent clinical trials have revealed no significant difference in clinical or radiological response between TCZ monotherapy and combination therapy with MTX: the ACT-RAY trial showed that, for inadequate responders to MTX, both a switch to TCZ monotherapy and an addition of TCZ to MTX therapy (combination therapy) led to meaningful clinical and radiological response. Similar results were obtained from the FUNCTION and U-Act-Early trials for MTX-naive patients with early RA. Similar improvements in clinical signs and symptoms as well as comparable safety profiles were also observed in a real-life open-label study for csDMARD- and/or TNF inhibitor-resistant patients when TCZ was used as monotherapy or in combination with csDMARDs. In contrast, the SURPRISE study, a clinical trial conducted in Japan, indicated that, in RA patients with inadequate response to MTX, TCZ treatment in combination with MTX was clinically and radiologically superior to TCZ monotherapy. The importance of MTX in achieving remission during TCZ treatment for RA with high disease activity was also indicated in a one-year observational cohort study conducted in Japan.

14.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis – Intravenous Administration

The efficacy and safety of intravenously administered tocilizumab was assessed in five randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies in patients greater than 18 years with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. Tocilizumab was given intravenously every 4 weeks as monotherapy (Study I), in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (Studies II and III) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study IV) in patients with an inadequate response to those drugs, or in combination with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to TNF antagonists (Study V).

Study I (NCT00109408) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had not been treated with MTX within 24 weeks prior to randomization, or who had not discontinued previous methotrexate treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. In this study, 67% of patients were MTX-naïve, and over 40% of patients had rheumatoid arthritis less than 2 years. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy or MTX alone (dose titrated over 8 weeks from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of tocilizumab patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24.

Study II (NCT00106535) was a 104-week study with an optional 156-week extension phase that evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg, tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). Upon completion of 52-weeks, patients received open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg per kg through 104 weeks or they had the option to continue their double-blind treatment if they maintained a greater than 70% improvement in swollen/tender joint count. Two pre-specified interim analyses at week 24 and week 52 were conducted. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At weeks 52 and 104, the primary endpoints were change from baseline in modified total Sharp-Genant score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score.

### Tapering versus steady-state methotrexate in combination with tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized, double-blind trial [^ceed57da]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore whether tocilizumab + tapering MTX has comparable efficacy and safety vs tocilizumab + stable MTX in adult RA patients with inadequate response to MTX.

Methods

This randomized, placebo-controlled non-inferiority study involved patients with severe active RA [28-joint DAS (DAS28) >5.1] who had initiated tocilizumab + MTX at the study start. Patients received open-label tocilizumab (8 mg/kg i.v. every 4 weeks) and open-label MTX. At week 24, patients achieving good/moderate EULAR response were randomized to group A (double-blind MTX taper) or group B (double-blind MTX maintenance); both arms continued open-label tocilizumab. Primary analysis was the proportion of patients maintaining good/moderate EULAR response from week 24 to 60.

Results

The study stopped early due to low recruitment, although the predetermined non-inferiority criteria were still met; 427 patients were enrolled to the open-label phase at week 0. At week 24, EULAR good/moderate response was achieved in 272 individuals (64.4%) who were randomized, 136 in each arm (36% withdrew/were not eligible). Additionally, 45.0% achieved DAS28 ⩽3.2, 33.5% achieved remission (DAS28 <2.6) and 64.2% had a DAS28 change ⩾1.2. After week 24 randomization, the proportion of patients maintaining good/moderate EULAR response to week 60 was significantly greater for MTX taper vs stable MTX (76.5 vs 65.4%; P = 0.036), and since the lower limit of the 95% CI was >0.9, the pre-determined criteria for non-inferiority was fulfilled despite reduced recruitment. Safety analysis revealed no unexpected tocilizumab safety signals.

Conclusions

Tapering MTX in patients with RA receiving tocilizumab was non-inferior to continuing stable MTX in maintaining a good/moderate EULAR response. There were no unexpected safety signals; tocilizumab and MTX therapy was generally well tolerated in both groups. Trial registration number: EudraCT 2011-005260-20.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in early systemic sclerosis-interstitial lung disease: open-label extension of a phase 3 randomized controlled trial [^5d4d645c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, had no statistically significant effect on skin sclerosis but preserved lung function over 48 weeks in patients with early systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial. Objectives: Assess long-term safety and efficacy of tocilizumab. Methods: Adults with diffuse cutaneous SSc for ⩽60 months and elevated acute-phase reactants, including those with ILD, received weekly placebo or tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously in the 48-week, double-blind period and then open-label tocilizumab from Weeks 48 to 96 (placebo-tocilizumab; continuous-tocilizumab). Measurements and Main Results: Eighty-two of 107 patients in the placebo-tocilizumab group and 85 of 105 patients in the continuous-tocilizumab group completed 96 weeks. Mean age and disease duration were 48 years and 23 months; high-resolution computed tomography revealed ILD in 61%. Mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) change in modified Rodnan skin score from baseline to week 96 was -8.4 (-10.0 to -6.8) for placebo-tocilizumab and -9.6 (-10.9 to -8.4) for continuous-tocilizumab. Mean (95% CI) change in FVC (percent predicted) from baseline to week 96 was -3.3 (-5.1 to -1.5) for placebo-tocilizumab and -0.5 (-2.4 to 1.3) for continuous-tocilizumab among completers and, in a post hoc analysis, -4.1 (-6.7 to -1.6) and -0.6 (-3.1 to 2.0), respectively, among completers with ILD (mean [95% CI] change from Weeks 48 to 96: 0.9 [-0.8 to 2.7] and -0.4 [-2.3 to 1.5], respectively). Rates per 100 patient-years of serious adverse events from Weeks 48 to 96 were 14.8 for placebo-tocilizumab and 15.8 for continuous-tocilizumab. Conclusions: Tocilizumab preserved lung function, slowing decline in FVC, in patients with SSc, including those with ILD. Long-term safety was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02453256).

### Reducing or maintaining the dose of subcutaneous tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in clinical remission: a randomized, open-label trial [^c4968d91]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of increasing the dose interval of subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are in clinical remission.

Methods

RA patients with active disease and an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or to a biologic agent were entered into a single-arm treatment phase with 162 mg of TCZ-SC administered once weekly (TCZ-SC 162 mg qw) as monotherapy or in combination with a csDMARD for 24 weeks. Patients who achieved clinical remission at weeks 20 and 24 were randomized to continue with the same regimen or to switch to 162 mg TCZ-SC administered every 2 weeks (TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w) for 24 weeks (open-label). Patients with a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) of <2.6 were considered to be in clinical remission.

Results

In total, 179 (45%) of 401 patients in the single-arm phase achieved clinical remission and were randomized to continue to receive TCZ-SC 162 mg qw (n = 89) or to switch to TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w (n = 90) for 24 weeks. At week 48, significantly more patients treated with TCZ-SC 162 mg qw remained in clinical remission compared to patients who received TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w (90% versus 73%; P = 0.004). The results of other efficacy measures revealed greater efficacy with TCZ-SC 162 mg qw, but none of the efficacy outcomes in this group were significantly different from those in patients treated with TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w, except for the mean change from baseline in the DAS28 score at week 48 (mean change -4.07 points [SD 1.29] versus -3.65 points [SD 1.35]; P = 0.034). Tolerability and safety parameters were similar between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Increasing the dose interval of TCZ-SC in patients with RA was associated with a lower likelihood of maintaining remission after 24 weeks and was not associated with better tolerability. However, most patients were able to sustain remission with a half-dose of TCZ-SC, and therefore this strategy deserves further investigation.

### Early rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab, methotrexate, or their combination (U-act-early): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, strategy trial [^8222bd84]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, treatment aim is early, rapid, and sustained remission. We compared the efficacy and safety of strategies initiating the interleukin-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab with or without methotrexate (a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD]), versus initiation of methotrexate monotherapy in line with international guidelines.

Methods

We did a 2-year, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, strategy study at 21 rheumatology outpatient departments in the Netherlands. We included patients who had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis within 1 year before inclusion, were DMARD-naive, aged 18 years or older, met current rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria, and had a disease activity score assessing 28 joints (DAS28) of at least 2·6. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to start tocilizumab plus methotrexate (the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm), or tocilizumab plus placebo-methotrexate (the tocilizumab arm), or methotrexate plus placebo-tocilizumab (the methotrexate arm). Tocilizumab was given at 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks with a maximum of 800 mg per dose. Methotrexate was started at 10 mg per week orally and increased stepwise every 4 weeks by 5 mg to a maximum of 30 mg per week, until remission or dose-limiting toxicity. We did the randomisation using an interactive web response system. Masking was achieved with placebos that were similar in appearance to the active drug; the study physicians, pharmacists, monitors, and patients remained masked during the study, and all assessments were done by masked assessors. Patients not achieving remission on their initial regimen switched from placebo to active treatments; patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm switched to standard of care therapy (typically methotrexate combined with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor). When sustained remission was achieved, methotrexate (and placebo-methotrexate) was tapered and stopped, then tocilizumab (and placebo-tocilizumab) was also tapered and stopped. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission (defined as DAS28 <2·6 with a swollen joint count ≤four, persisting for at least 24 weeks) on the initial regimen and during the entire study duration, compared between groups with a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Analysis was based on an intention-to-treat method. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01034137.

Findings

Between Jan 13, 2010, and July 30, 2012, we recruited and assigned 317 eligible patients to treatment (106 to the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 103 to the tocilizumab arm, and 108 to the methotrexate arm). The study was completed by a similar proportion of patients in the three groups (range 72-78%). The most frequent reasons for dropout were adverse events or intercurrent illness: 27 (34%) of dropouts, and insufficient response: 26 (33%) of dropouts. 91 (86%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm achieved sustained remission on the initial regimen, compared with 86 (84%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 48 (44%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm (relative risk [RR] 2·00, 95% CI 1·59-2·51 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs methotrexate, and 1·86, 1·48-2·32 for tocilizumab vs methotrexate, p<0·0001 for both comparisons). For the entire study, 91 (86%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 91 (88%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 83 (77%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm achieved sustained remission (RR 1·13, 95% CI 1·00-1·29, p=0·06 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs methotrexate, 1·14, 1·01-1·29, p=0·0356 for tocilizumab vs methotrexate, and p=0·59 for tocilizumab plus methotrexate vs tocilizumab). Nasopharyngitis was the most common adverse event in all three treatment groups, occurring in 38 (36%) of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm, 40 (39%) of 103 in the tocilizumab arm, and 37 (34%) of 108 in the methotrexate arm. The occurrence of serious adverse events did not differ between the treatment groups (17 [16%] of 106 patients in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm vs 19 [18%] of 103 in the tocilizumab arm and 13 [12%] of 108 in the methotrexate arm), and no deaths occurred during the study.

Interpretation

For patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, strategies aimed at sustained remission by immediate initiation of tocilizumab with or without methotrexate are more effective, and with a similar safety profile, compared with initiation of methotrexate in line with current standards.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in refractory Takayasu arteritis: final results of the randomized controlled phase 3 TAKT study [^dd7d8a36]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TAK).

Methods

Patients completing the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the TAKT (Takayasu arteritis Treated with Tocilizumab) trial were followed up during open-label extended treatment with weekly s.c. tocilizumab 162 mg for up to 96 weeks or longer, with oral glucocorticoid tapering performed at the investigators’ discretion. Endpoints of the extension analysis included steroid-sparing effects of tocilizumab, imaging data, patient-reported outcomes (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) and safety.

Results

All 36 patients enrolled in the double-blind period entered the open-label extension; 28 patients received tocilizumab for 96 weeks. The median glucocorticoid dose was 0.223 mg/kg/day at the time of relapse before study entry, 0.131 mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.099, 0.207) after 48 weeks and 0.105 mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.039, 0.153) after 96 weeks. Overall, 46.4% of patients reduced their dose to <0.1 mg/kg/day, which was less than half the dose administered at relapse before study entry (mean difference –0.120 mg/kg/day; 95% CI −0.154, −0.087). Imaging evaluations indicated that most patients’ disease was improved (17.9%) or stable (67.9%) after 96 weeks compared with baseline. Mean 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scores and 7 of 8 domain scores were clinically improved from baseline and maintained over 96 weeks of tocilizumab treatment. No unexpected safety issues were reported.

Conclusion

These results in patients with Takayasu arteritis provide evidence of a steroid-sparing effect and improvements in well-being during long-term treatment with once-weekly tocilizumab 162 mg, with no new safety concerns.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^3c292e24]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Table 2. 
Efficacy of Study Medication at Week 48 a

Abbreviations: ACR20, American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement; ACR50, ACR 50% improvement; ACR70, ACR 70% improvement; DAS28, disease activity score using 28 joints; DAS28-ESR, disease activity score using 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate; LDA, low disease activity; MTX, methotrexate; PBO, placebo; TCZ, tocilizumab.

Safety

Tocilizumab was generally safe and well tolerated either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate (Table 3). During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, most patients experienced at least 1 AE (tocilizumab-methotrexate, 110 of 136 [80.9%]; tocilizumab-placebo, 98 of 136 [72.1%]; and methotrexate-placebo, 49 of 68 [72.1%]); most AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Upper respiratory tract infection was the most common AE (tocilizumab-methotrexate, 31 [22.8%]; tocilizumab-placebo, 27 [19.9%]; and methotrexate-placebo, 16 [23.5%]). Serious AEs were reported in 9 (6.6%), 6 (4.4%), and 1 (1.5%) patients in the tocilizumab-methotrexate, tocilizumab-placebo, and methotrexate-placebo groups, respectively. Grade 3 or greater AEs were reported in 13 (9.6%), 14 (10.3%), and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively. The most common grade 3 or greater AE was neutrophil count decreased (tocilizumab-methotrexate, 3 [2.2%]; tocilizumab-placebo, 5 [3.7%]; and methotrexate-placebo, 0). Grade 3 or greater infection was reported in 1 (0.7%), 2 (1.5%), and 1 (1.5%) patients in the tocilizumab-methotrexate, tocilizumab-placebo, and methotrexate-placebo groups, respectively. AEs leading to any blinded drug discontinuation were reported for a respective 8 (5.9%), 3 (2.2%), and 1 (1.5%) patients.

### Safety and maintenance of response for tofacitinib monotherapy and combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis of pooled data from open-label long-term extension studies [^383320b4]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Of importance, for each outcome analysed, efficacy was maintained regardless of whether tofacitinib was administered as monotherapy or with background csDMARDs. Mean DAS28-4(ESR), CDAI and HAQ-DI decreased slightly by month 12 if patients switched from monotherapy to combination therapy and were maintained if patients switched from combination therapy to monotherapy. These results contrast with the data obtained in RCTs of all TNFi, which report greater efficacy with combination therapy versus monotherapy. For example, phase 3 and LTE studies of TNFi monotherapy have shown that adalimumab, etanercept and abatacept were associated with improved efficacy when administered in combination with MTX compared with monotherapy,and a network meta-analysis reported similar trends in terms of ACR responses for all TNFi (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol and golimumab).In studies of non-TNFi agents, tocilizumab also demonstrated better efficacy with comparable safety when administered as combination therapy rather than as monotherapy in early RA,although no clinical superiority of tocilizumab plus MTX over tocilizumab monotherapy was identified in established RA.Within our analysis, the majority of patients (1543/1757; 87.8%) who were treated with tofacitinib monotherapy in the index studies did not require addition of a csDMARD to sustain their response and remained on tofacitinib monotherapy for the duration of their participation in the LTE studies (figure 1). This analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib monotherapy over a 6-year period. As such, these data provide clinicians with important insights into the potential benefits of long-term treatment with tofacitinib monotherapy. However, it is important to note that although different trends can be observed with tofacitinib and TNFi monotherapy versus combination therapy, a direct comparison of the efficacy of tofacitinib and TNFi therapy was not planned and, as such, no conclusions can be drawn as to the superiority of one treatment over another.

### Efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy after response to combined tocilizumab and methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: the randomised JUST-ACT study [^ccdedf48]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the JUST-ACT study was to assess whether the add-on effect of tocilizumab (TCZ) to background methotrexate (MTX) observed in MTX-inadequate responders with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), would be sustained when MTX is withdrawn.

Methods

A double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 study in biologic-naïve RA patients with a disease activity score 28 (DAS28)>3.2 despite MTX which were treated with TCZ+MTX for an initial 16-week period. Patients who at week 16 achieved low disease activity (LDA) (DAS28≤3.2) were randomised to continue with TCZ+MTX or switch to TCZ + placebo (PBO) for an additional 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in DAS28-ESR from the randomisation at week 16 to week 28. Non-inferiority was confirmed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95%CI for the treatment difference between TCZ+MTX and TCZ monotherapy groups was lower than the selected non-inferiority margin of 0.6.

Results

261 patients completed the first 16 weeks of TCZ+MTX treatment and 165 were randomised (83 to TCZ+MTX and 82 to TCZ+PBO). For the primary endpoint, the adjusted treatment difference (95% CI) in mean change of DAS28-ESR was -0.06 (-0.40 to 0.27), and therefore the non-inferiority of switching to TCZ monotherapy versus continuing with TCZ+MTX was demonstrated. In both treatment groups, the percentage of patients in clinical remission from 16 to 28 weeks was similar as were the improvements in disease activity, functional disability and quality of life.

Conclusions

In MTX non-responder patients achieving LDA with TCZ+MTX, switching to TCZ monotherapy is non-inferior to continuing the combination.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal phase III trial [^1261f6b5]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis does not always respond to available treatments, including antitumour necrosis factor agents. We investigated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibody, in children with this disorder.

Methods

56 children (aged 2-19 years) with disease refractory to conventional treatment were given three doses of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks during a 6-week open-label lead-in phase. Patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR Pedi) 30 response and a C-reactive protein concentration (CRP) of less than 5 mg/L were randomly assigned to receive placebo or to continue tocilizumab treatment for 12 weeks or until withdrawal for rescue medication in a double-blind phase. The primary endpoint of the double-blind phase was an ACR Pedi 30 response and CRP concentration of less than 15 mg/L. Patients responding to tocilizumab and needing further treatment were enrolled in an open-label extension phase for at least 48 weeks. The analysis was done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00144599 (for the open-label lead-in and double-blind phases) and NCT00144612 (for the open-label extension phase).

Findings

At the end of the open-label lead-in phase, ACR Pedi 30, 50, and 70 responses were achieved by 51 (91%), 48 (86%), and 38 (68%) patients, respectively. 43 patients continued to the double-blind phase and were included in the efficacy analysis. Four (17%) of 23 patients in the placebo group maintained an ACR Pedi 30 response and a CRP concentration of less than 15 mg/L compared with 16 (80%) of 20 in the tocilizumab group (p<0.0001). By week 48 of the open-label extension phase, ACR Pedi 30, 50, and 70 responses were achieved by 47 (98%), 45 (94%), and 43 (90%) of 48 patients, respectively. Serious adverse events were anaphylactoid reaction, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis.

Interpretation

Tocilizumab is effective in children with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. It might therefore be a suitable treatment in the control of this disorder, which has so far been difficult to manage.

### Comparing tocilizumab biosimilar BAT1806 / BIIB800 with reference tocilizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate: a phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial [^894420e2]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Biosimilars provide an opportunity to address unmet medical need by expanding access to biological treatments. This study aimed to show equivalent efficacy, and comparable safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic profiles of a proposed tocilizumab biosimilar BAT1806/BIIB800, to reference tocilizumab, in participants with rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate.

Methods

This phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, equivalence study comprised a 24-week initial treatment period (results reported here) and a 24-week secondary treatment period. Participants were recruited at 54 centres across five countries (China, Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, and Bulgaria). Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to methotrexate were randomly assigned (1:1:2) to receive reference tocilizumab up to week 48, or reference tocilizumab up to week 24 followed by BAT1806/BIIB800 up to week 48 (the two reference tocilizumab groups were analysed as a single group in this analysis), or BAT1806/BIIB800 up to week 48 (the BAT1806/BIIB800 group), administered by intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks at a starting dose of 8 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who had a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 12 (for the European Medicines Agency [EMA]) or week 24 (for the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and China National Medical Products Administration [NMPA]) using prespecified equivalence margins (95% CI -14·5 to +14·5 [EMA], 90% CI -12·0 to +15·0 [FDA], and 95% CI -13·6 to +13·6 [NMPA]). The International Council for Harmonisation E9(R1) estimand framework, with strategies for addressing intercurrent events, was implemented for the efficacy evaluations with expected differences as per the predefined equivalence margins. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03830203) and EudraCT (2018-002202-31), and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Dec 19, 2018, and Jan 5, 2021, we randomly assigned 621 participants: 309 to the reference tocilizumab group and 312 to the BAT1806/BIIB800 group. The mean age was 50·5 years (SD 12·0), 534 (86%) were women, 87 (14%) were men, and 368 (59%) were White. For the primary estimands, estimated ACR20 response rates were 64·8% in the reference tocilizumab group and 69·0% in the BAT1806/BIIB800 group (treatment difference 4·1% [95% CI -3·6 to 11·9]) at week 12, and 67·9% in the reference tocilizumab group and 69·9% in the BAT1806/BIIB800 group (treatment difference 1·9% [90% CI -4·0 to 7·9; 95% CI -5·2 to 9·1]) at week 24. All confidence intervals were contained within the predefined equivalence margins. Comparable pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profiles were observed for the reference tocilizumab and BAT1806/BIIB800 groups. Adverse events were reported by 201 (65%) participants in the reference tocilizumab group and 206 (66%) in the BAT1806/BIIB800 group; 196 (63%) participants in the reference tocilizumab group and 201 (64%) participants in the BAT1806/BIIB800 group reported a treatment-emergent adverse event. Five participants had a fatal event (reference tocilizumab n=1; BAT1806/BIIB800 n=4).

Interpretation

BAT1806/BIIB800 showed equivalent efficacy, and comparable safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic profiles as reference tocilizumab.

### Systematic review of tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis: a new biologic agent targeting the interleukin-6 receptor [^aa8065e4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, represents a new treatment strategy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is currently approved in the United States for RA patients who have failed to improve with at least one anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.

Objective

The goal of this study was to summarize the efficacy and safety profile of TCZ.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify English-language articles within PubMed and the Cochrane Library from January 1989 to August 2011 reporting results from Phase III TCZ double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), noncontrolled clinical trials, and open-label extensions with a duration ≥6 months. Study outcomes had to include at least one of the following: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, 50, or 70 response rates; tender/swollen joint count; Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index; radiographic outcomes and drug persistence. Phase II RCTs were included only if they contained relevant information not available in Phase III RCTs. Relevant studies were selected to evaluate TCZ's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Results

Ten published clinical trials (7 Phase III, 3 Phase II) for TCZ were retrieved (7833 articles initially identified) from PubMed and 31 from the Cochrane library. Compared with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy, TCZ 8 mg/kg IV monotherapy had higher rates of ACR20 (P < 0.001), ACR50 (P = 0.002), and ACR70 (P < 0.001) scores at week 24. TCZ 8 mg/kg IV plus oral MTX had a higher ACR20 response rate than oral MTX plus placebo in patients with RA who failed to respond to MTX or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (P < 0.001). Patients receiving TCZ 8 mg/kg had less radiographic progression on the Genant-modified Sharp score (85% had no progression) than the control group (67% had no progression) (P < 0.001). The rate of serious infections was 4.7 events/100 patient-years of exposure in the TCZ groups. A greater frequency of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, and transaminitis was observed with TCZ compared with placebo.

Conclusion

The short-term efficacy and safety profile of TCZ is promising. Additional long-term safety data are needed to better characterize the risk-benefit profile of this agent.

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^39d7ca60]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.7	Clinical Trials Experience in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV)

The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab- IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase.

The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.

Infections

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 345 per 100 patient- years and 287 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of infections was 304 per 100 patient-years.

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of serious infections was 11.4 per 100 patient years. The most commonly reported serious infections included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, varicella, and otitis media.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of a proposed biosimilar MSB11456 with tocilizumab reference product in subjects with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis: results of a randomised double-blind study [^73ef2cf7]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the transition from EU-approved tocilizumab to MSB11456 at week 24, the proportions of patients with at least one event per TEAE category and the severity of those events up to week 55 did not differ notably from those in the groups continuing MSB11456 or EU-approved tocilizumab (online supplemental table 3).

Laboratory findings and vital signs during the 24-week core period and the overall period were similar between MSB11456 and EU-approved tocilizumab. Similarly, there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in the extended period (after treatment switch).

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^f6ccefb6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report the 2-year efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods

Patients ages 2-17 years with active polyarticular-course JIA, in whom treatment with methotrexate was unsuccessful, received 16 weeks of open-label intravenous TCZ in part 1 (once every 4 weeks: 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight [BW] <30 kg; 8 mg/kg for BW ≥30 kg). Assessments were based on the JIA-American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response (defined as percentage of improvement in ≥3 of the 6 JIA core response variables [CRVs]). Patients with at least a JIA-ACR30 response (defined as ≥30% improvement in ≥3 of the 6 JIA CRVs without worsening in >1 of the remaining JIA CRVs by >30%) at week 16 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TCZ or placebo in part 2. Patients remained in part 2 until either week 40 or the occurrence of JIA flare. Upon starting part 3, all patients received open-label TCZ. At week 104 of the study, efficacy was assessed using JIA-ACR50/70/90 response rates (defined as 50%, 70%, or 90% improvement, respectively), achievement of inactive disease, and the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score in 71 joints (JADAS-71). Safety was assessed in the all-exposure population per 100 patient-years of exposure.

Results

Overall, 188 patients entered part 1, 166 patients entered part 2, and 160 patients entered part 3. By week 104, among the 188 patients in the modified intent-to-treat group who received TCZ, JIA-ACR50/70/90 response rates were 80.3%/77.1%/59.6%, respectively, the median JADAS-71 score decreased from 3.6 at week 40 to 0.7 at week 104, 51.1% of patients had achieved inactive disease, and 31 of 66 patients who had been receiving glucocorticoids discontinued them. Adverse event (AE) and serious AE rates were 406.5 per 100 patient-years and 11.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively. The infection rate was 151.4 per 100 patient-years, and the serious infection rate was 5.2 per 100 patient-years.

Conclusion

Patients treated with TCZ for polyarticular-course JIA showed high-level disease control for up to 2 years. The TCZ safety profile was consistent with that previously reported.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^0a3d56d5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The study DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) was published by Tian Liu and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis. In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tocilizumab/methotrexate in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis? In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the population was: 204 patients (171 female, 33 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged 18-70 years, with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs. The key exclusion criteria were inflammatory joint disease other than rheumatoid arthritis; unsuccessful anti-TNF treatment; active infection or malignant disease. In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the interventions were: n=136 tocilizumab/methotrexate (subcutaneous tocilizumab 162 mg every 2 weeks plus oral methotrexate 10-25 mg once weekly) n=68 methotrexate (subcutaneous placebo every 2 weeks plus oral methotrexate 10-25 mg once weekly). In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in ACR 20% improvement response at week 24 (52.9% vs. 25%; AD 27.9%, 95% CI 14.7 to 41.2). In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in ACR 50% improvement response at week 24 (23.5% vs. 7.4%; AD 16.1%, 95% CI 6.7 to 25.6). In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in at least one adverse event. In the DMARD (tocilizumab/methotrexate vs. methotrexate) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged 18-70 years, with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs, tocilizumab/methotrexate was superior to methotrexate with respect to ACR 20% improvement response at week 24.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in refractory Takayasu arteritis: final results of the randomized controlled phase 3 TAKT study [^0f5e9318]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TAK).

Methods

Patients completing the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the TAKT (Takayasu arteritis Treated with Tocilizumab) trial were followed up during open-label extended treatment with weekly s.c. tocilizumab 162mg for up to 96weeks or longer, with oral glucocorticoid tapering performed at the investigators' discretion. Endpoints of the extension analysis included steroid-sparing effects of tocilizumab, imaging data, patient-reported outcomes (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) and safety.

Results

All 36 patients enrolled in the double-blind period entered the open-label extension; 28 patients received tocilizumab for 96weeks. The median glucocorticoid dose was 0.223mg/kg/day at the time of relapse before study entry, 0.131mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.099, 0.207) after 48weeks and 0.105mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.039, 0.153) after 96weeks. Overall, 46.4% of patients reduced their dose to <0.1mg/kg/day, which was less than half the dose administered at relapse before study entry (mean difference -0.120mg/kg/day; 95% CI -0.154, -0.087). Imaging evaluations indicated that most patients' disease was improved (17.9%) or stable (67.9%) after 96weeks compared with baseline. Mean 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scores and 7 of 8 domain scores were clinically improved from baseline and maintained over 96weeks of tocilizumab treatment. No unexpected safety issues were reported.

Conclusion

These results in patients with Takayasu arteritis provide evidence of a steroid-sparing effect and improvements in well-being during long-term treatment with once-weekly tocilizumab 162mg, with no new safety concerns.

### Longterm safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cumulative analysis of up to 4.6 years of exposure [^06f7c5a3]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the longterm safety and efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Patient data were from 5 randomized controlled TCZ trials (n = 4211), their open-label extension phases (n = 3512), and a drug interaction study (n = 23). All randomly assigned patients, regardless of previous RA treatment, were analyzed. Measures of safety included number of adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE), AE leading to treatment discontinuation, laboratory tests, and deaths. Efficacy measures included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), ACR core set components, and low disease activity (LDA) or Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) remission. ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease remission was a posthoc exploratory analysis.

Results

Total duration of observation was 12,293 patient-years (PY). No new safety signals were identified; infections were the most common AE and SAE. The rate of serious infections was 4.5/100 PY. Improvements from baseline in clinical efficacy, measured as ACR20/50/70 responses, TJC, SJC, ACR core set components, and LDA and DAS28 remission, were generally sustained through at least 216 weeks of followup. ACR/EULAR disease remission was attained by 16.5% (Boolean) and 22.7% (index) of patients at Week 216.

Conclusion

TCZ has to date been studied for up to 4.6 years (240 weeks) of treatment in patients with RA. Our analysis reveals a longer-term safety profile consistent with previous observations, no new safety signals, and durable efficacy of TCZ in a large clinical trial program.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab plus methotrexate on disease activity, physical function and radiographic progression: 5 years of sarilumab plus methotrexate treatment [^2616539b]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The safety and efficacy of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg plus MTX were previously demonstrated in MTX-IR patients with moderately to severely active RA in the 52-week double-blind study.Results from this 5-year analysis of the open-label extension study confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab in this group of patients.

The safety profile of sarilumab was stable over 5 years of follow-up and observations were generally consistent, not only with those in the randomised portion of the study but also with other studies in the sarilumab RA clinical programme.In addition, the safety findings are consistent with the anticipated safety profile of IL-6 blockade.No new safety signals emerged and the most common AEs were injection-site erythema, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infections and increased ALT. Occurrence of injection-site reactions was common (21.6 events per 100 PY) but consistent with long-term data for subcutaneous tocilizumab (26.1 events per 100 PY), another IL-6 receptor antagonist.Neutropenia was also common with sarilumab treatment, which is consistent with the phase III clinical trials of sarilumab and with this class of therapy.However, despite neutropenia occurring at a rate of 12.8 events per 100 PY at any sarilumab dose, the infection rate reported in these patients was low, which suggests that neutropenia related to sarilumab treatment is not associated with an increased risk of infection. Furthermore, the last ANC recorded before onset of infection or serious infection was normal in the majority of cases. These results are consistent with a post hoc analysis of three sarilumab phase III trials and patients entering the open-label extensions of two of these trials.The post hoc analysis also found that the majority of patients in the randomised controlled trials and open-label extensions who temporarily discontinued treatment with sarilumab due to low ANC were able to continue or reinitiate sarilumab with no apparent clinically meaningful impact on long-term efficacy or safety.Published data suggest that patients with RA are at a twofold higher risk of herpes zoster infection than individuals without RA,but the reported rate was low in the open-label extension (0.5 events per 100 PY) and comparable to the general population (0.3–0.5 events per 100 PY).While the absolute incidence of AEs was lower in the patients initially randomised to sarilumab 150 mg than those receiving the 200 mg dose, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates were higher. This result should be interpreted with caution, due to the limited duration of exposure in the sarilumab 150 mg group and the relatively small number of events. Furthermore, the absolute incidence of AEs in the double-blind phase was lower in patients randomised to sarilumab 150 mg than those randomised to sarilumab 200 mg.No increases in rates of AEs or SAEs were observed with increasing exposure duration and the incidence rates of AEs and laboratory abnormalities generally remained stable when analysed over time by 6-month interval. Furthermore, the incidences of injection-site reactions and ALT >3× ULN declined over time.

In the DMARD (tocilizumab vs. methotrexate) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in ACR 20% improvement response at week 24 (50% vs. 25%; AD 25%, 95% CI 11.7 to 38.3). In the DMARD (tocilizumab vs. methotrexate) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in ACR 50% improvement response at week 24 (21.3% vs. 7.3%; AD 14%, 95% CI 4.7 to 23.2). In the DMARD (tocilizumab vs. methotrexate) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in at least one adverse event. In the DMARD (tocilizumab vs. methotrexate) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged 18-70 years, with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis with an inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs, tocilizumab was superior to methotrexate with respect to ACR 20% improvement response at week 24.

### Efficacy and safety of CT-P47 versus reference tocilizumab: 32-week results of a randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase III study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including 8 weeks of switching data from reference tocilizumab to CT-P47 [^ac0b5e9d]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

With their increased affordability, biosimilars can facilitate access to biologics in individuals who may not otherwise have received such drugs, thereby enabling better outcomes for patients.Biosimilars to several biological DMARDs are currently available.As a candidate TCZ biosimilar, CT-P47 has potential to improve the management of patients with RA. Given that TCZ is also approved for disorders other than RA, extrapolation of indications for TCZ biosimilars can broaden their use across several diseases.Subsequent to the approval of the intravenous formulation of r-TCZ, studies showing similar efficacy and safety supported the approval of an SC formulation.While SC r-TCZ may be widely used, the potential for cost saving with an intravenous formulation of a TCZ biosimilar is equally relevant.When treating RA, though TCZ may be a more effective monotherapy than other biologics,patients in the current study were receiving concomitant MTX, in line with previous TCZ trials,studies that favoured combining TCZ with MTXand management recommendations.

### Tocilizumab (Actemra) [^e4196eb5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study II (NCT00106535) was a 104-week study with an optional 156-week extension phase that evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). Upon completion of 52-weeks, patients received open-label treatment with ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg through 104 weeks or they had the option to continue their double-blind treatment if they maintained a greater than 70% improvement in swollen/tender joint count. Two pre-specified interim analyses at week 24 and week 52 were conducted. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At weeks 52 and 104, the primary endpoints were change from baseline in modified total Sharp-Genant score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score.

Study III (NCT00106548) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study IV (NCT00106574) evaluated patients who had an inadequate response to their existing therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg or placebo every four weeks, in combination with the stable DMARDs. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study V (NCT00106522) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomization. Patients received ACTEMRA 8 mg per kg, ACTEMRA 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

### Impact of tocilizumab monotherapy on patient-reported outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis from two randomised controlled trials [^d6022e46]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with TCZ, MTX or ADA monotherapy was effective in improving PROs, including HRQOL, in patients with active RA. Although patients receiving MTX or ADA reported improvements across all PROs, TCZ-treated patients reported equivalent or greater improvements. Overall, TCZ was more effective over 24 weeks than MTX in patients without prior inadequate responses to MTX or TNFis and was more effective as a first-line biologic than ADA in patients for whom continued treatment with MTX was inappropriate. Results of these trials indicate that it is now possible for patients with RA to achieve PRO scores that more closely approach those reported by healthy populations.

Tocilizumab alone or in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologics compared to placebo or other DMARDs or biologics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted all data including major (ACR50, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawals, specific adverse events) and secondary outcomes. We calculated the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

Eight RCTs were included in this systematic review with 3334 participants; 2233 treated with tocilizumab and 1101 controls. Of the 2233, 1561 were treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every four weeks, which is the approved dose. In patients taking concomitant methotrexate, compared to placebo, tocilizumab-treated patients were four times more likely to achieve ACR50 (absolute %, 38.8% versus 9.6%), 11 times more likely to achieve Disease Activity Score (DAS) remission (absolute %, 30.5% versus 2.7%), 1.8 times more likely to achieve clinically meaningful decrease in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ/mHAQ) scores (absolute %, 60.5% versus 34%), 1.2 times more likely to have any adverse event (absolute %, 74% versus 65%) and 0.6 times less likely to withdraw from therapy for any reason (absolute %, 8.1% versus 14.9%). With the limitation that none of the studies were powered for safety as primary outcome, there were no statistically significant differences in serious adverse effects, or withdrawals due to adverse events. A significant increase in total, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride level was seen in the tocilizumab treated patients.

Authors' Conclusions

Tocilizumab is beneficial in decreasing RA disease activity and improving function. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with significant increase in cholesterol levels and in total adverse events. Larger safety studies are needed to address these safety concerns.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^243ae50c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

AEs grade 3 or greater were reported in 23 (16.9%), 15 (11.0%), and 3 (4.4%) patients in the combination, monotherapy, and placebo groups, respectively, and in 52 patients (15.9%) in the all-tocilizumab group across the study period. Rates of AEs grade 3 or greater per 100 patient-years were numerically higher in the combination group (21.4 [95% CI, 14.3-30.7]) and in the monotherapy group (26.8 [95% CI, 16.4-41.4]) compared with the placebo group (10.3 [95% CI, 2.1-30.0]), with a rate of 21.9 (95% CI, 17.0-27.8) per 100 patient-years in the all-tocilizumab group (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). AEs leading to any study drug discontinuation were reported for 12 (8.8%), 4 (2.9%), and 2 (2.9%) patients in the combination, monotherapy, and placebo groups, respectively, and for 22 patients (6.7%) in the all-tocilizumab group. No deaths were reported.

6.7 Clinical Trials Experience in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV)

The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab-IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase.

The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.

Infections

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 345 per 100 patient-years and 287 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of infections was 304 per 100 patient-years.

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of serious infections was 11.4 per 100 patient years. The most commonly reported serious infections included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, varicella, and otitis media.

### Clinical, radiographic and functional effectiveness of tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis patients – REACTION 52-week study [^61603c52]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Retention rate during 52 weeks of treatment with tocilizumab

The retention rate of this study was 92.0% at Week 12, 83.0% at Week 24 and 71.1% at Week 52. Sixty-seven (28.9%) patients discontinued tocilizumab treatment because of adverse events (AEs) (38/67, 56.7%), lack of efficacy (21/67, 31.3%), remission (1/67, 1.5%) and other reasons (7/67, 10.4%). Retention rate was higher for patients with concomitant MTX than for those without it (77.1 vs 66.0%), and was lower for those with concomitant GCs than those without (68.7 vs 78.4%), while it did not differ between those with or without previous treatment with anti-TNF biologics (72.5 vs 70.9%).

### Efficacy and safety of CT-P47 versus reference tocilizumab: 32-week results of a randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase III study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including 8 weeks of switching data from reference tocilizumab to CT-P47 [^e8167e88]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To demonstrate efficacy equivalence of CT-P47 and EU-approved reference tocilizumab (r-TCZ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

This double-blind, phase III study randomised (1:1) patients to receive CT-P47 or r-TCZ (8mg/kg) every 4 weeks until week 20 during treatment period (TP) 1. Prior to week 24 dosing, patients receiving r-TCZ were randomised (1:1) to continue r-TCZ or switch to CT-P47; patients receiving CT-P47 continued CT-P47 (TP2, 8mg/kg every 4 weeks until week 48). The dual primary endpoints (for different regulatory requirements) were mean changes from baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) at week 12 and week 24. Efficacy equivalence was determined if CIs for the treatment difference were within predefined equivalence margins: (95%CI -0.6, 0.6 (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)) at week 12 or 90%CI -0.6, 0.5 (ANCOVA with multiple imputation) at week 24). Additional efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety endpoints, including immunogenicity, were investigated. Findings up to week 32 are presented.

Results

In TP1, 471 patients were randomised (234 CT-P47; 237 r-TCZ). The 95% and 90% CIs for the estimated treatment differences were contained within the predefined equivalence margins; the estimated difference in DAS28-ESR at week 12 was -0.01 (95% CI -0.26, 0.24) and at week 24 was -0.10 (90% CI -0.30, 0.10). Secondary efficacy endpoints, PKs and overall safety were comparable between groups up to week 32.

Conclusions

Efficacy equivalence, alongside comparable PK, safety and immunogenicity profiles, was determined between CT-P47 and r-TCZ in adults with RA, including after switching from r-TCZ to CT-P47.

### Two years of sarilumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to MTX: safety, efficacy and radiographic outcomes [^07f001eb]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Upon completion of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients could enrol in the long-term extension study in which all patients received sarilumab 200 mg q2w plus MTX. As RA is a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment, the primary objective of the OLE was to examine the long-term safety of sarilumab. In this analysis of treatment with sarilumab for 2 years, the safety profile was consistent with the anticipated effects of IL-6R inhibition, and no new safety concerns were identified. Discontinuation rates were similar across original randomization groups. The most common non-laboratory TEAEs were injection site erythema, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. Malignancies, MACE and lower GI perforations were infrequent. The most common laboratory abnormalities were neutropenia and elevations in ALT.

These 2-year observations are consistent with the sarilumab safety profile observed in other sarilumab clinical trials of shorter duration and are consistent with previously published studies of other IL-6R inhibitors, including the long-term safety for tocilizumab when administered intravenously or subcutaneously. The 2-year attrition was comparable to that observed at year 2 in a long-term extension study for tocilizumab. In addition, decreased ANC was not associated with increased rates of infections, which is in alignment with observations from previous studies with sarilumab and an analysis of pooled data from phases III to IV studies of tocilizumab.

Extension studies have shown that the clinical benefits achieved with active therapy with biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs can be sustained in the long term. Durable clinical responses were maintained with sarilumab 200 mg q2w, even with dose reduction to 150 mg q2w to manage changes in laboratory parameters. Disease activity and radiographic progression were reduced with sarilumab, after initiation in the randomized study or after switch to sarilumab 200 mg q2w in the OLE. Across the initial randomization groups, DAS28-CRP and CDAI scores reached the same levels, and percentages of patients achieving CDAI remission and DAS28-CRP <2.6 were similar.

### Tocilizumab-aazg (Tyenne) [^0ad22877]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The proportions of patients with JIA ACR 50/70 responses in Part I were 84.0%, and 64%, respectively for patients taking background MTX in addition to tocilizumab and 80% and 55% respectively for patients on tocilizumab monotherapy.

In Part II, patients (ITT, n=163) were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio that was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR 30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR 30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. JIA ACR 30 flare was defined as 3 or more of the 6 core outcome variables worsening by at least 30% with no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving by more than 30% relative to Week 16.

Tocilizumab treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% [21/82] versus 48% [39/81]; adjusted difference in proportions -21%, 95% CI: -35%, -8%).

During the withdrawal phase (Part II), more patients treated with tocilizumab showed JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 40 compared to patients withdrawn to placebo.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab plus methotrexate on disease activity, physical function and radiographic progression: 5 years of sarilumab plus methotrexate treatment [^857bbef7]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has previously been described.The study was an operationally seamless phase II/III study. Part A was the phase II dose-ranging portion, and part B was the phase III portion of the study. Two cohorts of patients were enrolled in part B: those who were randomised before dose selection (cohort 1) and those who were randomised after dose selection (cohort 2). In part B cohort 2, MTX-IR adult patients with moderately to severely active RA were randomised (1:1:1) to placebo, sarilumab 150 mg or sarilumab 200 mg subcutaneously q2w in combination with weekly MTX for 52 weeks. After 16 weeks, patients with <20% improvement from baseline in either swollen joint count or tender joint count at two consecutive visits were offered rescue therapy with open-label sarilumab 200 mg q2w for the remainder of the study. Patients who completed the study were eligible for enrolment in the open-label extension in which they received sarilumab 200 mg q2w plus MTX. All patients continued to receive MTX background therapy, which could be reduced, discontinued or switched to an alternative approved non-biological DMARD for safety or tolerability reasons. Reasons for MTX discontinuation were not recorded. Patients were excluded from the open-label extension if they had adverse events (AEs) or other abnormalities that would adversely affect participation in the study, determined according to investigator judgement or protocol. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and with the principles stipulated in the Declaration of Helsinki; all protocols and patient information materials were approved by appropriate ethical review boards and all patients provided written informed consent.

### ICHIBAN, a non-interventional study evaluating tocilizumab long-term effectiveness and safety in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [^c1b63996]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to measure long-term effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in daily German practice.

Methods

ICHIBAN was a prospective, multi-centre, non-interventional study (ML22928) that enrolled adult patients with active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Patients were to be treated according to tocilizumab label and observed for up to two years. Effectiveness outcomes included DAS28-ESR remission, EULAR response, CDAI and HAQ.

Results

Overall, 3164 patients received at least one dose of tocilizumab. Patient mean age was 55.5±13.1 years (74.8% female). At baseline, 72.1% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Approximately 50.9% of patients received concomitant csDMARDs, mostly methotrexate, and 80.7% received concomitant glucocorticoids (GCs). In patients receiving GCs at baseline, the mean dose decreased from 9.32±16.36 mg/d to 4.60±4.48 mg/d at week 104. In the effectiveness population with no prior TCZ (n=2902), 61.4% of patients achieved the primary outcome, DAS28-ESR remission. Improvements were seen as early as week 4. At week 104, 77.9% of patients had DAS28-ESR low disease activity, 89.6% achieved good or moderate EULAR response, and 29.5% achieved a CDAI-based remission. Effectiveness outcomes were similar in all previous therapy subgroups. The incidence of serious infections was similar to the rates in former studies involving tocilizumab. Patients receiving GC at baseline experienced slightly higher rates of treatment-related serious adverse events, mainly infections. No new safety signals were observed.

Conclusions

Long-term effectiveness and safety in ICHIBAN were in line with previously reported tocilizumab efficacy and safety studies.

### Clinical, radiographic and functional effectiveness of tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis patients – REACTION 52-week study [^fc2284eb]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a fundamental role in the inflammatory processes leading to destructive arthritis in patients with RA. Biological agents against pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α have dramatically changed the management of patients with RA. It is now recommended to treat RA patients to achieve clinical remission by early and tight control of disease activity with intensive medication. Recent clinical trials have shown that treatment with anti-TNF biologics in combination with MTX in early RA can lead to clinical remission in ~50% of patients ; however, the remaining half of the patients are either those not able to achieve clinical remission or discontinued anti-TNF biologics and switched to other medications. A new biological agent, tocilizumab, targeting the IL-6 receptor has recently been approved for use in patients with RA in more than 40 countries around the world, including Japan, drawing attention to the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in clinical practice. Generally, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluation of the efficacy of newly developed agents. However, RCTs are artificial and may not reflect efficacy and safety in the real rheumatology world.

While we have reported the effectiveness of tocilizumab at Week 24, there is no report that evaluates all efficacy with regard to clinical remission, structural remission and functional remission of tocilizumab comprehensively under daily clinical practice. Hence we undertook the Retrospective Actemra Investigation for Optimal Needs of RA Patients (REACTION 52-week study) to confirm the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in daily clinical practice.

### Comparative effectiveness of subcutaneous tocilizumab versus intravenous tocilizumab in a pan-European collaboration of registries [^a788a450]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

In our cohort, seropositivity was associated to a lower CDAI at any time during follow-up. A higher remission rate has been described in RF-positive patients treated with TCZ, but this was not reproduced in ACPA-positive patients in another cohort.

Retention was higher with TCZ-IV2SC than TCZ-IV-only patients. Unfortunately, our data did not allow us to evaluate the reasons of switching between routes of delivery. It is possible that this reflects a selected population with better effectiveness, tolerance and compliance, who switched for practical reasons but were already considered as responders. These results are in line with two previous studies looking at patients switching from TCZ-IV to TCZ-SC. In the 84-week, open-label extension of the MUSASHI trial, 160 patients switched from TCZ-IV to TCZ-SC and efficacy was maintained after switch.Another small trial with 57 Japanese patients did not find a change of efficacy after switching from TCZ-IV to TCZ-SC after a follow-up of 3 months.However, our study is the first to evaluate switching from TCZ-IV to TCZ-SC in a large non-Japanese population. In the TCZ-SC2IV subgroup, the descriptive analysis of CDAI also showed a similar trend in efficacy before and after switch than other subgroups; however, the TCZ-SC2IV subgroup was too small and the duration of follow-up too short to draw any definitive conclusion.

As in previous studies, we did not find an effect of BMI on both TCZ formulations as assessed by drug retention or clinical effectiveness.

Our study has several limitations. Data quality of registries is often less thorough than in clinical trials. In particular, we do not have enough details on causes of discontinuation or switching to allow further analysis. We have also no data on adherence that may be different between the TCZ-IV and TCZ-SC. Adherence is reported to be lower with subcutaneous bDMARDs and more frequent dosing schedule.Despite this, we did not find a difference in effectiveness when comparing TCZ-SC with TCZ-IV. Finally, we do not have data outside of the bDMARDs courses and thus could not explore other aspects as for example the rate of biologic-free remission between groups.

### New-onset versus relapsing giant cell arteritis treated with tocilizumab: 3-year results from a randomized controlled trial and extension [^567ad58f]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Tocilizumab plus prednisone induces sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with GCA. However, its long-term benefits in new-onset vs relapsing disease are uncertain, and the value of weekly vs every-other-week dosing has not been evaluated.

Methods

In Giant-Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) part 1, patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA received blinded tocilizumab weekly (TCZ QW), tocilizumab every-other-week (TCZ Q2W) or placebo for 52weeks, with a prednisone taper. In part 2 (open-label), patients were treated at investigator discretion for 104weeks. In this analysis, patients were evaluated according to their original treatment assignments, and outcomes beyond 52weeks were assessed. Outcomes of interest included time to first flare and cumulative glucocorticoid exposure over 3years according to baseline disease status.

Results

Part 1 enrolled 250 patients; 215 entered part 2. At baseline, 48% had new-onset disease and 52% had relapsing disease. In patients with new-onset and relapsing disease, the median time to first flare in the TCZ QW group was 577 and 575days, respectively, vs 479 and 428days with TCZ Q2W and 179 and 224days with placebo; the median cumulative glucocorticoid dose was 3068mg and 2191mg with TCZ QW, 4080mg and 2353mg with TCZ Q2W, and 4639mg and 6178mg with placebo.

Conclusion

TCZ QW delayed the time to flare and reduced the cumulative glucocorticoid dose in patients with relapsing GCA and new-onset GCA. These data support initiating TCZ QW as part of first-line therapy in all patients with active GCA.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (ADACTA): a randomised, double-blind, controlled phase 4 trial [^bdf5b939]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Roughly a third of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological treatments receive them as monotherapy. Tocilizumab--an inhibitor of interleukin 6 receptor signalling--has been studied as monotherapy in several clinical trials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

We did this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 4 superiority study in 76 centres in 15 countries in North and South America, Australasia, and Europe. We enrolled patients who were aged at least 18 years, had severe rheumatoid arthritis for 6 months or more, and were intolerant to methotrexate or were inappropriate for continued methotrexate treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; block size of four) to receive tocilizumab 8 mg per kg bodyweight intravenously every 4 weeks plus placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks or adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks plus placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Investigators, patients, and sponsor personnel were masked to assignment. The primary endpoint was change in disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) from baseline to week 24. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01119859.

Findings

We screened 452 patients and enrolled 326 patients. The intention-to-treat population contained 325 patients (163 assigned to tocilizumab, 162 assigned to adalimumab). Week 24 mean change from baseline in DAS28 was significantly greater in the tocilizumab group (-3·3) than in the adalimumab group (-1·8) patients (difference -1·5, 95% CI -1·8 to -1·1; p<0·0001). 16 of 162 (10%) patients in the adalimumab group versus 19 of 162 (12%) in the tocilizumab group had serious adverse events. More patients in the tocilizumab group than in the adalimumab group had increased LDL-cholesterol, increased alanine aminotransferase concentrations, and reduced platelet and neutrophil counts.

Interpretation

Tocilizumab monotherapy was superior to adalimumab monotherapy for reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients for whom methotrexate was deemed inappropriate. The adverse event profiles of tocilizumab and adalimumab were consistent with previous findings.

### Tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis: a cochrane systematic review [^a82d3c98]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

to compare the benefit and safety of tocilizumab to placebo in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

we searched multiple databases for published randomized or controlled clinical trials comparing benefit and safety of tocilizumab to placebo, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), or other biologics. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk, and for continuous outcomes, the mean difference.

Results

eight randomized controlled trials were included in this systematic review, with 3334 participants, 2233 treated with tocilizumab and 1101 controls. The US and Canadian approved dose of tocilizumab, 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, was given to 1561 participants. In patients taking concomitant methotrexate, compared to placebo, patients treated with approved dose of tocilizumab were substantially and statistically significantly more likely than placebo to achieve the American College of Rheumatology 50 (absolute percentage, 38.8% vs 9.6%, respectively; RR 3.2, 95% CI 2.7, 3.7); Disease Activity Score remission (30.5% vs 2.7%; RR 8.7, 95% CI 6.3, 11.8); and a clinically meaningful decrease in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)/Modified HAQ scores (60.5% vs 34%; RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6, 1.9). There were no substantive statistically significant differences in serious adverse effects (0.8% vs 0.7%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8, 1.6) or withdrawals due to adverse events (4.9% vs 3.7%; RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9, 2.1); however, tocilizumab-treated patients were significantly more likely to have any adverse event (74% vs 65%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.07); elevation in the ratio of low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; 20% vs 12%; RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.2); and increase in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (12% vs 7%; RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2, 2.6); and they were less likely to withdraw from treatment for any reason (8.1% vs 14.9%; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5, 0.8).

Conclusion

at the approved dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, tocilizumab in combination with methotrexate/DMARD is beneficial in decreasing RA disease activity and improving function. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with a significant increase in cholesterol levels and occurrence of any adverse event, but not serious adverse events. Larger safety studies are needed to address these safety concerns.

### Do biologics-naïve patients with rheumatoid arthritis respond better to tocilizumab than patients for whom anti-TNF agents have failed? A retrospective study [^1e960861]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine responses to tocilizumab between patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who switched to anti-TNF agents and those who are biologics-naïve.

Methods

This retrospective study investigated 107 patients with RA who were treated with tocilizumab. At baseline, 61 of them had already been treated with anti-TNF agents (switched group; 46 for inefficacy and 15 for adverse events), and 46 were biologics-naïve (naïve group). Treatment responses to tocilizumab at week 12 and 24 were compared between the switched and naïve groups using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28).

Results

Forty-two (91.3%) and 50 (82.0%) patients in the naïve and switched groups, respectively, completed 24 weeks of tocilizumab treatment. The DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values (means±SD) at weeks 12 and 24 compared to baseline decreased significantly for the naïve and switched groups. The DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values at weeks 12 and 24 were significantly decreased in the naïve group, compared to the switched group. Disease activity was improved in the naïve patients compared to the switched patients.

Conclusions

Tocilizumab was safe, tolerable, and clinically effective for patients with inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy and for those who were biologics-naïve, and it was more effective among the latter.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^cffac312]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessments

Evaluation of long‐term efficacy was based on the modified intent‐to‐treat (mITT) population, defined as all patients enrolled in part 1 who received ≥1 dose of TCZ. Some long‐term efficacy end points were assessed in the long‐term extension (LTE) population, defined as all patients treated in part 1 who received blinded or open‐label TCZ during part 2 or part 3. Additional analyses were performed in patients who were randomly assigned to receive TCZ in part 2 and hence received TCZ from baseline through week 104 (TCZ continuous group). To investigate the effects of interrupting TCZ treatment, efficacy was evaluated separately in patients who were randomly assigned to the placebo group in part 2; these patients reinitiated treatment with open‐label TCZ upon receiving escape therapy in part 2 or upon entering part 3 of the study (TCZ restart group). The TCZ restart group included patients from the time they restarted TCZ treatment, either as escape therapy from the second visit in part 2 or as open‐label therapy in part 3; therefore, 84 weeks was the maximum length of TCZ treatment that could have been received at the end of the study in the TCZ restart group.

### Tocilizumab (Actemra) [^1067f882]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Part II, patients (ITT, n=163) were randomized to ACTEMRA (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio that was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR 30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR 30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. JIA ACR 30 flare was defined as 3 or more of the 6 core outcome variables worsening by at least 30% with no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving by more than 30% relative to Week 16.

ACTEMRA treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% [21/82] versus 48% [39/81]; adjusted difference in proportions -21%, 95% CI: -35%, -8%).

During the withdrawal phase (Part II), more patients treated with ACTEMRA showed JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 40 compared to patients withdrawn to placebo.

Discussion

The results of this randomised, double-blind trial demonstrate that, as expected for tocilizumab, efficacy was shown as early as week 2, increased through the first 12–16 weeks of treatment and was sustained to week 24 and week 52, thereafter. The efficacy profile of MSB11456 was therapeutically equivalent to that of EU-approved tocilizumab when subcutaneously administered weekly for 24 weeks at a dose of 162 mg to patients with moderate-to-severe active RA receiving concomitant methotrexate. Therapeutic equivalence between MSB11456 and EU-approved tocilizumab was demonstrated for the primary endpoint (change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 24), for the key secondary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 response at week 24) and for the early efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 12). Multiple other efficacy endpoints commonly used to assess the efficacy of therapeutics in patients with RAalso supported the therapeutic similarity of MSB11456 and EU-approved tocilizumab and similar efficacy was observed between MSB11456 and EU-approved tocilizumab at each assessment time point. The study also showed that it is possible to switch from EU-approved tocilizumab to MSB11456 without any clinically relevant effect on efficacy, immunogenicity or safety parameters.

Reductions in glucocorticoid and MTX doses

Among patients who were receiving oral glucocorticoids at baseline (n = 86) (Table 1) and who had data available at week 104 (n = 66), 31 patients (47%) had discontinued oral glucocorticoids and 23 patients (35%) were receiving a reduced oral glucocorticoid dose by week 104. The mean daily oral glucocorticoid dose in the all‐exposure population (n = 188) was 0.06 mg/kg/day (median 0.00 [range 0.00–0.24]) at baseline and 0.02 mg/kg/day (median 0.00 [range 0.00–0.40]) at week 104 (n = 155 [LOCF; patients who withdrew were excluded]).

Among 127 of the 148 patients who were receiving MTX at baseline and had week 104 data available, 13 patients (10%) were receiving a reduced MTX dose by week 104, and 12 patients (9%) had discontinued MTX entirely. The mean ± SD MTX dose in the all‐exposure population decreased from 10.3 ± 7.4 mg/m 2 /week at baseline (n = 187) to 7.9 ± 6.4 mg/m 2 /week at week 104 (n = 155).

Patient‐reported outcomes

Mean CHAQ DI scores decreased from 0.48 at week 40 to 0.28 at week 104 in the LTE population (Supplementary Figure 3,). Pain markedly decreased from baseline to week 104 in the TCZ continuous population (decrease in the mean ± SEM VAS score from 45.0 ± 3.1 to 10.3 ± 2.3) and in the TCZ restart population (Supplementary Figure 4,). Improvement was also seen in the patient/parent global assessment VAS score (mean ± SD change from baseline –36.6 ± 26.70 mm).

### Early and late responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug inadequate responders and were treated with tocilizumab or switched to rituximab: an open-label phase 3 trial (MIRAI) [^c35f4c6f]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate early and late responses in biological-naïve patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating tocilizumab and early tocilizumab non-responders who switched to rituximab.

Methods

In this open-label, non-randomised phase 3 study, RA patients with inadequate response to conventional synthetic DMARDs received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously at study begin and weeks 4, 8 and 12. After evaluation at week 16, early responders (Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] <2.6) completed the study; partial responders (DAS28-ESR decrease >1.2 or DAS28-ESR ≥2.6-≤3.2) were to continue tocilizumab through week 28; non-responders (DAS28-ESR decrease ≤1.2) switched to rituximab (1000 mg, weeks 16 and 18) with safety follow-up through week 66.

Results

Of 519 patients, 222 (42.8%) achieved early DAS28-ESR remission at week 16; 240 patients continued treatment, 213 (41.0%) received tocilizumab, and 27 (5.2%) switched to rituximab. At week 32 DAS28-ESR remission was achieved by 117/213 patients (54.9%) who continued tocilizumab and 4/27 patients (14.8%) who switched to rituximab; good EULAR response was achieved by 66.7% and 25.9% and CDAI remission by 19.2% and 14.8% of patients, respectively. Serious adverse events occurred through week 32 in 45/490 patients (9.2%) who received tocilizumab (serious infections, 2.7%) and through week 66 in 8/27 patients (29.6%) who switched to rituximab.

Conclusions

Early response to tocilizumab was observed in 42.8% of patients. Half of early partial responders benefitted from continuing tocilizumab. Switching non-responders to rituximab seems feasible. No new safety signals were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab or switched to rituximab.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^c5056ca4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic Features

Of patients with fever or rash at baseline, those treated with tocilizumab had fewer systemic features; 35 out of 41 (85%) became fever free (no temperature recording at or above 37.5°C in the preceding 14 days) compared to 5 out of 24 (21%) of placebo-treated patients, and 14 out of 22 (64%) became free of rash compared to 2 out of 18 (11%) of placebo-treated patients. Responses were consistent in the open label extension (data available through 44 weeks).

Corticosteroid Tapering

Of the patients receiving oral corticosteroids at baseline, 8 out of 31 (26%) placebo and 48 out of 70 (69%), tocilizumab patients achieved a JIA ACR 70 response at week 6 or 8 enabling corticosteroid dose reduction. Seventeen (24%) tocilizumab patients versus 1 (3%) placebo patient were able to reduce the dose of corticosteroid by at least 20% without experiencing a subsequent JIA ACR 30 flare or occurrence of systemic symptoms to week 12. In the open label portion of the study, by week 44, there were 44 out of 103 (43%) tocilizumab patients off oral corticosteroids. Of these 44 patients 50% were off corticosteroids 18 weeks or more.

Health Related Outcomes

Physical function and disability were assessed using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (CHAQ-DI). Seventy-seven percent (58 out of 75) of patients in the tocilizumab treatment group achieved a minimal clinically important improvement in CHAQ-DI (change from baseline of ≥ 0.13 units) at week 12 compared to 19% (7 out of 37) in the placebo treatment group.

14.5 COVID-19 - Intravenous Administration

The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 was based on RECOVERY (NCT04381936), a randomized, controlled, open-label, platform study, and supported by the results from EMPACTA (NCT04372186), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Results of two other randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, COVACTA (NCT04320615) and REMDACTA (NCT04409262), which evaluated the efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of COVID-19 are also summarized.

### Subcutaneous tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: findings from the common-framework phase 4 study programme TOZURA conducted in 22 countries [^a6ab2418]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment persistence with TCZ-SC was lower in the monotherapy group compared with combination therapy. This difference in persistence may be due to unobserved differences in characteristics between the two groups. Patients in the monotherapy group were more likely to have received prior bDMARD treatment and less likely to be receiving glucocorticoids at baseline compared with the combination therapy group. However, the propensity score–based analysis indicated these confounders did not fully explain the difference in persistence.

Safety outcomes at 24 weeks in all patients were consistent with previous studies and were similar between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups. The rate of AEs in this study per 100 PY was consistent with the rate observed in the ACT-SURE study, an open-label clinical trial with a similar patient population (622.4 vs 593), except for the known difference of more frequent injection site reactions occurring with TCZ-SC compared with TCZ-IV. The rate of SAEs for TCZ-SC qw monotherapy in this study per 100 PY was similar to the rate observed for TCZ-SC monotherapy in the 2-year long-term extension of the MUSASHI study, which also studied TCZ-SC qw monotherapy (22.8 vs 16.9). The rate of SAEs for combination therapy in this study was also similar to the rates in the 97-week long-term extension of the SUMMACTA trial for TCZ-SC with concomitant csDMARDs (12.8 vs 14.61). Serious infections were the most commonly reported SAE in this study, occurring at rates similar to those reported for TCZ-SC monotherapy in the MUSASHI long-term extension (4.0 vs 5.3) and for combination therapy in the SUMMACTA long-term extension (3.5 vs 3.95).

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^0be1edfb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to the interpretation of these long‐term data because there was no comparator after week 40, given the open‐label nature of part 3. Comparison of patients who received TCZ continuously throughout the study with those who received placebo treatment during part 2 enabled limited estimation of the effect of stopping and restarting TCZ treatment. Low patient numbers in the subgroup analyses should be noted in the interpretation of responses according to previous or concurrent medications and baseline disease characteristics. The number of polyarticular‐course JIA patients receiving TCZ monotherapy was relatively low, and analyses were not corrected for other patient characteristics such as disease duration and/or failure of other biologic treatments. Therefore, additional research is needed to evaluate the added benefits of MTX background therapy in polyarticular‐course JIA patients treated with TCZ. Longer‐term follow‐up and the availability of comparator groups from patients who have not received TCZ or who are treated with other biologic medications is needed for full understanding of the long‐term efficacy and safety of TCZ when used to treat polyarticular‐course JIA. An observational polyarticular‐course JIA registry study is being conducted to assess the longer‐term safety and effectiveness of up to 5 years of treatment with TCZ versus a comparator biologic.

In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that improvements in the signs and symptoms of polyarticular‐course JIA in children treated with TCZ were maintained or improved during longer‐term treatment up to 2 years and that the safety profile of TCZ remained consistent with that established in a much larger number of adults with RA, with no evidence of increasing toxicities over this period of time.

14.1	Rheumatoid Arthritis – Intravenous Administration

The efficacy and safety of intravenously administered tocilizumab was assessed in five randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies in patients greater than 18 years with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. Tocilizumab was given intravenously every 4 weeks as monotherapy (Study I), in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (Studies II and III) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study IV) in patients with an inadequate response to those drugs, or in combination with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to TNF antagonists (Study V).

Study I (NCT00109408) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had not been treated with MTX within 24 weeks prior to randomization, or who had not discontinued previous methotrexate treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. In this study, 67% of patients were MTX-naïve, and over 40% of patients had rheumatoid arthritis less than 2 years. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy or MTX alone (dose titrated over 8 weeks from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of tocilizumab patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24.

### Rheumatoid arthritis treatment after methotrexate: the durability of triple therapy versus etanercept [^5776660c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Although it is common for rheumatologists to initiate biologic agents after failure of methotrexate monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ample data support the initial use of combinations of conventional therapies in this clinical scenario. Our study explores the durability of triple therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine) versus methotrexate-etanercept in RA.

Methods

RA patients with suboptimal response to methotrexate (n=353) were randomized to either triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept therapy in a 48-week, double-blinded, noninferiority trial. Patients without clinical improvement at 24 weeks were switched to the alternative treatment. Of the total, 289 participated in followup. We report treatment durability, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and other measures during an open-label extension for an additional period up to 72 weeks.

Results

Mean±SD duration of open-label followup was 11±6 months. The likelihood of continuing conventional therapy at 1 year was 78% for triple therapy versus 63% for methotrexate-etanercept, with most treatment changes occurring at the start of followup. More patients changed from methotrexate-etanercept to triple therapy than from triple therapy to methotrexate-etanercept (P=0.005). DAS28 scores and other disease activity measures were not different for the 2 treatments and were stable during followup.

Conclusion

In RA patients with suboptimal methotrexate response randomized to receive triple therapy or methotrexate-etanercept, the former was found to be significantly more durable. Given cost differences and similar outcomes, the variable durability demonstrated provides additional evidence supporting conventional combinations over biologic agent combinations as the first choice after methotrexate inadequate response.

Trials investigating routes of administration

SUMMACTA compared subcutaneous (SC) versus intravenous formulations (IV) of TCZ in cs-/bDMARD-IR RA patients. TCZ-SC 162 mg weekly (QW) was non-inferior to TCZ-IV 8 mg/kg.In the multicentre, double-blind MUSASHI study, TCZ-SC every other week (Q2W) confirmed the non-inferiority of TCZ-SC monotherapy to TCZ-IV monotherapy in Japanese patients with an IR to csDMARDs and/or bDMARDs.An 84-week open-label extension period of the MUSASHI study evaluated the efficacy of switch from weight-titrated–dose TCZ-IV monotherapy to fixed-dose TCZ-SC monotherapy. Switching to another route of administration (IV to SC) was associated with comparable efficacy in the majority of patients, even though it was somewhat lower in patients with high body weight.In patients with RA with IR to TCZ-SC Q2W, TCZ-SC weekly was superior to TCZ-SC Q2W for adjusted mean change in DAS28-ESR from baseline to week 12 in a Japanese study. Therefore, shortening the dosing interval to QW improved efficacy with acceptable tolerability.Details on studies investigating route of administration are shown in online supplemental tables S2.3.1.5 and S2.4.1.5.

Adding versus switching trials

Pertaining to switching within the IL-6R blocker class, a posthoc analysis of the EXTEND trial, an open-label extension study of the ASCERTAIN trial, investigated patients switched from double-blind TCZ to open label SAR, showing sustained clinical efficacy over 96 weeks.Apart from that, two key studies (one with unclear and another with high RoB due to being not double-blinded and a lower number of patients enrolled as initially planned) compared the effectiveness between TCZ added to MTX and TCZ monotherapy (switched from MTX) in established RA. Clinical data suggested benefit of add-on (TCZ+MTX) over switching to TCZ, and data of radiographic progression were in favour of the add-on strategy in both studies, whereas in patients receiving TCZ monotherapy radiographic progression was numerically higher.Study details are depicted in online supplemental tables S2.3.1.6–S2.3.1.7 and S2.4.1.6–S2.4.1.7.

### Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with anti-tumor necrosis factor or tocilizumab therapy as first biologic agent in a global comparative observational study [^b2b9713d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clinical effectiveness between tocilizumab and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs initiating biologic therapy.

Methods

Patients prescribed tocilizumab (intravenous) or TNFi were prospectively observed in routine clinical practice for 52 weeks across 158 sites in 26 countries. The primary observation was the change from baseline in Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at week 24 using analysis of covariance for between-groups comparison. Secondary end points included Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and patient-reported outcomes at weeks 24 and 52.

Results

Of 1,216 patients, 35% initiated tocilizumab and 65% initiated TNFi. RA duration was shorter, and disease activity and corticosteroid use were higher in tocilizumab patients. Tocilizumab-treated patients had greater improvement in DAS28-ESR at weeks 24 and 52 (week 24 difference [95% confidence interval] in adjusted means: -0.831 [-1.086, -0.576]; P<0.001). Change from baseline in CDAI was also greater with tocilizumab (adjusted means difference: week 24, -3.48; week 52, -4.60; both P<0.001). Tocilizumab-treated patients had more improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index than TNFi-treated patients (P<0.05). The cumulative probability of drug discontinuation at week 52 was lower with tocilizumab (15%) than TNFi (27%; P<0.001, unadjusted analysis). Unadjusted frequencies (events per 100 patient-years) for tocilizumab and TNFi were 6.44 and 11.99 for serious adverse events, 1.98 and 5.03 for serious infections, and 0.74 and 0.77 for deaths, respectively.

Conclusion

Patients initiating tocilizumab experienced greater effectiveness and drug survival than those initiating TNFi in an observational setting.

Results

Patient characteristics and disposition

Of the 1197 adult patients who entered the double-blind trial (placebo, n=398; sarilumab 150 mg, n=400; sarilumab 200 mg, n=399), more patients in the placebo group (n=156) than in the sarilumab 150 mg group (n=55) or sarilumab 200 mg group (n=46) received rescue therapy. A total of 901 patients completed the double-blind trial and enrolled in the open-label extension: 307 from the placebo group, 300 from the sarilumab 150 mg group and 294 from the sarilumab 200 mg group. Two patients were not treated; therefore, 899 received sarilumab 200 mg (online supplementary figure 1). During the open-label extension, discontinuation rates were similar across original treatment groups (figure 1). Overall in the double-blind study and the open-label extension, discontinuations due to safety reasons were reported in 340 patients (28%); discontinuations due to non-safety reasons were reported in 222 patients (19%), including 52 patients (4%) due to lack of efficacy and 29 (2%) due to poor compliance with the protocol. At baseline of the double-blind study, demographics and disease characteristics of patients who enrolled in the open-label extension were similar both between treatment groups and to those of the total population who were randomised in the double-blind study (table 1). Demographics and patient characteristics were also similar across original randomisation groups at baseline of the open-label extension (online supplementary table 1).

### Long-term outcomes in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis receiving adalimumab with or without methotrexate [^b24d582f]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) describes a clinically heterogeneous group of arthritides of unknown cause that begin before 16 years of age and often continue into adulthood. – The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations suggest initiating treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or methotrexate or, in more severe cases, biologics.Because use of a particular biological agent in an individual patient may be limited by long-term toxicity, inadequate response or the inability to maintain an acceptable level of disease control, it is important to have knowledge and regulatory approval of several biological therapies for the treatment of JIA, including tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (such as etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab and golimumab) or biologics with other mechanisms of action such as abatacept, tocilizumab and canakinumab. –

Adalimumab has a favourable benefit–risk profile in children with JIA. – A long-term, 4-period, phase III study of up to 360 weeks of adalimumab treatment with or without methotrexate (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00048542) was conducted in children with JIA who had active disease and had failed NSAIDs.The results from the double-blind, placebo-controlled period demonstrated that in patients who initially responded to open-label adalimumab treatment, significantly fewer disease flares occurred in patients continuing to receive adalimumab compared with those who switched to placebo; treatment response was sustained during an additional 104 weeks of open-label adalimumab treatment.

The objective of this follow-up analysis was to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of adalimumab with or without methotrexate through up to 6 years of exposure and to assess predictors of sustained disease control in patients with polyarticular JIA through up to 6 years of treatment.

Systemic Features

Of patients with fever or rash at baseline, those treated with ACTEMRA had fewer systemic features; 35 out of 41 (85%) became fever free (no temperature recording at or above 37.5°C in the preceding 14 days) compared to 5 out of 24 (21%) of placebo-treated patients, and 14 out of 22 (64%) became free of rash compared to 2 out of 18 (11%) of placebo-treated patients. Responses were consistent in the open label extension (data available through 44 weeks).

Corticosteroid Tapering

Of the patients receiving oral corticosteroids at baseline, 8 out of 31 (26%) placebo and 48 out of 70 (69%), ACTEMRA patients achieved a JIA ACR 70 response at week 6 or 8 enabling corticosteroid dose reduction. Seventeen (24%) ACTEMRA patients versus 1 (3%) placebo patient were able to reduce the dose of corticosteroid by at least 20% without experiencing a subsequent JIA ACR 30 flare or occurrence of systemic symptoms to week 12. In the open label portion of the study, by week 44, there were 44 out of 103 (43%) ACTEMRA patients off oral corticosteroids. Of these 44 patients 50% were off corticosteroids 18 weeks or more.

Health Related Outcomes

Physical function and disability were assessed using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (CHAQ-DI). Seventy-seven percent (58 out of 75) of patients in the ACTEMRA treatment group achieved a minimal clinically important improvement in CHAQ-DI (change from baseline of ≥ 0.13 units) at week 12 compared to 19% (7 out of 37) in the placebo treatment group.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab in clinical trials of polyarticular or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^c05bf696]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous tocilizumab (SC-TCZ) treatment in a long-term extension (LTE) of clinical trials in polyarticular or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA or sJIA).

Methods

Patients with pJIA or sJIA from two open-label, 52-week phase 1b core trials of SC-TCZ who had adequate response per investigator assessment entered the LTE and continued SC-TCZ treatment according to body weight-based dosing regimens until commercial availability or up to 5years. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy were assessed for up to 3years, and safety for up to 5years in the LTE.

Results

Forty-four patients with pJIA and 38 patients with sJIA entered the LTE. Tocilizumab trough concentrations were maintained within the range expected to provide clinical benefit (mean values: pJIA, ∼10μg/ml; sJIA, ∼75μg/ml over 3years). Pharmacodynamic parameters (interleukin-6, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) were maintained throughout the LTE at levels achieved in the core trials. Inactive disease per American College of Rheumatology provisional criteria was reported for 90% (17/19) and 53% (8/15) of patients with pJIA and 91% (10/11) and 92% (12/13) of patients with sJIA in the <30 and ≥30kg body weight groups, respectively. Serious adverse events in the LTE were reported in six patients with pJIA (13.6%; five serious infections) and five patients with sJIA (13.2%; one serious infection).

Conclusion

Patients with pJIA or sJIA experienced long-term disease control with SC-TCZ treatment. Long-term safety was consistent with the known tocilizumab safety profile.

### Tocilizumab as monotherapy or in combination with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: twenty-four-week results of an open-label, clinical practice study [^66ca5130]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety and tolerability of tocilizumab (TCZ) as monotherapy or in combination with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response at study entry to their current treatment with biologic agents or DMARDs.

Methods

This 24-week, multicenter, open-label, phase IIIb study conducted in the US enrolled 886 patients. Treatments were allocated to patients based on their current therapy at study entry. Patients receiving monotherapy with biologic agents were assigned to TCZ 8 mg/kg monotherapy. All other patients were randomized to either TCZ 4 mg/kg + DMARDs or TCZ 8 mg/kg + DMARDs. The primary end point was the number and percentage of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs) during 24 weeks of TCZ treatment. Efficacy assessments were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Data were analyzed descriptively.

Results

Overall, 69 patients (7.8%) reported ≥1 SAEs. The rate of SAEs per 100 person-years was 28.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 23.1-34.4) overall and was similar across treatment groups: 29.1 (95% CI 21.0-39.2), 30.3 (95% CI 22.2-40.2), and 20.6 (95% CI 10.3-36.9) in the TCZ 4/8 mg/kg + DMARDs, TCZ 8 mg/kg + DMARDs, and TCZ 8 mg/kg monotherapy groups, respectively. The most common SAEs were infections (i.e., pneumonia [1.0%] and cellulitis [0.9%]). In addition, American College of Rheumatology response rates and reductions in mean Disease Activity Score based on a 28-joint count were generally similar among treatment groups.

Conclusion

The safety findings in this study were consistent with the previously identified safety profile of TCZ. TCZ had an AE profile consistent with prior randomized blinded studies and was effective when administered as either monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs for the treatment of RA.

### Long-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy comparing FKB327 with the adalimumab reference product in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis: data from randomised double-blind and open-label extension studies [^454d8497]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of this double-blind (DB) study and open-label extension (OLE) was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with FKB327 compared with the RP when each was administered in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with RA. Preliminary data through 54 weeks of treatment have been published previously.The current data set evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination of FKB327 plus MTX compared with the RP plus MTX for up to 2 years of treatment. The current study was also designed to investigate the long-term effects of single-swiching treatment and to assess any effects of double-switching treatment for the first time in this treatment population.

### Optimizing outcomes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to anti-TNF treatment [^fa72ae6a]. Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

A failure to respond to TNF inhibitors remains a serious concern for patients with RA. Although some patients experience a primary lack of drug efficacy in reducing their symptoms, others fail to maintain an initial response because of acquired drug resistance. While switching to another TNF inhibitor is a common practice for patients who are not responsive to a particular treatment, limited clinical trial data support this strategy. If more than one TNF inhibitor provides inadequate responses and/or similar tolerability issues, switching to a different class of agent may provide a more effective option. Currently four non-TNF inhibitors are approved for use in RA patients-the T-cell co-stimulation inhibitor abatacept, the B-cell-depleting mAb rituximab, the IL-1 receptor blocker anakinra and the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab. These biologic agents have been studied in large, randomized placebo-controlled trials that demonstrate their efficacy in reducing disease activity in patients failing TNF inhibitor therapy. Results with the majority of these agents suggest that their administration may provide a greater proportion of patients with an effective, evidence-based disease-modifying approach earlier in the course of their disease than switching TNF inhibitors.

### Tofacitinib versus tocilizumab in the treatment of biological-naïve or previous biological-failure patients with methotrexate-refractory active rheumatoid arthritis [^9aea9b10]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tofacitinib, a potent selective inhibitor of Janus kinases (JAKs), is the first targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Recent phase III clinical trials showed that tofacitinib is effective and generally well tolerated in the treatment of active RA, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs).Long-term extension studies demonstrated stable safety and sustained efficacy.

For optimising RA management, we need to clarify whether tofacitinib should be considered as an option only for patients who have failed to respond to at least one biological DMARD (bDMARD) or for MTX-resistant or MTX-intolerant patients prior to any attempted biological therapy. In a previous study, we found that the effect of tofacitinib on initial improvement is significantly higher in bDMARD-naïve patients than in patients who failed previous bDMARD therapy.However, the number of patients included in that study was small and the effect of previous bDMARD number on outcomes of tofacitinib therapy was unclear. Recent phase III and IIIb/IV trials revealed that tofacitinib has at least equal efficacy and similar safety to adalimumab, an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibody, in the treatment of patients with RA with inadequate response to MTX.There are few comparison studies between tofacitinib and non-TNF inhibitors such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, in regard to their effectiveness and safety, however.

In the present study, we used ongoing real-world registries including patients with MTX-refractory active RA who had first begun tofacitinib or tocilizumab in our institutions between August 2013 and February 2019. We compared therapeutic outcomes at 12 months between tofacitinib-treated and tocilizumab-treated patients, grouped by status of previous bDMARD use, after propensity score (PS) matching.

### Non-medical switching from tocilizumab to sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis patients with low disease activity, an observational study [^708acd53]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Tocilizumab and sarilumab are IL-6-receptor antagonists registered for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with equal effectiveness and safety. Switching from tocilizumab to sarilumab could be a strategy to reduce injection burden, in case of drug shortages, and to reduce costs. This study therefore aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of switching patients with RA with well-controlled disease under tocilizumab treatment to sarilumab. Patients with RA with low Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28;-CRP<2.9 or <3.5 with clinical judgment), on stable dose tocilizumab (>6months) were offered to switch to sarilumab. Patients who switched and consented were followed for 6months. Sarilumab was started at 200mg and double the last tocilizumab interval. Co-primary outcomes at 6 months were (i) the 90% confidence interval (CI) of DAS28-CRP change from baseline compared with the non-inferiority margin of 0.6 and (ii) the 90% CI of the proportion of patients persisting with sarilumab, compared with a prespecified minimum of 70%. Of 50 invited patients, 25 agreed to switch to sarilumab, and 23 patients switched and were included. One patient was lost to follow-up immediately after inclusion, therefore 22 patients are included in the analyses. At 6 months, mean change in DAS28-CRP was 0.48 (90% CI: 0.11-0.87), compared with the non-inferiority margin of 0.6. Sarilumab persistence was 68% (90% CI: 51-82%, 15 out of 22 patients), compared with the prespecified minimum of 70%. Non-medical switching from tocilizumab to sarilumab in patients doing well on tocilizumab failed to show non-inferiority regarding disease activity and drug persistence.

### Efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy versus tocilizumab and methotrexate combination therapy in the prevention of radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis using individual patient data from multiple clinical trials [^b4e1e332]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The aim of our study was to determine the effect of preventing radiographic progression, using individual patient data, with TCZ monotherapy compared to TCZ + MTX combination therapy on different components of radiographic progression and to identify possible effect modifiers. We hypothesized that, in general, a more intensive strategy (i.e. TCZ + MTX) would increase the effectiveness of preventing radiographic progression during treatment; however, this effect may vary among subgroups depending on disease phase and level of severity.

### Targeting interleukin-6 in pediatric rheumatic diseases [^29998c0c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe the most recent data regarding the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in immune and inflammatory responses, the mode of action and safety information on tocilizumab, the only available IL-6 inhibitor, and discuss recent results on the therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 in pediatric rheumatic diseases.

Recent Findings

New data on the effects of IL-6 on T and B cells have been published. Clinical trials with tocilizumab in adults, particularly with rheumatoid arthritis, provide new data on mechanism of action and a reasonably wide safety database. A withdrawal design trial showed marked efficacy in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (s-JIA). Open label studies or anecdotal reports suggest possible efficacy also in other JIA subtypes, as well as other rheumatic diseases.

Summary

Targeting IL-6 activities is an effective approach in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. The long-term benefit and safety of tocilizumab have to be defined in long-term extension studies. The risk/benefit ratio appears to be particularly favorable in s-JIA. With the increasing number of biologics becoming available, future efforts should be directed to the definition of biomarkers that will identify responders to each novel biologic, allowing a personalized approach.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in refractory Takayasu arteritis: final results of the randomized controlled phase 3 TAKT study [^15cd0bf3]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

TAK relapses

During the open-label extension (median 96 weeks), 18 relapses were recorded in 14 patients [29.4 events per 100 patient-years (PY)]. The most common symptoms of relapse were malaise (12/18; 66.7%), spontaneous pain in chest or back region (8/18; 44.4%) and tenderness or spontaneous pain in carotid artery (7/18; 38.9%) (Supplementary material, section Results, and supplementary Tables S3–S5, available at Rheumatology online).

Safety

During the total duration of the TAKT study (double-blind and open-label periods), patients received tocilizumab 162 mg/week s.c. for a median of 108.07 weeks.

The most frequently reported AEs were infections and infestations (88.9%; 218.8/100 PY) (see Supplementary material, section Results, and supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online, for additional safety results). Serious AEs were reported by 25% of patients (17.4/100 PY); the most common were gastroenteritis (5.6%; 2.9/100 PY) and pneumonia (5.6%; 2.9/100 PY). All serious infections resolved without sequelae. No patients withdrew from the study because of an AE.

### Tocilizumab monotherapy or combined with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: a randomized clinical trial [^19c2ce55]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The most common AE was upper respiratory tract infection (combination, 42 [30.9%]; monotherapy, 29 [21.3%]; placebo, 18 [26.5%]; and all-tocilizumab, 95 [29.0%]) (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Herpes zoster was reported in 1 (0.7%), 3 (2.2%), and 1 (1.5%) patients in the combination, monotherapy, and placebo groups, respectively, and in 6 patients (1.8%) in the all-tocilizumab group (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). No gastrointestinal perforation was reported.

Across the study period, serious AEs were reported in 14 (10.3%), 7 (5.1%), and 2 (2.9%) patients in the combination, monotherapy, and placebo groups, respectively, and in 29 patients (8.8%) in the all-tocilizumab group. Rates of serious AEs per 100 patient-years of exposure were numerically higher in the combination group (11.1 [95% CI, 6.2-18.3]) and in the monotherapy group (10.7 [95% CI, 4.6-21.1) compared with the placebo group (6.8 [95% CI, 0.8-24.7]), with a rate of 10.0 (95% CI, 6.8-14.2) in the all-tocilizumab group (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

### Combination leflunomide and methotrexate (MTX) therapy for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis failing MTX monotherapy: open-label extension of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial [^b15550c4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To obtain additional safety and efficacy data on leflunomide (LEF) treatment in combination with methotrexate (MTX) therapy in an open-label extension study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

Following a 24 week, randomized, double-blind trial of adding placebo (PLA) or LEF to stable MTX therapy, patients could enter a 24 week extension. Subjects randomized to LEF and MTX continued treatment [(LEF/LEF) + MTX]. Subjects randomized to PLA and MTX switched to LEF (10 mg/day, no loading dose) and MTX [(PLA/LEF) + MTX]. The double-blind regarding initial randomization was maintained.

Results

For subjects in the extension phase, American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) responder rates for the (LEF/LEF) + MTX group were maintained from Week 24 (57/96, 59.4%) to Week 48 (53/96, 55.2%). ACR20 responder rates improved in patients switched to LEF from PLA at Week 24 [(PLA/LEF) + MTX] from 25.0% (24/96) at Week 24 to 57.3% (55/96) at Week 48. Patients in the extension who switched from PLA to LEF without a loading dose exhibited a lower incidence of elevated transaminases compared to patients initially randomized to LEF. Diarrhea and nausea were less frequent during the open-label extension in patients who did not receive a LEF loading dose.

Conclusion

Response to therapy was maintained to 48 weeks of treatment in patients who continued to receive LEF and MTX during the extension. Importantly, ACR20 response rates after 24 weeks of LEF therapy were similar between patients switched from PLA to LEF without loading dose, and those who received a loading does of LEF (100 mg/day x 2 days) at randomization. Fewer adverse events were reported in patients switched to LEF without a loading dose.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^f634badb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report the 2‐year efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with polyarticular‐course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).

Methods

Patients ages 2–17 years with active polyarticular‐course JIA, in whom treatment with methotrexate was unsuccessful, received 16 weeks of open‐label intravenous TCZ in part 1 (once every 4 weeks: 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight [BW] <30 kg; 8 mg/kg for BW ≥30 kg). Assessments were based on the JIA–American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response (defined as percentage of improvement in ≥3 of the 6 JIA core response variables [CRVs]). Patients with at least a JIA‐ACR30 response (defined as ≥30% improvement in ≥3 of the 6 JIA CRVs without worsening in >1 of the remaining JIA CRVs by >30%) at week 16 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive TCZ or placebo in part 2. Patients remained in part 2 until either week 40 or the occurrence of JIA flare. Upon starting part 3, all patients received open‐label TCZ. At week 104 of the study, efficacy was assessed using JIA‐ACR50/70/90 response rates (defined as 50%, 70%, or 90% improvement, respectively), achievement of inactive disease, and the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score in 71 joints (JADAS‐71). Safety was assessed in the all‐exposure population per 100 patient‐years of exposure.

Results

Overall, 188 patients entered part 1, 166 patients entered part 2, and 160 patients entered part 3. By week 104, among the 188 patients in the modified intent‐to‐treat group who received TCZ, JIA‐ACR50/70/90 response rates were 80.3%/77.1%/59.6%, respectively, the median JADAS‐71 score decreased from 3.6 at week 40 to 0.7 at week 104, 51.1% of patients had achieved inactive disease, and 31 of 66 patients who had been receiving glucocorticoids discontinued them. Adverse event (AE) and serious AE rates were 406.5 per 100 patient‐years and 11.1 per 100 patient‐years, respectively. The infection rate was 151.4 per 100 patient‐years, and the serious infection rate was 5.2 per 100 patient‐years.

Conclusion

Patients treated with TCZ for polyarticular‐course JIA showed high‐level disease control for up to 2 years. The TCZ safety profile was consistent with that previously reported.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of sarilumab plus methotrexate on disease activity, physical function and radiographic progression: 5 years of sarilumab plus methotrexate treatment [^b0ffc645]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy, according to DAS28-CRP, CDAI and HAQ-DI, was sustained through 5 years of follow-up. Similar changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP, CDAI and HAQ-DI were observed regardless of the initial randomisation group in the randomised portion of the study. Improvements in the proportions of patients achieving DAS28-CRP <3.2 and <2.6 and CDAI ≤10 and ≤2.8 continued over time. These results are consistent with—and build on—the 2 year observations.

Among the main limitations associated with long-term extension studies is enrichment of the cohort for patients who respond well to treatment and tolerate any AEs they encounter. As a result, the measurement of continuous variables can be influenced by the progressively smaller number of patients who remain in the study. To help minimise this bias, the absolute numbers of patients are presented at each relevant timepoint in addition to percentage response rates. Furthermore, ITT analyses are presented alongside completer analyses for dichotomous variables.

In conclusion, the durable efficacy of sarilumab was demonstrated through 5 years of follow-up in an open-label extension study, and reductions in disease activity, inhibition of radiographic progression and improvements in physical function were observed. No new safety signals were identified, and the safety profile remained stable and consistent with IL-6 blockade.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^2dda85ec]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The efficacy of TCZ in patients with polyarticular‐course JIA previously demonstrated at week 40 (7) was maintained, if not further improved, through week 104. Notably, clinical remission was reached in ~25% of patients treated with TCZ for 104 weeks. Indeed, many patients successfully decreased or even discontinued glucocorticoids and/or MTX. The analysis of patients who received placebo during part 2 and restarted TCZ following flare or after week 40 of the study (TCZ restart population) showed efficacy comparable to that of patients treated with TCZ continuously to week 104, suggesting that efficacy can be recaptured after TCZ interruption.

Consistent with findings from other studies (21, 22), we found that polyarticular‐course JIA patients in whom previous biologic therapies were unsuccessful or who had longer disease durations experienced less pronounced improvement of JIA with TCZ treatment. Nevertheless, 60.7% of patients in our study who previously received biologics achieved a JIA‐ACR70 response by week 104. In contrast to adult patients with RA (23), combination therapy with TCZ and MTX seemed somewhat more effective than TCZ monotherapy in our study of patients with polyarticular‐course JIA. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because the study was not powered for comparison of TCZ monotherapy with TCZ in combination with MTX. Children whose duration of polyarticular‐course JIA exceeded 2 years before they received TCZ or those who were RF negative achieved JIA‐ACR70/90 responses less frequently than children with shorter disease duration or those who were RF positive. These observations are consistent with previous studies in JIA patients who were treated with biologics (24, 25). Long‐term use of glucocorticoids in children is highly undesirable because of impairment in growth (26), known long‐term cardiovascular risks, and other toxicities (27). In this study, glucocorticoid treatment was prescribed to 46% of polyarticular‐course JIA patients at baseline. TCZ therapy allowed for the discontinuation of steroids in 47% of these patients (31 of 66 patients) by week 104. As reported elsewhere (28), this reduction in glucocorticoid exposure, together with the degree of disease control achieved, is considered clinically relevant based on improved growth profiles.

### Efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy versus tocilizumab and methotrexate combination therapy in the prevention of radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis using individual patient data from multiple clinical trials [^c66b3767]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Joint damage is a negative outcome in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that leads to a decline in physical function and quality of life. However, methods in preventing radiographic progression of joint damage have improved over the last decades by early intensive treat‐to‐target treatment strategies with disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). Consequently, detecting differences between effective treatment strategies in the prevention of radiographic progression is challenging, especially early in the disease course.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

In the prevention of radiographic progression, combination therapy with tocilizumab (TCZ) and methotrexate (MTX) is generally more effective than TCZ monotherapy.
In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for those with more joint damage or lower counts on the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) at baseline, the efficacy of TCZ monotherapy may be equivalent to TCZ + MTX in the prevention of radiographic progression.
In patients with established RA who have a longer disease duration, TCZ monotherapy may be equivalent to TCZ + MTX combination therapy in the prevention of radiographic progression.

Joint damage remains an important outcome measure, as it objectively reflects irreversible damage and the “disease‐modifying” effects of treatment strategies. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most frequently used first‐line DMARD in RA, but patients may need to switch to therapy with a DMARD/bDMARD or otherwise combine MTX with a DMARD/bDMARD because of adverse events and/or insufficient response to MTX. It is a clinical fact that a relevant subgroup of patients do not adhere to treatment with MTX because of side effects, aversion, or inadequate efficacy. Tocilizumab (TCZ) may then be a suitable option for these patients, as TCZ can be used with lower doses of MTX or even in the absence of MTX (i.e. as TCZ monotherapy) while still being effective in controlling disease activity as well as in the prevention of radiographic progression. However, it is not clear whether TCZ + MTX combination therapy has a better effect than TCZ monotherapy on preventing radiographic progression, the results of which would be relevant knowledge for clinical decision‐making.

Patient disposition and baseline characteristics

A total of 322 patients completed the double‐blind period of the study. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of 319 patients, including 1 patient in the TCZ‐SC group who had not completed the double‐blind period, who received at least 1 dose of TCZ‐SC during the open‐label extension period. Of these, 160 patients received TCZ‐IV in the double‐blind period (TCZ IV/SC group) and 159 received TCZ‐SC in the double‐blind period (TCZ SC/SC group); 158 patients (98.8%) in the TCZ IV/SC group and 157 (98.7%) in the TCZ SC/SC group continued treatment and completed the observations at week 36 (at 12 weeks after first dosing in the open‐label extension period).

Three patients in the TCZ‐SC group withdrew from the study after completion of the double‐blind period without any administration of open‐label TCZ due to adverse event, protocol violation, and refusal of treatment, while 1 patient in the TCZ‐IV group withdrew due to adverse events. Two patients in the TCZ IV/SC group withdrew during the open‐label extension period, one due to an adverse event and the other due to an inadequate response. Two patients in the TCZ SC/SC group withdrew during the open‐label extension period due to an inadequate response. Of 159 patients in the TCZ SC/SC group, 158 were included in the efficacy analysis, while 1 was excluded due to noncompletion of the double‐blind period.

### Subcutaneous tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: findings from the common-framework phase 4 study programme TOZURA conducted in 22 countries [^1d0aa259]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this pooled analysis of the TOZURA study programme was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ-SC) as monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) in patients with moderate to severe RA who had an inadequate response to csDMARD or anti-TNF agent therapy or who were MTX naïve.

Methods

TOZURA is a multinational, open-label, single-arm, common-framework, phase 4 study programme (11 protocols, 22 countries). Patients received TCZ-SC 162 mg each week for ⩾24 weeks, administered at the investigator's discretion, as monotherapy or in combination with a csDMARD. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity were evaluated; propensity score-based matching was used for between-group comparisons.

Results

Of 1804 patients, 353 (19.6%) received monotherapy and 1451 (80.4%) received combination therapy. The 28-joint DAS using ESR (DAS28-ESR) in both groups decreased significantly from baseline to week 24 (mean change: monotherapy -3.40, combination therapy -3.46), with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.46). The proportion of patients who achieved DAS28-ESR or Clinical Disease Activity Index remission or ACR 20/50/70/90 responses was similar between groups. Overall, 13.9% of patients withdrew-6.2% for safety reasons and 1.6% for insufficient therapeutic response; 5.8% of patients experienced one or more serious adverse events [14.6/100 patient-years (PY)]; six deaths occurred (0.64/100 PY).

Conclusion

In a common framework of 11 studies in 22 countries, this phase 4 study programme confirmed TCZ-SC's known efficacy and safety profile with comparable effects as monotherapy and in combination with csDMARDs.

### Mavrilimumab, a fully human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α monoclonal antibody: long-term safety and efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^eaad4275]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Mavrilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody, targets granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α. We undertook to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of mavrilimumab in rheumatoid arthritis patients in 2 phase IIb studies (1071 and 1107) and in 1 open-label extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01712399).

Methods

In study 1071, patients with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) received mavrilimumab (30, 100, or 150 mg) or placebo every other week plus methotrexate. In study 1107, patients with an inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor agents and/or DMARDs received 100 mg mavrilimumab every other week or 50 mg golimumab every 4 weeks plus methotrexate. Patients entering the open-label extension study received 100 mg mavrilimumab every other week plus methotrexate. Long-term safety and efficacy of mavrilimumab were assessed.

Results

A total of 442 patients received mavrilimumab (14 of 245 patients from study 1071, 9 of 70 patients from study 1107, and 52 of 397 patients from the open-label extension study discontinued mavrilimumab treatment throughout the studies). The cumulative safety exposure was 899 patient-years; the median duration of mavrilimumab treatment was 2.5 years (range 0.1-3.3 years). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were nasopharyngitis (n = 69; 7.68 per 100 patient-years) and bronchitis (n = 51; 5.68 per 100 patient-years). At weeks 74 and 104, 3.5% and 6.2% of patients, respectively, demonstrated reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, while 2.9% and 3.4% of patients, respectively, demonstrated reduction in forced vital capacity (>20% reduction from baseline to <80% predicted). Most pulmonary changes were transient and only infrequently associated with AEs. Mavrilimumab at 100 mg every other week demonstrated sustained efficacy; at week 122, 65.0% of patients achieved a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) of <3.2, and 40.6% of patients achieved a DAS28-CRP of <2.6.

Conclusion

Long-term treatment with mavrilimumab maintained response and was well-tolerated with no increased incidence of treatment-emergent AEs. Safety data were comparable with those from both phase IIb qualifying studies.

### Treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based recommendations. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^8e9d0de9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tocilizumab in systemic sclerosis–associated interstitial lung disease (SSc‑ILD)—trial evidence and outcomes: The faSScinate phase 2 RCT assigned 87 subjects over 48 weeks, with an open‑label extension to 96 weeks giving tocilizumab to 30 original tocilizumab‑arm and 31 original placebo‑arm subjects; the focuSSced phase 3 RCT assigned 210 subjects across 20 countries over 48 weeks, with an open‑label extension to 96 weeks giving tocilizumab to 60 original tocilizumab‑arm and 54 original placebo‑arm subjects, and in focuSSced 136 of 210 participants (65%) had SSc‑ILD by HRCT review. Across trials, ILD was not an inclusion criterion and change in modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) was the primary outcome. Disease progression findings included: mean change from baseline to 48 weeks in forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted was 6.5% less in the tocilizumab arm, with a median change of 3.4% less; the risk of FVC percent predicted decrease >10% by 48 weeks was three times less and the risk of any increase at 48 weeks was nearly twice as much with tocilizumab, while by 96 weeks there were no significant differences in these risks. Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) percent predicted decline from baseline to 48 weeks was 1.5% less with tocilizumab, and from 48 to 96 weeks the mean decrease in DLco percent predicted was 5.4% less. Imaging‑based quantitative interstitial lung disease (QILD) and quantitative lung fibrosis (QLF) score changes at 48 weeks favored tocilizumab; mRSS change at 72 weeks was 4.1 better with tocilizumab, but during 48–96 weeks the placebo arm (on open‑label tocilizumab) was 0.8 better. Mortality showed no significant difference at 24, 48, or 96 weeks. At 96 weeks in the open‑label phase, mean change from baseline in 5‑D Itch, HAQ‑DI, FACIT‑Fatigue, and Patient Global Visual Analog Scale favored the placebo group transitioned to tocilizumab. At 48 weeks, adverse events per 100 patient‑years favored tocilizumab, with 38 fewer hypersensitivity events, 44 fewer overall adverse events, 7.6 fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, 9.1 fewer infectious adverse events, and 27.4 fewer overall serious adverse events versus placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^40ef2f3b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) describes a group of chronic arthritides of unknown etiology that begin before the age of 16 years and persist for longer than 6 weeks (1). Children with rheumatoid factor (RF)–positive polyarticular JIA, RF‐negative polyarticular JIA, or extended oligoarticular JIA can be referred to as having polyarticular‐course JIA (2); these patients are at risk of progressive joint damage, functional disability, and growth impairment (3, 4). Indeed, up to 30% of patients with polyarticular‐course JIA continue to experience active arthritis despite the use of disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate (MTX), and/or biologic therapies, such as anti–tumor necrosis factor agents and CTLA‐4 blockade (5).

Serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) are often elevated in polyarticular‐course JIA and are associated with the extent and severity of active arthritis and with markers of inflammation, such as C‐reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (6). A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase III withdrawal trial of the IL‐6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with polyarticular‐course JIA (CHERISH) demonstrated improvement in JIA–American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses, and significantly more placebo‐treated patients than TCZ‐treated patients experienced JIA flare during the 24‐week, double‐blind withdrawal period. This demonstrates that treatment with TCZ for up to 40 weeks was effective for improving the signs and symptoms of polyarticular‐course JIA in children with inadequate response to MTX (7). The observed safety profile of TCZ in this trial was consistent with that of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (7). Based on the results of this trial, TCZ was approved for the treatment of polyarticular‐course JIA in patients ≥2 years of age as an intravenous (IV) infusion once every 4 weeks at a dose of 10 mg/kg in patients with a body weight (BW) of <30 kg and 8 mg/kg in patients with a BW of ≥30 kg. TCZ as a subcutaneous injection was subsequently approved at a dose of 162 mg once every 3 weeks in patients with a BW of <30 kg and once every 2 weeks in patients with a BW of ≥30 kg, based on data from a phase Ib study with extrapolation to the efficacy and safety established in the CHERISH trial.

### Early effects of tocilizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis: a one-week sub-study of a randomised controlled trial (rapid onset and systemic efficacy [ ROSE ] study) [^0c439500]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Tocilizumab has demonstrated efficacy in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from week 2 onward. This sub-study assessed effects of tocilizumab plus disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) during the first week of therapy.

Methods

Rapid Onset and Systemic Efficacy was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Adults with moderate to severe active RA taking DMARDs received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (or placebo) plus DMARDs every 4 weeks. Data were analysed from the first 62 patients at designated study sites who agreed to clinical evaluation and blood sampling at days 3 and 7 and had C-reactive protein levels ≥1 mg/dl. Outcomes included American College of Rheumatology core data set measures, disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28) and routine assessment of patient index data 3 (RAPID3) scores.

Results

Baseline evaluations were similar between groups (tocilizumab, n=40; placebo, n=22). Patient global assessments of disease activity and pain improved significantly in favour of tocilizumab (mean change from baseline to day 7: -16.2 [tocilizumab], 0.8 [placebo] [p=0.005] and -12.2 [tocilizumab], 1.4 [placebo] [p=0.01], respectively). Physician global assessment of disease activity also improved more with tocilizumab (-15.4 [tocilizumab], -5.6 [placebo] [p=0.05]). Changes from baseline in tender/swollen joint counts, physical function and RAPID3 scores were not significantly different between groups. DAS28 significantly improved with tocilizumab versus placebo at day 7 (-1.16 [tocilizumab], -0.27 [placebo] [p=0.007]).

Conclusions

Tocilizumab showed significant improvement in patient-reported disease activity, pain and DAS28 score as early as day 7 after first infusion, earlier than physician-reported measures, which may take longer to manifest.

Designs of the phaseb studies (1071 and 1107) and the open‐label extension study. After week 24, patients enrolled in study 1071 or study 1107 were eligible for the open‐label extension study and received mavrilimumab for up to a maximum of 3.3 years. After week 12, patients enrolled in study 1071 or study 1107 who were not responding adequately to blinded study treatment were allowed to enter the open‐label extension study to receive mavrilimumab. Studies 1071 and 1107 were not conducted simultaneously.= subcutaneous; eow = every other week;= methotrexate.

Patients who completed studies 1071 or 1107 or who had inadequate clinical responses after week 12 were eligible to enter the open‐label extension study. All patients enrolled in the open‐label extension study received SC mavrilimumab at 100 mg every other week plus standard therapy (Figure 1). Patients received mavrilimumab at 100 mg as this was the highest, most efficacious dose in a previous phase IIa study 21. At initiation of the open‐label extension study, no data from study 1071 were available demonstrating improved efficacy and an acceptable safety profile with mavrilimumab at 150 mg versus 100 mg.

All 3 studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and all were approved by the appropriate institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each study site. All patients provided written informed consent.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients. Patients were ages 18–80 years with moderate‐to‐severe adult‐onset RA according to the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 classification criteria 24, a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints 25 using the C‐reactive protein level (DAS28‐CRP) of ≥3.2 at screening, a DAS28 using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate of ≥3.2 26 on day 1, and ≥4 swollen joints at screening and on day 1.

### Efficacy and safety of long-term baricitinib with and without methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: experience with baricitinib monotherapy continuation or after switching from methotrexate monotherapy or baricitinib plus methotrexate [^648cce42]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of maintaining baricitinib monotherapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) originally treated with baricitinib monotherapy or switched from methotrexate (MTX) or the combination of baricitinib plus MTX to baricitinib monotherapy.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of patients from the RA-BEGIN study who entered a long-term extension, RA-BEYOND, and were assessed for up to 24 weeks. In RA-BEGIN, MTX-naive patients with early active RA were randomized to MTX monotherapy, baricitinib 4 mg monotherapy, or baricitinib 4 mg plus MTX. At week 52, all patients entering RA-BEYOND received baricitinib 4 mg monotherapy. MTX could be prescribed during RA-BEYOND at the investigator's discretion.

Results

Patients in RA-BEYOND who were not rescued in RA-BEGIN (n = 423) were evaluated. Of these, 47% continued baricitinib monotherapy and 53% added MTX, with similar proportions from the 3 original arms. Patients with lower disease activity at the RA-BEYOND baseline generally continued to do well with baricitinib monotherapy as assessed by the Simplified Disease Activity Index, the Clinical Disease Activity Index, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index scores. Patients prescribed MTX had higher disease activity at the RA-BEYOND baseline and had improved disease activity after the addition of MTX. Safety outcomes were similar across treatment groups.

Conclusion

Many patients responded well to continued baricitinib monotherapy or to switching to baricitinib monotherapy from MTX monotherapy or baricitinib plus MTX, showing sustained or improved disease control. The groups of patients who had less disease control on their original therapies showed sustained or improved disease control with the addition of MTX to baricitinib.

### Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab for polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the open-label two-year extension of a phase III trial [^1c743e96]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the mITT population, the number of patients who achieved inactive disease status according to ACR provisional criteria improved from 49 patients (26.1%) at week 40 to 96 patients (51.1%) at week 104; at the same time points, there were 7 patients (3.7%) and 46 patients (24.5%), respectively, whose disease was in clinical remission and were receiving medication (Figure 2B). In the TCZ continuous population, the number of patients who achieved JIA‐ACR inactive disease status improved from 33 patients (40.2%) at week 40 to 52 patients (63.4%) at week 104; at the same time points, there were 5 patients (6.1%) and 31 patients (37.8%), respectively, whose disease was in clinical remission and who were receiving medication (Supplementary Table 1,).

The median JADAS‐71 score improved from 3.6 at week 40 to 0.7 at week 104 in the LTE population (Figure 3). Improvements in the median JADAS‐71 score from week 40 through week 104 were also observed in the TCZ continuous group (from 2.7 to 0.5) and the TCZ restart group (from 4.5 to 1.5) (Supplementary Figures 2C and D and Supplementary Table 1,).

Figure 3 
Median Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score in 71 joints (JADAS‐71) in the long‐term extension (LTE) population (n = 163), according to study visit. All patients with a nonmissing assessment at each time point were included; there was no imputation for missing data. Last observation carried forward was used for missing core components. Dashed horizontal lines show inactive disease (JADAS‐71 <1) and low disease activity (JADAS‐71 <3.8).* The LTE population included all patients randomly assigned in part 2 who received ≥1 dose of tocilizumab (TCZ) either double‐blind or open‐label during parts 2 and 3 (25 patients who did not receive TCZ during parts 2 or 3 had no data from week 40 and were not included).

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of a proposed biosimilar MSB11456 with tocilizumab reference product in subjects with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis: results of a randomised double-blind study [^7afff43e]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the proposed biosimilar MSB11456 versus European Union (EU)-approved tocilizumab reference product in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, multinational, parallel-group study (NCT04512001).

Methods

Adult patients with moderate-to-severe active RA and inadequate clinical response to ≥1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (synthetic or biologic) receiving methotrexate were randomised to receive 24 weekly subcutaneous 162mg injections of either MSB11456 or EU-approved tocilizumab. Equivalence between treatments was considered if the 95% CI (European Medicines Agency)/90%CI (US Food and Drug Administration) for the difference in mean change from baseline to week 24 in Disease Activity Score-28 Joint Count with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) between treatments was entirely within prespecified equivalence intervals (-0.6 to 0.6 and -0.6 to 0.5, respectively). At week 24, patients were rerandomised to continued treatment or MSB11456. Secondary efficacy endpoints to week 52, and safety and immunogenicity to week 55 were also evaluated.

Results

At week 24, the least squares mean difference in the change from baseline in DAS28-ESR between treatments was 0.01 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.22) in the 604 randomised patients. Similarity between treatments was shown for all other efficacy, safety and immunogenicity endpoints, including in patients who switched from EU-approved tocilizumab to MSB114466.

Conclusions

Therapeutic equivalence was demonstrated for efficacy endpoints, and safety and immunogenicity analyses support the similarity of the two treatments. The results of this study strengthen the evidence that the proposed biosimilar MSB11456 and EU-approved tocilizumab exert similar clinical effects.

### Effect of tocilizumab on neutrophils in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis: pooled analysis of data from phase 3 and 4 clinical trials [^f77bf23e]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Objectives. To investigate changes in neutrophil count and occurrences of infection in RA patients treated with the IL-6 receptor-α inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ).

Methods. Data were pooled from patients who received i.v. TCZ (4 mg/kg + MTX, 8 mg/kg ± DMARDs, 10 mg/kg) or placebo + DMARDs in phase 3/4 clinical trials, long-term extensions or a pharmacology study. Neutrophil counts were measured routinely according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events grades; TCZ dosing was adjusted if necessary. Covariates associated with decreased neutrophil counts were assessed with multivariate regression analysis. Infection rates within 30 days of neutrophil count changes were calculated per 100 patient-years of TCZ exposure.

Results. In placebo-controlled parts of trials, more TCZ-treated than placebo-treated patients had grade 1/2 or 3/4 neutrophil counts (TCZ: 28.2%/3.1%; placebo: 8.9%/0.2%). In placebo-controlled trials + long-term extensions, 4171 patients provided 16204.8 patient-years of TCZ exposure. Neutrophil counts decreased through week 6 from baseline [mean (.) change, –2.17 (2.16) × 10 9 /l) and remained stable thereafter. Rates (95% CI) of serious infections within 30 days of normal [4.66 (4.31, 5.03)], grade 1/2 [2.48 (1.79, 3.34)] and 3/4 [2.77 (0.34, 10.01)] neutrophil counts were similar. Baseline neutrophil count <2 × 10 9 /l and female gender were associated with grade 3/4 neutrophil counts [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 19.02 (6.76, 53.52), 2.55 (1.40, 4.66)]. Patients who stopped TCZ in response to decreased neutrophil count returned more quickly to normal levels than patients who reduced or continued their dose.

Conclusion. Decreases in neutrophil counts in patients taking TCZ do not appear to be associated with serious infections and are normalized by current risk mitigation guidelines.

### Safety and maintenance of response for tofacitinib monotherapy and combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis of pooled data from open-label long-term extension studies [^614ee92b]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This post hoc analysis evaluated patients receiving tofacitinib monotherapy or combination therapy, as well as those who switched from monotherapy to combination therapy (mono→combo) or vice versa (combo→mono) in long-term extension (LTE) studies.

Methods

Data were pooled from open-label LTE studies (ORAL Sequel (NCT00413699; ongoing; data collected 14 January 2016) and NCT00661661) involving patients who participated in qualifying index studies. Efficacy outcomes included American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70 rates, change from baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-4(ESR)), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index and DAS28-4(ESR) and CDAI low disease activity and remission. Safety was evaluated over 96 months.

Results

Of the 4967 patients treated, 35.4% initiated tofacitinib monotherapy, 64.6% initiated combination therapy, 2.6% were mono→combo switchers and 7.1% were combo→mono switchers. Patients who switched multiple times were excluded. Of those who initiated monotherapy and combination therapy, 87.8% (1543/1757) and 82.0% (2631/3210), respectively, remained on the same regimen throughout the study; efficacy was maintained. Incidence rates (IRs) for serious adverse events with tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, were 9.42 and 8.41 with monotherapy and 8.36 and 10.75 with combination therapy; IRs for discontinuations due to AEs were 7.13 and 6.06 with monotherapy and 7.82 and 8.06 with combination therapy (overlapping CIs). For mono→combo and combo→mono switchers, discontinuations due to AEs were experienced by 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively, within 30 days of switching.

Conclusion

Tofacitinib efficacy as monotherapy or combination therapy was maintained through month 48 and sustained to month 72, with minimal switching of treatment regimens. Safety was consistent over 96 months.
