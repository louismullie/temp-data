## Question

A lung mass of a 50 pack-year smoker is biopsied. If ADH levels were grossly increased, what would most likely be the histologic appearance of this mass?
A. Tall columnar cells bordering the alveolar septum
B. Sheets of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei
C. Layered squamous cells with keratin pearls
D. Pleomorphic giant cells with leukocyte fragments in cytoplasm

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which lung tumor histology best explains markedly elevated ADH levels in a 50 pack-year smoker and what the microscopic appearance would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which lung cancers are classically associated with ectopic ADH secretion. Then, I should verify the typical histologic features of that tumor. Next, I will consider the epidemiology and smoking risk to ensure the clinical context fits. Finally, I will compare the provided answer choices and select the one that matches the expected morphology, correcting any misattributions if needed.

> Let me first confirm the paraneoplastic link. Markedly elevated ADH with hyponatremia points toward the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and in lung cancer the most frequent culprit is small cell lung carcinoma via ectopic vasopressin production, occurring in roughly 5–10% of SCLC and strongly linked to cigarette smoking, which fits a 50 pack-year smoker profile [^116GN6fj] [^117KNoi2].

> Wait, let me verify the histology before jumping to conclusions. Small cell lung carcinoma shows sheets of small, round, blue cells with scant cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, finely granular chromatin, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, nuclear molding, and frequent mitoses; crush artifact and perivascular basophilic stippling (Azzopardi effect) are characteristic, and these features align with option B describing sheets of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei [^117KNoi2] [^115Edcd7].

> Hold on, I should verify the epidemiologic context. SCLC is tightly associated with heavy smoking and often presents centrally with bulky hilar/mediastinal disease, so a long-term smoker with a lung mass and ectopic ADH is a classic scenario for SCLC rather than peripheral adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, reinforcing the choice of B as the expected histology [^117KNoi2].

> Let me consider the distractors carefully. Option A with tall columnar cells lining alveolar septa suggests adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth, which does not match SCLC morphology; option C with layered squamous cells and keratin pearls indicates squamous cell carcinoma; and option D with pleomorphic giant cells and leukocyte fragments describes giant cell carcinoma, a large-cell undifferentiated variant, not SCLC; none of these patterns are expected with ectopic ADH secretion, which is a neuroendocrine SCLC phenomenon [^112FC2bY] [^114BgKTb] [^116GN6fj].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought option A might fit because some lung tumors can show glandular features, but that would be misleading here; adenocarcinoma is not the typical source of ectopic ADH, and its architecture and cytology are distinctly different from the small round blue cells of SCLC, so I should correct that initial inclination and affirm that B is the correct match for SCLC morphology in this paraneoplastic context [^112FC2bY] [^117KNoi2].

> Final answer: B. Sheets of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, which is the classic histologic appearance of small cell lung carcinoma, the lung cancer most strongly associated with ectopic ADH secretion and SIADH in a heavy smoker [^117KNoi2] [^116GN6fj] [^114a6oHF].

---

The most likely histologic appearance of a lung mass in a 50 pack-year smoker with markedly elevated ADH is **small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio** [^117KNoi2], consistent with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [^115Edcd7]. SCLC is the lung cancer most strongly associated with SIADH due to ectopic ADH production [^116GN6fj] [^114a6oHF], and its histology features sheets of small, round, hyperchromatic cells with minimal cytoplasm, nuclear molding, and frequent mitoses [^117KNoi2] [^114DHF4b]. This corresponds to option B.

---

## Histologic features of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)

SCLC has **distinct histologic features** that differentiate it from other lung malignancies:

- **Cell size and shape**: Small, round to oval cells, approximately 2–3 times the size of small lymphocytes [^117KNoi2].

- **Cytoplasm**: Scant, indistinct cytoplasm, resulting in a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio [^115Edcd7].

- **Nuclear features**: Hyperchromatic nuclei with finely granular chromatin, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, and frequent nuclear molding [^117KNoi2].

- **Mitotic activity**: High mitotic rate (> 10 mitoses per 2 mm²) [^115Edcd7].

- **Growth pattern**: Sheets or clusters of cells without distinct architectural organization [^117KNoi2].

- **Necrosis**: Frequent and extensive necrosis is common [^114DHF4b].

These features are consistent with **option B**, which describes sheets of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei [^117KNoi2].

---

## Association between SCLC and elevated ADH levels

SCLC is **notorious for its association with paraneoplastic syndromes**, including SIADH, due to ectopic hormone production [^116GN6fj]. Elevated ADH levels in SCLC result from the tumor's neuroendocrine differentiation, which allows it to synthesize and secrete hormones such as ADH [^114a6oHF]. Clinically significant hyponatremia due to SIADH occurs in approximately 5–10% of SCLC cases [^116GN6fj].

---

## Differential diagnosis of lung masses in smokers

While SCLC is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical scenario, other lung malignancies should be considered:

| **Histologic type** | **Key features** | **Association with adh** |
|-|-|-|
| Small cell carcinoma | Small round blue cells; high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio; frequent mitoses; necrosis | Strongly associated with SIADH [^116GN6fj] |
| Squamous cell carcinoma | Keratin pearls; intercellular bridges; layered squamous cells | Not associated with ADH secretion |
| Adenocarcinoma | Glandular formation; tall columnar cells; alveolar septa | Not associated with ADH secretion |
| Large cell carcinoma | Pleomorphic giant cells; abundant cytoplasm; leukocyte fragments | Not associated with ADH secretion |

---

Given the clinical context of a 50 pack-year smoker with markedly elevated ADH, **SCLC is the most likely diagnosis** [^116GN6fj], and its histologic appearance corresponds to option B [^117KNoi2].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely histologic appearance of the lung mass in a 50 pack-year smoker with markedly elevated ADH is **sheets of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei** [^117KNoi2], consistent with small cell lung carcinoma [^115Edcd7]. SCLC is strongly associated with ectopic ADH production, leading to SIADH, and its histologic features are distinct from other lung malignancies [^114a6oHF].

Nonadenocarcinoma non–small cell lung cancer — patient selection for molecular testing notes that although actionable mutations have been reported in biopsies with nonadenocarcinoma non–small cell types, the frequency is low enough that it is not recommended to test all small biopsy samples with nonadenocarcinoma histology, and molecular testing is appropriate when clinical features are atypical and/or consistent with a higher likelihood of a targetable mutation. Young age and absence of tobacco exposure are highlighted as chief factors indicating higher probability of a targetable oncogenic driver; alterations are most commonly reported with minimal (1–10 packs per year) or no tobacco exposure, and light or absent exposure should be sufficient rationale to prompt testing. Evidence on age includes that adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations had a lower mean age than those without mutations (56 years versus 63, P = 0.03), while the difference for ALK was not significant (60 versus 66) and for ROS1 was 65 versus 62; in the absence of published evidence, the opinion is that a reasonable strategy would be to test patients younger than 50 years with nonadenocarcinoma histology.

Identifying highest-risk subjects for chemoprevention trials — cohort selection and risk models — emphasizes concentrating on multifactor risk to improve trial efficiency and prediction. Selecting high-risk cohorts "reduces the sample size, the duration of the study, and the cost" and "optimizes the cost-benefit ratio for the study subjects", with selection of subjects having multiple risk factors such as " ≥ 20 pack-years, moderate COPD, and evidence of endobronchial histologic changes" to maximize resources. Risk relates to cumulative exposure, as "there appears to be a continuum between risk and 10, 20, and 30 pack-years of smoking" and "No one level has been accepted as a definitive threshold of what is considered high risk". Among prediction tools, the Tammemagi model was "based on a large population cohort of 35,254 ever smokers in the control arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO)", and its "receiver operator characteristic area under the curves was 0.805 in the training set and 0.75 in external validation using 44,223 subjects in the intervention arm"; external validation in British Columbia "confirmed the accuracy of the prediction model".

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2023 lung cancer screening guideline — CISNET modeling of years‑since‑quitting (YSQ) criteria: Modeling examined "three different YSQ scenarios", with the first two (WithYSQ and NoYSQexit) comparing durations "0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years", and a third (NoYSQ) eliminating YSQ with stop age varying "from 80 to 100 years". In the "1960 US birth cohort", very few reach "a ≥ 20 pack-year history and quit smoking ≥ 15 years before age 50 years". The " ≤ YSQ15 criterion" mainly reduces deaths averted by causing a "steady loss of eligibility… which accelerates after age 60 years". Relative to current YSQ15 policy, "eliminating YSQ criterion to continue screening… results in 18% more deaths averted versus 21% more deaths averted by eliminating the YSQ criterion… altogether", so "not exiting screening accounts for 86% of the additional deaths averted". Under current USPSTF rules, "an individual aged 50 years… would be disqualified from continuing screening at age 65 years". Easing or eliminating YSQ also led to "increased eligibility for LCS, increased numbers of deaths averted and LYG, and increased harms (false positives, biopsies, and estimated overdiagnosis and radiation-induced lung cancer deaths)".

### Paxillin expression and amplification in early lung lesions of high-risk patients, lung adenocarcinoma and metastatic disease [^112f8F3B]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Paxillin is overexpressed in premalignant epithelial lesions in high-risk patients. Representative images of transbronchial biopsy samples stained for paxillin. Paxillin staining localises to the cytoplasm and is enriched in the basal layers of the respiratory mucosa (arrows). The bottom row of pie graphs describes quantitative paxillin staining intensity in biopsy samples with hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia or goblet cell metaplasia morphology.

Figure 2
Preinvasive epithelial lesions from high-risk patients overexpress paxillin. Bronchoscopic biopsy samples showing dysplasia (A, B) and carcinoma (C, D). Note the large, irregular nuclei in the upper portion of the respiratory (white arrow) and mitotic figure (arrowheads) mucosa in (A) and (B). Paxillin staining is strongest along the basal and parabasal layers (arrows in D).

Dysplasia and carcinoma were associated with a long history of smoking (table 3). On the other hand, hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia and goblet cell metaplasia were associated with a corresponding increase in mean smoking pack-year history, indicating that hyperplastic changes occur earliest in smokers, whereas goblet cell metaplasia occurs in the setting of a longer smoking history. The highest levels of paxillin staining were observed in patients with the longest smoking history. Stronger paxillin staining was visible in 69% of biopsy samples from current smokers (22/32) compared with 49% of biopsy samples from former smokers (24/49) (p = 0.0395, χ² test).

Pack-years of smoking by histology and paxillin expression

Gene copy number of paxillin correlates with histological subtype and KRAS mutation

A pilot series of 11 human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples representing various histological subtypes were examined by FISH to determine if paxillin (12q24.23) gene copy number alteration correlated with a specific histological subtype of lung cancer (table 4). Paxillin gene copy number was increased in two of four adenocarcinoma samples, whereas paxillin gene copy number changes in other histological subtypes were not observed. EGFR and KRAS mutation status were examined on enriched tumour foci isolated using laser capture microscopy. A KRAS mutation in codon 12/13 was detected in one of the two adenocarcinomas cases with increased paxillin gene copy number, indicating that KRAS muationand altered paxillin gene copy number are not mutually exclusive. No mutations in exon 19 or exon 21 of EGFR in any samples were detected.

Non–small-cell lung adenocarcinoma patient narrative — biomarker-driven therapy and outcomes — reports an X-ray finding of a large, 7-cm mass in my lung and diagnosis with non–small-cell lung adenocarcinoma; the patient noted that 90% of people with lung cancer are smokers, and only 15% of lung cancer patients survive 5 years. A planned surgical biopsy was not performed because the surgeon was not willing to operate on a stage IV patient like me. After 3 weeks the tumor had an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation identified; after 3 months and four rounds of chemotherapy plus Tarceva, the tumor shrank in size to less than a centimeter, with surgery 2 weeks later for an upper left lobectomy and daily Tarceva for 2 years postsurgery. The patient acquired a resistance mutation known as T790M, and as of reporting it has been 4 years since my last surgery; the patient states being a 10-year nonsmoker lung cancer survivor.

### Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors: what (little) do we know? [^115FdRzs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors are a distinct subset of tumors composing approximately 20% of all lung cancers. The major categories of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors include typical and atypical carcinoids, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and the more common small cell lung cancer. They are classified into different categories in the 2004 World Health Organization system, but share structural and morphologic features. Despite these shared features, their clinical characteristics range from indolent to aggressive, and therefore the approach to treatment depends on the histologic subtype. This article discusses the current understanding of the epidemiology, pathologic characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of this spectrum of diseases.

### A comparative analysis of heterogeneity in lung cancer screening effectiveness in two randomised controlled trials [^1119DpQG]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Heterogeneity in LC screening effectiveness was evaluated in individual-level data from the two largest screening trials through traditional sub-group analyses, predictive-modelling and machine-learning. Estimates were similar across methodologies, for both NELSON (median LCM reduction across methods = 27.2%, 95% CI: 10.8–40.9%) and NLST (median = 15.3%, 95% CI: 3.7–25.5%) after accounting for differences in participant characteristics between trials. The greater reduction in LCM in NELSON compared to NLST may reflect differences in trial designs, such as differences in control arms (NELSON: no screening. NLST: chest radiography screening) and number of screening rounds (NELSON: four screening rounds. NLST: three screening rounds). Screening effectiveness diminished with increasing pack-years (LCM reductions across trials = 26.8–50.9% in the lowest pack-year groups compared to 5.5–9.5% in the highest pack-year groups), former smokers compared to current smokers (LCM reductions = 37.8–39.1% versus 16.1–22.7%) and women compared to men (LCM reductions = 24.6–25.3% versus 8.3–24.9%). LC risks estimated by risk-prediction models were lower for groups with higher estimated relative screening effectiveness. However, histology was identified as the main effect modifier of heterogeneity in LC screening effectiveness. Screening was effective for adenocarcinoma and OTH, reducing mortality by 17.8–23.0% (medians NELSON&NLST) and 24.5–35.5% (medians NELSON&NLST), respectively. In contrast, screening was less effective for small-cell cancers, reducing mortality by 9.7–11.3% (medians NELSON&NLST) and discordant results were found for squamous-cell carcinoma (NELSON: median reduction of 52.2% (95% CI: 25.7–69.1% decrease); NLST: median increase of 27.9% (95% CI: 69.8% increase to 4.5% decrease)). Our findings are consistent with natural-history models that estimate longer preclinical durations and greater screen-detectability for histologies for which we find greater screening effectiveness. In particular, we find greater screening effectiveness for histologies that predominantly develop in locations that allow for easier detection through screening. For example, adenocarcinomas develop predominantly in the periphery of the lungs, as opposed to small-cell cancers that tend to be centrally located. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with regards to observed relations between histology and smoking behaviour, and variations in survival by histology and smoking behaviour –. Consequently, these mechanisms may drive the heterogeneity in screening effectiveness found in our study.

The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 6 — EGFR mutation prevalence in primarily non-Asian lung cancer patients shows higher rates in never smokers and in adenocarcinoma histology, with sex-, smoking-, pack-year–, and histology-specific counts. Females have 28% prevalence with 859 mutation-positive and 2239 negative cases across 19 studies (N = 3098), whereas males have 18% with 397 positive and 1768 negative across 19 studies (N = 2165). Never smokers have 45% prevalence (666 positive, 805 negative; 18 studies, N = 1471) compared with 15% in ever smokers (569 positive, 3154 negative; 18 studies, N = 3723). By pack-years, 0–10 shows 39% (18 positive, 28 negative; 1 study, N = 46), 11–50 shows 8% (7 positive, 86 negative; 1 study, N = 93), and > 50 shows 5% (3 positive, 56 negative; 1 study, N = 59). By histology, adenocarcinoma is 24% (1266 positive, 3918 negative; 19 studies, N = 5184), squamous is 5% (6 positive, 104 negative; 9 studies, N = 110), adenosquamous is 13% (1 positive, 7 negative; 2 studies, N = 8), and large cell is 5% (2 positive, 37 negative; 6 studies, N = 39).

### Long-term impact of smoking on lung epithelial proliferation in current and former smokers [^117FqSqj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer risk remains elevated for many years after quitting smoking. To assess using proliferation indices in bronchial tissues as an intermediate endpoint biomarker in lung cancer chemoprevention trials, we determined the relationship between the extent, intensity, and cessation of tobacco smoking and proliferative changes in bronchial epithelial biopsy specimens.

Methods

Bronchial biopsy specimens were obtained from up to six epithelial sites in 120 current smokers (median pack-years, 42) and 207 former smokers (median pack-years, 40; median quit-years, 8.1). Sections from the paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin — eosin to determine the metaplasia index and with an antibody to Ki-67 to determine the proliferative (labeling) index for the basal and parabasal (Ki-67 PLI) layers. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

Biopsy sites with metaplasia had statistically significantly higher Ki-67-labeling indices than those without metaplasia (P < .001) in both current and former smokers. Increased proliferation was observed in multiple biopsy sites, with the average Ki-67 PLI of the subject strongly correlating with the metaplasia index (r = .72 for current smokers; P < .001), even in sites without metaplasia (r = .23 for current smokers; P < .001). In current smokers, the Ki-67 PLI was associated with the number of packs smoked/day (P = 0.02) but not with smoking years or pack-years. In subjects who had quit smoking, the Ki-67 PLI dropped statistically significantly within 1 year (P = 0.008) but remained detectable for more than 20 years, even in the absence of squamous metaplasia.

Conclusion

Smoking appears to elicit a dose-related proliferative response in the bronchial epithelia of active smokers. Although the proliferative response decreased gradually in former smokers, a subset of individuals had detectable proliferation for many years and may benefit from targeted chemoprevention. Bronchial epithelial proliferation, measured by Ki-67, may provide a useful biomarker in the assessment of lung cancer risk and in the response to chemopreventive interventions.

Transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) evidence base — A foundational meta-analysis included 46 studies and additional reports that focused on needle aspiration or biopsy for localized pulmonary lesions. Eligibility and verification standards required that at least 90% of study populations had parenchymal pulmonary lesions, all diagnoses were verified by surgical biopsy, biopsy of an adjacent site with tumor involvement, culture results, or clinical follow-up for at least 1 year, and at least 90% of patients in each study had a histologic reference standard diagnosis; cytology alone was not accepted. In reanalysis, five studies with < 50 patients were excluded, only one cut-point was used (definite malignancy or suspicious for malignancy as test positive, all other results as test negative), and in 2007 five additional studies published from 2001 to 2004 were incorporated.

### IgG4-related lung disease as a differential diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disease: atypical presentation of an atypical disease [^112z2ZV5]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Initially, a malignant lymphoproliferative process with lymphangitic carcinomatosis of the lung was considered as the most probable diagnosis. Given the extensive adenopathies, Castleman disease was also considered, although the lack of lymph node enhancement and the lung interstitial and mass-like involvement made it less likely.

A primary lung malignancy also seemed likely; in an older, heavy smoker patient with cough and weight loss, the suspicion of primary lung cancer should be high.

Lastly, although probably lower than lymphoproliferative diseases and lung cancer, sarcoidosis should be considered. It can typically cause lymphadenopathy (hilar, mediastinal and less typically extrapulmonary), interstitial changes and less often mass-like opacities.

Small cell lung cancer — panel surgical recommendations: The Panel recommends that in patients who do not smoke tobacco, small lesions that are presumed to be small cell carcinoma on biopsy should be resected because they are likely carcinoids that have been misdiagnosed. The Panel also recommends surgery for certain patients with clinical stage I–IIA (T1–2, N0) SCLC with negative nodes that have been confirmed by pathologic lymph node staging. Surgery can include patients with clinical limited stage IIA SCLC based on the staging criteria that includes tumors < 5 cm in diameter (T2b) without lymph node involvement (N0). The Panel made recommendations for patients who did not have a preoperative biopsy but have an intraoperative diagnosis of likely SCLC. If resection is performed, the Panel recommends lobectomy (preferred) with mediastinal lymph node dissection or systematic lymph node sampling (eg, ≥ 3 N2 and ≥ 1 N1 stations). The Panel does not recommend pneumonectomy if nodal metastatic disease.

### Primary and secondary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the larynx: a review [^116y32bX]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

Primary laryngeal small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC) is an unusual malignancy accounting for < 0.5% of laryngeal carcinomas. To date, approximately 200 cases of primary and 5 of secondary SCNC of the larynx have been reported. This tumor most often presents in the sixth and seventh decades in men who are heavy cigarette smokers. The lesion may be associated with different paraneoplastic syndromes (ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome, Schwartz-Bartter syndrome or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, and Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome) or with ectopic hormone production. The diagnosis is based essentially on the histologic appearance of the tumor, confirmed by immunocytochemical investigations. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens offer potential for long-term survival. This tumor is biologically aggressive, and the extent of the disease is the most significant independent prognostic factor of survival. The survival rate is similar to that with pulmonary SCNC.

### Smoking-related interstitial fibrosis (SRIF) in patients presenting with diffuse parenchymal lung disease [^114V3zwn]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Histologic Data

Our pathologic analysis and scoring were based on surgical lung biopsy specimens. The pathologic findings are shown in correlation with imaging findings in Figures 4 and 5. Surgical lung biopsy specimens from all six cases showed SRIF, characterized by thickening of alveolar septa by dense, eosinophilic, "ropey-appearing" hyalinized collagen. Although GGOs were radiologically diffuse, pathologic fibrosis was patchy in most areas, involving mainly subpleural and peribronchiolar lung parenchyma. In some cases, a lobule with SRIF was separated from a lobule of nonfibrotic lung by an interlobular septum FIGURE 5D, 5F. However, occasionally (eg, case 1, upper lobe), fibrosis thickened the alveolar septa in a diffuse and uniform manner, mimicking the histologic appearance of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) FIGURE 5A. Histologically, SRIF involved all lobes but was upper lobe predominant in three cases (cases 1, 2, and 5), middle lobe predominant in one case (case 4), and similar in all three lobes in one case (case 3). In case 6, only the lower lobe was sampled, precluding histologic assessment of distribution. Correlation of histologic SRIF with radiologic GGO using our semiquantitative scoring system is shown in FIGURE 2.

Contralateral additional pulmonary tumor nodules (M1a) — Only a few studies have reported data on patients with contralateral pulmonary tumor nodules, and the panel suggests that a careful search with further imaging be undertaken in all such patients and that invasive mediastinal staging is performed; given that the histologic type is not a major prognostic factor, it does not appear to be necessary to perform a needle biopsy to define the histologic type. Surgical resection in patients with contralateral pulmonary tumor nodules appears to result in good 5-year survival.

### Frozen section of lung specimens [^115rqZxM]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Frozen section of lung tissue is performed to guide the surgeon in subsequent therapy.

Design

Practical experience in frozen section of the lung was reviewed in the medical literature and from the records of several academic hospitals.

Results

Most frozen sections of the lung are performed for evaluation of a solitary nodule, a mass, or the surgical margins of a resection. Frozen section may also be used to assess the adequacy of a lung wedge biopsy taken for later diagnosis of a condition.

Conclusion

The pathologic evaluation of intraoperative pulmonary lesions is indicated for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and masses, both neoplastic and nonneoplastic, surgical resection margins, and mediastinal lymph nodes. The most worrisome pitfalls involve differentiating benign reactive atypia from malignancy on frozen section.

### Revision of the 1996 working formulation for the standardization of nomenclature in the diagnosis of lung rejection [^115ua82G]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Medium credibility.

Smokers'‑type respiratory bronchiolitis in lung transplant biopsies shows an accumulation of tan-colored alveolar macrophages around respiratory bronchioles, with macrophages that may contain flecks of brown or black material and show Prussian blue positivity; there may be associated interstitial thickening with variable chronic inflammation and other features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease such as goblet-cell metaplasia, mucostasis and bronchiolar metaplasia, and this appearance should be distinguished from rejection-related inflammation and BALT. The incidence has increased with expansion of the donor pool to include smokers' organs, dust macules/nodules may be of donor origin, and persistence of smokers' macrophages in the donor lung should not be confused with recipient smoking.

Case 3

Premenopausal woman, menarche at the age of 11, one high-risk pregnancy due to placental abruption and rupture, one spontaneous abortion due to fetal growth restriction and a third pregnancy without complications, two cesarean sections, with a history of hysterectomy for a hemorrhagic uterine leiomyoma complicated by retroperitoneal bleeding with acute anemia at the age of 40. The patient is obese (body mass index, BMI: 30.1 kg/m 2), has a history of dyslipidemia, smoking in late adolescence (7 pack-years), childhood adenoidectomy, childhood asthma and vertebral bone degenerative disease, and an allergy to etoricoxib (facial edema). The patient has no personal history of cancer but has a family history of cancer: father died at 57 with oral cavity and esophageal cancers (was a smoker and alcoholic), paternal grandfather died at 72 with lung cancer (was a smoker), paternal uncle died at 50+ with pancreatic cancer, maternal uncle died at 50 with gastric cancer. There was no history of renal cell cancer or of other tumors in the family. Four years after hysterectomy (at the age of 44), the patient developed what seemed to be a recurrence of her childhood asthma symptoms, with episodes of dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, and hypersomnia. The symptoms would exacerbate on physical exertion. A chest X-ray revealed a right lung mass. A subsequent thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan showed a tissue-dense, spiked-countour node on the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, invading the mediastinal pleura, plus a second tissue-dense, bilobed, ampulliform mass in the left pulmonary hilum, involving the left pulmonary artery anteriorly and compressing the left main bronchus and adjacent segmental bronchii. There were no lymphadenopathies or any other findings. A PET scan revealed increased metabolism of the lung lesions. The right lung node was biopsied, presenting a fusocellular proliferation, without atypia, necrosis or mitotic activity, positive for desmin, caldesmon, estrogen receptors, and actin (weak expression). Remaining markers were negative, namely cytokeratins, ALK1, S100, CD34, myogenin, myoD1, inhibin, calretinin, CD117, and HMB-45. This result was compatible with a benign mesenchymal neoplasia with smooth muscle differentiation. A fine needle aspiration cytology was performed on the left lung hilar mass, which showed the same fusocellular, benign proliferation pattern. CA 125 and routine blood tests were normal. Serum assessment of estradiol and FSH and LH were at premenopausal levels. The patient was started on hormone therapy with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days subcutaneous + letrozole 2.5 mg once daily. Estrogen levels decreased from premenopausal levels of 166 to < 9 pg/mL. The patient mentioned no desire to have more children and was submitted to bilateral annexectomy. After bilateral annexectomy, goserelin was discontinued and letrozole was kept at 2.5 mg once daily. At a follow-up assessment, serum hormone levels were found to be compatible with postmenopausal levels. A follow-up chest CT scan performed 6 months after starting hormonal blockade and 2 months after surgical castration showed a significant reduction of the pulmonary lesions' size, the right upper lobe mass with a 74% reduction in size, and the left pulmonary hilum mass with a 44% reduction in size. The patient has been on respiratory kinesitherapy and her symptoms have improved.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) — epidemiology, morphology, and differential diagnosis: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comprises 14% of all lung cancers, with > 30,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States, and almost all patients are heavy smokers with the majority presenting with a perihilar mass; nearly all patients present in advanced stages with disseminated disease, and diagnosis relies primarily on small transbronchial biopsy samples or cytologic material. SCLC cells are small, generally two to three times the size of small lymphocytes, with key morphologic features including scant cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear molding, finely granular chromatin, and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli; crush artifact and perivascular basophilic condensation (Azzopardi effect) often are seen, and the tumor grows in large sheets with vague organoid nesting, a ribbon-like pattern, and rosettes, with interobserver agreement > 95% when these criteria are satisfied. TTF-1, although expressed in the majority of SCLCs, cannot be used as evidence of pulmonary origin because it is also expressed in small cell carcinomas of extrapulmonary sites. In most cases, differentiating SCLC from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is achieved by routine morphologic examination; NSCLC cells are larger with a moderate amount of cytoplasm, vesicular or coarse chromatin pattern, and prominent nucleoli, nuclear molding and smearing are not usually seen, and glandular or squamous differentiation or specific immunoreactivity to napsin A or p63 aids in the diagnosis of NSCLC. A subset belongs to combined SCLC, where at least 10% of the tumor shows morphologic features of a large cell carcinoma and rarely adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

### Unusual primary lung tumors: a radiologic-pathologic overview [^114J9U95]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Although the great majority of lung carcinomas are histologically characterized as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell undifferentiated carcinoma, or small cell carcinoma, a variety of rare benign and malignant lung tumors may sporadically affect the lung. Several nonneoplastic tumorlike lesions are seen infrequently but are also part of the differential diagnosis for lung masses. Conventional radiographic findings, although of limited value in the diagnosis of these entities, should be examined carefully when lung tumors are suspected. Computed tomography (CT) is well suited for making a definitive diagnosis of some disease processes. CT helps determine the location and features of the lesions and depicts associated findings to help document the extent of disease. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed when there are typical CT features (eg, the presence of fat in lipoid pneumonia). Although unusual primary lung tumors are difficult to diagnose on the basis of imaging findings alone because such findings are nonspecific in the majority of cases, cross-sectional imaging can play an important role in the diagnostic work-up of these unusual tumors by delineating their extent and directing the radiologist or bronchoscopist to the appropriate biopsy site.

Clinicopathologic Assessment

Clinical patient characteristics were annotated by reviewing the electronic medical record. The baseline characteristics included age, sex, tobacco smoking history, date of diagnosis, pathology sample site, and pathology sample type. Radiology data were reviewed to collect information on the metastatic site distribution at presentation. Smoking history was collected from the patient-completed smoking questionnaire. Pack-years of smoking were derived as follows: [(average number of cigarettes smoked per day/20) × years of smoking]. Never-smokers were defined as patients who had smoked < 100 cigarettes, and light smokers were defined as those who had a ≤ 10 pack-year smoking history.

Tumor classification was performed according to the criteria in the 2021 World Health Organization classification of thoracic tumors. All tumors underwent central pathologic review by pathologists with expertise in thoracic tumors (NR, CFA, and JC). The criteria for SCLC included undifferentiated morphology with high a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and nearly imperceptible cytoplasm, cell molding, mitotic count of > 10 per 2 mm² (if sufficient well-preserved tissue available to perform the counts) and Ki67 proliferation index of ≥ 50%, commonly associated with extensive necrosis. The criteria for carcinoids included a well-differentiated morphology composed of uniform cells with lower nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and readily visible cytoplasm, mitotic count of ≤ 10 per 2 mm², and absence of extensive necrosis. For survival analysis, carcinoids were classified as typical or atypical using the World Health Organization criteria: < 2 mitoses per 2 mm² and no necrosis for typical carcinoids, and ≥ 2 mitoses per 2 mm² and/or focal necrosis for atypical carcinoids. Samples that were too crushed or poorly preserved to evaluate the morphology, or that had equivocal morphologic features, were regarded as unclassified. For all patients, pathologic specimens and clinical records were reviewed in detail to exclude the possibility of an alternative tumor type or nonpulmonary origin.

Histopathological features of HP — Lung biopsy often plays a pivotal role in diagnosis. The findings that make a diagnosis of HP likely apply to both nonfibrotic (cellular) and fibrotic variants, differing by the presence or absence of a fibrotic pattern that may overlap histologically with fibrotic IPF. For nonfibrotic, or cellular, HP, a confident histopathological diagnosis requires typical features including: 1) a cellular interstitial pneumonia accentuated around small airways ("bronchiolocentric") with 2) a cellular chronic bronchiolitis, 3) a distinctive pattern of granulomatous inflammation, and 4) no histopathological features to suggest a more likely alternative.

Materials and methods

Patients

The study material used for IHC consists of lung tissues from 50 IPF patients who had undergone surgical lung biopsy at the Oulu University Hospital for diagnostic purposes between 1991 and 2019 as described in the previous study. Lung tissue specimens taken at autopsy from 8 out of 50 patients were also studied. IPF was diagnosed according to the international guidelines. The patients experiencing AE-IPF during follow-up (n = 22) were identified either based on the surgical lung biopsy and autopsy material showing DAD in parallel with UIP indicating AE-IPF (n = 9), or by applying the current criteria for AE-IPF (n = 13). Control samples (n = 10) were derived from histologically normal-looking lung tissues from non-smoking patients being operated for lung adenocarcinoma.

Date of birth, gender, age, smoking status, pharmacological treatment, and pulmonary function test results at the time of biopsy were collected from electronic patient records. Patients with less than 5 pack-years of smoking history were regarded as non-smokers. The overall survival time was calculated from biopsy date to death, transplantation, or last follow-up date (May 11, 2021). Death dates were collected from death certificates obtained from the national registry of Statistics Finland.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure — instillation, retrieval, and sample requirements: Normal saline at room temperature is instilled with a total volume between 100 and 300 mL divided into three to five aliquots, and each aliquot is retrieved using negative suction pressure less than 100 mm Hg. The minimal total volume retrieved should be greater than or equal to 5% of the instilled volume, and if less than 5% of each instilled aliquot is recovered due to retention of fluid in the lung, the procedure should be aborted to avoid increased risk. For cellular analysis, a minimal pooled volume of 5 mL is needed (optimal 10–20 ml), and pooling aliquots for routine analyses is acceptable. Gross appearance may aid diagnosis; BAL fluid with flocculent material that settles to the bottom of the container within 15 to 20 minutes is highly suggestive of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.

### A comparative analysis of heterogeneity in lung cancer screening effectiveness in two randomised controlled trials [^111H6uaw]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Clinical trials demonstrate that screening can reduce lung cancer mortality by over 20%. However, lung cancer screening effectiveness (reduction in lung cancer specific mortality) may vary by personal risk-factors. Here we evaluate heterogeneity in lung cancer screening effectiveness through traditional sub-group analyses, predictive modelling approaches and machine-learning in individual-level data from the Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON; 14,808 participants, 12,429 men, 2377 women, 2 persons with an unknown sex) and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST; 53,405 participants, 31,501 men, 21,904 women). We find that screening effectiveness varies by pack-years (screening effectiveness ranges across trials: lowest groups = 26.8–50.9%, highest groups = 5.5–9.5%), smoking status (screening effectiveness ranges across trials: former smokers = 37.8–39.1%, current smokers = 16.1–22.7%) and sex (screening effectiveness ranges across trials: women = 24.6–25.3%; men = 8.3–24.9%). Furthermore, screening effectiveness varies by histology (screening effectiveness ranges across trials: adenocarcinoma = 17.8–23.0%, other lung cancers = 24.5–35.5%, small-cell carcinoma = 9.7%-11.3%). Screening is ineffective for squamous-cell carcinoma in NLST (screening effectiveness = 27.9% (95% confidence interval: 69.8% increase to 4.5% decrease) mortality increase) but effective in NELSON (screening effectiveness = 52.2% (95% confidence interval: 25.7–69.1% decrease) mortality reduction). We find that variations in screening effectiveness across pack-years, smoking status, and sex are primarily explained by a greater prevalence of histologies with favourable screening effectiveness in these groups. Our study shows that heterogeneity in lung screening effectiveness is primarily driven by histology and that relaxing smoking-related screening eligibility criteria may enhance screening effectiveness.

### Relationships of serum CC16 levels with smoking status and lung function in COPD [^116ghpUi]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

While lung function in COPD is thought to be influenced by multiple factors including chronic inflammation, ongoing deleterious structural changes, and overproduction of mucus leading to airway obstruction, a complete understanding of mechanisms remains elusive. Experimentally, cigarette-smoke exposed mice lacking CC16 have shown indications of lung injury consistent with COPD pathologies. Utilizing a mouse-model of COPD, mice that received intranasally-administered recombinant CC16 experienced reductions in cigarette-smoked induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), reduced NF-κB activation, decreases in inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced alveolar size. Our study supports that the magnitude of smoking history, particularly in former smokers with COPD, is important in CC16 responses because of the inverse relationship found between the number of pack-years smoked and serum CC16 level. Bernard and colleagues also reported that CC16 serum levels decreased by an estimated 15% with each 10-pack-year unit increase in healthy smoking adults. A potential explanation is serum CC16 expression following cessation in COPD subjects may be partially determined by prior smoking intensity (i.e. pack-years). Experimental data to support these notions are currently lacking, but the smoke exposure "dose" could impact amount/degree of damage to respiratory epithelium including the abundance of club cells which secrete CC16 protein. This dose–response relationship suggested by number of pack-years smoked may not be demonstrated in current smokers with COPD due to the ongoing smoke-exposure causing damage to club cells and sustained suppression of CC16 in this sample of current smokers with significant smoking history (average 35 pack-years). Whereas smoke exposure induces long-lasting effects on club cells, this effect, appears to be potentially reversible because we demonstrated increasing levels of CC16 with more time since smoking cessation among former smokers with COPD. This encouraging and novel observation requires further investigation as strategies aimed at increasing effector club cell numbers as well as club cell function that secrete the anti-inflammatory/antioxidant CC16 protein may represent novel approaches to reduce disease burden.

Eligibility expansion and disparities — modeling suggests that screening at an earlier age with fewer pack-years may help address inequities, and expanding to A-50–80–20–15 substantially increases eligibility across groups. Screening for lung cancer in persons at an earlier age and with fewer pack-years of smoking (ie, 20 pack-years) may also help partially ameliorate racial disparities in screening eligibility. A strategy of annual screening of persons aged 50 to 80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years (A-50–80–20–15) would increase the relative percentage of persons eligible for screening by 87% overall — 78% in non-Hispanic White adults, 107% in non-Hispanic Black adults, and 112% in Hispanic adults — compared with 2013 USPSTF criteria (A-55–80–30–15); similarly, this strategy would increase the relative percentage eligible by 80% in men and by 96% in women.

### Lung tumors with neuroendocrine morphology: essential radiologic and pathologic features [^114B7fyo]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Tumors with neuroendocrine morphology are a distinct subset of lung neoplasms sharing characteristic histologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular features.

Objective

To review the current histologic classification and the diagnostic criteria for the major categories of neuroendocrine tumors of the lung.

Data Sources

Published classification systems from the World Health Organization and pertinent peer-reviewed articles indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) form the basis of this review.

Conclusions

Accurate classification of the neuroendocrine tumors of the lung requires knowledge of specific criteria separating the major categories, which is essential for determining prognosis and treatment.

### Distinguishing Cushing's disease from the ectopic ACTH syndrome: needles in a haystack or hiding in plain sight? [^113pzokT]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

1.1 Prevalence and nonpituitary source of

The EAS is rare. It is reported in approximately 1%–5% of patients with SCLC,3% of patients with lung or pancreatic NETs (excluding MEN1)and 0.7% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but may occur in up to 25% of thymic NETs,(including MEN1). Contemporary studies suggest that more cases of EAS are being identified, potentially due to increased awareness. However, when looking at ACTH‐dependent Cushing's syndrome overall, some 10%–20% of such patients may harbour an ectopic source. The prevalence of EAS in patients with ACTH‐dependent Cushing's syndrome has likely increased over the years due to vastly improved imaging techniques, and it may also be found to be more common in patients with NETs if more detailed endocrine studies were performed.

The most frequent site of ectopic ACTH is the lung. The largest published collection of series, with 383 EAS patients, suggests that lung NETs are the most common tumour (> 25%) with a roughly equal prevalence of typical and atypical histopathology, followed by SCLC (~20%). The next most common tumours are thymic (11%) and pancreatic NETs (8%), medullary thyroid cancer (6%) and phaeochromocytomas (5%). However, up to 20% of ACTH‐secreting tumours remain undiscovered, being referred to as "occult" despite repeated evaluation, although progressively smaller numbers are reported in recent studies due to more sophisticated imaging techniques and, probably, longer follow‐up intervals. The lung nevertheless remains the major occult source where tumours are eventually demonstrated, although this may take many years to become apparent.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112CH8Y3]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Histologic diagnostic criteria for nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) — alternative diagnosis indicates a biopsy favoring other processes such as primary small airway disease (ie bronchiolitis from a variety of causes), which is usually distinguishable since the findings are restricted to the small airways and there is a lack of appreciable involvement of the surrounding alveoli; other interstitial lung diseases listed include sarcoidosis (well-formed granulomas that may coalesce in a lymphatic distribution), aspiration (bronchiolocentric inflammation frequently with foreign material and giant cell or histiocytic reaction) that tends not to be as uniform and diffuse as HP, connective tissue disease, drug induced lung disease, immunodeficiency (increased plasma cells, prominent lymphoid hyperplasia and/or cellular interstitial lymphoid infiltrates, pleuritis, granulomas), respiratory bronchiolitis or other smoking-related lesions (bronchiolocentric pigmented alveolar macrophages), granulomatous infection (robust, frequent necrotizing granulomas, especially mycobacterial, and fungal infections), pneumoconiosis/occupational exposures (flock workers-lymphocytic bronchiolitis and lymphoid hyperplasia; berylliosis – well-formed granulomas), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (peribronchiolar cellular infiltrates of Langerhans cells with or without cavitation and/or fibrosis).

### Desquamative interstitial pneumonia in a non-smoker with neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen syndrome) [^115KzMCm]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Interstitial lung disease has been reported in NF1 with an incidence of 5.5%–23%. Ground glass opacities, cystic lesions and emphysematous changes are the most common described radiological findings, but the association of these findings to NF1 is controversial since all those reported patients had history of smoking. There are limited data of cases of NF1 with interstitial lung disease documented with tissue biopsy in the literature. The histopathological patterns reported include non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), chronic eosinophilic pneumoniaand DIP. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of DIP-pattern of injury in non-smoker patients with NF1.

DIP is characterised by diffuse involvement of the lung by numerous histiocytes filling the airspaces with a sheet-like configuration and slight thickening of the alveolar septa. A histopathological pattern that is typical for DIP, commonly associated with smoking, has also been described in autoimmune disorders, after occupational exposures and drugs. The absence of any drug or environmental exposures in the history of this patient argue in favour that his interstitial lung disease with the DIP-pattern is most likely associated with the NF1. Further, increased levels of circulating monocytes and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines are observed in NF1 patients providing evidence of chronic inflammation associated with NF1. The mechanism of DIP in NF1 is unclear but it has been proposed that the connection between NF1 and interstitial lung disease could be linked to a mesenchymal defect in NF1leading to deposition of collagen. Patients with NF1 have also been noted to have increased levels of nerve growth factor which may have a pro-fibrogenic effect on lung tissue.

Pulmonary hypertension has also been described as a complication in patients with NF1, sometimes leading to right ventricular failure and death. Neoangiogenesis of the large, medium-sized and small vessel leading to pulmonary vasculopathy with intimal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and fibrosis is the possible pathogenic mechanism. In addition to the DIP-pattern, pulmonary hypertensive changes were histologically seen in the biopsy from this patient, but there was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterisation. Though these vascular changes might be secondary to the presence of interstitial disease, neurofibromin has clearly been established as a critical regulator of endothelial cell (EC), VSMC and bone marrow cell function. Excessive and chronic infiltration of macrophages into the neointima promoting EC senescence and increased VSMC proliferation may explain the endothelial changes found in our patient and the association between NF1 and pulmonary hypertension.

### Paraneoplastic syndrome as the presentation of limited stage small cell carcinoma [^114TmEjn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive form of pulmonary malignancy which accounts for 15–20% of lung cancer cases. SCLC is well known for its rapid doubling time, tendency to metastasize, and its affinity for relapsing. Nearly 60–70% of patients with SCLC present with disseminated disease, and early diagnosis improves outcomes. Typical presentations include cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. However, SCLC can present in more atypical ways.

Paraneoplastic syndromes such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, hypercalcemia, and Cushing's syndrome are some atypical presentations. Up to 10% of patients with lung cancer develop a paraneoplastic syndrome during the course of their disease progression. An even smaller number of patients have paraneoplastic syndromes as their presenting feature. It is therefore not surprising that abnormal laboratory values can be misinterpreted as isolated findings when there is no obvious evidence of malignancy.

SCLC has almost an exclusive association with cigarette smoking. In one study, smoking was associated in 100 and 97.9% of cases in men and women, respectively. With this strong of a relationship, SCLC should be considered in current and past smokers with evidence of abnormal laboratories or symptoms consistent with paraneoplastic syndromes. The following case depicts how identifying a paraneoplastic syndrome helped uncover an underlying SCLC and improve one patient's prognosis.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111FRyzT]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hot tub lung — histopathology and categorization related to hypersensitivity pneumonitis are depicted with granulomas within the bronchiolar lumen and adjacent airspaces consisting of rounded collections of epithelioid histiocytes; a well-formed granuloma shows a sharply circumscribed border with few chronic inflammatory cells, and in hot tub lung the granulomas are what tend to stand out. Biopsy demonstrates multiple small nodules centered on bronchioles at low power and, on medium power, the lesion of peribronchiolar metaplasia consisting of slight fibrotic thickening of the bronchiolar wall with surrounding alveolar walls mildly thickened and pneumocytes replaced by bronchiolar-type epithelium; the surrounding alveolar parenchyma is relatively normal with preserved architecture, and bronchiolar epithelium consists of ciliated and nonciliated columnar and cuboidal epithelial cells. Such a case would be included in the category of indeterminate for hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Principles of pathologic review — immunohistochemistry: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) should be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation when there is morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine morphology. NCAM (CD56), chromogranin, synaptophysin, and INSM1 are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors in cases in which morphologic suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists. A panel of markers is useful, but one positive marker is enough if the staining is unambiguous in > 10% of the tumor cells.

For individuals at risk for lung cancer and for patients with a history of lung cancer, the use of vitamin E, retinoids, and N-acetylcysteine and isotretinoin is not recommended for primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention of lung cancer (Grade 1A). For individuals at risk for lung cancer and for patients with a history of lung cancer, the use of aspirin is not recommended for primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention.

Table 1
Patient Characteristics (n = 626)

Figure 1
Years of Smoking Cessation to Lung Cancer Diagnosis versus Percent of Former Smokers, n = 411. Sixty percent of patients in a surgical lung cancer cohort with a smoking history had stopped smoking 11–60 years (mean 18.1 ± 15.7, median 16, IQR 3 to 30) before lung cancer diagnosis.

The histology of lung cancer differed across smoking status. (p = 0.007, Figure 2) Post hoc tests showed that the percent of lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma was lower in smokers than in never-smokers (64.3% versus 79.9%, p = 0.0004). In contrast, the percent with squamous cell carcinoma was higher in smokers than in never-smokers (15.5% versus 8.3%, p = 0.028). (Figure 2)

Figure 2

Lung cancer epidemiology and smoking risk — United States and worldwide data indicate substantial burden and smoking-related risk: The number of newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer in the United States in 2012 was estimated to be 226,160, and lung cancer causes more deaths (160,340) than colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer combined; estimated 2011 new lung cancer cases worldwide were 1,608,800, with an estimated 1,387,400 deaths. The single most important modifiable risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, and today 19.3% of the adult population in the United States continues to smoke. In those who actively smoke, the risk of lung cancer is, on average, 10-fold higher than in lifetime never smokers (defined as a person who has smoked < 100 cigarettes), and more than half of lung cancers occur in individuals who have stopped smoking. The 5-year US survival rate for lung cancer is a discouraging 16%.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^114a6oHF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the frequent association between nonmalignant lung pathology (eg, pneumonia, pleural effusion) and SIAD, an unanswered question is whether AVP or AVP-like peptides can be produced in the lung, or whether this is pituitary mediated. Small cell lung carcinoma, derived from neuroendocrine cells in the lung epithelium, produces paraneoplastic AVP in approximately 10% to 15% of cases. Whether nonneoplastic pulmonary neuroendocrine cells have the capacity to release AVP is not clear. An alternative hypothesis is that hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines produced in the setting of pulmonary infection such as interleukin-6 stimulate pituitary AVP release.

Nephrogenic SIAD is a very rare X-linked recessive condition caused by an activating mutation of the AVPR2 gene that encodes the V2 receptor. There have been 21 cases reported (18 of these males), across 5 family groups. This mutation leads to constant activation of the V2 receptors in the renal collecting duct, causing free water retention and hyponatremia — resembling chronic SIAD, but with appropriately low AVP levels in response to hypoosmolality. Overt cases present in infancy and can be associated with severe cerebral edema. There is high phenotypic variability, however, with some cases minimally symptomatic and diagnosed only after challenge with a water load. Genetic testing in patients with SIAD is infrequent, hence the proportion of nephrogenic SIAD is unknown, but it is estimated to affect fewer than 1 per million population. A low serum copeptin concentration (eg, < 2.0 pmol/L, with low serum sodium and osmolality) may provide a clue to this diagnosis and prompt genetic testing.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gastrointestinal stromal tumors - NCCN, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, NCCN 2022 guidelines recommend to offer the following management based on the results of the initial diagnostic evaluation in patients with a mass known to be or clinically suspicious for gastrointestinal stromal tumors:

- perform complete surgical resection for resectable with minimal morbidity

- perform biopsy for diagnosis, molecular testing (next-generation sequencing and succinate dehydrogenase B immunohistochemistry), and (if feasible) risk stratification for resectable with significant morbidity, if neoadjuvant therapy is planned. Refer to guidelines for soft tissue sarcoma if the pathology results indicate sarcomas of gastrointestinal origin other than gastrointestinal stromal tumors

- manage unresectable or metastatic disease as unresectable or metastatic disease and consider baseline chest imaging.

Although "Systemic corticosteroids are usually administered to relieve swelling associated with radiation therapy, although data to support the efficacy of steroids are missing", a "meta-analysis of two randomized studies and 44 nonrandomized studies failed to identify a benefit associated with corticosteroid administration", and "their use may impact the ability to obtain histology in cases in which the first biopsy is found to be insufficient". Given that emergent therapy is not mandatory, "it is prudent to obtain a histologic diagnosis before treating patients with SVC syndrome", and "the use of radiation prior to a biopsy may obscure the histologic diagnosis".

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115Edcd7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Small cell lung cancer — pathologic evaluation and classification emphasize morphology and mitotic thresholds, stating that SCLC is characterized by small blue cells with scant cytoplasm and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and that the most useful characteristics for distinguishing SCLC from large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are the high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and paucity of nucleoli in SCLC. Careful mitotic counting is essential, with thresholds specified as SCLC (> 10 mitoses/2 mm² field); atypical carcinoid (2–10 mitoses/2 mm² field); typical carcinoid (0–1 mitoses/2 mm² field), and mitoses should be counted in the areas of highest activity and per 2 mm² field, rather than per 10 high-power fields; in tumors near the defined cutoffs of 2 or 10 mitoses per 2 mm², at least three 2 mm² fields should be counted and the calculated mean used. Strongly recommend a second opinion — with a pathologist specializing in the diagnosis of thoracic malignancies — for diagnostic dilemma, including carcinoid. Combined SCLC consists of both SCLC histology and NSCLC histology and there is no minimal percentage of NSCLC histologic elements required; when any are present along with SCLC, this can be called combined SCLC, except in combination with LCNEC, and at least 10% of the tumor should show unequivocal LCNEC morphology to be classified as combined SCLC and LCNEC. Comprehensive molecular profiling via blood, tissue, or both can be considered in rare cases — particularly for patients with extensive stage/relapsed SCLC who do not smoke tobacco, lightly smoke, have remote smoking history, or have diagnostic or therapeutic dilemma, or at time of relapse — if not previously done.

Asbestos body and fiber detection — Asbestos fibers and asbestos bodies can be identified and quantified in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens; bronchial lung biopsy is less reliable than BAL or open lung biopsy for recovering sufficient tissue to demonstrate elevated asbestos body or fiber counts when they occur. Asbestos fibers, unlike asbestos bodies, are rarely seen by light microscopy and must be analyzed by scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and variability among laboratories in tissue fiber quantification has led to efforts to standardize procedures. Asbestos mineralogical types can be identified by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.

Methotrexate — hepatic toxicity, risk factors, and monitoring: One prospective study in rheumatoid arthritis reported stopping methotrexate because of hepatotoxicity in 5% of cases, and a large series identified severe liver failure and cirrhosis in 24 patients with a 5-year cumulative incidence of one per 1,000 patients. A meta-analysis of 636 patients across 15 studies found that 28% progressed at least one histologic grade, with 5% having advanced liver disease (grade IIIB or IV), and major risk factors included cumulative methotrexate dose, heavy alcohol use, and underlying psoriasis. Patients had a 6.7% chance of progressive liver damage for each cumulative gram of methotrexate, and these data have led to the recommendation that liver biopsy be considered after each 1 to 1.5 g of methotrexate. Routine liver function testing usually is performed every 4 to 12 weeks while receiving the drug; liver biopsy samples are no longer recommended by the American College of Rheumatology, which instead recommends monitoring transaminase levels, and only if transaminase levels are elevated in more than one-half of the testing in the prior year does the American College of Rheumatology recommend a biopsy. In sarcoidosis, hepatotoxicity has been reported in up to 15% of cases, and increased alcohol consumption has led to increased methotrexate toxicity in some studies; patients with hepatitis C are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity.

### Paraneoplastic syndrome as the presentation of limited stage small cell carcinoma [^111Uxjg5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the deadliest forms of lung cancer due to its poor prognosis upon diagnosis, rapid doubling time, and affinity for metastasis. As 60–70% of patients with SCLC have disseminated disease upon presentation, it is imperative to determine the extent of disease burden for treatment. As a neuroendocrine carcinoma, clinicians must pay close attention to abnormal findings in a smoker that could lead to earlier diagnosis and better prognostication.

Case Presentation

A 64 year-old 20-pack year smoker presented to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting for 3 days. No inciting events were elicited. History and review of symptoms were negative including symptoms most-commonly associated with malignancy such as fevers and weight loss. He also denied any pulmonary symptoms. Physical examination was benign except for right lung end-expiratory wheezing. Our patient was clinically euvolemic. Initial blood laboratories showed a sodium 110, serum osmolarity 227, and urine osmolarity of 579. Fluid restriction led to normalization of his sodium and resolution of nausea & vomiting. Chest radiography was obtained to follow-up on the wheezing, which was read as no acute cardiopulmonary disease by radiology. Due to high suspicion of SIADH from malignancy, a CT of the chest was performed which showed a conglomerate of nodules and opacities in the right upper lobe. Biopsy revealed SCLC. At outpatient follow-up, patient had a PET-CT showing one active mediastinal lymph node as the only site of metastasis. He received three round of chemotherapy, chest and prophylactic cranial radiation, and deemed in remission by oncology.

Discussion and Conclusions

Due to its affinity for metastases, 70% of patients with SCLC present with symptoms related to the spread of cancer to affected organ systems. Given the aggressive nature of this disease, screening measures have been implemented to help diagnose limited stage SCLC. Unfortunately, in our patient and many others, screening guidelines may fail to identify appropriate patients to scan. It is therefore imperative to use our clinical index of suspicion and identify any early presentations (including paraneoplastic syndromes) which may tip off the beginning stages of SCLC. This could improve survival rates by up to 45%.

Classification and prognostic factors — WHO categories and favorable features: WHO divides lung cancer into two major classes based on its biology, therapy, and prognosis: NSCLC and SCLC. NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancer cases and includes two major types: nonsquamous (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other subtypes) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of lung cancer seen in the United States and is also the most frequently occurring histology in individuals who have never smoked cigarettes. All NSCLC should be classified according to subtype using the WHO Guidelines. Good prognostic factors include early-stage disease at diagnosis, good performance status (PS) (ECOG 0, 1), no significant weight loss (< 5%), and female gender.

### Approach to eosinophilia presenting with pulmonary symptoms [^116uetMB]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement is characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, typically ≥ 500 cells/mm 3, by pulmonary symptoms and physical examination findings that are nonspecific, and by radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease and is further supported by histopathologic evidence of tissue eosinophilia in a lung or pleura biopsy specimen and/or increased eosinophils in BAL fluid, usually > 10%. Considering that there are a variety of underlying causes of eosinophilia with pulmonary manifestations and overlapping clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is essential to approach the evaluation of eosinophilia with pulmonary findings systematically. In this review, we will describe a case presentation and discuss the differential diagnosis, a directed approach to the diagnostic evaluation and supporting literature, the current treatment strategies for pulmonary eosinophilia syndromes, and the levels of evidence underlying the recommendations, where available. Overall, optimal management of eosinophilic lung disease presentations are directed at the underlying cause when identifiable, and the urgency of treatment may be guided by the presence of severe end-organ involvement or life-threatening complications. When an underlying cause is not easily attributable, management of eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement largely relies on eosinophil-directed interventions, for which biologic therapies are increasingly being used.

### International association for the study of lung cancer / American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society international multidisciplinary classification of lung adenocarcinoma [^112FC2bY]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. To address advances in oncology, molecular biology, pathology, radiology, and surgery of lung adenocarcinoma, an international multidisciplinary classification was sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society. This new adenocarcinoma classification is needed to provide uniform terminology and diagnostic criteria, especially for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), the overall approach to small nonresection cancer specimens, and for multidisciplinary strategic management of tissue for molecular and immunohistochemical studies.

Methods

An international core panel of experts representing all three societies was formed with oncologists/pulmonologists, pathologists, radiologists, molecular biologists, and thoracic surgeons. A systematic review was performed under the guidance of the American Thoracic Society Documents Development and Implementation Committee. The search strategy identified 11,368 citations of which 312 articles met specified eligibility criteria and were retrieved for full text review. A series of meetings were held to discuss the development of the new classification, to develop the recommendations, and to write the current document. Recommendations for key questions were graded by strength and quality of the evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

Results

The classification addresses both resection specimens, and small biopsies and cytology. The terms BAC and mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used. For resection specimens, new concepts are introduced such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) for small solitary adenocarcinomas with either pure lepidic growth (AIS) or predominant lepidic growth with ≤ 5 mm invasion (MIA) to define patients who, if they undergo complete resection, will have 100% or near 100% disease-specific survival, respectively. AIS and MIA are usually nonmucinous but rarely may be mucinous. Invasive adenocarcinomas are classified by predominant pattern after using comprehensive histologic subtyping with lepidic (formerly most mixed subtype tumors with nonmucinous BAC), acinar, papillary, and solid patterns; micropapillary is added as a new histologic subtype. Variants include invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (formerly mucinous BAC), colloid, fetal, and enteric adenocarcinoma. This classification provides guidance for small biopsies and cytology specimens, as approximately 70% of lung cancers are diagnosed in such samples. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), in patients with advanced-stage disease, are to be classified into more specific types such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, whenever possible for several reasons: (1) adenocarcinoma or NSCLC not otherwise specified should be tested for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as the presence of these mutations is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, (2) adenocarcinoma histology is a strong predictor for improved outcome with pemetrexed therapy compared with squamous cell carcinoma, and (3) potential life-threatening hemorrhage may occur in patients with squamous cell carcinoma who receive bevacizumab. If the tumor cannot be classified based on light microscopy alone, special studies such as immunohistochemistry and/or mucin stains should be applied to classify the tumor further. Use of the term NSCLC not otherwise specified should be minimized.

Conclusions

This new classification strategy is based on a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma that incorporates clinical, molecular, radiologic, and surgical issues, but it is primarily based on histology. This classification is intended to support clinical practice, and research investigation and clinical trials. As EGFR mutation is a validated predictive marker for response and progression-free survival with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, we recommend that patients with advanced adenocarcinomas be tested for EGFR mutation. This has implications for strategic management of tissue, particularly for small biopsies and cytology samples, to maximize high-quality tissue available for molecular studies. Potential impact for tumor, node, and metastasis staging include adjustment of the size T factor according to only the invasive component (1) pathologically in invasive tumors with lepidic areas or (2) radiologically by measuring the solid component of part-solid nodules.

Small cell lung cancer — paraneoplastic syndromes are described across endocrine, neurologic, and hematologic domains, and "Presence does not imply metastases or incurability". Endocrine effects are "Due to ectopic peptide hormone production" and are "Usually reversible with successful anti-tumor therapy". Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) involves "Ectopic vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) secretion" with "Clinically significant hyponatremia in 5%–10% of SCLC". Cushing syndrome reflects "Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion" with possible "High serum cortisol and ACTH, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, alkalosis". Neurologic syndromes are uncommon as "All specific syndromes are rare" and include "Subacute cerebellar degeneration – ataxia, dysarthria", "Encephalomyelitis – confusion, obtundation, dementia", "Sensory neuropathy – pain, sensory loss", "Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) – proximal muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction", and "Cancer-associated retinopathy – visual loss, photosensitivity". Hematologic associations include "Anemia of chronic disease", "Leukemoid reaction – leukocytosis", and "Trousseau syndrome – migratory thrombophlebitis".

Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer, and the remaining 85% are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread. Horner's syndrome is also common in tumors at the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, which also cause shoulder pain that radiates down the little-finger side of the arm as well as destruction of the topmost ribs. Swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone can indicate a tumor that has spread within the chest.

Tumors obstructing bloodflow to the heart can cause superior vena cava syndrome, while tumors infiltrating the area around the heart can cause fluid buildup around the heart, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Lung tumors often cause the release of body-altering hormones, which cause unusual symptoms, called paraneoplastic syndromes. Inappropriate hormone release can cause dramatic shifts in concentrations of blood minerals. Most common is hypercalcemia caused by over-production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or parathyroid hormone. Hypercalcemia can manifest as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, increased thirst, frequent urination, and altered mental status.

Those with lung cancer also commonly experience hypokalemia due to inappropriate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, as well as hyponatremia due to overproduction of antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic peptide. Diagnosis A person suspected of having lung cancer will have imaging tests done to evaluate the presence, extent, and location of tumors. First, many primary care providers perform a chest X-ray to look for a mass inside the lung. The X-ray may reveal an obvious mass, the widening of the mediastinum, atelectasis, consolidation, or pleural effusion; however, some lung tumors are not visible by X-ray. Next, many undergo computed tomography scanning, which can reveal the sizes and locations of tumors. A definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tissue be histologically examined for cancer cells.

Given the location of lung cancer tumors, biopsies can often be obtained by minimally invasive techniques: a fiberoptic bronchoscope that can retrieve tissue, fine needle aspiration, or other imaging-guided biopsy through the skin. Those who cannot undergo a typical biopsy procedure may instead have a liquid biopsy taken which may contain circulating tumor DNA that can be detected. Lung cancer can often appear as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan. In lung cancer screening studies as many as 30% of those screened have a lung nodule, the majority of which turn out to be benign. Besides lung cancer many other diseases can also give this appearance, including hamartomas, and infectious granulomas caused by tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis. SCLC tumors are often found near the center of the lungs, in the major airways.

### Treatment options for newly… [^114L7nEi]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment –Health Professional Version General Information About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Go to Patient Version NSCLC is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small cell lung cancer. The most common types of NSCLC are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but there are several other types that occur less frequently, and all types can occur in unusual histological variants. Although NSCLCs are associated with cigarette smoke, adenocarcinomas may be found in patients who never smoked. Anatomy NSCLC arises from the epithelial cells of the lung of the central bronchi to terminal alveoli. The histological type of NSCLC correlates with site of origin, reflecting the variation in respiratory tract epithelium of the bronchi to alveoli. Squamous cell carcinoma usually starts near a central bronchus. Adenocarcinoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma usually originate in peripheral lung tissue.

Pathogenesis Smoking-related lung carcinogenesis is a multistep process. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma have defined premalignant precursor lesions. Before becoming invasive, lung epithelium may undergo morphological changes that include:

- Hyperplasia.
- Metaplasia.
- Dysplasia.
- Carcinoma in situ. Dysplasia and carcinoma in situ are considered the principal premalignant lesions because they are more likely to progress to invasive cancer and less likely to spontaneously regress.
- Living in an area with air pollution.
- Family history of lung cancer.
- HIV infection.
- Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers. The single most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer is smoking. For a smoker, the risk of lung cancer is, on average, tenfold higher than in a lifetime nonsmoker.

The risk increases with the quantity of cigarettes, duration of smoking, and starting age. Clinical Presentation Lung cancer may present with symptoms or be found incidentally on chest imaging. The most common symptoms at presentation include:

- Worsening cough.
- Chest pain.
- Hemoptysis.
- Malaise.
- Weight loss.
- Dyspnea.
- Hoarseness. Symptoms may result from local invasion or compression of adjacent thoracic structures, such as compression involving the esophagus causing dysphagia, compression involving the laryngeal nerves causing hoarseness, or compression involving the superior vena cava causing facial edema and distension of the superficial veins of the head and neck. Symptoms from distant metastases may also be present and include neurological defect or personality change from brain metastases or pain from bone metastases.

Infrequently, patients may present with symptoms and signs of paraneoplastic diseases such as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy with digital clubbing or hypercalcemia from parathyroid hormone-related protein. Physical examination may identify enlarged supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion or lobar collapse, unresolved pneumonia, or signs of associated disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary fibrosis. Before a patient begins lung cancer treatment, an experienced lung cancer pathologist must review the pathological material. This is critical because SCLC, which responds well to chemotherapy and is generally not treated surgically, can be confused on microscopic examination with NSCLC. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy are invaluable techniques for diagnosis and subclassification, but most lung tumors can be classified by light microscopic criteria.

### Morphology&grade… [^115TYBLx]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Morphology & Grade ICD-O-3 Morphology Codes If the diagnostic term in the pathology report is not in the list below, be sure to consult your ICD-O manual. Small cell lung cancers include ICD-O morphology codes M-80413, M-80423, M-80433, M-80443, and M-80453. Small cell carcinoma is also called oat cell, round cell, reserve cell, or small cell intermediate cell carcinoma. Small cell cancers are usually central lesions. Occasionally, mixed tumors containing small cells and non-small cells are diagnosed. These should be treated as small cell cancers. Common non-small cell lung cancer histologies: Squamous or epidermoid Least likely to recur after resection; frequently a central or bronchial lesion. Adenocarcinoma Usually slow-growing, but can metastasize widely; usually a peripheral lesion.

Bronchioloalveolar Avery specific subtype of adenocarcinoma with a distinct characteristic presentation and behavior. Bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinomas arise in the alveolar sacs in the lungs. Large cell carcinoma Also called giant cell or clear cell. Other subtypes of adenocarcinoma are acinar, papillary, and mucinous. Adenosquamous carcinoma A specific histologic variant containing both epithelial and glandular cells. Carcinoids. Arise from neuroectoderm. Melanomas, sarcomas and lymphomas may also arise in the lung. Mesothelioma Linked to asbestos exposure; usually involves the pleura, not the lung. Non-small cell carcinoma. A general term used sloppily to separate small cell from the "non-small cell" types of carcinomas.

Only use 8046/3 when there is no other type of non-small cell carcinoma contained in the source documents. Synonyms for in situ carcinoma: polypoid with no invasion of stalk, confined to epithelium, intraepidermal, intraepithelial, involvment up to but not through the basement membrane, noninfiltrating, no stromal involvement, papillary noninfiltrating, Stage 0. Key words: Pancoast tumor A tumor of the apex of lung which invades brachial plexus nerves causing pain in the arm. Superior sulcus tumor A less invasive tumor of the apex of the lung. Bronchogenic carcinoma It is a description of where the tumor arose: broncho- and -genic. More information should be obtained before the morphology is coded.

### Rhabdomyosarcoma… [^116mLLna]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults. Common sites of metastasis include the lungs, bone marrow, and bones. There are many classification systems for RMS and a variety of defined histological types. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type and comprises about 60% of cases. Outcomes vary considerably, with five-year survival rates between 35 and 95%, depending on the type of RMS involved, so clear diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. Types Given the difficulty in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma, definitive classification of subtypes has proven difficult. As a result, classification systems vary by institute and organization.

Rhabdomyosarcoma in the 2020 WHO classification, though, is listed as four histological subtypes: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, and spindle-cell/sclerosing. Embryonal subtype Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma is almost always found in mucosal-lined organs, including the vagina, bladder, and nasopharynx. It often presents in infants younger than a year old, as a round, grape-like mass on the affected organ. Histologically, cells of the botryoid variant are defined by a dense tumor layer under an epithelium. This subtype has a good prognosis. Alveolar Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is the second-most common type. ARMS comprises around 20–25% of RMS-related tumors, and it is equally distributed among all age groups with an incidence of about one case per million people ages 0 to 19.

For this reason, it is the most common form of RMS observed in young adults and teenagers, who are less prone to the embryonal variant. This type of RMS is characterized by densely packed, round cells that arrange around spaces similar in shape to pulmonary alveoli, although variants have been discovered without these characteristic alveolar spacings. ARMS tends to form more often in the extremities, trunk, and peritoneum. It is also typically more aggressive than ERMS. Pleomorphic Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, also known as anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma, is defined by the presence of pleomorphic cells with large, lobate hyperchromatic nuclei and multipolar mitotic figures. These tumors display high heterogeneity and extremely poor differentiation. The pleomorphic cells may be diffuse or localized, with the diffuse variation correlating to a worse prognosis.

It occurs most often in adults, rarely in children, and is often discovered in the extremities. Due to the lack of discernible separation among cancers of this type, clinicians often label undiagnosed sarcomas with little to no discernible features as anaplastic RMS. It is the most aggressive type of RMS, and often requires intensive treatment. Spindle-cell/sclerosing Spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is an added subtype listed in the 2020 WHO classification of soft-tissue sarcomas. This subtype is very similar to that of leiomyosarcoma, and it has a fascicular, spindled, and leiomyomatous growth pattern with notable rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. It occurs most commonly in the paratesticular region, and the prognosis for this particular form of RMS is excellent with a reported five-year survival rate of 95%. The sclerosing aspect of this subtype has a hyaline sclerosis and pseudovascular development.

### Diagnosis… [^115RhR9m]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Small-cell carcinoma, also known as oat cell carcinoma, is a type of highly malignant cancer that most commonly arises within the lung, although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the cervix, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. Compared to non-small cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma is more aggressive, with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, and earlier development of metastases. Small-cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor, meaning that the cells were originally part of the neuroendocrine system. As a result, small cell carcinomas often secrete various hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone or vasopressin. The unpredictable hormone secretion of small-cell carcinoma adds additional symptoms and mortality to the aggressive course of the cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women.

When associated with the lung, SCLC is sometimes called "oat cell carcinoma" due to the flat cell shape and scanty cytoplasm. Small cell mesothelioma – an extremely rare subtype of lung cancer – can be mistaken for small cell lung cancer. Small-cell carcinoma is most often more rapidly and widely metastatic than non-small-cell lung carcinoma. There is usually early involvement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. The mechanisms of its metastatic progression are not well understood. Combined When SCLC is found with one or more differentiated forms of lung cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, the malignant tumor is then diagnosed and classified as a combined small cell lung carcinoma. Small-cell lung carcinoma can occur in combination with a wide variety of other histological variants of lung cancer, including extremely complex malignant tissue admixtures. C-SCLC is the only currently recognized subtype of SCLC.

Extrapulmonary Very rarely, the primary site for small-cell carcinoma is outside of the lungs and pleural space; in these cases, it is referred to as extrapulmonary small-cell carcinoma. Outside of the respiratory tract, small-cell carcinoma can appear in the cervix, prostate, liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, or bladder. Extrapulmonary localized in the lymph nodes This is an extremely rare type of small cell, and there has been little information in the scientific community. It appears to occur in only one or more lymph nodes, and nowhere else in the body. Treatment is similar to small-cell lung cancer, but survival rates are much higher than other small-cell carcinomas. Prostate Small-cell carcinoma of the prostate is a rare form of prostate cancer. Symptomatic metastasis of SCCP to the brain is rare, and carries a poor prognosis.

Signs and symptoms Small-cell carcinoma of the lung usually presents in the central airways and infiltrates the submucosa leading to the narrowing of bronchial airways. Common symptoms include cough, dyspnea, weight loss, and debility. Over 70% of patients with small-cell carcinoma present with metastatic disease; common sites include the liver, adrenals, bone, and brain. Due to its high grade neuroendocrine nature, small-cell carcinomas can produce ectopic hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone and anti-diuretic hormone. Ectopic production of large amounts of ADH leads to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion. Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome is a well-known paraneoplastic condition linked to small-cell carcinoma. Approximately half of all individuals diagnosed with Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome will eventually be found to have a small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Genetics TP53 is mutated in 70 to 90% of SCLCs.

### Giant-cell carcinoma of the lung [^114BgKTb]. Wikipedia (2010). Low credibility.

The background contained numerous lymphocytes and neutrophils. The shape of the tumor cell was spindle or pleomorphic, and the sizes of the tumor cells varied by more than 5-fold. The tumor cells had an abundant, thick and well-demarcated cytoplasm. The location of the nucleus was centrifugal, and the nucleus was oval or irregularly shaped. Multinucleated giant cells were frequently observed. The size of the nucleus was more than 5 times that of normal lymphocytes, and its size also varied by more than 5-fold. The nuclear membrane was thin, and nuclear chromatin was coarsely granular, while the nucleolus was single and round. In cytological preparations, giant cells typically appear as single cells or in flat loose clusters, and occasionally in fascicles.

Also by definition, GCCL do not contain any amount of these small, neurosecretory granule-containing, neuroendocrine cells that are characteristic of small-cell carcinomas — when they do, the tumor should be classified as a combined small-cell carcinoma. Compared to most other lung cancer variants, cells comprising GCCL tend to be much larger, Both cells and nuclei show extreme variation in size distribution and shape. Carcinomatous giant cells carcinoma nuclei have been reported to average 5 times the size of lymphocyte nuclei. The cells from giant-cell carcinomas are anaplastic, and show no evidence of cell maturation or differentiation, lacking the cytological and tissue architectural characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinomas, or other more differentiated lung cancer cell types. They tend to be highly pleomorphic, but are most often round and/or polygonal in shape, with a relatively low nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. When associated with spindle cells, as they very frequently are in tumors with mixed histology, malignant giant cells tend to form loosely cohesive aggregate structures on cytological examination. However, when a biopsy sample consists purely of malignant giant cells, the cells tend to be single and disaggregated. Case series suggest that the relative number of giant cells in a given tumor are generally directly proportional to the size of the tumor, and to the relative amount of necrosis. Giant cells in a lung cancer are highly associated with the presence of spindle cells. The chromatin of malignant giant cells tends to be hyperchromatic and coarsely clumped. Nucleoli are usually multiple and prominent.

Subcellular characteristics often noted in the malignant giant cells of GCCL cases include abundant mitochondria, concentric whorls of tonofilament-like fibrils, and aggregates of several pairs of centrioles. Tissue architectural features In mixed tumors, giant cells are more likely to be found in higher proportions at the edge of a tumor. When extensive necrosis is present, it is possible for a giant-cell tumor to have only a thin rim of viable cells remaining at the perimeter of the mass. In one early case series, abundant production of loose malignant giant cells were noted to fill the alveoli of patients without destroying, infiltrating, or disturbing the normal underlying architecture, a pathologic behavior that bears some resemblance to the pneumonic variant of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Macroscopic features Giant-cell carcinomas of the lung frequently show extensive necrosis and myxoid degeneration.
