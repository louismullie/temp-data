## Question

What to prescribe for pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to prescribe for pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing community-acquired pneumonia from hospital-acquired pneumonia and clarifying the scope. Then, I should verify severity assessment and site-of-care decisions. Next, I will review outpatient versus inpatient empiric regimens, including special populations and stewardship. After that, I need to check duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and follow-up imaging. Finally, I will consider pediatric nuances, immunocompromised hosts, and what to do if the patient is not improving as expected, anchoring to ATS/IDSA 2019 and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope, because I need to ensure we are discussing community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults rather than hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia, which follow different pathways and pathogens. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline explicitly addresses adult CAP and excludes immunocompromised hosts and HAP/VAP, so I should keep those separate to avoid conflating recommendations [^2f918f33] [^ae5381dc].

> Next, I should review severity assessment and site-of-care decisions, since empiric therapy hinges on severity and disposition. I need to check that we are using validated tools like PSI or CURB-65 alongside clinical judgment, and I should confirm that the 2019 guideline de-emphasizes rigid time-to-antibiotics rules while still supporting timely initiation when CAP is confirmed or strongly suspected, given the association with improved outcomes in observational data [^2f918f33] [^e2c9b1fb].

> For adult outpatients without comorbidities, I should confirm first-line options and the macrolide resistance caveat. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline recommends high-dose amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25 percent, which I should verify locally before choosing a macrolide [^30479eb6] [^688d8fef] [^d3e0a451].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for avoiding macrolide monotherapy in many U.S. settings. The resistance threshold is based on modeling that incorporates both high- and low-level macrolide resistance and projects increased clinical failure at or above 25 percent, so in the absence of local data showing low resistance, macrolide monotherapy should be avoided for uncomplicated CAP [^d4cb69a5].

> For adult outpatients with comorbidities, I need to ensure broader coverage. The 2019 guideline supports combination therapy with a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime plus doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, chosen based on patient-specific risks and local resistance patterns, with stewardship urging the narrowest effective option when feasible [^f7279f2f] [^0a447dfe].

> Wait, let me verify the inpatient nonsevere CAP recommendations. The 2019 guideline gives a strong recommendation for either a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with a conditional option of beta-lactam plus doxycycline if macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated, and I should remember to avoid beta-lactam monotherapy routinely in this setting [^f30cc1d7].

> For severe CAP, I should confirm that combination therapy is required. The guideline recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and it explicitly advises against fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline for severe disease, given inferior evidence for those alternatives in this population [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].

> I need to check the stance on the old HCAP category. The 2019 guideline advises abandoning HCAP as a designation to guide extended-spectrum therapy and instead using locally validated risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas to decide on empiric coverage, obtaining cultures when risk factors are present and de-escalating at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving [^990c32f7] [^b035f7cc].

> Let me consider duration and the IV-to-oral switch, because overtreatment is common. The 2019 guideline recommends a minimum of 5 days total therapy, with discontinuation once the patient achieves clinical stability for 48 to 72 hours and no less than 5 total days, and it supports switching to oral therapy using the same class or agent when clinically stable, which aligns with shorter-course evidence and stewardship goals [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

> I should double-check follow-up imaging. Routine chest radiography at the end of therapy is not recommended for most patients, but repeat imaging is reasonable if the patient fails to improve as expected or if malignancy is a concern, which helps avoid unnecessary radiation and costs [^88dd7966].

> For pediatrics, I need to ensure age-appropriate guidance. In children 3 months and older, amoxicillin is first-line for suspected bacterial CAP, with macrolides considered when atypical pathogens are likely in older children, and durations of 3 to 5 days are supported for nonsevere cases, which differs from adult practice and should be applied carefully with local epidemiology in mind [^b78966c4] [^5cd42207] [^7da23c47].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised. I should confirm that standard CAP guidelines do not apply and that consensus statements recommend broader initial coverage and aggressive diagnostic evaluation, including consideration of fungal and opportunistic pathogens, with de-escalation once data return, which requires specialist input and individualized regimens [^f4441452].

> If the patient is not improving as expected, I need to check for complications, alternative diagnoses, or resistant pathogens. That means reassessing the diagnosis, evaluating for empyema or abscess, obtaining targeted cultures if not already done, and considering atypical pathogens or MRSA/Pseudomonas based on risk factors, with adjustment of therapy accordingly rather than reflexively escalating without data [^b035f7cc] [^461a6a72].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles: use the narrowest effective agent, avoid unnecessary atypical coverage in low-risk settings, obtain cultures when indicated to enable de-escalation, and stop therapy promptly when stability is achieved, because these steps reduce adverse events, C. difficile, and resistance while maintaining outcomes [^d1ef5189] [^f3594bdf].

For pneumonia, **empiric therapy should match severity and comorbidities** [^2f918f33] and be refined to local resistance and cultures [^461a6a72]. Outpatients without comorbidities should receive **amoxicillin or doxycycline** [^30479eb6]; with comorbidities, use a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^f7279f2f]. Inpatients with nonsevere CAP should get a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^f30cc1d7]; severe CAP requires a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^1388daf3]. Treat for a minimum of 5 days [^760f62a6], ensuring clinical stability before stopping [^37eb851a].

---

## Outpatient antibiotic therapy

### Outpatients without comorbidities

- **First-line therapy**: amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily [^30479eb6] [^688d8fef].
- **Alternative therapy**: macrolides (azithromycin or clarithromycin) only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is < 25% [^688d8fef] [^d4cb69a5].

---

### Outpatients with comorbidities

- **Combination therapy**: beta-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily [^f7279f2f].
- **Alternative therapy**: respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) monotherapy [^0a447dfe].

---

## Inpatient antibiotic therapy

### Nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

For nonsevere CAP, **combination therapy** with a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin/sulbactam) plus a macrolide (azithromycin) is recommended [^f30cc1d7]. Alternatively, **monotherapy** with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) is acceptable [^f30cc1d7].

---

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)

For severe CAP, **combination therapy** with a beta-lactam (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide (azithromycin) is recommended [^1388daf3]. Alternatively, a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) may be used [^34776dc5].

---

## Special considerations

- **MRSA or Pseudomonas risk**: add specific coverage if risk factors are present [^990c32f7] [^b035f7cc].
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: standard CAP regimens are recommended; routine anaerobic coverage is not necessary unless there is clinical suspicion of anaerobic infection [^a9f1418b].
- **Duration of therapy**: minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

---

## Pediatric considerations

In children, **amoxicillin is first-line** for mild to moderate CAP [^b78966c4] [^7da23c47]. Macrolides are used when **Mycoplasma pneumoniae** or **Chlamydophila pneumoniae** are suspected, particularly in children aged 5–16 years [^25855038].

---

## Antibiotic therapy for pneumonia

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotic therapy** |
|-|-|
| Outpatient, no comorbidities | - Amoxicillin 1 g PO TID <br/> - Or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID [^30479eb6] [^688d8fef] |
| Outpatient, comorbidities | - Beta-lactam + doxycycline <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^f7279f2f] [^0a447dfe] |
| Inpatient, nonsevere CAP | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Or respiratory fluoroquinolone [^f30cc1d7] |
| Inpatient, severe CAP | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Or beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5] |
| Pediatric, mild to moderate CAP | Amoxicillin [^b78966c4] [^7da23c47] |
| Pediatric, suspected atypical pathogens | Macrolides (azithromycin) [^25855038] |

---

Empiric therapy should be **individualized** based on severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns, and adjusted to culture results to ensure targeted, effective treatment [^2f918f33] [^461a6a72].

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^24babb34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^760bdc66]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^8359b38e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is uncertain.

Objectives

To compare the effects of antibiotics for empiric therapy of moderate to severe CAP using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to July 03, 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT).

Participants

Adults with moderate to severe CAP.

Interventions

Any empiric antibiotic regimen versus another, placebo, or no treatment.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

We conducted frequentist random-effects NMAs addressing patient-important outcomes and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Results

143 RCTs involving 29,157 participants proved eligible. Effects are in comparison with respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. Penicillins alone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67; RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 88 more), 2nd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.02; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 135 more), and 3rd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77; RD 42 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 102 more) or combined with a macrolide (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 111 more) may be inferior in reducing treatment failure (all low certainty). The evidence among other antibiotic regimens for treatment failure and among all regimens for all-cause mortality, duration of hospitalization, and adverse events suggested little to no difference (in most cases with low certainty) or was very low certainty.

Conclusions

For empiric treatment of moderate to severe CAP, none of the antibiotic regimens provided convincing evidence of important differences in any of the outcomes.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^11ed24ed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^d0880ecd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^8d887f20]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bd24d22c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^b8c7536c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the current literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent Findings

Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

The cost, morbidity and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk-stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy, so that the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity of CAP may be minimized.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^4e59d67a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Objectives

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP? [^15ae53e3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics is prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^f2e2362f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^5727375d]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^e2c9b1fb]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^64aa66c9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: current outcomes, epidemiology, etiology, and therapy [^5c661a49]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis with a significant impact on healthcare management around the world, with the highest morbidity and mortality of all of the forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with severe pneumonia usually require intensive care unit management, including vasopressors or mechanical ventilation. Early clinical suspicion and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapies are mandatory in patients with severe pneumonia. A number of recent studies and guidelines addressing these issues have been published, and they will be reviewed in this article.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^cbe0b5b9]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^c1dbce47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^d1ef5189]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^7763a431]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### Guideline-concordant antibiotic use in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^a279fff3]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite national guidelines on appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is wide variation in antibiotic decision-making for children with community-acquired pneumonia. This study sought to determine prevalence and factors associated with guideline-concordant antibiotic use in children presenting with pneumonia to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We enrolled children aged younger than 18 years presenting to the ED at 2 US children's hospitals between September 2017 and May 2019 with clinical and radiographic pneumonia. The primary outcome was guideline-concordant antibiotic use as defined by the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America pediatric pneumonia guideline and local expert consensus. Outcomes included proportion of antibiotic use and proportion of guideline-concordant treatment. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine associations of comorbidities and functional limitations, clinical findings, and radiographic characteristics with overall antibiotic use and guideline-concordant treatment.

Results

Among 772 included children, 573 received antibiotics (74.2%), and 441 (57.1%) received guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic initiation was less likely in those with interstitial findings on chest radiograph (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07–0.25) and negative results or nonperformance of viral testing (aOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24–0.65). Guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in those with chest indrawing (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.34–3.66) and less likely in those with clinically significant effusion (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.76).

Conclusions

Among children presenting to the ED with pneumonia, more than 40% received treatment inconsistent with guideline recommendations. These observations underscore opportunities to improve appropriate antibiotic use in this population.

### Short-course versus long-course antibiotic therapy for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 months to 59 months [^fa91d0b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under five years of age. Treatment of pneumonia requires an effective antibiotic used in adequate doses for an appropriate duration. Recommended duration of treatment ranges between 7 and 14 days, but this is not based on any empirical evidence. Shorter duration of therapy, if found to be effective, could be particularly important in resource-poor settings where there is a high risk of death, poor access to medicines and health care, and limited budgets for medicines.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy with the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2 to 59 months.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (OVID) (January 1966 to September 2007); EMBASE (Embase.com) (1974 to September 2007); and LILACS (1982 to September 2007).

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of short-course versus long-course therapy using the same antibiotic for non-severe community-acquired pneumonia in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Three studies (5763 children) were included. Analysis of three days versus five days of treatment with the same antibiotic for non-severe pneumonia in children showed non-significant differences in rates of clinical cure at the end of treatment (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01), treatment failure at the end of treatment (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25) and relapse rate after seven days of clinical cure (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.42). Subgroup analysis evaluating the impact of different antibiotics showed non-significant differences for these outcomes with different durations of therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence of this review suggests that a short course (three days) of antibiotic therapy is as effective as a longer treatment (five days) for non-severe pneumonia in children under five years of age. However, there is a need for more well-designed RCTs to support our review findings.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^ab3d5bff]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^f4441452]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^20d5fca0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^2bebfeb9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can be prevented through vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and COVID-19 vaccines. Diagnosis requires suggestive history and physical findings in conjunction with radiographic evidence of infiltrates. Laboratory testing can help guide therapy. Important issues in treatment include choosing the proper venue, timely initiation of the appropriate antibiotic or antiviral, appropriate respiratory support, deescalation after negative culture results, switching to oral therapy, and short treatment duration.

### Health care-associated pneumonia: an evidence-based review [^9469a43f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Health care-associated pneumonia is a relatively new classification of pneumonia that includes community-dwelling pneumonia patients having contact with the health care system. Current data indicate that health care-associated pneumonia patients present with more severe disease, are more likely to be infected with drug-resistant pathogens, and suffer increased mortality compared with community-acquired pneumonia patients. Guidelines recommend that these patients receive empiric antibiotics similar to those recommended for nosocomial pneumonia; however, it is not currently known if outcomes are improved when health care-associated pneumonia patients are treated with these therapies. In addition, the individual health care-associated pneumonia risk factors are based on limited data and are a poor predictor of patients likely to be infected with drug-resistant pathogens. Many questions remain on how to most appropriately care for this growing group of pneumonia patients. This review is an evidence-based discussion of current health care-associated pneumonia data, the individual health care-associated pneumonia risk factors, and limitations and additional considerations for the health care-associated pneumonia classification system.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^b2bd5f95]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Strategies for prediction of drug-resistant pathogens and empiric antibiotic selection in community-acquired pneumonia [^f3ec0512]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are appropriately treated with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, predicting which patients require coverage of drug-resistant pathogens (DRP) remains a challenge. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America CAP guidelines endorse using locally validated prediction models for DRP. Here we review risk factors for DRP and provide a summary of available risk prediction models.

Recent Findings

Both inadequate initial empiric spectrum as well as unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use are associated with poor outcomes in CAP. Multiple prediction models for DRP-based patient-level risk factors have been published, with some variation in included predictor variables and test performance characteristics. Seven models have been robustly externally validated, and implementation data have been published for two of these models. All models demonstrated better performance than the healthcare-associated pneumonia criteria, with most favoring sensitivity over specificity. We also report validation of the novel, risk factor-based treatment algorithm proposed in the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines which strongly favors specificity over sensitivity, especially in nonsevere pneumonia.

Summary

Using patient-level risk factors to guide the decision whether to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics is a rational approach to treatment. Several viable candidate prediction models are available. Hospitals should evaluate the local performance of existing scores before implementing in routine clinical practice.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^3555adb9]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection in that the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Current data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition. Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^a75cf1c1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

We examined the impact of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines that recommend ampicillin or amoxicillin for children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing of ampicillin/amoxicillin increased following guideline publication, but remains low. Cephalosporin and macrolide prescribing decreased but remains common. Further studies exploring outcomes of and reasons for compliance with guidelines are warranted.

### Approaches to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department and the appropriate role of fluoroquinolones [^be0e645c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Emergency Department is a critical point of care for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The initial diagnosis, the decision to admit or discharge, the timing of initiating treatment, and appropriateness of the empirical therapy are key factors in successful management. Rising resistance rates to commonly used CAP antibiotics has complicated empirical treatment. Respiratory fluoroquinolones represent an important therapeutic option for patients with co-morbidities and risk factors for penicillin-, macrolide-, and multi-drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infections. Ensuring appropriate use is required to maintain their high level of effectiveness in key respiratory pathogens. Treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are available to assist emergency physicians in developing clinical pathways to ensure appropriate use of available therapies.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^e907035a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^70ecc6b6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^37eb851a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### What is healthcare-associated pneumonia and how is it managed? [^192d2d87]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pneumonia developing before hospital admission in patients in close contact with the health system was recently termed 'healthcare-associated pneumonia' and proposed as a new category of respiratory infection. We focus on the recent literature concerning the epidemiology, causative organisms, antibiotic susceptibilities, and outcomes of and empirical antibiotic therapy for this condition.

Recent Findings

The reported incidence of healthcare-associated pneumonia among patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia ranges from 17% to 67%. Hospitalization within 90 days before pneumonia, attending a dialysis clinic and residing in a nursing home were the most common criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Compared with patients with community-acquired pneumonia, those with healthcare-associated pneumonia are older, have greater co-morbidity, and are more likely to have aspiration pneumonia and pneumonia caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia also more frequently initially receive an inappropriate antibiotic therapy, have higher case fatality rates and have longer hospital stay.

Summary

Many patients hospitalized with pneumonia via the emergency department have healthcare-associated pneumonia. There are significant differences in the spectrum of causative organisms and antibiotic susceptibilities between healthcare-associated and community-acquired pneumonia. Physicians should differentiate patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia from those with community-acquired pneumonia to promote a targeted approach when selecting initial antibiotic therapy.

### Appropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory infections: review of recent statements and position papers [^8b86eda5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Respiratory infections are among the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics. The excessive use of antibiotics in ambulatory practice has contributed to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The appropriate use of antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections could potentially reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This article reviews recent guidelines and position papers on the appropriate antibiotic treatment for respiratory infections. There is a wide consensus that antibiotics are not appropriate for the treatment of most cases of acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, and rhinosinusitis. The recently published community-acquired pneumonia guidelines emphasized the importance of selecting antibiotic regimens active against both typical and atypical pathogens. However, there is disagreement regarding the routine use of the new quinolones.

### Prevalence of clinical signs within reference ranges among hospitalized patients prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia [^42ee5065]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia in hospitalized patients despite clinical signs within the reference range?

Findings

In this cohort study of 12 273 patients treated for possible pneumonia in 4 hospitals, all cardinal signs for pneumonia were within reference ranges in 18.6% of patients with possible community-acquired pneumonia and 13.5% of patients with possible hospital-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotics were continued for 3 days or longer after all clinical signs were normal in 34.8% of patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia and 38.4% treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Meaning

Findings of this study suggest that antibiotics are prescribed frequently for suspected pneumonia in patients with clinical signs within reference ranges and continued for 3 days or longer after clinical signs normalize; these findings suggest potential targets to improve prescribing.

This clinical policy represents an approach that emphasizes key clinical information to determine the severity of CAP. By using this approach, a determination of whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or inpatient may be made. Recommendations about the utility of ancillary studies and the use of antibiotics are also given. As more of the questions are answered through controlled studies, an evidence-based approach to this problem will become increasingly important in improving the outcome of patients with CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^9fac0986]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^ff4c7b0c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### At the threshold: defining clinically meaningful resistance thresholds for antibiotic choice in community-acquired pneumonia [^d4cb69a5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major source of morbidity and mortality. Macrolide antibiotics are recommended as empirical first-line therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Guidelines suggest a 25% rate of high-level macrolide resistance in the community as the threshold beyond which macrolides should not be used. We evaluated the implications of this threshold for clinical failure rates.

Methods

We developed a theoretical model linking the prevalence of macrolide resistance to patient outcomes, based on the epidemiological concept of risk difference. We estimated the risk of clinical failure as a function of the likelihood and impact of discordant therapy and of the probability of clinical failure even in the presence of optimal therapy. The model was parameterized on the basis of the best available data derived from the published medical literature, and clinical failures were valued monetarily using an expected net benefit approach.

Results

Under the proposed 25% resistance threshold, the risk difference for such therapy would be 1.2% (95% credible interval, 0.5%-3.1%) for death, 1.6% (95% credible interval, 0.5%-3.2%) for bacteremia, and 3.3% (95% credible interval, 1.1%-5.7%) for prolonged clinical course; excess risks of death were valued at > $10,000 per empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and were further elevated in high-risk populations. Excluding low-level resistance resulted in a 4-fold underestimation of projected risks.

Conclusion

A 25% resistance threshold that fails to consider low-level resistance will result in high excess rates of morbidity and mortality because of discordant therapy. Whether projected failure rates are classified as unacceptable is an important health policy question, because risk of clinical failure needs to be weighed against other considerations.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^38213cf1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) is the most life-threatening form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and often necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors. The overall mortality rate for SCAP exceeds 20%, and it is a leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Studies indicate that early administration of antibiotics can reduce hospital mortality and ICU admission rates, so an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen is important for patients with SCAP.

The most frequently identified pathogens causing SCAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and atypical pathogens. Understanding these pathogens is critical, as it informs the selection of appropriate initial empirical antibiotic regimens, which are essential for reducing mortality and ICU admissions in SCAP patients. The Infectious Diseases Society of America and American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) and the latest European community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines recommend a β-lactam antibiotics plus a macrolides for patients with SCAP. The combination of a β-lactam antibiotics and a respiratory fluoroquinolones, however, remains controversial and lacks definitive evidence to support its superiority. Moreover, recent retrospective cohort studies have suggested that β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides, fluoroquinolones monotherapy, and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline may yield similar outcomes in non-severe CAP. However, few studies have directly compared fluoroquinolones monotherapy and β-lactam antibiotics plus tetracycline in SCAP. Despite the recommendations provided by guidelines, the optimal antibiotic regimen for SCAP remains a subject of ongoing debate. Questions persist regarding whether a β-lactam antibiotics plus macrolides combination is superior to a β-lactam antibiotics plus fluoroquinolones, and the efficacy of fluoroquinolones monotherapy and β-lactam antibiotics plus doxycycline as potentially suboptimal options is still unclear. Conventional pairwise meta-analyses, which rely on direct comparisons, are relatively limited and pose challenges in evaluating these antibiotic regimens. Therefore, we conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the outcomes associated with different antibiotic treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ae5381dc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^06a7e5ce]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) — burden, core measures, and early antibiotics — is characterized by high impact and variable practices: CAP is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States with 1.7 million hospital admissions per year, and CAP-related hospitalizations cost an estimated $9 billion annually. Core ED measures for CAP include blood culture collection prior to first antibiotic administration, administration of initial antibiotics within 6 hours of ED arrival (previously within 4 hours), and appropriate antibiotic selection. Attempts to increase the proportion treated in less than 4 hours resulted in an additional 17% of patients being unnecessarily treated with antibiotics; among ED patients with respiratory complaints, 1,948 were evaluated and only 198 were ultimately diagnosed with CAP, such that if half received empiric antibiotics at least 40% would have received them unnecessarily. Reported practice patterns include that 37% of academic EDs administer antibiotics before obtaining chest radiograph.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, inpatient regimens, BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer IV amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone in patients with severe pneumonia. Consider rationalizing these if a microbiological diagnosis is established.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^83a95687]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^5cd42207]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^990c32f7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b7ec5544]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) adults — Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions at diagnosis: We recommend not obtaining sputum Gram stain and culture routinely in adults with CAP managed in the outpatient setting (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We recommend obtaining pretreatment Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions in adults with CAP managed in the hospital setting who are classified as severe CAP, especially if they are intubated (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); are being empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence); were previously infected with MRSA or P. aeruginosa, especially those with prior respiratory tract infection (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence); or were hospitalized and received parenteral antibiotics, whether during the hospitalization event or not, in the last 90 days (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).
