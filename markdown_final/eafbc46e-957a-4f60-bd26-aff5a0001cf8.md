## Question

Rotate Lantus to toujeo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about switching from Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL) to Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL), including dose conversion, titration, monitoring, special populations, and a practical checklist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences that drive dose adjustments. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled conversion rules and reconcile them with clinical trial data. Next, I will outline a stepwise switching protocol with monitoring and titration cadence. After that, I need to consider special populations and inpatient scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, actionable checklist and confirm safety counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for dose differences between Lantus U-100 and Toujeo U-300, because this underpins the entire conversion strategy. Toujeo's higher concentration slows subcutaneous absorption and microprecipitate dissolution, yielding a flatter, longer PK/PD profile with lower within-day variability, but also a lower unit-for-unit glucose-lowering effect compared with Lantus at the same dose, which explains why higher unit doses are typically required to match glycemic control [^115AMNWM] [^111isE9T].

> Wait, let me verify the exact potency difference so I don't overstate it. The FDA pharmacodynamics section notes that at steady state, the 24-hour glucose-lowering effect of Toujeo 0.4 U/kg is approximately 27% lower than an equivalent dose of Lantus, and that higher doses of Toujeo are required to achieve similar control, which aligns with clinical observations of needing roughly 10–18% more units when switching from Lantus to Toujeo [^111isE9T] [^114iUWsv] [^113qvfEh].

> Hold on, I should confirm the labeled switching guidance before proposing a practical approach. The FDA label instructs that for patients on once-daily long-acting insulin, start Toujeo at the same unit dose and titrate to effect, while anticipating that a higher daily dose will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control; for patients switching from twice-daily basal insulin, start Toujeo at 80% of the total daily NPH or detemir dose, and monitor closely during the transition [^114iUWsv] [^115v7Vmf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "start Toujeo at 80% of the Lantus dose" to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, but that would be incorrect for a once-daily Lantus regimen. The label's 80% rule applies when converting from twice-daily basal insulin to once-daily Toujeo, not when switching from once-daily Lantus to once-daily Toujeo, so I should correct that and adhere to unit-for-unit for once-daily Lantus with planned up-titration as needed [^114iUWsv] [^115v7Vmf].

> Next, I should review the clinical trial data to ensure the labeled approach is consistent with real-world outcomes. In randomized trials, patients switched to Toujeo required about 12–18% more basal insulin than those on Lantus to achieve comparable A1c, with noninferior A1c outcomes and no meaningful weight differences, supporting the expectation of modest dose escalation after a unit-for-unit switch from Lantus [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4] [^112JWJi7].

> I will now examine a practical switching protocol, but let me first confirm the monitoring cadence. Start by continuing the current Lantus dose until the day of switch, then begin Toujeo at the same unit dose that evening or the next morning, maintaining the same injection time when possible; increase fingerstick glucose monitoring to daily for the first 1–2 weeks, titrate Toujeo no more frequently than every 3–4 days toward a fasting glucose target of about 80–130 mg/dL, and anticipate an average increase of roughly 10–20% over the first few weeks to match prior control, consistent with label guidance and trial data [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy] [^113Vm5ms].

> But wait, what if the patient is on twice-daily basal insulin such as NPH or detemir? In that case, I should double-check the conversion: start Toujeo at 80% of the total daily dose of the twice-daily basal, then titrate to fasting targets, which reduces the risk of overlapping basal effects and hypoglycemia during consolidation to once-daily dosing [^114iUWsv] [^115v7Vmf].

> I need to ensure I address the early transition period, because the PK/PD lag can transiently unmask hyperglycemia. Toujeo's onset develops over about 6 hours and steady-state glycemic effect may take at least 5 days, so during the first week I should watch for higher fasting glucose and avoid premature dose judgment; if fasting levels drift upward, resist the urge to overcorrect immediately — titrate methodically every 3–4 days unless clearly indicated otherwise [^111isE9T] [^114iUWsv].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. In geriatric patients, I should confirm that initial dosing and increments are conservative to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, with careful titration and frequent monitoring, aligning with FDA geriatric cautions and ADA guidance emphasizing individualized, lower-intensity targets in complex or frail older adults [^114RtfwC] [^1137VP55].

> I should review renal and hepatic impairment next. Because insulin clearance may be reduced in kidney disease and hepatic dysfunction can alter metabolism, frequent glucose checks and cautious dose adjustments are warranted. In advanced kidney failure, basal insulin requirements often fall, so I need to titrate slowly and reassess regularly [^114RtfwC] [^1111PdvU] [^112tXwD6].

> Hold on, I should verify inpatient considerations, especially if the patient arrives on Toujeo and must be switched to a formulary U-100 basal. Narrative guidance suggests a 20% dose reduction when moving from U-300 to U-100 in the hospital to avoid hypoglycemia from mismatched durations, with close monitoring and subsequent up-titration based on bedside glucose trends. I should also remember that a 1:1 inpatient interchange from U-300 to detemir has been associated with higher hypoglycemia, reinforcing the need for dose reduction and vigilance during transitions [^113r9kzd] [^115yZpHU].

> Let me think about device selection and dose rounding, because this affects implementation. Toujeo SoloStar dials in 1-unit steps up to 80 units per injection, while Max SoloStar dials in 2-unit steps up to 160 units; if switching pen types and the prior dose is odd, round up or down by 1 unit to match dial increments, and reassess glycemic response thereafter [^116BUzxy] [^117KJWfF].

> Next, I should review safety counseling and hypoglycemia mitigation. I need to ensure patients recognize nocturnal hypoglycemia, rotate injection sites away from lipodystrophy, and understand that improved day-to-day PK/PD with Toujeo may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with Lantus in some settings, though this benefit is most pronounced in type 2 diabetes cohorts and should be individualized [^112JWJi7] [^111WZG3D].

> I should double-check that I've integrated guideline-level advice on overbasalization and titration discipline. The ADA Standards note that longer-acting basal analogs like U-300 glargine have lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine, and that an initial dose reduction is reasonable when switching from detemir or U-300 to another basal; they also advise evaluating for overbasalization when bedtime-to-morning glucose differentials exceed about 50 mg/dL, prompting reassessment of basal dose and mealtime coverage [^114TPXyY].

> Let me synthesize a practical checklist to close the loop. Confirm the current basal regimen and total daily dose. If once-daily Lantus, switch unit-for-unit to Toujeo and plan for 10–20% dose escalation over 1–2 weeks. If twice-daily basal, start Toujeo at 80% of total daily dose. Maintain or choose a consistent injection time. Intensify glucose monitoring for 1–2 weeks. Titrate every 3–4 days to fasting targets. Review hypoglycemia recognition, sick-day rules, and injection site rotation. And in older adults or those with CKD, titrate more conservatively with closer follow-up, documenting rationale and targets in the chart [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy] [^114RtfwC].

Switch from Lantus to Toujeo using a **unit-for-unit conversion** for most patients [^114iUWsv], but expect to need **10–20% more Toujeo** to match Lantus control [^113Vm5ms] [^115AMNWM]. Start Toujeo at the same units as Lantus, then titrate every 3–4 days [^114iUWsv] to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL [^notfound]. Monitor glucose closely during the first weeks [^114iUWsv] and adjust other diabetes medications as needed [^1137ZzJ1]. Toujeo's longer, flatter profile may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia [^112JWJi7], but the full effect takes ~5 days [^1137ZzJ1]; dose adjustments should be gradual to avoid hypoglycemia [^114iUWsv].

---

## Pharmacological differences between Lantus and Toujeo

Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL) and Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) have distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles that influence dosing and clinical outcomes:

| **Parameter** | **Lantus (u-100)** | **Toujeo (u-300)** |
|-|-|-|
| Concentration | 100 U/mL | 300 U/mL |
| Duration of action | ~24 hours | Up to 36 hours |
| Onset of action | ~1 hour | ~6 hours |
| Peak effect | Minimal | Minimal |
| Half-life | ~12 hours | ~19 hours |
| Intra-subject variability | Moderate | Lower |

---

Toujeo's higher concentration and altered pharmacokinetics result in a **longer, flatter profile** with less day-to-day variability, which may reduce hypoglycemia, especially at night [^112JWJi7] [^1137VP55].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the switch

Clinical trials show that switching from Lantus to Toujeo achieves **similar HbA1c control** but often requires a 10–20% higher dose [^112JWJi7] [^115AMNWM]. Toujeo also reduces nocturnal and overall hypoglycemia versus Lantus in type 2 diabetes [^112JWJi7] [^113qvfEh].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy for switching

The recommended strategy is to **start Toujeo at the same unit dose as Lantus** and titrate to effect [^114iUWsv]:

- **Initial dose**: Same units as Lantus (unit-for-unit) [^114iUWsv].
- **Titration**: Adjust every 3–4 days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL [^116BUzxy] [^114cg82Q].
- **Final dose**: Expect ~10–20% higher than Lantus to achieve similar control [^113Vm5ms] [^115AMNWM].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment during the transition

Close monitoring is essential during the transition:

- **Glucose monitoring**: Check fasting glucose daily for the first few weeks [^notfound].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Watch for nocturnal hypoglycemia, especially early on [^112JWJi7].
- **Medication adjustments**: Modify other diabetes drugs as needed to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^1137ZzJ1].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of switching

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **lower nocturnal and overall hypoglycemia** in type 2 diabetes [^112JWJi7] [^1137VP55], a **once-daily injection** with flexible timing, and improved adherence due to reduced injection burden [^112PcrxK].

---

### Risks

Risks include **transient hyperglycemia** early in the transition and the need for higher doses, which may increase costs [^1137ZzJ1]. Early hypoglycemia may occur, especially with aggressive titration.

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: Monitor closely and adjust as needed [^114RtfwC].
- **Elderly**: Use conservative dosing and titration to limit hypoglycemia [^114RtfwC].
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Similar HbA1c with Toujeo, but may need ~10–20% more units than Lantus [^112JWJi7] [^115AMNWM].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient education**: Explain the switch, monitoring, and titration plan [^115a2C9j].
- **Follow-up**: Schedule visits every 4–6 weeks until stable [^notfound].
- **Pen selection**: Use SoloStar for ≤ 80 units/day; Max SoloStar for > 80 units/day [^116BUzxy].

---

Switching from Lantus to Toujeo is straightforward: start unit-for-unit, titrate every 3–4 days, and expect to need ~10–20% more Toujeo for similar control. Toujeo may reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia, but close monitoring is essential during the transition [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy] [^111fUKZ4] [^113Vm5ms] [^112JWJi7].

BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Meal adjustment algorithm in patients receiving glargine+premixed insulin before breakfast. All the patients were required to exercise 30 min (moderate intensity) after dinner

In addition, patients were given oral administration of acarbose at dinner (minimum and maximum doses of 50 mg qd and 100 mg tid) and metformin (minimum and maximum doses of 0.5 g bid and 1.0 g bid). At the same time, they stopped taking secretagogues, TZDs, and DPP-IV inhibitors. The doses of insulin and oral drugs were adjusted according to the blood profiles. Patients were asked to have regular meal times. The purpose of the treatment was to achieve 2 h PG < 11.0 mmol/L and the target HbA1c level was set to 7.5%.

Stable period (5–16 weeks)

Once adjusted, the treatment protocol was maintained for 12 weeks, and had to remain unchanged. Nevertheless, if fine adjustments were needed due to disease conditions, the dose of glargine and variety of oral hypoglycemic agents (metformin tablet and acarbose tablet) could only be reduced rather than increased, while the doses of insulin aspart 30 could be increased or decreased.

Data collection

The following baseline data were recorded: age, gender, course of disease, insulin dose, BMI, HbA1c, fasting glucose, glucose before and 2 h after meals, glucose before sleep and insulin injection time-point before main meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner). At the 16th weekend, HbA1c was measured.

Study drugs

In this study, insulin glargine (Lantus) (Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France) and insulin aspart 30 (NovoMix 30 Flexpen) (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) were selected, both of which were injected simultaneously and separately on both sides around the umbilicus before breakfast. Other drugs included metformin tablet (Glucophage) (Bristol-Meyer Squibb, New York, NY, USA) and 100 mg Glucobay (acarbose tablet) (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Montville, NJ, USA).

### Basal insulin regime change from lantus to toujeo resulted in fewer hypoglycaemic episodes in a 28-year-old man with diabetes mellitus [^111WZG3D]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An active 28-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus reported a reduced number of hypoglycaemic episodes following change in basal regime insulin glargine from U100 Lantus to U300 Toujeo. Consequently, an improved quality of life was also reported. Flash-based glucose monitoring was utilised to record 24-hour continuous glucose levels throughout two comparable 60-day periods before and after the change in regimen. Low blood glucose was most likely between 03:00 and 08:00. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 3.9mmol/L) reduced by an average of 2.5 episodes per week. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes (≤ 2.9mmol/L) reduced to an average of 0.4 per week, down from 1.5 per week. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes reduced in frequency and severity. Furthermore, nocturnal hypoglycaemia episodes occurred in a more predictable time window. This was especially important in the reported reduction of impact on the patient's quality of life, as the episodes tended to be associated with anxiety and low mood. Patient education needed to facilitate this change was minimal, and benefits to the patient were great, including decreased sleep disturbances and reduced risk of associated anxiety symptoms.

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^112cMP3p]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

EDITION 2 provided evidence that body weight can be stabilized more effectively with Gla-300 than with Gla-100. After switching basal insulin to Gla-300, there was a significant weight benefit vs. Gla-100 which was maintained until 12 months of therapy. Our study confirmed these results, as body weight remained stable throughout the trial without exhibiting any significant changes.

A limitation of the current study was the small number of patients (n = 62) that were followed up until 12 months. Also, at study start, only a few physicians had much practical experience with Gla-300, which had been approved in Switzerland only shortly before trial initiation. It can be assumed that the population selected comprised a particularly challenging cohort of patients, since their pre-existing basal insulin regimens had failed. The lack of a direct comparator is another limitation, as no information on the outcomes with alternative therapies is available. The question of whether the obvious benefits seen in our trial are solely a result of the properties of Gla-300 or if the root cause is improved adherence to insulin therapy/fostered insulin titration cannot be fully answered. However, the EDITION program demonstrated consistent and sustained glucose control with Gla-300 and a significantly lower risk of hypoglycemia as compared to Gla-100. In EDITION 2, these superior safety results were most prominent in the titration phase from baseline to week 8, with a relative risk reduction for any hypoglycemia at any time of the day of 23%. The strengths of TOP-2 are its prospective multicenter design with observational monitoring and follow-up that can be considered representative of primary care in Switzerland.

### Estimated changes in insulin prices and discounts after entry of new insulin products, 2012–2019 [^111zfYxz]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

Our findings are of relevance because policy making to address cost-related insulin access has been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the net price of insulin and its association with patient out-of-pocket costs, resulting in policy proposals that have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as increasing the cost of insulin. Overall, our analysis confirms that insulin products are highly rebated and that net prices faced by payers increased at a slower pace than list prices from 2012 to 2019. Before competition, however, increasing discounts were not able to offset increases in list prices, meaning that list price growth resulted in higher net prices.

Our net price estimations revealed commercial strategies across insulin markets. Net prices of long-acting legacy insulin products Lantus and insulin detemir (Levemir) decreased after classwide competition owing to the introduction of biosimilar Basaglar, as well as Toujeo and insulin degludec (Tresiba), in 2015. At launch, Sanofi priced high-strength insulin glargine Toujeo at a lower net price than legacy insulin glargine Lantus even as it was reducing the net price of Lantus. This strategy, acknowledged by Sanofi to the Senate Finance Committee, aimed to encourage insurers to induce switches from Lantus to Toujeo, ostensibly to avoid automatic substitution of Lantus with forthcoming interchangeable biosimilars (first approved in 2021). Novo Nordisk priced insulin degludec (Tresiba) at a higher list and net price compared with legacy insulin detemir (Levemir), which likely reflects its ultralong duration of action unmatched by other products. However, by 2018, the net price of insulin degludec (Tresiba) had decreased below the net price of insulin detemir (Levemir) in 2014, suggesting intense competition in the crowded long-acting insulin market. The introduction of noninterchangeable insulin glargine Basaglar in 2015 was followed by decreases in net prices faced by payers across the entire class of long-acting insulin products. Although Toujeo has a lower net price than Basaglar, it has not captured as much market share as Basaglar (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1), which may reflect insurers' concern about switching patients to a formulation that will not face biosimilar competition for a longer period. Together, the change in trajectory of net prices of long-acting insulin products after competition suggests that competition resulted in lower net prices, likely reducing overall insulin spending.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first TOUJEO dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating TOUJEO, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to TOUJEO, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Scenario Analyses

Two new basal insulin analogues have recently entered the market, IGlar U300 (Toujeo ®) and IGlar biosimilar (Abasaglar ®). Given that they are new to the market, there are currently no head-to-head data for them versus IDeg. However, scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of IDeg versus these comparators using available data and plausible assumptions.

IDeg versus Abasaglar ®

This scenario analysis assumed that Abasaglar ® has the same efficacy and safety as IGlar U100 (Lantus ®). However, Abasaglar ® is a biosimilar and is not identical to IGlar U100, and EMA approval does not involve any assessment or recommendation regarding interchangeability. The price of Abasaglar ® is 15% lower than that of IGlar U100 (Lantus ®), so this scenario reflected a 15% reduction in the price of IGlar U100, with no change in any other parameters.

Methods

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims in the MarketScan commercial claims data, spanning November 2020 to November 2022 (eMethods in Supplement 1). Institutional review board approval was waived because we analyzed deidentified patient-level data that were fully compliant with HIPAA (US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for reporting observational studies.

The study population included commercially insured enrollees who were younger than 65 years and had at least 1 fill for a highly prescribed long-acting insulin glargine (Lantus [Sanofi]) or its substitutes, interchangeable biosimilar insulin glargine-yfgn (Semglee [Mylan Pharmaceuticals]) and a noninterchangeable insulin glargine (Basaglar [Lilly]) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), in the 12-month period before and after November 16, 2021, when interchangeable insulin glargine-yfgn was launched (insulin glargine-yfgn was initially launched as a noninterchangeable biosimilar in June 2020). We included the noninterchangeable substitute, which was approved as a follow-on biologic to the highly prescribed insulin glargine, because it is widely considered a biosimilar in clinical practice. We excluded Toujeo (Sanofi; another branded insulin glargine) from the denominator because our focus was on understanding the extent to which state laws may influence the substitution of the highly prescribed insulin glargine with insulin glargine-yfgn (the other branded insulin glargine cannot be substituted with insulin glargine-yfgn).

### Cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113qvfEh]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

IDeg versus IGlar U300 (Toujeo ®)

IGlar U300 is a concentrated insulin glargine product (300 units/ml) for once-daily use for the treatment of T1DM and T2DM in adults. With the IGlar U300 prefilled pen, the maximum dose per injection is 80U. IGlar U300 has a flatter and more prolonged (up to 36 h) profile of insulin concentration and glucose-lowering activity compared with IGlar U100 at the same dose. IGlar U300 is not bioequivalent to IGlar U100 and they are not directly interchangeable. An approximately 10–18% higher dose is required when patients are switched from IGlar U100 to IGlar U300.

In clinical trials, IGlar U300 was non-inferior to IGlar U100 in terms of HbA 1c reduction in T1DM, T2DM BOT and T2DM B/B. In T1DM, there was no significant difference in hypoglycaemia (severe, nocturnal or overall) between IGlar U300 and IGlar U100; in T2DM BOT there was no significant difference in severe or nocturnal hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of overall hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; and in T2DM B/B there was no significant difference in severe or overall hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100. In all three patient groups, the total daily basal insulin dose was higher with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; by 17.5% in T1DM, 17% in T2DM BOT and 10% in T2DM B/B.

### The effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 U / mL among type 2 diabetes patients: analysis of a real-world data in Israel [^113gj4Y1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive metabolic condition characterized by insulin resistance and decreased beta‐cell function. 1 Patients with T2DM suffer from either one or several metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity, increased endogenous glucose output, compromised insulin action and insulin secretion dysfunction. 2, 3, 4 This condition places patients at an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarctions, stoke and elevated blood pressure along with many other potential health impediments. 5, 6

The reduction of functional insulin‐producing beta cells contributes to the development and progression of T2DM. 7, 8 As the nature of this condition is progressive and as beta‐cell activity declines, a glycaemic control and medication regimen should be re‐evaluated routinely and adjusted based on patient characteristics. As T2DM advances, the endogenous insulin may be insufficient to achieve the desired glycaemic control. Based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommendations, once the glycaemic control is insufficiently achieved by using other antihyperglycaemic agents, the intensification with insulin should be considered and should not be delayed. 9, 10 Treatment with insulin has the advantage of being highly effective in reducing blood glucose levels as mono‐therapy or in combination with any other agents, especially in severe hyperglycaemia when blood glucose levels reach ≥ 300 mg/dL or HbA 1c ≥ 10%. 11

Physicians and patients may be reluctant in initiating insulin therapy, where such a delay could increase the risk of long‐term glycaemic complications that may lead to micro and macro‐vascular complications. 12, 13 Although good glycaemic control is related to a lower risk for micro and macro‐vascular complications, fear of the short‐term outcome of hypoglycaemia is associated with delayed insulin initiation and no or low adherence to insulin treatment. 14

In June 2016, insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo ®), a longer‐acting second generation basal insulin analogue, was introduced in Israel. This insulin is a new formulation of insulin glargine with a more stable and prolonged glucose lowering effect compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus ®).

### Insulin glargine 300 U / mL and insulin glulisine treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes: a non-interventional study of effectiveness in routine clinical practice [^117Dbeb1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The external validity of observational studies like Toujeo-6M is relatively high as a result of the lack of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to involve patients. However, it is important to put the results into context with outcomes generated in randomized trials which investigated similar patient populations using the same therapeutic regimen under strict control. Such comparisons can validate the observed findings and vice versa. From the EDITION program, the EDITION 1 trial investigated the same treatment regimen (BBT) similarly in patients with T2DM. Both the baseline glycemic control and the improvement during the 6-month follow-up in our study were higher compared with the results from EDITION 1 (8.9% vs 8.2%, and − 1.4% vs − 0.8%, respectively). It is important to highlight that the final HbA1c values were comparable (7.5% and 7.3% in our study and in EDITION 1, respectively) which indicates that with treatment optimization with Gla-300-based BBT, similar glycemic control can be achieved in daily practice as in strictly controlled protocol-driven randomized controlled trials. Although the daily basal and prandial insulin doses in EDITION 1 were considerably higher than in our study, the difference can be attributed to the inclusion criteria in EDITION 1 which only recruited patients using at least 42 U of BI daily in the trial. Recent results from DELIVER 2 indicate a substantially smaller improvement of HbA1c (− 0.5%) in patients with T2DM who were switched to Gla-300-based insulin regimens (basal-oral or basal-bolus) despite the similar baseline HbA1c value (8.95%) compared to our study. However, there is no information on the dose titration after switching in DELIVER 2, so it cannot be evaluated whether sufficient BI titration has been applied in the study. Furthermore, in DELIVER 2, patients were switched from first-generation basal analogues (insulin glargine U100/mL or insulin detemir) as opposed to our study in which patients were using human insulin-based BBT before switching.

### New insulin glargine 300 U / mL versus glargine 100 U / mL in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic drugs: glucose control and hypoglycaemia in a randomized controlled trial (EDITION JP 2) [^111P6im1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

While type 2 diabetes can initially be controlled in most people with lifestyle modification and oral antihyperglycaemic drug (OAD) treatment, disease progression often leads to a requirement for insulin therapy 1. Nevertheless, a number of barriers may reduce adherence to insulin regimens, and patients and physicians might be wary of intensifying therapy because of fear of hypoglycaemia 2, 3, which probably contributes to the inadequate glycaemic control that is observed in many people 3. The global prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly, including in Japan, where changing lifestyles have led to a rapid rise in type 2 diabetes over the last few decades 4, 5, 6. There is considerable need, therefore, for improved management strategies that can help to reduce the burden attributable to diabetes.

Since the market authorization of insulin glargine 100 U/ml [Gla‐100 (Lantus ®; Sanofi, Paris, France)] in 2000 (Gla‐100 was licensed in Japan in 2003), long‐acting basal insulin analogues have had a considerable positive impact on diabetes management 7. Nevertheless, quality of life for people with diabetes might be further improved by therapies that can achieve and maintain glycaemic control, lower hypoglycaemia risk and increase injection interval flexibility. New insulin glargine 300 U/ml (Gla‐300) may help to address these needs; studies in both Japanese and Western populations 8, 9 have shown more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100, and persistence of glycaemic control beyond 24 h in people with type 1 diabetes. Gla‐300 was licensed in the USA, Europe and Japan in 2015 (as Toujeo ® in the USA and Europe; as Lantus ® XR in Japan).

The phase IIIa EDITION programme compared Gla‐300 with Gla‐100 in several different populations, and has shown that Gla‐300 is as effective as Gla‐100 in achieving glycaemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In addition, a lower hypoglycaemia risk was observed over 6 months in multinational type 2 diabetes populations treated with Gla‐300 combined with mealtime insulin (EDITION 1) or OAD(s) (EDITION 2), and in insulin‐naïve people (EDITION 3) 10, 11, 12. The present study, EDITION JP 2 (NCT01689142), investigated the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100 in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes who were already using basal insulin and OAD(s).

a First-generation basal insulin analogs (e.g. insulin glargine 100 units/ml or insulin detemir)

In a recent paper, Hirsch and Draznin explored several clinical scenarios in which challenges may arise when switching from degludec to a basal insulin with a shorter half-life. The authors surveyed 30 other HCPs on what they would do in each situation, and also offered their own recommendation, based on the PK/PD profile of the insulins involved. The most popular answer selected by HCPs often involved making unit-to-unit conversions between degludec and formulary insulins, but this may not be appropriate, especially in hospitalized patients who are vulnerable to hypoglycemia, because of the carry-over effect of previously injected degludec. For patients admitted to the hospital on degludec, the authors recommended halving their basal insulin dose on the first day they are switched to a first-generation formulary basal insulin and then upping the dose to 75–100% of the pre-admittance insulin dose the next day (depending on BG levels). This is based on the knowledge that 50% of the last degludec dose is still contributing to the serum insulin levels 25 h post-injection, as indicated by the terminal half-life. This is a conservative approach to avoid hypoglycemia when switching from a second- to first-generation basal insulin in hospitalized patients. It is important to consider when exactly the patient's last dose was given, especially given the flexibility in degludec dosing. For example, if the last dose of insulin (degludec) was > 30 h ago, halving the next dose of insulin (e.g. glargine U100, onset of action ≤ 6 h) may result in a temporary rise in glycemia. It is impossible to provide a precise and universal calculation for conversion, as every situation is different, and the factors listed in Table 1 will also determine patients' insulin requirements. Nevertheless, we would recommend considering a reduction in total daily insulin dose of between 20 and 50% when switching non-critical patients from degludec to a first-generation basal insulin upon admittance to hospital and a similar magnitude in dose reduction when switching back to degludec upon discharge to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Optimizing glycemic control before conception and during pregnancy appears to improve fetal outcome; this should include the avoidance of episodes of hypoglycemia as the toxic effects of maternal hypoglycemia on the fetus have been well-documented. The drug insulin glargine SC (also known as Lantus, Toujeo, Toujeo MAX) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^112SN518]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

A recently published head-to-head study in insulin-naïve patients with T2D corroborated the efficacy of Gla-300 with the advantage of a lower risk of hypoglycemia versus IDeg. The HbA1c reduction was similar with both basal insulin analogs. However, with Gla-300, the incidence and event rate for confirmed hypoglycemia (< 3.0 mmol/L) at any time of the day were significantly reduced by 37% and 43% compared to IDeg during the titration phase.

For the evaluation of efficacy and safety, randomized controlled trials (RCT) remain the "gold standard", and are pivotal for regulatory bodies in the drug approval process. Nonetheless, the intensive monitoring and education provided during the RCTs are not always representative of daily clinical practice. A gap has been identified between efficacy in RCTs and effectiveness in real-world data for GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors. Limited resources and poor medication adherence in the real world may largely account for this finding. Thus, the external validity of results obtained from RCTs needs to be confirmed in a "real-life" setting such as non-interventional trials. Non-interventional observational studies with less restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria can include broader populations of patients and offer an important tool to better assess the real-world effectiveness of a drug. Retrospective real-world evidence gathered with Gla-300 has already demonstrated a glucose control improvement along with a lower risk for hypoglycemia as compared to other basal insulins. In this study we aimed to prospectively investigate the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 in patients with T2D in Switzerland after 6 and 12 months in real-life conditions. The results for the German study cohort were recently presented at the 78 th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JQfj8]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The main limitations of the Lantus Registry Study have been reported previously. Briefly, the lack of comparator arm in the trial means that it is difficult to determine whether observed improvements in glycemic control following the switch in treatment are solely on account of treatment effectiveness or influenced by study design. This is because observation can alter the behavior of both patients and physicians involved in a clinical trial, which can influence outcome measures. Another general limitation of observational and single-arm studies is the strong likelihood of bias and confounding in study design. Treatment was at the discretion of the physicians, which further exposes the study to bias.

Additionally, the duration of the Lantus Registry Study was relatively short and did not allow proper evaluation of the clinical challenges associated with optimal titration of insulin glargine along with OAD dosage adjustments. A longer study is required for more robust evaluation of these clinical challenges and insulin glargine titration. As a result of the widespread use of premixed insulin in China, there is lack of clinical experience with insulin glargine, which may have led to insufficient titration and therefore a lower achievement of glycemic control than would have otherwise been seen. However, the current subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study does provide insight into the characteristics of patients associated with the clinical benefits of transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral OADs, based on real-world data. It also highlights the need to improve the management of T2DM in clinical practice, especially with regard to titrating the dose of insulin glargine to enable patients to achieve adequate glycemic control. This study also raises the need for further investigation of the effects of switching therapy on the incidence of hypoglycemia in Asian populations to encourage optimal titration of the dose of insulin glargine.

### Switching to insulin glargine 300 units / mL in real-world older patients with type 2 diabetes (DELIVER 3) [^1137VP55]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was 9.7% in 2013 to 2016. 1 Of these people, ~12 million were aged ≥ 65 years, resulting in a prevalence of diabetes in this age group of 25%. 2 Diabetes was estimated to be associated with direct medical costs of US $237 billion in the USA in 2017; > 60% of this cost was for those aged ≥ 65 years. 3

Older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have an elevated risk of hypoglycaemia compared with younger adults. 4, 5 Not surprisingly, hypoglycaemia has been associated with increased healthcare resource utilization and hospitalizations. 6 Additionally, among older adults with T2D, hypoglycaemia has been associated with cognitive decline, dementia, falls, accidents and fractures. 7, 8, 9, 10 Therefore, the American Diabetes Association recommends that treatments for older adults with T2D should focus on minimizing the risk of hypoglycaemia. 11 Treatments with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia may also lead to better adherence. 12

To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic goals for older adults are less strict than for younger adults, ranging from < 7.5% (for otherwise healthy individuals) and from < 8.5% (for those with complex/poor health), 13 compared with < 7% for younger adults. 11, 13 The first‐line pharmacologic treatment for older adults with T2D is metformin; other options include oral dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors, sodium glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists and basal insulin. 11

First‐generation basal insulins include insulin glargine 100 units/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus 14) and insulin detemir (IDet; Levemir 15). Insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo 16), a second‐generation basal insulin, has a more stable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile and a longer duration of action than Gla‐100, leading to lower within‐day variability and better day‐to‐day reproducibility. 17, 18 In the EDITION randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was a comparable to lower risk of hypoglycaemia with Gla‐300 than with Gla‐100 in adults with T2D. 19, 20, 21, 22 Similar results have recently been reported in the SENIOR RCT, which enrolled patients aged ≥ 65 years with T2D. 23

### Real-world evaluation of dosing in patients converted from insulin glargine (lantus) to insulin glargine (basaglar) [^116WHf87]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Basaglar, insulin glargine (BGlar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a follow-on biologic, was developed after the patent for Lantus, insulin glargine (LGlar; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) expired. Objective: To compare the dosing and hemoglobin A 1C (A1C)-lowering effects of BGlar compared with LGlar in a real-world setting. Methods: Adult patients, at 5 clinics, with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were converted from LGlar to BGlar were included in this retrospective observational study. The primary outcome compared mean basal insulin dose (U/d) from the date of conversion to 6 months. Basal insulin and total daily insulin doses were also compared from baseline to 3- and 12-months postconversion, as also change in A1C, body weight, and estimated monthly acquisition costs of basal insulin. Results: Of the 225 patients included, 56% were male, and 81% had T2DM. The mean conversion dose (U/d) of LGlar was 46.3 ± 32.7. There was no significant difference in the mean BGlar dose (U/d) at 6 months (45.9 ± 33.5; P = 0.52), nor was there a statistical difference at 3 or 12 months. There were no significant differences in change in A1C at any time point. The estimated monthly acquisition cost of BGlar was significantly less than that for LGlar at conversion ($286 vs $341, P < 0.001) and 6 months ($290 vs $351, P < 0.001) respectively. Conclusion/Relevance: The results of this retrospective study suggest that BGlar resulted in similar glycemic outcomes compared with LGlar in a real-world setting and may be a preferable option in a value-based health care environment.

Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The efficacy of TOUJEO was evaluated in a 26-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (Study B) in 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal.

The mean age of the trial population was 13 years; 31% were < 12 years of age, 69% were ages ≥ 12 years of age. The mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Of the 463 pediatric patients, 51% were male, 92% were White, 3% were Black or African American, and 30% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean baseline BMI percentile was 68.32.

At week 26, the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline between TOUJEO and LANTUS was 0.02% with a 95% confidence interval (-0.16%; 0.20%) and met the prespecified noninferiority margin (0.3%). The results are presented in Table 5.

### The evolution of insulin and how it informs therapy and treatment choices [^115AMNWM]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

A 3-fold concentrated version of insulin glargine was developed to prolong the duration of action when the results of 2 preliminary studies showed less diurnal variation in glucose-lowering activity with U-300 compared to the same dose of U-100 glargine. Insulin glargine U-300 (300 U/mL) was approved by the FDA in 2015 and marketed as Toujeo ® (Sanofi S/A). The higher concentration of glargine delivered in the same volume further slows the dissolution of the glargine precipitate in the SC space, leading to a better basal insulin. The PK and PD profiles of the U-100 and U-300 formulations of insulin glargine are shown in Fig. 10A. The concentrated U-300 insulin glargine profile has a lower peak and a longer duration of action compared to U-100 insulin glargine at the same U/kg dose. The glucose-lowering effects of U-300 insulin glargine at steady state appear to be lower than U-100 insulin glargine at the same dose level (Fig. 10A). In a study in type 1 diabetes, subjects needed 17.5% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic control. In studies in type 2 diabetes, subjects needed an average of 12% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic effect. Conversely, it is recommended that up to a 20% dose reduction may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when switching from U-300 to U-100 insulin glargine. In addition, dose-dependent kinetics were observed with U-300 insulin glargine in people with type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with the mechanism described (Fig. 10B).

### What do the guidelines say about use of biosimilar insulin therapy? Simple practical considerations to guide clinicians in different patient subgroups-sharing Canadian perspectives [^115JtzeY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The rising cost of insulins are significantly impacting health care expenditure, thereby limiting access to treatment for more people affected by diabetes. Fear and misunderstanding of insulin therapy have worsened with the emergence of biosimilar insulins. Biosimilars are not the same as generic medications. Generic medication contains identical ingredients to the reference, whereas biosimilar medication is highly comparable but not necessarily identical to the reference.

Results

There are five biosimilar insulins currently available in Canada: insulin glargine (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, insulin lispro (U-100) as the biosimilar insulin, Admelog® and insulin aspart (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Trurapi® and Kirsty ™. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity for biosimilar insulins compared with reference insulins. The dosing of biosimilar insulins is also the same as the reference for initiating, switching (1:1) and titrating. Regulatory agencies, payors and clinical practice guideline committees are initiating biosimilar initiatives aimed at reducing costs, impacting more patients worldwide. While few studies have evaluated biosimilar insulin use in a real-world clinical practice setting, the descriptive patterns retrieved from the LMC Diabetes Registry reflect the Ontario Ministry of Health's changes in biologic drug policy that were implemented to promote the use of biosimilar insulins.

Conclusion

Many health care providers are largely unfamiliar with biosimilar insulins. This limits the acceptance of biosimilar insulins by patients, as it is related to the comfort of health care providers in educating patients. Tailoring effective conversations to patient needs ensures the best possible therapeutic outcomes.

Plain Language Summary

This review article intends to review the efficacy and safety data from pivotal clinical trials with biosimilar insulins, as well as the regulatory and health economic considerations which underpin the safe and cost-effective use of biosimilar insulin therapy. Biosimilars are not the same as generic medications. Generic medication contains identical ingredients to the reference, whereas biosimilar medication is highly comparable but not necessarily identical to the reference. There are five biosimilar insulins currently available in Canada: insulin glargine (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, insulin lispro (U-100) as the biosimilar insulin, Admelog® and insulin aspart (U-100) as the biosimilar insulins, Trurapi® and Kirsty™. Data for biosimilars must be submitted in a stepwise approach to demonstrate similarity to the reference biologic under the following categories: structure & function, human clinical trials, comparative studies evaluating efficacy and safety and manufacturing quality control. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity for biosimilar insulins compared with reference insulins. The dosing of biosimilar insulins is also the same as the reference for initiating, switching (1:1) and titrating. Health care providers are encouraged to stay up to date on the latest guidelines and recommendations regarding biosimilar insulin interchangeability to ensure safe and cost-effective use of these products. Regulatory agencies, payors and clinical practice guideline committees are initiating biosimilar initiatives aimed at reducing costs, impacting more patients worldwide. While few studies have evaluated biosimilar insulin use in a real-world clinical practice setting, the descriptive patterns retrieved from the LMC Diabetes Registry reflect the Ontario Ministry of Health's changes in biologic drug policy that were implemented to promote the use of biosimilar insulins. A summary of adults with diabetes from this registry showed 3.8% of individuals with T1D were prescribed Basaglar® before April 2023 compared to 12.0% after January 2024. For the T2D cohort, the use of basal biosimilar insulins, Basaglar® and Semglee®, similarly increased by approximately 10% and 2% after January 2024, respectively. The use of bolus biosimilar insulins also increased after January 2024 by approximately 28% in the T1D cohort and 60% in the T2D cohort using insulin therapy. Many health care providers are largely unfamiliar with biosimilar insulins. This limits the acceptance of biosimilar insulins by patients, as it is related to the comfort of health care providers in educating patients. People living with diabetes must have access to safe and effective treatment options, and they should be able to obtain appropriate medications at an affordable price and in a fair and timely manner.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating TOUJEO, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to TOUJEO, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 (8–14), 12 (12–18), and 16 (12–20) hours, respectively. Mean serum insulin concentrations declined to the lower limit of quantitation of 5.02 µU/mL by 16, 28, and beyond 36 hours, respectively.

Steady-state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once-daily subcutaneous administration of 0.4 U/kg to 0.6 U/kg doses of TOUJEO over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO, the intra-subject variability, defined as the coefficient of variation for the insulin exposure during 24 hours, was 21.0% at steady state.

Elimination

After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of human insulin.

Specific Populations

Pediatrics

Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for TOUJEO based on concentration data of its main metabolite M1 using data from 75 pediatric patients (6 to < 18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes. The findings with regard to the effect of body weight on systemic exposure of M1 are generally consistent with findings in adults.

Elderly, Race, Sex, and Obesity

Effect of age ≥ 65, race, and sex on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been evaluated. When weight is taken into account as a covariate on clearance, BMI is not an additional covariate.

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients Stratified by Endpoint HbA 1c

Patients were stratified according to an endpoint HbA 1c level of either < 7.0% or ≥ 7.0%. Among them, 1019 patients (55.2%) reached HbA 1c < 7.0% and 828 patients (44.8%) did not. Patient demographics and characteristics of the two groups at baseline are shown in Table 1. Patients with an endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger (55.10 ± 11.16 vs 57.90 ± 10.61 years; P < 0.001) and had lower baseline BMI (24.94 ± 2.94 vs 25.34 ± 3.58 kg/m 2; P < 0.05), shorter mean duration of diabetes (6.05 ± 5.60 vs 9.14 ± 6.49 years; P < 0.001), and lower baseline HbA 1c (7.34 ± 1.16% vs 8.28 ± 1.06%; P < 0.001) and FPG (7.60 ± 1.87 vs 8.70 ± 2.19 mmol/L; P < 0.001) than patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of ≥ 7.0%. The HbA 1c < 7.0% group also had a lower proportion of patients with diabetes complications (36.2% vs 45.4%; P < 0.001) and comorbidities (57.2% vs 63.6%; P < 0.01). A lower proportion of female patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% compared with those who achieved HbA 1c ≥ 7% (41.3% vs 47.7%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of < 7.0% received a markedly lower dose of premixed insulin prior to treatment switch (0.41 ± 0.14 vs 0.46 ± 0.16 U/kg/day; P < 0.001). There was also a difference in the number OADs taken at baseline between patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% and those who did not (P < 0.001); a higher proportion of patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% took only one OAD at baseline (63.6% vs 49.3%).

This study also demonstrates that BMI could be a factor influencing efficacy outcomes. Patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were shown to have lower baseline BMI than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Higher BMI has been shown to be associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, which may be why patients with lower BMI exhibit greater glycemic control in response to insulin glargine.

Another factor of significance was the insulin glargine dose at endpoint, which was shown to be negatively associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. This may have been on account of the suboptimal glycemic control of patients at baseline. At baseline, the mean HbA 1c of the mITT set was 7.8% and the mean FPG was 8.1 mmol/L.

Findings from this study demonstrate that FPG is an important factor influencing the HbA 1c level of patients. Patients with an improvement in HbA 1c had significantly higher baseline HbA 1c in comparison to the unchanged and deterioration groups. This reflects a more marked reduction in HbA 1c for poorly controlled patients, although this does not necessarily indicate their achievement of HbA 1c < 7.0%. Fasting hyperglycemia is the main contributor to glycemic load for poorly controlled T2DM and this suggests that for patients with poor glycemic control at baseline, treatment with insulin glargine, which targets FPG, has a greater impact on overall glycemic control. This has also been observed in the study by Zhang et al. Patients with higher baseline HbA 1c levels, as a result of the nature of their hyperglycemia, are therefore likely to experience improvements in glycemic control in comparison to those with lower baseline HbA 1c levels during treatment switching.

### Transition of patients to and from insulin degludec: a clinical challenge [^113zRK5i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

With appearance of new insulins on the market, new clinical challenges, much like unintended consequences, came into light in our daily practice. One of the most pressing issues has become an issue of switching patients to and from newer insulins in various clinical situations. A proper switch from 1 medication to another requires understanding of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of both drugs. Unfortunately, there is no research in this area and, as a result, there are no guidelines nor is there even a consensus. We present 5 clinical scenarios in which the patients were transitioned to or from insulin degludec. Because there are no data and no current consensus, we have polled 200 diabetes care providers soliciting their opinion as to how they would handle these clinical situations. Our poll of endocrinologists revealed multiple approaches as well as elements of confusion among providers. Even though all answers, summarized following each case, might be reasonable, and there might not be a single correct answer, we wish to express our opinion that is based on PK and PD of these insulins. Because there is more than 1 correct way of implementing these transitions, we urge our colleagues to institute a very close follow-up of these patients with frequent adjustments of insulin dose to avoid stacking with potential hypoglycemia.

Basal and prandial insulin dosing considerations emphasize flexibility, dose differences, and interchangeability. For degludec, "Flexible dosing with at least 8 to 40 hours between injections was not associated with increased hypo- or hyperglycemia". For detemir, "Up to 40% to 50% of persons may require twice daily dosing (with 12 hours after the morning dose)". For glargine U300, "Persons with type 1 diabetes may require ~15% to 30% higher dose compared with glargine U100". The biosimilars section notes interchangeability and substitution: "Biosimilar designation allows the drugs to be interchangeable with the reference drug and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow pharmacists to substitute without the need for an authorized prescription", and advises, "Clinicians should refer to the FDA — approved prescribing information for the most current official product information on any of the insulins". For prandial insulins, "Based on onset of action, insulin should be taken at appropriate time to match the postprandial glucose absorption. All can be used in insulin pumps with preference given to rapid-acting insulins".

### Initiation of insulin glargine in suboptimally controlled patients with type 2 diabetes: sub-analysis of the AT.LANTUS trial comparing treatment outcomes in subjects from primary and secondary care in the UK [^112R6UFV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The AT.LANTUS study compared insulin glargine initiation and titration using one of two algorithms in suboptimally controlled subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on a primary outcome of severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes included other categories of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic control, weight changes and insulin dose. Here, we report the results of a subanalysis of the trial, which investigated whether insulin glargine can be initiated and titrated as effectively in primary [general practitioner (GP)] as secondary (hospital) care in patients with T2DM in the UK.

Methods

The main study was a multicentre (n = 611), multinational (n = 59), open-label, 24-week randomized trial in 4,588 suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM. Insulin glargine was titrated to target fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels of ≤ 5.5 mmol/l according to algorithm 1 (clinic-driven titration) or algorithm 2 (patient-managed titration). In this substudy, 819 subjects (GP, n = 215; hospital, n = 604) from 57 primary and 130 secondary care centres were included in the subanalysis; subjects were switched to once-daily insulin glargine from baseline treatments that consisted primarily of oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) (38%) only or premixed insulin ± OAD (23%).

Results

Both the GP and the hospital groups of subjects experienced a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (< 1%), with significant decreases in HbA1c levels (-0.51 and -0.95% respectively; p < 0.001), large reductions in FBG levels (-2.72 and 3.0 mmol/l respectively; p < 0.001) and modest weight gain of 1 and 1.2 kg respectively (p < 0.05). With the exception of absolute reductions in HbA1c and reductions in basal and prandial insulin made on switching to insulin glargine, there were few significant differences in subjects managed in primary compared with secondary care.

Conclusions

This study shows that despite differences in diabetes duration and baseline glycaemic control, an insulin glargine-based therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in a diverse range of suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM in both primary and secondary care settings in the UK. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low and consistent with the results of the main study. Absolute reductions in HbA1c were greatest in the secondary care setting, but similar levels of glycaemic control were achieved in both groups due to differences in baseline HbA1c. In the patients managed in primary care, there was an overall reduction in prandial and basal insulin used when switching to a basal insulin regimen and a lack of titration of prandial insulin. Therefore, the role of prandial insulin, its initiation and titration, appears to be an area that requires more focus in primary care.

2.3 Converting to LANTUS from other insulin therapies

If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or
long-acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS, the amount and timing of
shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be
adjusted.

If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being
discontinued.
If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being
discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2 METHODS

2.1 Trial design

EDITION 2, EDITION 3 and EDITION JP 2 were multicentre, randomized, open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase 3a studies in different populations of adults with T2DM (NCT01499095, NCT01676220, NCT01689142) and have been described previously. 6, 8, 10 In EDITION 2 and EDITION JP 2, participants must have used basal insulin treatment (≥ 42 U/d in EDITION 2) for more than 6 months, in combination with non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents within the previous 4 weeks. For the EDITION 2 trial, exclusion criteria included recent (within the past 2 months) use of sulphonylureas. In the EDITION JP 2 trial, concomitant sulphonylurea and/or glinide treatment was permitted, with doses adjusted if at least two symptomatic or at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode(s) occurred. Overall, 63% of participants in the EDITION JP 2 trial received sulphonylureas and/or glinides, with a similar proportion of participants in the Gla‐300 (62%) and Gla‐100 (64%) groups. 11 Participants in the EDITION 3 trial were insulin‐naïve and were required to have used non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents for at least 6 months before screening; if participants were receiving sulphonylureas/glinides, these medications were discontinued.

Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive once‐daily injections of Gla‐300 (Toujeo, Sanofi, Paris, France) using a modified SoloSTAR (Sanofi) pen‐injector in the EDITION 2 trial or a modified Tactipen (Sanofi) injector in the EDITION 3 and JP 2 trials, or Gla‐100 (Lantus, Sanofi) using a SoloSTAR pen. Basal insulin was titrated, seeking a pre‐breakfast SMPG target of 4.4–5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL).

Basal insulin injections were to be administered in the evening, defined as the time immediately before the evening meal until bedtime, at the same time every day. All participants recorded time of injection.

2.3 Procedures

All participants in both groups made a total of 3 visits over a 16‐week period. The 2nd visit was at week 4 and 3rd visit at week 16 after initial visit. At each visit, all patients had blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight, height, blood pressure and heart rate, answered adverse reaction questions and completed the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM‐SAT) Questionnaire form.

At first visit, the following changes were made in intervention group:

All prandial insulin injections (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, Novolin R or Humulin R) were discontinued.
Basal insulin (NPH, Lantus, Levemir, Toujeo or Tresiba) were continued at 80% of the home dose. The dose was gradually increased until the patient is back on the home dose (the dose that the patient has been taking at home prior to the enrolment) or fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl was achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
If the patient was on premixed insulin 2–3 times daily, it was switched to a basal insulin alone and Glargine was given at 40% of total daily dose of premixed insulin. The dose was gradually increased until fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl is achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
Metformin at home dose was continued, but other noninsulin diabetes medications were discontinued. If the patient was not on metformin, then metformin ER was started at 500 mg daily with a meal for 2 weeks and then 1000 mg daily as a maintenance dose if tolerated.
Both SGLT2i, empagliflozin 10 mg or 12.5 mg once daily, and GLP1 RA, dulaglutide 0.75 mg subcutaneously once weekly, were added to metformin and a basal insulin.

SWITCH STUDIES FOR INSULIN GLARGINE/LISPRO

Two unique biosimilars of insulin glargine (RP Lantus) are approved in the EU (i.e. Abasaglar and Semglee). 2 Insulin lispro Sanofi is an EU‐approved biosimilar of the insulin lispro RP (Humalog). 2

Four studies incorporating a switch between the insulin glargine RP and a biosimilar were identified (Table S6 in the online Supplementary Information). One of these studies, based on a retrospective chart review, indicated an increase in insulin dosage by 2.4 units after switching 24 patients to the biosimilar. 33 The results of another retrospective chart review, of 73 patients switched from Basalin to Lantus showed further reductions in blood glucose, although the insulin glargine dose did not increase. 34 The hypoglycemia incidence was low during both Basalin and Lantus treatment (2.4% vs. 1.2%, respectively), with no cases of severe hypoglycemia. Authors concluded that further studies are needed to verify these findings. 34 Basalin is not approved in the EU or in the United States, thus, not to be considered a true biosimilar evaluated by a stringent regulatory framework. A lack of true biosimilarity could, thus, potentially explain the observed pre‐ and post‐switch differences. The retrospective design poses further a limitation to the interpretation of the results. No insulin lispro switch studies were identified.

Introduction

Clinical guidelines recommend introduction of a basal insulin as an effective strategy for initiating insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes (T2D) when patients fail to meet glycemic goals using non-insulin antihyperglycemic agents. Basal insulins should provide relatively constant blood levels sufficient to suppress hepatic glucose output between meals and during the night. Long-acting basal insulin analogs were developed several years ago to overcome the deficiencies of conventional basal insulin therapy and more closely mimic endogenous basal insulin secretion. Insulin glargine (IGlar; Lantus ®, Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France), the first long-acting basal insulin analog, became available in 2000 and continues to be an important treatment option for people with diabetes. Compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH), IGlar has demonstrated less variability and a more prolonged duration of action (up to 24 h) with a more even concentration–time profile. Clinically, this has allowed once-daily (QD) dosing in most patients and resulted in a lower risk of hypoglycemia.

In 2014, Lilly insulin glargine (LY IGlar; Basaglar ®, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA and Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rheim, Germany) received marketing authorization in the European Union as the first biosimilar insulin product, which was followed by approvals in Japan and the USA under the appropriate pathways. Protein-derived biosimilars or follow-on biologics, such as insulins, are highly similar versions of previously approved biopharmaceuticals with an amino acid sequence (primary protein structure) that is identical to that of the corresponding reference product. Their development may reduce costs and increase patient access to such therapies. Because of the nature of protein drugs, complex manufacturing processes are utilized, and differences in these processes can affect the final products. Thus, nonclinical and clinical studies comparing similar biologics with their reference products must demonstrate similar structural and functional characteristics and clinically similar outcomes, as required by regulatory agencies. Several such studies were conducted as part of the LY IGlar development program. Assessment of outcome effects across different racial backgrounds and clinical characteristics, such as prior insulin exposure, is also important as further characterization of the extent of effect comparability. Herein we report results from a phase III clinical trial (ELEMENT 5) that compares the efficacy and safety of LY IGlar and IGlar in a T2D population with expanded Asian participation and on additional basal insulin background therapies compared with that from an earlier study.

### Glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes switching from twice-daily basal insulin to once-daily insulin glargine 300 U / mL or insulin glargine 100 U / mL (EDITION 1 and EDITION 2 subgroup analysis) [^112PcrxK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

The convenience of switching to once‐daily dosing may improve quality of life, 1 adherence to therapy, 1 and, consequently, may lead to better glycaemic control. 2 Some people with diabetes, however, may still prefer a twice‐daily regimen; this choice should be respected, as effective self‐management is reliant on the patient being comfortable with their daily routine. Nevertheless, Gla‐300 can be considered as an option for people with T2DM wishing to switch to a once‐daily regimen.

Limitations of the present study include its post hoc, exploratory nature. As the EDITION studies were not designed to evaluate the effect of switching from twice‐daily to once‐daily dosing regimens, this analysis only included a small number of participants. As per the inclusion criteria of the studies, 12, 13 participants were receiving relatively high doses of basal insulin, and may not be representative of the global T2DM population; however, this analysis offers clinical evidence on switching from twice‐daily to once‐daily basal insulin dosing. Further studies investigating switching to Gla‐300 in different populations of people with T2DM, including those with lower body mass index and requiring lower doses of insulin, would be of interest.

In conclusion, in this post hoc analysis of 6‐month data from EDITION 1 and 2, people with T2DM who switched from twice‐daily basal insulin to once‐daily evening injection of Gla‐300 achieved similar glycaemic control with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with those who switched to once‐daily Gla‐100. These findings suggest that people with T2DM currently on a twice‐daily insulin regimen can choose to switch to once‐daily Gla‐300 while maintaining glycaemic control, without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Switching to once‐daily Gla‐300 is also likely to reduce the burden of self‐management, which may improve adherence and potentially outcomes. 1, 2 As the switching protocol used in the EDITION studies was similar to the guidance now provided in the Gla‐300 product label, 16, 17 these findings from the EDITION studies are likely to be relevant to real‐life clinical practice. It will be interesting to see whether there are differences observed in glycaemic control between Gla‐300 and Gla‐100 in "real‐life" clinical studies without centrally defined insulin titration algorithms.

In Study D, the average age was 58.2 years. The majority of patients were White (94%) and 46% were male; 33% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 34.8 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 12% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 15% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

Cardiovascular Safety

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

- Reduce dose.

Optimally titrating the dose of insulin glargine is therefore a critical factor influencing achievement of adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c. This finding holds particular significance as it demonstrates a mechanism by which patients can achieve target HbA 1c following a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. This finding is also relevant to Asia, given that physicians in Asia often have a cautious approach to the titration of insulin, especially as Asian patients with T2DM, who are leaner than Caucasian patients, are perceived to be at an increased risk of hypoglycemia. This fear is unfounded as several studies conducted in Asian patients with T2DM have shown that the rates of hypoglycemia are low with insulin glargine when taken as combination therapy with OADs in insulin-naïve patients or in patients switching from premixed insulin. A study by Riddle et al. which sought to determine the relative contributions of basal hyperglycemia versus postprandial hyperglycemia in patients inadequately controlled on OADs prior to and following treatment intensification with various therapies, demonstrated that symptomatic hypoglycemic events were greater with the other treatments than with basal insulin.

Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Treatments

By means of an interactive voice/web response system, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to either once-daily IDeg 200 units/mL (3-mL FlexTouch; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) or once-daily IGlar (Lantus 100 units/mL, 3-mL SoloStar; Sanofi U.S. LLC, St. Louis, MO) and continued metformin with or without DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. Trial participants were instructed to continue the same total daily dose of metformin and DPP-4 inhibitor treatment as before the start of the trial. In countries where DPP-4 inhibitor treatment did not have the indication of combination with insulin treatment, participants discontinued DPP-4 inhibitor treatment at randomization.

IDeg 200 units/mL was administered once-daily with the main evening meal and, consistent with its product labeling, IGlar was administered once daily at the same time each day. Insulin treatments were injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm, or abdomen. The starting dose for each insulin was 10 units and, during the treatment period, the dose was systematically titrated using a treat-to-target approach striving for a prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) level of < 5 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL). Both IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar were titrated once weekly according to the average of three preceding prebreakfast SMBG levels and other available data (e.g. symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, previous responses to dose adjustments, and any additional nonmandatory blood glucose measurements). The treatment period was 26 weeks, and doses were individually titrated in an effort to achieve a specific target of < 5 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL) with both treatments. After the 26-week treatment period, participants switched their basal insulin treatment to the intermediate-acting NPH insulin for 1 week to wash out the investigational exogenous insulins and minimize interference with insulin antibody measurements.

The safety committee from the sponsor performed ongoing blinded safety surveillance. Titration of insulin doses was monitored by the outside company Quintiles (Singapore, U.S. and Switzerland) and reviewed by the sponsor's titration committee. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated and assessed by an independent external event adjudication committee.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Onset of Action

The pharmacodynamic profiles for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.4, 0.6, or 0.9 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average, the onset of action develops over 6 hours post dose for all three single doses of TOUJEO.

Single-Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO had a lower maximum (GIRmax) and 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) compared to LANTUS. The overall glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was 12% of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS. Glucose lowering at least 30% of the effect of a single 0.4 U/kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of TOUJEO exceeded 0.6 U/kg.

Multiple Once-Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of TOUJEO after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. At steady state, the 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The glucose lowering effect of a TOUJEO dose increased with each daily administration.

The pharmacodynamic profile for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as multiple once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 1.

Challenges of Interrupting Treatment with Second-generation Basal Insulin Analogs during Hospitalization

Not all hospital formularies include second-generation basal insulins, so patients may need to be transferred to the available formulary basal insulin, and, in some cases, it might be more practical or desirable to transfer patients temporarily to continuous intravenous (IV) insulin infusion. The current lack of data and restricted formularies will mean that the vast majority of patients being treated with degludec or glargine U300 are likely to be switched to an insulin with a shorter half-life. Despite this, there are no guidelines on safely switching between second- and first-generation basal insulin analogs upon admittance and discharge from hospital. While the prescribing information gives recommendations on how to switch to these newer insulins (unit-for-unit conversions except when switching from twice-daily basal insulin to glargine U300, where a 20% dose reduction is recommended), it is unknown whether these are suitable for patients who may have just undergone major changes in glucose handling before being discharged from hospital, and there is even less information on switching from these insulins. Table 3 presents a comparison of guidance (drawn from the authors' clinical experience) on the hospital care of patients with T2D receiving outpatient basal insulin regimens involving a first- or second-generation basal insulin analog.

Introduction

The treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus remains a major challenge for physicians and care providers. In 2017, 1 in 11 adults was estimated to suffer from diabetes, and the global prevalence is expected to rise to over 600 million patients in 2045, the majority of whom will be affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D). In recent years, a considerable number of treatment options have emerged, allowing for individualized care and improving clinical outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes.

However, despite new antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or GLP-1 receptor agonists that have been shown to improve glycemic control, disease progression often ultimately necessitates the initiation of an insulin regimen. Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Toujeo ®, Sanofi–Aventis) is a basal insulin analog with improved properties, including more stable and smoother pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL and insulin degludec 100 U/mL. In the EDITION phase III program, these properties translated into an unaltered efficacy in terms of HbA1c reduction but with less hypoglycemia vs. Gla-100. Notably, in EDITION 2, patients with T2D on basal insulin supported oral therapy who switched to Gla-300 showed a 27% risk reduction for any hypoglycemia from baseline to month 6. Furthermore, patients with Gla-300 experienced significantly less weight gain than patients with Gla-100. These results suggested a relevant treatment benefit for patients with T2D uncontrolled on basal insulin supported oral therapy who switched to Gla-300, as hypoglycemia and weight gain are important barriers to insulin therapy initiation, adherence, and intensification.

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

TOUJEO is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens:
TOUJEO SoloStar contains 450 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection.
TOUJEO Max SoloStar contains 900 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day.
When changing between TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen.
The dose counter of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of TOUJEO to be injected and no conversion is required.
Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day.
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Individualize and titrate the dosage of TOUJEO based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
Titrate the dose of TOUJEO no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were Caucasian, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Clinical outcomes of switching to insulin glargine 300 U / mL from other basal insulins in people with type 2 diabetes in Italy: a real-world study [^116E4cvx]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary aim was to provide real-world evidence of the outcomes after the switch to glargine 300 U/ml (Gla-300) from other basal insulins (first or second generation) in Italy.

Methods

Multicenter, observational, retrospective study based on electronic medical records.

Results

Overall, 953 T2DM insulin ± OAD treated people switched to Gla-300 or Gla-100 from January 2015 to July 2018. Three clinically relevant cohorts were identified: patients switching to Gla-300 from first-generation basal insulin (cohort 1), patients switching to Gla-300 from degludec-100 (Deg-100) (cohort 2), and those switching to Gla-100 from any basal insulin (cohort 3). The three cohorts differed in terms of age, diabetes duration, and metabolic control. HbA1c changes after 6 months from the switch were - 0.27% (95% CI - 0.38; - 0.16), - 0.06% (95% CI - 0.31; 0.19), and - 0.30% (95% CI - 0.51; - 0.09) in the three cohorts, respectively. FPG significantly decreased in cohort 1 (- 14.07 mg/dl, 95% CI - 20.25; - 7.89), while body weight significantly decreased in cohort 2 (- 1.47 kg, 95% CI - 2.55; - 0.39). Doses of insulin marginally changed during the follow-up (+0.89 U in basal insulin daily dose in cohort 1 and+2.07 U in short-acting insulin daily dose in cohort 2).

Conclusions

Switching to Gla-300 from first-generation basal insulin in the real world is associated with improvements in metabolic control despite a suboptimal titration of both basal and short-acting insulins. Inertia in insulin titration documented in the Gla-100 cohort is also observed with the second-generation basal insulin. The switch to Gla-300 from Deg-100 was associated with a decrease in body weight of - 1.47 kg despite a slight increase in short-acting insulin daily doses of about+2 U.

Conclusion

In patients with type 2 diabetes, switching basal insulin to Gla-300 improves glycemic control, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia and no weight gain. These results confirm the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 in a real-world setting and show that Gla-300 is a suitable therapy option in Switzerland for patients with diabetes.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, Insulin Glargine, U-300 has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300 monitor glucose daily, titrate Insulin Glargine, U-300 as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

### Insulin glargine 300 U / mL and insulin glulisine treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes: a non-interventional study of effectiveness in routine clinical practice [^113xzt8B]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The EDITION development program confirmed that insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) provides comparable glycemic control to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) but with lower hypoglycemia risk. Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Gla-300 in everyday practice.

Methods

This one-arm, non-interventional study included patients with type 2 diabetes who were switched to Gla-300-based basal-bolus therapy (BBT) and followed for 6 months. Indications for switching included inadequate glycemic control and/or hypoglycemic events with the previous regimen.

Results

Overall 229 patients were included, with mean age of 60.9 years. All glycemic variables improved between baseline and 6 months significantly (mean ± standard deviation [SD] hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] from 8.9 ± 1.5% to 7.5 ± 1.1%, fasting blood glucose from 9.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L to 7.0 ± 2.1 mmol/L, postprandial blood glucose from 12.0 ± 3.8 mmol/L to 8.9 ± 2.5 mmol/L). Gla-300 doses were increased and mealtime insulin doses were unchanged. Rates of both non-severe and severe hypoglycemic events decreased significantly compared to pre-study and 6-month follow-up periods. Patients switched because of elevated HbA1c had higher baseline HbA1c and greater decrease in HbA1c paralleled with increase in insulin doses compared to those switched because of hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

In day-to-day practice, switching from human insulin to Gla-300-based BBT resulted in significant improvement in glycemic control and decrease in hypoglycemia risk.

### Improving type 2 diabetes management in general practice using a second-generation basal insulin analogue insulin glargine 300 U / mL: a practical guide [^115uGgQK]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Comment

In patients who are on insulin therapy and experiencing hypoglycaemic episodes, switching to a second-generation basal insulin analogue is an option. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be used to detect hidden hypoglycaemic episodes. Switching to a second-generation basal insulin analogue is a logical choice e.g. for the elderly, those living alone, those with inadequate glucose control requiring intensification or in patients having difficulties maintaining a strict 24-h dosing schedule.

Hypoglycaemia is a major risk factor for Mary and the risk could be considerably reduced by switching her to a second-generation basal insulin analogue plus a short-acting insulin if required (basal plus) or basal insulin with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. This reflects a flatter 24-h glycaemic lowering effect of the newer-generation insulin analogues.

When commencing glargine U300, the starting dose would be her total daily insulin less 30% [(40 units + 48 units = 88 units) − 30% = 58 units] (see Fig. 2). T h is could be introduced as a single morning or evening dose. Her Gla-300 will be titrated against her fasting blood glucose level (BGL).

Once her morning fasting blood glucose is near 6 mmol/L, and there is no evidence of hypoglycaemia, we can focus on closely monitoring her postprandial blood glucose. If there is significant postprandial BGL excursions (see Fig. 3), consideration could be given to the introduction of a GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefits, to assist with controlling the postprandial glucose and help her reduce weight without a significant increased risk of hypoglycaemia or introducing short-acting insulin, initially to those meals showing the greatest postprandial BGL excursions (basal plus) where a GLP-1 receptor agonist may not be efficacious enough to control significant postprandial hyperglycaemia (see Fig. 4).

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JWpdD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately three-quarters (74.5%) of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% in this study also failed to achieve FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L. The lack of adequate FPG control in patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% is not surprising given the increased contribution of fasting hyperglycemia to poorly controlled T2DM. Considering their high FPG levels, these patients would have a lower tendency to experience hypoglycemia. Our analysis also showed that the incidence of hypoglycemia did not increase in patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% compared with patients achieving endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% (P = 0.6889), even though patients in the ≥ 7.0% group were older, with a longer duration of diabetes, and a higher proportion of complications and comorbidities. The average endpoint insulin glargine dose for patients who failed both HbA 1c and FPG targets was 0.26 ± 0.09 U/kg/day, which was approximately 40% lower than the doses (0.4–0.5 U/kg/day) required to achieve adequate glycemic control while maintaining a low risk of hypoglycemia reported by other studies. This indicates that there is still potential for up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine in patients who failed to reach both glycemic targets. Hence, further up-titration of the insulin glargine dose in patients who failed to reach both HbA 1c and FPG targets may not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve the likelihood of achieving adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c.

### Rate of inpatient hypoglycemia following a 1: 1 dose interchange between concentrated insulin glargine to insulin detemir [^115yZpHU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin remains a mainstay of treating hyperglycemia in an acute setting. Insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Toujeo, iGlar300) has a different pharmacokinetic profile than 100 units/mL basal insulins, such as insulin detemir (iDet100) and iGlar100. While conversion from iGlar300 to iGlar100 requires a 20% dose decrease, there is currently no recommended interchange from iGlar300 to iDet100.

Objective

Compare the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients who received a 1:1 unit interchange from home iGlar300 or iGlar100 to iDet100 while admitted.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate adults within a multi-site network admitted between May and December 2019. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of iDet100 following interchange from home iGlar300 or iGlar100. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypoglycemic events following a 1:1 interchange of iGlar300 vs. iGlar100 to inpatient iDet100. Secondary outcomes include overall hypoglycemic events, time to hypoglycemia, and doses given before hypoglycemia.

Results

Of 615 patients, 394 received a 1:1 unit interchange to iDet100 (52 from iGlar300 and 342 from iGlar100). Incidence of hypoglycemic events was significantly higher in those with a 1:1 interchange from iGlar300 versus iGlar100 (36.5% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.007). Significant differences were observed in overall hypoglycemic events, time to hypoglycemia, and number of doses given before hypoglycemic event.

Conclusion and Relevance

A 1:1 unit interchange from iGlar300 to iDet100 led to a higher incidence of hypoglycemic events compared to those interchanged from iGlar100. Dose reduction should be considered when transitioning from home iGlar300 to iDet100 in the inpatient setting.

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^1113ZbmU]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo ®) is a long-acting, once-daily basal insulin with improved — more stable and smoother — pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and insulin degludec (IDeg). These properties have been shown to translate into an effective HbA1c reduction with the advantage of a lower risk of hypoglycemia in randomized controlled trials of Gla-300 versus Gla-100. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

Methods

The prospective, observational, open-label, multicenter study TOP-2 explored the effectiveness of Gla-300 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5–10%) on their previous basal insulin in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The primary endpoints were the percentages of patients achieving a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L after 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, and insulin dose as well as hypoglycemia incidence and safety. Here we report the results for the Swiss patient cohort after 12 months of treatment with insulin glargine 300 U/mL.

Results

The 62 patients (33 men) had a mean age of 65 years, a mean diabetes duration of 14 years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m 2, and were mainly switched from Gla-100 (44%) to Gla-300. The most common concomitant oral anti-diabetes therapy was metformin (65%). The mean individual HbA1c target chosen by the investigators was 7.4%. After 12 months of therapy, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.6% (p < 0.0001). Likewise, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean FPG from 9.1 mmol/L to 7.4 mmol/L (p < 0.0001). At study end, 32% of patients achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, 55% achieved FPG ≤ 7.2 mmol/L, and 57% achieved their individual HbA1c target. Gla-300 was uptitrated to a mean dose of 40 units per day. Symptomatic hypoglycemia incidence after 12 months was low at 9.7% and a rate of 0.23 events per patient year. Body weight remained stable and was not significantly altered during the study.

Conclusion

Upon switching basaI insulin to Gla-300, overall glucose control significantly improved and glycemic targets were achieved with a low rate of hypoglycemia in T2D patients under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

### Glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes switching from twice-daily basal insulin to once-daily insulin glargine 300 U / mL or insulin glargine 100 U / mL (EDITION 1 and EDITION 2 subgroup analysis) [^114DgjDv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Reducing the number of daily basal insulin injections for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can lower the burden of disease management, potentially leading to improved treatment adherence and persistence, 1 which may be associated with better long‐term blood glucose control, improved health resource utilization, and reduced costs. 2, 3 Long‐acting basal insulin analogues, such as insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla‐100; Lantus; Sanofi, Paris, France) or detemir, have improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, with longer duration of action than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, 3, 4 allowing many people with T2DM to adopt a once‐daily regimen 3, 4; however, a substantial proportion of individuals using basal insulin still inject at least twice daily. 3, 5 Potential reasons for this may include a perceived, or real, risk of hypoglycaemia with shorter‐acting basal insulins, 2, 6, 7 the desire to adjust daytime and night‐time basal insulin doses, and reducing the injection site discomfort associated with higher volume injections. 8

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla‐300; Toujeo; Sanofi) has a prolonged pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile compared with Gla‐100, with low variability and high reproducibility, resulting in more predictable and evenly distributed glucose‐lowering activity beyond 24 hours. 9, 10 This extended and more stable coverage may enable more people currently administering multiple daily basal insulin injections to minimize the number of basal injections. The EDITION 1 to 3 trial programme assessed the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 in T2DM, and demonstrated similar glycaemic control vs Gla‐100 with less hypoglycaemia. 11 This post hoc analysis of EDITION 1 and 2 has explored the effect of switching to once‐daily therapy on outcomes with Gla‐300 and Gla‐100 in the subgroup of participants previously receiving twice‐daily basal insulin injections.

Basal insulin management — risk reduction and overbasalization signals — states that long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine and degludec or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin, that longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk than U-100 glargine, and that an initial dose reduction is reasonable and typically needed when switching from insulin detemir or U-300 glargine to another insulin; evaluation for overbasalization should be prompted by clinical signals such as bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥ 50 mg/dL [≥ 2.8 mmol/L].

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Commentary to "Differential effect of hypoalbuminemia on hypoglycemia on type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin glargine 300 U / mL and insulin degludec" by kawaguchi et al. diabetes therapy 2019 [^111CDuBw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

"For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL) expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control".

"At steady state, the 24 h glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC 0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS".

Given that degludec and glargine U100 have been shown to produce parity in HbA 1c in numerous trials at equivalent unit doses, it follows that degludec will have a greater unit potency than glargine U300. This has indeed been confirmed in glucose clamp studies. Assuming that the disparity between glargine U300 and degludec is similar to that between glargine U300 and U100, insulin-naïve patients who commenced the cross-over study on the same unit dose of glargine U300 as of degludec would have effectively commenced on a dose with approximately 27% less glucose-lowering potency. Similarly, previous insulin users switching unit-for-unit from, for example, NPH insulin or glargine U100 to degludec would have maintained an equivalent dose, whereas those switching to glargine U300 would, in effect, have received a substantial dose reduction by 27%. Admittedly, the minimum 10-day titration period would have gone some way to mitigating this dose difference, but this interval is short and would have allowed only a few titration steps. In the second period of the study, patients were crossed over unit-for-unit and the dose left unchanged, so those switching from degludec to glargine U300 would have, in effect, had a 27% dose reduction, whereas those switching from glargine U300 to degludec would have had a substantial dose increase, in effect by 37%.

Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The efficacy of TOUJEO was evaluated in a 26-week, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (Study B) in 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal.

The mean age of the trial population was 13 years; 31% were < 12 years of age, 69% were ages ≥ 12 years of age. The mean duration of diabetes was 6 years. Of the 463 pediatric patients, 51% were male, 92% were White, 3% were Black or African American, and 30% were Hispanic. The mean baseline BMI percentile was 68.32.

At week 26, the difference in HbA1c reduction from baseline between TOUJEO and LANTUS was 0.02% with a 95% confidence interval (-0.16%; 0.20%) and met the prespecified noninferiority margin (0.3%). The results are presented in Table 5.

### In silico examination of initiation of long-acting insulin analogs toujeo compared to lantus under 3 dosing titration rules in virtual type 2 diabetes subjects [^117PBGLA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the benefits and clinical necessity of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes (T2D), healthcare providers are reluctant to initiate insulin, and patients are reluctant to start it for several reasons, one of these being the complexity of insulin treatment. Patients and their healthcare providers can benefit from titration algorithms (TAs) or rules that assist with the initiation and titration of insulin, performing the calculations that are needed to safely initiate and conservatively adjust.

Methods

The primary objective for this in silico study was to examine the effectiveness of 3 dose TAs (1–3) for optimization of basal insulin glargine (Gla-100 and Gla-300). In the simulations, 100 virtual subjects with T2D were included (50% men, age 62 ± 3 years, HbA1c 8.1% ± 2.9%, body weight 94 ± 16 kg). Subjects were studied under each TA (TA1 and TA2 fasting blood glucose [FBG] targets 90–130 mg/dL, TA3 FBG target 110–150 mg/dL). Initial dose of both insulins was based on 0.2 U/kg body weight. During 3 months, subjects reported their FBG to the LTHome web-based dose guidance system with a rules engine to safely guide long-acting insulin titration and maintenance. Subjects followed dose recommendations to reach designated FBG target ranges.

Results

All subjects reached stable doses under all TAs with both Gla-100 and Gla-300 insulin, and 93 or more of the 100 subjects, depending on the assigned TA, achieved the target FBG range within the 3-month simulation for all TAs. Mean FBG was lowered (Gla-100: 155 ± 40 to 118 ± 11 mg/dL with TA1 and TA2 and 132 ± 12 mg/dL for TA3; Gla-300: 125 ± 14 with TA1 and TA2 and 134 ± 15 mg/dL with TA3). Calculated HbA1c improved from 8.1% ± 2.9% to 7.1% ± 2.5% for TA1 and TA2 and 7.5% ± 2.5% for TA3, a reduction of 0.9% and 0.6% over 3 months for both insulins. Three subjects on Gla-100 and one subject on Gla-300 experienced mild hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

All TAs delivered safe dose recommendations with minimal hypoglycemia, leading to a stable glucose control in the majority of subjects.

Importantly, for the first period of the cross-over study, both insulin-naïve patients started on the same unit dose for each insulin (glargine U300 or degludec) and previously insulin-treated patients were switched unit-for-unit to the study insulins. For the second treatment period, the basal insulin was also switched (from glargine U300 to degludec, or vice versa) unit for unit (after a 3–4-day wash-out period) and then left unchanged. This approach presupposes parity in the glucose-lowering potency of the two insulins, but the potency of glargine U300 is known to be reduced compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) and degludec. Indeed, the prescribing information for glargine U300 (TOUJEO ®; Sanofi S. A. Paris, France) states:

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to TOUJEO from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^114o4hxK]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This subgroup analysis of data from the 16-week Lantus Registry Study in China investigated the characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with clinical benefits of transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Methods

The modified intention-to-treat population of the Lantus Registry Study, comprising 1847 patients with T2DM, were included in the current subgroup analyses. Enrolled patients were divided into subgroups based on efficacy variables of endpoint glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), endpoint fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and change in HbA 1c from baseline. The baseline characteristics of those who did and did not achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% were compared, as were those with improvement, no change, or deterioration in HbA 1c. Characteristics of patients who were unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%, further grouped according to whether or not they achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, were also compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%.

Results

Comparison between subgroups demonstrated that patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were significantly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower baseline FPG, HbA 1c, body mass index, and dose of premixed insulin than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Logistic regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between baseline age, HbA 1c, FPG, and duration of diabetes with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. When stratified according to change in HbA 1c, the improvement group was younger, with higher baseline HbA 1c and a greater number of patients with duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years. Three-quarters of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L.

Conclusion

Younger patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA 1c, FPG, and premixed insulin dose following a switch in treatment to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus OADs from premixed insulin have greater potential to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%. Poorly controlled patients with higher baseline HbA 1c are most likely to experience an improvement in HbA 1c following the switch in therapy. The majority of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, highlighting the importance of adequate titration of insulin glargine to achieve adequate FPG control, which can enable achievement of target HbA 1c.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^115a2C9j]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

How to Dose?

There are several important concepts to remember when dosing basal insulin: (a) the starting dose will be wrong; (b) there is no maximal insulin dose; (c) titration of insulin dose is the key. Each of these concepts needs to be explicitly discussed and understood by the patient in order for titration to be successful. Despite 92% of physicians agreeing that "insulin intensification is an essential element of diabetes management", 30% of primary care physicians "never or rarely" personally intensified insulin (vs 4% of specialists) in the multinational survey MODIFY. Interestingly, in a recent multinational survey, HCPs generally preferred a gradual and safe approach to titration to avoid hypoglycemia whereas patients are frustrated by time to reach goal. It is therefore important to manage the patient's expectations.

The starting dose for basal insulin recommended by this panel is 10 U/day. The dose should be incrementally increased on a regular basis using target FBG as the determinant for dose adjustments. At initiation, educating patients that many people will need at least 40–50 units of basal insulin to achieve target FBG is useful for goal setting and behavior shaping. This may help mitigate patient fear/reluctance to up-titrate.

Box 1A details the recommendations by the panel for basal insulin dose and titration.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In controlled clinical studies, 30 of 304 (9.8%) TOUJEO-treated patients with type 1 diabetes and 327 of 1242 (26.3%) TOUJEO-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age, among them 2.0% of the patients with type 1 and 3.0% of the patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of TOUJEO have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients.

Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when TOUJEO is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)].

8.6	Renal Impairment

The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for TOUJEO in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^112XFKci]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When transitioning to iGlarLixi from basal insulin, the starting dose depends on the patient's current basal insulin regimen. It is recommended to start at 30 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on 30 units of basal insulin daily or more, and 15 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on < 30 units of basal insulin daily, with titration directed by FPG targets. In those transitioning to iDegLira from basal insulin, the starting dose is 16 units once daily, with titration based on FPG, up to a maximum daily dose of 50 units once daily. Short‐acting insulin should generally be discontinued once an FRC is initiated, unless continued for specific prandial needs that are not expected to be covered by the GLP‐1 RA component. The rationale for discontinuing short‐acting insulin once initiating an FRC is that the GLP‐1 RA is expected to provide sufficient prandial glucose control. In most patients, this is sufficient to address post‐prandial glycemic excursions without the need for additional insulin. However, for those with high carbohydrate intake, continued post‐prandial excursions or long‐standing diabetes with impaired beta‐cell function, prandial insulin may be warranted to achieve glycemic targets.

6.3 Changing from a‐1 receptor agonist to an

Switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC such as iGlarLixi or iDegLira is a strategy to consider when glycemic control is inadequate, particularly secondary to rising FPG levels not being adequately addressed by the GLP‐1 RA alone. Patient selection should take into account the degree to which HbA1c exceeds the target. Overall, intensifying therapy from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC provides an improvement in HbA1c of ~1%. In those on a GLP‐1 RA with more marked HbA1c elevations (i.e. HbA1c more than 2% above goal or more than 10%), FRC therapy may not be expected to achieve glycemic targets, necessitating the initiation of a separate basal insulin. Rates of hypoglycaemia are expected to increase with FRC use due to the inclusion of basal insulin, though the hypoglycaemia risk remains low overall. Weight gain should be expected when initiating an FRC compared to GLP‐1 RA monotherapy due to the insulin component, though it is usually modest and offset by the improvement in glycemic control.

### A multicentre, UK, retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 units / mL in treating people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in routine clinical practice (SPARTA) [^111p9W1P]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 units/ml [U300 (Toujeo ®); Sanofi, Paris, France] is a second‐generation, once‐daily basal insulin analogue 1. Because of its distinct formulation, U300 has a discrete pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile when compared with insulin glargine 100 units/ml [U100 (Lantus ®); Sanofi] 2, 3. The higher concentration of U300 generates a precipitate with a smaller surface area after subcutaneous injection compared with U100, resulting in a steadier and extended glargine release, and leading to a smoother pharmacokinetic profile and longer duration of action 1, 2, 3.

The use of U300 in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is supported by results from two phase III randomized controlled trials: EDITION 4 and EDITION JP 1 4, 5; however, no participants from the UK were included in these randomized controlled trials, and there is no real‐world evidence regarding the use and utility of U300 in Type 1 diabetes in UK clinical practice.

The present study was designed to provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of U300 in people with Type 1 diabetes across the UK over a 6‐month observation period.

### Practical guidance on the use of premix insulin analogs in initiating, intensifying, or switching insulin regimens in type 2 diabetes [^1167V4Ym]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premix insulin analogs are a well-established treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, there is a lack of simple, clear guidance on some aspects of their use. These include choosing a regimen for insulin initiation, recognizing when patients need intensification of therapy, and switching from basal-bolus to a premix insulin analog when appropriate.

Methods

An independent expert panel formulated recommendations on the use in T2D of the premix insulin analog formulations widely available in Australasia, based on the available evidence and their own experience.

Results

Results from trials in both initiation and intensification of insulin show that no single insulin or regimen is best on all endpoints, and that improved glycemic control can be expected regardless of which regimen is used. Thus, individual patient factors and preferences become more important. Guidance is presented to help the clinician choose between a premix insulin analog or basal analog for insulin initiation, and to intensify insulin therapy using premix insulin analogs. Recommendations are made on dosing, titration, the concomitant use of non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs, and other practical issues, and on the special case of switching from basal-bolus to premix insulin analog therapy.

Conclusion

This guidance is intended to help both general and specialist practitioners make informed choices and provide optimal care for patients with T2D. It emphasizes the importance of taking into account individual patient factors and preferences so that the choice of insulin regimen is individualized to the patient in the same way that glycemic targets are now individualized.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^112pf1hp]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients and Study Design

The Lantus Registry Study was a 16-week, open label, prospective, observational multicenter study conducted across China from September 2010 to June 2012.

In brief, patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 to 75 years of age, had received premixed insulin with or without OADs for at least 3 months, and had an HbA 1c level ≤ 10.0%. The main exclusion criteria included diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, temporary insulin treatment for gestational diabetes or surgery, allergy to insulin glargine (100 U/ml)/OAD or its excipients, and acute diabetes-related complications such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local ethical committees or institutional review boards at each participating institution. All patients or their legally acceptable surrogates gave written informed consent.

Study Treatment

Eligible participants were switched from their previous premixed insulin therapy (with or without OADs) to insulin glargine plus OADs at the discretion of both the physician and the patient, and in accordance with local product labels. Insulin glargine was initiated at a dose equivalent to 60.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c ≤ 8.0%) or 80.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c > 8.0%) of the total dose of the intermediate insulin component of the patient's previous premixed dose. Insulin glargine was up-titrated every 3 days by 2, 4, 6, and 8 U for a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5.5–6.6, 6.7–7.7, 7.8–9.9, and ≥ 10.0 mmol/L, respectively, until an FPG level of ≤ 5.6 mmol/L was achieved. This titration algorithm was in line with the Treat-to-Target algorithm. The OAD type and dosage were adjusted at the physicians' discretion according to the label and standard practice.

Characteristics of Patients Unable to Achieve Target HbA 1c Stratified by Endpoint FPG

Further analysis of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% was conducted according to whether or not they were able to achieve an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (Table 4). The majority of patients unable to achieve target HbA 1c also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (74.5% vs 25.5%). Patients with an endpoint FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L had significantly lower endpoint HbA 1c (7.60 ± 0.88% vs 7.90 ± 0.89%; P < 0.0001), baseline FPG (8.01 ± 1.82 vs 8.97 ± 2.25 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint FPG (5.46 ± 0.57 vs 8.01 ± 2.32 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), baseline 2-h PPG (11.67 ± 3.09 vs 12.81 ± 3.86 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint 2-h PPG (9.24 ± 2.66 vs 10.89 ± 2.68 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), BMI (24.12 ± 3.04 vs 25.76 ± 3.67 kg/m 2; P < 0.0001), dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/day (16.42 ± 6.15 vs 18.39 ± 6.62 U/day; P = 0.0002), and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/day (29.78 ± 9.28 vs 32.33 ± 11.55 U/day; P = 0.0013) than patients with an endpoint FPG of > 6.1 mmol/L. Other characteristics such as age, baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/kg/day, and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/kg/day were similar between both groups.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^111XugQ9]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This subgroup analysis of the Lantus Registry Study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with T2DM in China who may potentially benefit from transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus OADs. Results of this study demonstrate that patients with T2DM who are younger, have a shorter duration of diabetes, lower baseline HbA 1c and FPG levels, and a lower dose of premixed insulin prior to the switch have a greater potential to achieve glycemic targets following a transition in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. The group with improvement in HbA 1c had the highest baseline HbA 1c levels compared with those with no change or deterioration in HbA 1c. Therefore, this study demonstrates that while patients with lower baseline HbA 1c may be able to achieve glycemic targets following a switch in therapy, poorly controlled patients with higher baseline HbA 1c are most likely to demonstrate an improvement in glycemic control following a switch to insulin glargine plus OADs. The majority of patients who failed to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, and this highlights the importance of titrating the dose of insulin glargine to an appropriate level in order to achieve adequate FPG control, which can aid achievement of target HbA 1c.

### Comparative clinical efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) versus insulin glargine 100 U / mL in type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112JWJi7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of glargine-U100 (Lantus/Gla-100) with glargine-U300 (Toujeo/Gla-300) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Materials and Methods

A literature search on Gla-300/Gla-100 in diabetes management was conducted using the MEDLINE/Embase/Cochrane databases from inception to 10 January 2021. Eligible studies considered for inclusion were parallel-design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The random-effects model was applied for interpretation of the results.

Results

Of 5348 records screened, 592 were assessed for eligibility and 15 RCTs were considered for data extraction and meta-analysis (T2D [N = 10; n = 7082]; T1D [N = 5; n = 2222]). In patients with T1D, all safety parameters were comparable between Gla-100 and Gla-300. In T2D, statistically significant differences were observed in favour of Gla-300 over Gla-100 for nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia. For efficacy parameters, a statistically and clinically significant difference favouring Gla-100 in basal insulin dose requirement was observed for both T2D and T1D. Change in HbA1c showed a statistically but not clinically significant reduction with Gla-100 compared with Gla-300 in T1D. Statistically significant but clinically less relevant differences favoured Gla-300 for control of body weight in T1D and T2D and Gla-100 for fasting blood glucose in T2D.

Conclusions

Gla-100 and Gla-300 had comparable efficacy and safety profiles in both T1D and T2D populations. Gla-300 showed a lower risk of nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia, significant in insulin-experienced/exposed patients with T2D. Patients on Gla-300 required significantly more units of insulin daily than the Gla-100 group to achieve equivalent efficacy.

### Considerations for insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients during hospitalization: a narrative review of what we need to know in the age of second-generation basal insulin analogs [^113Dn5Yh]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

While Hirsch and Draznin discussed the challenges pertaining to degludec, to the best of our knowledge, these same challenges have not been explored with explicit reference to glargine U300. For the most part, the same principles will apply; indeed, the glargine U300 hospital trial reduced insulin dose by 20% when switching from U100 to U300 formulations. However, given the relatively shorter half-life and lower unit dose potency of glargine U300 compared with degludec, somewhat smaller dose reductions may be appropriate when switching between glargine U300 and formulary insulin.

Another important point to consider when adjusting insulin during hospitalization is whether the patient's pre-admission insulin dose was appropriate. In cases where patient adherence is poor, the insulin dose can sometimes be inappropriately increased. Therefore, it may be best to also consider the insulin dose expected based on the patient's body weight and nutritional needs. This scenario is possibly less likely, however, in patients on degludec/glargine U300 regimens, as the impact of missing a basal insulin dose becomes smaller as the half-life increases.

Admitting a Patient on Newer Therapies to Hospital

While there may not be enough evidence to draw conclusions on the utility of starting second-generation basal insulin analogs in hospitalized patients, the findings so far may help HCPs decide whether patients who are already being treated with a newer basal insulin should remain on that insulin during their hospital stay or be switched to an insulin with a shorter half-life. For example, the findings from the glargine U300 hospital trial do not indicate that a patient with T2D poorly controlled with glargine U300 would have better outcomes by being switched to glargine U100 upon admittance. This may mean that HCPs take the decision to keep patients on glargine U300 throughout, thereby avoiding the challenges and potential risks associated with switching between a first- and second-generation basal insulin. However, further study is required to support hospital HCPs in this decision and to ensure that future guidelines contain sufficient information on the challenges these new therapies pose to insulin management in an inpatient setting.

In Study D, the average age was 58.2 years. The majority of patients were White (94%) and 46% were male; 33% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 34.8 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 12% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6).

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and participants

EDITION 1, 2 and 3 (NCT01499082, NCT01499095, NCT01676220) were multicentre, randomized (1:1), open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase IIIa studies. 14, 15, 16 Briefly, eligible participants were aged ≥ 18 years with T2DM and receiving the following: EDITION 1, basal (≥ 42 U/d) and prandial insulin therapy ± metformin for ≥ 1 year; EDITION 2, basal insulin therapy (≥ 42 U/d) in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs; EDITION 3, oral antidiabetic drugs received for ≥ 6 months before screening and insulin‐naïve. People with severe, unstable or end‐stage renal disease (CKD stage 5, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2) were excluded. Participants were randomized (1:1) to once‐daily evening injections of Gla‐300 (Toujeo; Sanofi, Paris, France) or Gla‐100 (Lantus, Sanofi), titrated to a fasting self‐monitored plasma glucose target of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (80‐100 mg/dL); sulphonylurea use was not allowed.

In the present post hoc analysis, study populations were pooled and results assessed across two renal function subgroups, according to baseline eGFR (calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation): ≥ 15 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKD stage 3‐4, indicating mild‐to‐moderate renal impairment) and ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (indicating preserved renal function).

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^111DWjp8]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Adequate dose titration is essential after the initiation of an insulin regimen, but is often delayed in clinical practice. This phenomenon is often referred to as clinical inertia and increases with age, diabetes duration, and comorbidities. Multiple barriers have been identified at physician and patient levels that lead to deferred intensification. Fear of weight gain and concerns about hypoglycemia are important obstacles to address in this respect. First-generation basal insulin analogs such as Gla-100 were shown to provide significant advantages over NPH insulin regarding the risk for hypoglycemic events and administration, and recently approved second-generation basal insulins such as Gla-300 afford even greater improvements.

The increased glycemic control was achieved by titrating Gla-300 from a mean of 29 units per day to 38 units per day at 6 months and 40 units per day after 12 months. It is important to highlight that with the observational design in TOP-2, the titration algorithms used were completely at the investigators' discretion, and started with doses as low as 10 units per day. This contrasts with EDITION-2, where only patients with basal insulin doses of at least 42 units per day were included, and a protocol-driven titration plan was applied. So, for the first time, TOP-2 prospectively followed-up on patients with low doses of Gla-300 and demonstrated its effectiveness.

In TOP-2, we were able to demonstrate that the switch to Gla-300 in the real world was associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. During the first 6 and 12 months of therapy with Gla-300 in Switzerland, only 4 (6.5%) and 6 (9.7%) patients, respectively, experienced any hypoglycemia, resulting in an annualized rate of 0.23 events/patient year. The observed rate in our study is very low compared with the estimated global annual rate of 19.3 hypoglycemic events/patient year for patients with T2D and also with the hypoglycemia results for Gla-300 in EDITION-2. This is in line with previous real-world studies on Gla-100, which also showed a lower incidence of hypoglycemia compared to RCTs with Gla-100. It can be hypothesized that this is due to more cautious and individualized insulin titration in clinical practice than in an ambitious research environment. The low risk of hypoglycemia with Gla-300 and the significant improvements in glycemic control are of particular importance, as they indicate that a reasonable balance between safety and effectiveness can be achieved with Gla-300 in real life.

Treatment Changes

Gla-300 was administered once daily using a pre-filled insulin pen (Toujeo ® Solostar ®) in the evening, from dinnertime to bedtime according to the patient's and the investigator's choice at the same time of the day ± 3 h if needed. The time of injection could differ from the time of injection of the previous basal insulin. Pens were labeled for the study. Initial dose was equal to the dose with the previous basal insulin when this one was injected once daily (80% of the total insulin dose if twice daily). Gla-300 dose was titrated at least weekly, or every 3–4 days when possible, according to the titration algorithm (Table 1). Non-insulin treatment remained unchanged during the whole study unless a treatment had to be stopped for safety reason according to the investigator. Global treatment adherence was assessed by the investigator between V1 and V2 and between V1 and V3 as ≥ 80% or < 80% according to the remaining insulin in the returned pens, whereas the adherence to the titration algorithm was evaluated at V2 and V3 according to the patient's logbook (F-SMBG, insulin dose, hypoglycemia events, etc.).

Discharging a Patient from Hospital Formulary Insulin Back to Their Pre-Admission Regimen

Irrespective of the inpatient diabetes treatment regimen, the transition of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting represents a clinical challenge. Discharge planning should commence at hospital admission and include steps to ensure appropriate communication across caregivers, reconciling medication across the continuum of care, arranging for timely follow-up, and encouraging active involvement from patients in their diabetes care. Additional steps are advisable for patients switching back from the hospital formulary insulin to their pre-admission regimen involving a second-generation basal insulin analog (Table 3). For instance, patients should receive verbal and written instructions advising that the second-generation basal insulin dose should be titrated no more frequently than every 3–4 days to avoid overshooting the BG target, putting the patient at risk of hypoglycemia. A dose reduction should be considered in patients switching back to their home regimen involving degludec, while patients should be advised that it may take up to 4 days to see the full effect of degludec or up to 5 days to see the full effect of glargine U300 following discharge (Table 3).

COVID-19 Infection in Patients with T2D

Due to the recent emergence of COVID-19, there has not been an opportunity to study the relationship between T2D and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in large cohorts; thus, a conclusive relationship is yet to be determined. However, retrospective studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated that, compared with non-diabetic patients, patients with T2D require more intensive treatments in the management of COVID-19 symptoms, and have a significantly higher in-hospital death rate. Furthermore, well-controlled BG levels during COVID-19 infection are associated with better survival. One retrospective study, although limited by patient numbers, indicated that patients with T2D who are critically ill with COVID-19 seem have a greater need for insulin at the peak of their COVID-19 infection. The management of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 poses a clinical challenge that requires a balance between glucose-lowering treatments and treatments to manage the viral infection, in addition to careful consideration regarding the multiple factors that contribute to poor prognosis in patients with both COVID-19 and T2D. The authors feel that it is too early to discuss the use of second-generation basal insulin analogs in COVID-19 patients.

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^114PfnbT]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo ®) is a long-acting, once-daily basal insulin with improved-more stable and smoother-pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and insulin degludec (IDeg). These properties have been shown to translate into an effective HbA1c reduction with the advantage of a lower risk of hypoglycemia in randomized controlled trials of Gla-300 versus Gla-100. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

Methods

The prospective, observational, open-label, multicenter study TOP-2 explored the effectiveness of Gla-300 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5–10%) on their previous basal insulin in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The primary endpoints were the percentages of patients achieving a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L after 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, and insulin dose as well as hypoglycemia incidence and safety. Here we report the results for the Swiss patient cohort after 12 months of treatment with insulin glargine 300 U/mL.

Results

The 62 patients (33 men) had a mean age of 65 years, a mean diabetes duration of 14 years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m 2, and were mainly switched from Gla-100 (44%) to Gla-300. The most common concomitant oral anti-diabetes therapy was metformin (65%). The mean individual HbA1c target chosen by the investigators was 7.4%. After 12 months of therapy, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.6% (p < 0.0001). Likewise, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean FPG from 9.1 mmol/L to 7.4 mmol/L (p < 0.0001). At study end, 32% of patients achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, 55% achieved FPG ≤ 7.2 mmol/L, and 57% achieved their individual HbA1c target. Gla-300 was uptitrated to a mean dose of 40 units per day. Symptomatic hypoglycemia incidence after 12 months was low at 9.7% and a rate of 0.23 events per patient year. Body weight remained stable and was not significantly altered during the study.

Conclusion

Upon switching basaI insulin to Gla-300, overall glucose control significantly improved and glycemic targets were achieved with a low rate of hypoglycemia in T2D patients under real-world conditions in Switzerland.
