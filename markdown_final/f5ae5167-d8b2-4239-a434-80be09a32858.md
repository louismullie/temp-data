## Question

eval for pulsatile tinnitus neg w/ carotid us. next steps? ct angio brain?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about next imaging steps for pulsatile tinnitus after a negative carotid duplex, specifically whether CT angiography should be ordered and which study is preferred. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether pulsatile tinnitus itself mandates imaging regardless of carotid ultrasound results. Then, I should verify the limitations of carotid duplex and what pathologies it misses. Next, I will review the highest-credibility guideline recommendations (ACR 2023, AAO-HNSF 2014, ESR 2025) to determine the preferred initial imaging pathway. After that, I should compare CTA/CTV versus MRI/MRA/MRV trade-offs and indications. I also need to ensure we integrate otoscopic findings and audiometry because they change first-line imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a precise imaging recommendation with contingencies for contrast allergy, pregnancy, or a visible retrotympanic mass, and confirm any caveats about when catheter angiography is needed for dural AV fistula evaluation [^11353XiU] [^114Lur98] [^115fh5BT].

> Let me first confirm the indication for advanced imaging: pulsatile tinnitus is a red-flag phenotype that warrants imaging even when routine tests are unrevealing, so the presence of PT alone justifies neurovascular imaging irrespective of a negative carotid ultrasound result [^114Lur98] [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT].

> Wait, let me verify the scope and limitations of a negative carotid duplex before I jump to conclusions: duplex ultrasound primarily evaluates the extracranial carotid arteries and, while accurate for hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis, it does not assess intracranial arteries, dural arteriovenous shunts, venous sinuses, temporal bone variants, or signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, all of which are established causes of pulsatile tinnitus, and in disorders like fibromuscular dysplasia the symptomatic pathology often lies in mid to distal cervical segments beyond standard ultrasound windows or in intracranial/venous structures altogether [^1146Vjhu] [^112pMX4L].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance: the ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2023 explicitly recommends a combination of parenchymal and vascular imaging for patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus and normal otoscopy, specifically either head and neck CTA or a combination of brain/internal auditory canal MRI with MRA and/or MRV of the head, so imaging is indicated and should be comprehensive rather than limited to a "brain-only" study [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4].

> Hold on, I should verify exactly which CTA is preferred because I initially thought a brain CTA alone might suffice; however, that would risk missing cervical causes and venous outflow lesions, and the ACR clarifies that head and neck CTA is the appropriate vascular study in PT without a retrotympanic mass, aligning with the need to evaluate intracranial arteries, venous sinuses, temporal bone, and cervical segments in a single session when possible [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4].

> I will now examine the role of CT angiography/venography as a one-stop modality: multiphasic or single-phase CTA/CTV of the head and neck can detect arterial and venous causes, delineate temporal bone bony dehiscence or high-riding jugular bulb on bone algorithm reconstructions, and has shown high diagnostic yield in PT cohorts with strong lateralization of findings to the symptomatic side, which is advantageous when time and availability matter in clinical practice [^112SmDfQ] [^1155TBgH] [^1175iUqm].

> Let me consider venous-dominant etiologies more carefully, because subtle sinus stenoses or marginal sinus abnormalities may be missed without appropriate vascular coverage; dedicated vascular imaging such as CTA/CTV or MRV can identify these lesions, and endovascular treatment of select venous stenoses has been reported to resolve venous pulsatile tinnitus, underscoring the need for comprehensive venous evaluation in the initial workup when the exam is otherwise normal [^112nv6qv] [^112Fup46].

> But wait, what if we want to avoid radiation or iodinated contrast; MRI-based strategies are a valid alternative: the ACR lists brain/internal auditory canal MRI with MRA and/or MRV for PT without retrotympanic mass, MRI better characterizes parenchyma and certain soft-tissue or retrocochlear processes, and studies report meaningful diagnostic yield for MRI/MRA in PT, though CTA often provides superior temporal bone and small-caliber osseous detail in a single session [^11353XiU] [^112Ycsnb] [^115fh5BT].

> I need to ensure the initial clinical exam is properly integrated because it can change the first test: if otoscopy reveals a retrotympanic vascular mass, the ACR recommends dedicated non-contrast temporal bone CT first to characterize paragangliomas or vascular variants before additional vascular imaging, and regardless of exam findings, AAO-HNSF advises a focused history/physical and prompt comprehensive audiometry to document hearing status which can refine risk and guide subsequent imaging [^1129JRm4] [^1177Q7zu] [^1142XT7n].

> Next, I should review clinical features that modify pretest probability and diagnostic yield: patients with hypertension, obesity, visual symptoms, or ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss have higher rates of identifiable PT pathology, which can influence how aggressively we pursue vascular imaging and ancillary testing such as MRV for suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension or transverse sinus stenosis in the appropriate phenotype [^116XL5h4] [^112Fup46].

> Let me now formulate the imaging plan precisely and sanity-check it against guidelines: the recommended next step is head and neck CT angiography with venous phase coverage when feasible, reconstructed with thin-section temporal bone algorithms, extending from the aortic arch through the skull base to evaluate arterial and venous structures comprehensively; if iodinated contrast is contraindicated or radiation avoidance is preferred, obtain brain and internal auditory canal MRI with contrast plus MRA of the head and neck and MRV of the head as the alternative pathway endorsed by ACR 2023 [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4] [^1155TBgH].

> Hold on, I should verify special caveats: if a retrotympanic mass is seen, start with temporal bone CT before vascular imaging; if noninvasive imaging suggests a high-risk dural arteriovenous fistula or remains equivocal despite strong clinical suspicion, catheter angiography may still be required for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning, but that is reserved after targeted cross-sectional imaging given modern algorithms for PT [^1129JRm4] [^115fh5BT].

> In summary, yes, CT angiography is indicated, but it should be the head and neck CTA (ideally with venous phase or a combined CTA/CTV) rather than a brain-only CTA, because pulsatile tinnitus mandates comprehensive neurovascular imaging beyond the extracranial carotids, and a negative carotid ultrasound does not exclude the many arterial, venous, temporal bone, or intracranial causes visualized by guideline-recommended cross-sectional studies [^11353XiU] [^114Lur98] [^1146Vjhu] [^115fh5BT].

---

After a negative carotid ultrasound in pulsatile tinnitus, the next step is **MRI/MRA of the brain and neck** [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT] to evaluate intracranial and skull base vascular lesions, including dural arteriovenous fistulas, venous sinus stenosis, and paragangliomas [^112uTyZB] [^112Ycsnb]. If MRI/MRA is inconclusive or contraindicated, **CTA of the head and neck** [^112SmDfQ] [^1155TBgH] is an appropriate alternative to assess arterial and venous structures and bony abnormalities [^11353XiU]. CT angiography of the brain alone is not recommended, as it may miss key extracranial or skull base causes [^115fh5BT]. If noninvasive imaging is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consider **digital subtraction angiography** [^116mmKTr].

---

## Rationale for further imaging after negative carotid ultrasound

Carotid ultrasound assesses extracranial carotid disease [^1146Vjhu] but not intracranial arteries, venous sinuses, or skull base structures — common causes of pulsatile tinnitus. Therefore, **further imaging is necessary** to identify these etiologies [^115o4Ahw].

---

## Recommended next imaging modality: MRI/MRA of the brain and neck

MRI/MRA is the **preferred next imaging modality** [^115fh5BT] following a negative carotid ultrasound because it comprehensively evaluates intracranial and extracranial vasculature, venous sinuses, and soft tissues without ionizing radiation. MRI/MRA can identify:

- **Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs)**: Common vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^112uTyZB].

- **Venous sinus stenosis or thrombosis**: Often associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and pulsatile tinnitus [^111evAVQ].

- **Paragangliomas (glomus tumors)**: Vascular tumors frequently causing pulsatile tinnitus [^1129JRm4].

- **Other vascular anomalies**: Including aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and vascular loops [^116eY9Zc].

MRI/MRA has high sensitivity and specificity for these conditions, making it the **most appropriate next step** in the diagnostic evaluation [^112Ycsnb] [^115o4Ahw].

---

## Alternative imaging modality: CTA head and neck

If MRI/MRA is contraindicated or inconclusive, **CTA of the head and neck is an appropriate alternative** [^112SmDfQ] that provides detailed visualization of arterial and venous structures, including:

- **Arterial abnormalities**: Such as aneurysms, dissections, and stenosis.

- **Venous anomalies**: Including venous sinus stenosis, diverticula, and dehiscence [^1155TBgH].

- **Bony abnormalities**: Such as sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence and jugular bulb anomalies [^1175iUqm].

CTA is **particularly useful** for evaluating bony structures and calcified lesions that may be less well visualized on MRI [^1134gHyD].

---

## Limitations of CTA brain alone

CTA of the brain alone is **not recommended** as the next step because it does not adequately evaluate extracranial vessels, venous sinuses, or skull base abnormalities — common causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^115fh5BT]. Therefore, CTA of the head and neck or MRI/MRA of the brain and neck are preferred.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

The American College of Radiology (ACR) **Appropriateness Criteria recommend** obtaining combined parenchymal and vascular imaging — either CTA of the head/head and neck or a combination of head and internal auditory canal MRI, MRA, and/or head MRV — in patients with pulsatile tinnitus and no retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy [^11353XiU] [^115fh5BT]. This approach ensures comprehensive evaluation of potential vascular and nonvascular causes [^115o4Ahw].

---

## Summary of recommended imaging sequence

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRI/MRA brain and neck [^11353XiU] | First-line after negative carotid ultrasound | - No radiation <br/> - High sensitivity for vascular and soft tissue lesions | Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) |
| CTA head and neck [^112SmDfQ] | Alternative if MRI/MRA contraindicated or inconclusive | - Detailed arterial and venous visualization <br/> - Good for bony structures | Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast allergy |
| CTA brain alone | Not recommended | Limited evaluation of extracranial and skull base structures | May miss common causes of pulsatile tinnitus |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

After a negative carotid ultrasound in a patient with pulsatile tinnitus, the next imaging step is **MRI/MRA of the brain and neck** [^11353XiU]. If MRI/MRA is contraindicated or inconclusive, **CTA of the head and neck** is an appropriate alternative [^115fh5BT]. CTA of the brain alone is not recommended, as it may miss common extracranial and skull base causes of pulsatile tinnitus.

### Diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography in the radiological evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus [^112Ycsnb]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging with complimentary magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/MRA) in the radiological evaluation of patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT).

- **Materials and methods**: The present study was retrospectively conducted on 27 patients with pulsatile tinnitus. All patients showed normal otoscopic findings and were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with complimentary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Among them, 9 out of 27 (33.3%) patients were investigated by CT, and 12 out of 27 (44.4%) were evaluated by angiography. All patients' clinical investigation was reviewed to exclude systemic causes of PT.

- **Results**: All hard copies of MRI/MRA studies were evaluated. MRI/MRA detected the underlying etiology of subjective pulsatile tinnitus (PT) in 11 out of 27 patients (40.7%), while 16 out of 27 patients (59.3%) showed normal MRI/MRA examination. The most common cause was dural arteriovenous malformation (AFM) in 4 out of 27 (14.8%) patients. Other findings included high jugular bulb in 2 out of 27 (7.4%) patients, aneurysm of the internal carotid artery in 1 out of 27 (3.7%), aberrant internal carotid artery in 1 out of 27 (3.7%), vertebral artery hypoplasia in 2 out of 27 (7.4%), and glomus tumor in 1 out of 27 (3.7%) patients. The statistical results of the present study indicated that MRI/MRA had 80% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 86% accuracy, 85% positive predictive value (PPV), 83% negative predictive value (NPV), and a 15% error percentage for the diagnosis of PT.

- **Conclusion**: MRI/MRA was an effective radiological imaging method in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus. Magnetic resonance may be considered a first-line diagnostic imaging modality.

### CT arteriography and venography in the evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus with normal otoscopic examination [^112SmDfQ]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Our retrospective study aims to assess the ability of computed tomography arteriography and venography (CT A/V) to detect various findings that suggest a potential cause of pulsatile tinnitus and to examine the association between these findings and the side of pulsatile tinnitus.

A retrospective review of CT arteriography and venography of 32 patients with established pulsatile tinnitus and normal otoscopic examination was performed. The scans were executed using a 64-slice multidetector scanner and were reviewed for findings that are known to cause pulsatile tinnitus.

One or more findings known to cause pulsatile tinnitus were detected on the symptomatic side in 30 patients, on the asymptomatic side in 3 patients. One patient with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus showed a potential cause of symptoms only on one side, and in one patient, no potential cause could be identified. There is a significant association seen between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected (P < 0.001), between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential venous causes detected (P < 0.001), and between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the side of the dominant venous system (P = 0.02).

CT arteriography and venography is a useful tool in detecting many described potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus. A significant association is demonstrated between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected by CT arteriography and venography.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tinnitus [^114Lur98]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend not obtaining head or neck imaging solely for the evaluation of tinnitus unless at least one of the following is present:

- **Tinnitus localizing to one ear**: This may indicate a more focused investigation is necessary.

- **Pulsatile tinnitus**: This type of tinnitus might suggest vascular abnormalities requiring further imaging.

- **Focal neurological abnormalities**: The presence of such symptoms can warrant imaging to explore potential neurological causes.

- **Asymmetric hearing loss**: Imaging may be needed if there is significant asymmetry in hearing abilities between ears.

### Performance of ear canal sound measurements in detecting dural arteriovenous fistulas [^111U9F1M]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) are often referred for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to exclude cranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF). Because DSA is not without risk, the authors studied the sensitivity and specificity of an automated detection algorithm that analyzes external ear canal sound measurements to evaluate the presence of DAVF in PT patients.

Between 2015 and 2021, external ear canal sound measurements of 72 PT patients were collected prospectively at our tertiary tinnitus clinic preceding referral of these patients to the neurosurgical department for counseling about DSA. The measurements were analyzed with an algorithm that objectifies a pulsatile sound as a PT coherence index (PTCI) per frequency band.

Ultimately, DSA was performed in 49 PT patients. DAVF was revealed in 15 patients (31%). PTCI cutoff values of 0.7 (at 250 Hz) and 0.6 (at 1000 Hz) resulted in sensitivities of 100% (78%-100%) and specificities of 62% (44%-78%) and 68% (49%-83%), respectively, for detecting DAVF on DSA.

Analysis of external ear canal sound measurements in PT patients showed 100% sensitivity for detecting DAVF on DSA. This analysis can potentially be used as a screening tool to help clinicians and PT patients decide on the necessity of DSA. Retrospectively, the use of sound measurement in our cohort would have narrowed the indication for DSA to 23 of 49 cases (47%) without missing a DAVF.

### Duplex ultrasound for diagnosing symptomatic carotid stenosis in the extracranial segments [^1146Vjhu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis is a significant cause of stroke and transient ischemic attack. Correctly and rapidly identifying patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is essential for adequate treatment with early cerebral revascularization. Doubts about the diagnostic value regarding the accuracy of duplex ultrasound (DUS) and the possibility of using DUS as the single diagnostic test before carotid revascularization are still debated.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the accuracy of DUS in individuals with symptomatic carotid stenosis verified by either digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

- **Search methods**: We searched CRDTAS, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), ISI Web of Science, HTA, DARE, and LILACS up to 15 February 2021. We handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and other relevant publications and contacted experts in the field to identify additional studies or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies assessing DUS accuracy against an acceptable reference standard (DSA, MRA, or CTA) in symptomatic patients. We considered the classification of carotid stenosis with DUS defined with validated duplex velocity criteria and the NASCET criteria for carotid stenosis measures on DSA, MRA, and CTA. We excluded studies that included less than 70% of symptomatic patients; the time between the index test and the reference standard was longer than four weeks or not described, or that presented no objective criteria to estimate carotid stenosis.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus: a review of 74 patients [^112gZAr4]. Clinical Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of imaging modalities in detecting the underlying pathologies in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

- **Materials and methods**: Seventy-four patients with pulsatile tinnitus were radiologically evaluated. All patients except two were evaluated on a thin-section bone algorithm computed tomography scan covering the temporal bone and skull base. Fourteen patients were assessed with or without contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography; seven patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography; five patients were evaluated using digital subtraction angiography; and twelve patients were studied with Doppler ultrasonography.

- **Results**: The underlying pathology of tinnitus was detected in 50 patients (67.6%), while 24 patients had normal radiologic studies. The most common cause was a high jugular bulbus (21%), followed by atherosclerosis, dehiscent jugular bulbus, aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, dural arteriovenous fistula, aberrant internal carotid artery, jugular diverticulum, and glomus tumor.

- **Conclusion**: It was concluded that radiologic imaging methods are effective in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus.

### Neurosurgical causes of pulsatile tinnitus: Contemporary update [^115yZTgv]. Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

Traditionally in the domain of the otolaryngologist, pulsatile tinnitus (PT) has become increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons. PT may prove to be a harbinger of life-threatening pathology; however, it is often a marker of a more benign process. Irrespectively, the neurosurgeon should be familiar with the many potential etiologies of this unique and challenging patient population. In this review, we discuss the myriad causes of PT, categorized by pulse-phase rhythmicity.

### Venous causes of pulsatile tinnitus: Clinical presentation, clinical and radiographic evaluation, pathogenesis, and endovascular treatments: A literature review [^112Fup46]. Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is an abnormal perception of a sound without external stimulation. Venous pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is a specific form of tinnitus characterized by an objective and often subjective bruit that occurs as a result of localized venous abnormalities. Clinical evaluation relies on sound quality, duration, and precipitating factors. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) are among the most common causes of VPT. Other causes include sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities (SSWAs), jugular vein anomalies (JVAs), and emissary veins anomalies. These anomalies can be detected on magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography/magnetic resonance venography, and high-resolution temporal bone computed tomography.

The pathogenesis behind VPT includes turbulent blood flow as a result of luminal stenosis or abnormal dilation, amplification of internal sound due to temporal bone defects, and abnormal positions of the venous sinus system structures adjacent to the bony structures of the auditive apparatus. Based on these theories, different interventional treatment modalities can be applied to treat the underlying causes. Endovascular treatments have shown high efficacy and safety among those treatments, which include stenting of the lateral sinus stenosis in IIH and TSS, coiling of the SSWA and JVA, and embolization of emissary veins anomalies. Further studies are needed to understand the natural history of these anomalies and the efficacy of treatments for VPT, which — unlike other types of tinnitus — can be cured with proper treatment.

### Diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus: A review of 251 patients [^116XL5h4]. Otology & Neurotology (2022). Low credibility.

To analyze the underlying etiologies, presenting characteristics, and diagnostic workup of patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT), a retrospective review was conducted at a tertiary referral center. The study included all patients who received a diagnostic workup for PT between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2020.

The primary outcome measure was the diagnostic rate of imaging studies. Among 251 patients with PT, the most common etiologies included neoplasms (16%), arteriopathies (14%), venopathies (8.5%), middle/inner ear pathology (9.0%), or idiopathic causes (50%).

- **Patients**: Those with identifiable etiologies of PT more often had hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination. Notably, only 18.5% of patients without these characteristics had an identifiable etiology of PT.

- **Diagnostic studies**: The most commonly ordered diagnostic studies were magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (n = 146), MR angiography (MRA) (n = 105), CT angiography (CTA) (n = 84), computed tomography (CT) without contrast (n = 76), and MR Venogram (MRV) (n = 62). Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast and CT without contrast preferentially identified patients with nonvascular etiologies of PT, while MRA and CTA identified patients with vascular etiologies of PT. MRV did not demonstrate a high diagnostic rate for either type of PT, and no difference in diagnostic rate was found between MR-based or CT-based imaging.

In conclusion, patients who lack a history of hypertension, obesity, vision changes, ipsilateral asymmetric hearing loss, or an abnormal otologic examination are less likely to have identifiable etiologies for PT.

### Aneurysm of a dural sigmoid sinus: A novel vascular cause of pulsatile tinnitus [^114dH4JE]. Annals of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

We report a newly evidenced cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus — the aneurysm of a dural sigmoid sinus. A 33-year-old patient presented with an incapacitating pulsatile tinnitus of 6 months' duration in the left ear. The radiological workup evidenced an aneurysm of the left sigmoid sinus. Selective endovascular coil occlusion of the aneurysm was followed by complete resolution of the tinnitus.

### Diagnostic approach to pulsatile tinnitus: A narrative review [^115o4Ahw]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy.

An underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus can be identified in more than 70% of patients with a thorough evaluation. We advocate categorizing the myriad causes of pulsatile tinnitus into structural, metabolic, and vascular groups. Structural causes of pulsatile tinnitus include neoplasms and temporal bone pathologic abnormalities. Metabolic causes of pulsatile tinnitus include ototoxic medications and systemic causes of high cardiac output. Vascular causes include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. This categorization facilitates a practical evaluation, referral, and treatment pattern.

Categorizing the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus ensures that dangerous causes of pulsatile tinnitus are not missed and that patients receive the appropriate care from the proper specialist when needed.

### Metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as unilateral pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^116HJzrF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare symptom that may indicate life-threatening pathology in the absence of other symptoms or signs. Although pulsatile tinnitus often suggests a vascular cause, metastatic disease can also present in this manner. Clinicians should adopt a specific diagnostic algorithm for pulsatile tinnitus and always consider the possibility of metastatic disease. A history of malignant disease and new cranial nerve palsies should raise clinical suspicion for skull base metastases.

We describe the case of a 63-year-old woman presenting with unilateral subjective pulsatile tinnitus and a middle ear mass visible on otoscopy. Her background included the diagnosis of idiopathic unilateral vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsies 4 years prior, with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Repeat MRI and computed tomography imaging were consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. This case raises important questions about imaging protocols and the role of serial scanning in patients at high risk of metastatic disease.

### Recent developments in the understanding and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^112Uvwa1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with carotid and/or vertebral FMD can present with diverse symptoms ranging from headache, neck pain, and pulsatile tinnitus to arterial dissection, transient ischemic attack, or stroke, and, less commonly, subarachnoid hemorrhage. A significant number of patients in the US Registry sustained a neurological event: 13.4% experienced a hemispheric transient ischemic attack, 12.1% suffered a cervical artery dissection, and 9.8% had a stroke. The combined frequency of carotid, vertebral, cerebral, and basilar artery aneurysms was approximately 7%; however, the frequency of subarachnoid hemorrhage was very low at 1.1%. Pulsatile tinnitus, a pulsatile swooshing noise in the ear, has recently been recognized as a highly prevalent manifestation of this disease, reported as a presenting symptom in 32% of patients in the US Registry. Pulsatile tinnitus is associated with cerebrovascular involvement, cervical artery dissection, and multivessel FMD. For many patients, this is a highly annoying symptom that can impair quality of life and contribute to the morbidity of this disease.

There are no consistent diagnostic physical examination findings in FMD. In some patients, cervical, abdominal, or femoral bruit may be the only sign present. However, the presence of a bruit over the affected artery is not a sensitive indicator of disease. In the US Registry, 30.5% of registrants presented with a cervical bruit, 17.5% with an epigastric bruit, and 6.1% with a flank bruit. The sensitivity of a cervical bruit for the diagnosis of extracranial carotid and/or vertebral FMD was only 45%.

### Detecting causes of pulsatile tinnitus on CT arteriography-venography: A pictorial review [^1155TBgH]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can be a mild or debilitating symptom. Following clinical examination and otoscopy, when the underlying etiology is not apparent, radiological imaging can be used to evaluate further. CT arteriography-venography (CT A-V) of the head and neck has recently been introduced as a single 'one catch' modality for identifying the many causes of PT, including those which are treatable and potentially serious, while also providing reassurance through negative studies or studies with benign findings. CT A-V is performed as a single phase study allowing both arterial and venous assessment, hence limiting radiation exposure. Additional multiplanar reformats and bone reconstructions are desirable.

Understanding the limitations of CT A-V is also required, with an awareness of the scenarios where other imaging modalities should be considered. The causes of PT can be divided into systemic and non-systemic categories. Non-systemic etiologies in the head and neck should be carefully reviewed on CT A-V and include a variety of vascular causes such as arteriovenous malformations/fistulas, venous or arterial etiologies, and non-vascular causes like tumors and bony dysplasias. Venous causes (dominant, aberrant, stenosed or thrombosed venous vessels) are more common than arterial etiologies, which include aberrant or stenosed internal carotid artery, aneurysms or a persistent stapedial artery. Glomus tumors that are not visible on otoscopy and osseous pathologies such as bony dehiscence and otospongiosis should also be excluded.

Careful assessment of all the potential vascular and non-vascular causes is essential.

### Clinical practice guideline: Tinnitus [^1177Q7zu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, particularly concerning history and physical examination, the AAO-HNSF 2014 guidelines recommend eliciting a targeted history and conducting a focused physical examination in the initial evaluation of patients with presumed primary tinnitus. This approach aims to identify conditions that, if promptly recognized and managed, may alleviate tinnitus.

### ESR essentials: diagnostic strategies in tinnitus-practice recommendations by the European Society of Head and Neck Radiology [^115fh5BT]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Tinnitus is common, with approximately one-quarter of the elderly population experiencing chronic tinnitus. While non-pulsatile tinnitus usually has no structural cause, pulsatile tinnitus is more likely to have an identifiable aetiology, and imaging plays a key role in the search for treatable and life-threatening causes. Since the characteristics of the tinnitus guide the diagnostic strategy, a detailed clinical assessment should always be performed before imaging is considered.

In the setting of non-pulsatile tinnitus, imaging with MRI should only be performed if it is unilateral or asymmetric, or when it is associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or asymmetric hearing loss. In contrast, imaging investigation is always required in the presence of pulsatile tinnitus. Whilst there are specific clinical features in which temporal bone CT will be the initial imaging strategy for pulsatile tinnitus (e.g. retrotympanic mass or conductive hearing loss), most patients will require either CT or MRI with arterial and venous imaging.

The clinical categorization of pulsatile tinnitus as "arterial" or "venous" may guide the radiological search and help understand the significance of certain imaging findings (e.g. venous variants). Significant pathology, such as dural arteriovenous malformation, must be excluded in the context of objective pulsatile tinnitus and may require additional cross-sectional imaging. Conventional angiography is now rarely indicated.

- **Key points**: In patients with unilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus, MRI should be performed to rule out retrocochlear disease.

### The use of contrast enhanced ultrasound in carotid arterial disease [^115MbZEr]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Traditionally, stroke risk stratification has centered on the degree of internal carotid artery stenosis and the presence of focal neurological symptoms. However, the degree of stenosis alone is a relatively poor predictor of future stroke in asymptomatic patients, with the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial highlighting the need to identify a subgroup of asymptomatic individuals who may benefit from intervention. Attempting to define this subgroup has inspired imaging research to identify, in vivo, high-risk plaques.

In addition to pre-operative risk stratification of carotid stenosis, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) may be employed in monitoring response to plaque-stabilizing therapies. Unlike most contrast agents used in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, microbubbles used in CEUS remain within the vascular space and can hence be utilized to study vasculature. Apart from improving carotid structural scans, CEUS has the potential to provide additional information on plaque characteristics. Furthermore, by targeting microbubbles to specific ligands expressed on vascular endothelium, CEUS may have the ability to probe plaque biology.

This review describes the carotid ultrasound examination and the need to improve it, the rationale for imaging neovascularization, the use of CEUS to image neovascularization, the role of microbubbles in enhancing structural imaging of plaques, potential problems with CEUS, and future directions.

### Arteriovenous malformation in the parotid region presenting as pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^111Wi7WV]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a unique symptom in the general population and often leads patients to seek medical attention.

- **Methods and results**: We report a patient with an arteriovenous malformation of the superficial temporal artery in the parotid region, causing pulsatile tinnitus and insomnia. Magnetic resonance angiography and carotid angiography were useful tools for detecting this vascular malformation. Successful treatment of this lesion was achieved through endovascular embolization.

- **Conclusion**: This case illustrates that a thorough diagnostic work-up with a high index of suspicion and the proper treatment option is rewarding when dealing with such a rare disease.

### Imaging in pulsatile tinnitus [^1175iUqm]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Tinnitus may be continuous or pulsatile. Vascular lesions are the most frequent radiologically demonstrable cause of pulsatile tinnitus. These include congenital vascular anomalies, which may be arterial or venous, vascular tumors, and a variety of acquired vasculopathies. The choice of imaging depends on the clinical findings. If a mass is present at otoscopy, thin-section computed tomography (CT) is indicated. In the otoscopically normal patient, there is a range of possible imaging approaches; however, combined CT angiography and venography is particularly useful.

### Simple things are not simple: Pulsatile tinnitus due to tortuous occipital artery [^113f2CKq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is often a chronic and debilitating condition with a typically vascular origin. We describe a case of pulsatile tinnitus caused by an aberrant branch of the external carotid artery (ECA), which has not been reported previously.

- **Method**: A 67-year-old female presented with chronic unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, which could be completely controlled with direct pressure on a small tortuous superficial branch behind her left ear. Doppler imaging confirmed this to be an unusually tortuous occipital branch of the ECA. Under local anesthesia, this vessel was identified with intraoperative Doppler and ligated.

- **Result**: The patient experienced complete resolution of tinnitus immediately, with consistent results 3 months postoperatively.

- **Conclusions**: Pulsatile tinnitus due to aberrances in the occipital ECA branch is rare, and in this case, was successfully treated with minor surgery.

### Dying art of a history and physical: Pulsatile tinnitus [^1112D4ci]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Modern medicine often leaves the history and physical by the wayside. Physicians instead skip directly to diagnostic modalities like MRI and angiography. In this case report, we discuss a patient who presented with migraine symptoms. Auscultation revealed signs of pulsatile tinnitus. Further imaging concluded that it was secondary to a type I dural arteriovenous fistula. Thanks to a proper and thorough history and physical, the patient was streamlined into an accurate and efficient work-up, leading to symptomatic relief and quality of life improvement. Imaging is a powerful adjunctive technique in modern medicine, but physicians must not rely solely on machines to diagnose their patients. If this trend continues, it will have a tremendous negative impact on the cost and calibre of healthcare. Our hope is that this case will spread awareness in the medical community, urging physicians to use the lost art of a history and physical.

### Does the location of a vascular loop in the cerebellopontine angle explain pulsatile and non-pulsatile tinnitus [^116eY9Zc]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose was to investigate patients with unexplained pulsatile and non-pulsatile tinnitus using MR imaging of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) and to correlate the clinical subtype of tinnitus with the location of a blood vessel (in the internal auditory canal or at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve). Clinical presentation of tinnitus and perceptive hearing loss were correlated.

In 47 patients with unexplained tinnitus, an MR examination of the CPA was performed. Virtual endoscopy reconstructions were obtained using a 3D axial thin-section high-resolution heavily T2-weighted gradient echo constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) dataset. High-resolution T2-weighted CISS images showed a significantly higher number of vascular loops in the internal auditory canal in patients with arterial pulsatile tinnitus compared to patients with non-pulsatile tinnitus (P < 0.00001).

Virtual endoscopy images were used to investigate vascular contacts at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve in patients with low pitch and high pitch non-pulsatile tinnitus. A significantly different distribution of the vascular contacts (P = 0.0320) was found. Furthermore, a correlation between the clinical presentation of non-pulsatile tinnitus (high pitch and low pitch) and the perceptive hearing loss was found (P = 0.0235).

High-resolution heavily T2-weighted CISS images and virtual endoscopy of the CPA can be used to evaluate whether a vascular contact is present in the internal auditory canal or at the cisternal part of the VIIIth cranial nerve and whether the location of a vascular loop correlates with clinical symptoms.

### Brain herniation (encephalocele) into arachnoid granulations: Prevalence and association with pulsatile tinnitus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1162RpiC]. Neuroradiology (2022). Low credibility.

In the setting of pulsatile tinnitus (PT), brain herniation into arachnoid granulations (BHAG) is important to distinguish from other etiologies that result in stenosis or focal defect of the dural venous sinuses to appropriately guide patient management and treatment. Differential considerations for BHAG include simple arachnoid granulation, thrombus, tumor, and vascular anomaly such as dural arteriovenous fistula. It is important to note that, to our knowledge, BHAG have never been reported into a thrombosed sinus. Identifying a BHAG can help reassure that a thrombus is not present in that section of the vein, indicating that the stenotic lesion is an arachnoid granulation, thus obviating the need for anticoagulation in these patients.

Understanding the relationship of BHAG with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in patients with PT is of utmost clinical interest, as IIH is a serious and debilitating condition associated with PT. Specifically, the role of imaging to identify venous anatomy variants in patients with both PT and IIH can hold significant value in diagnosing these conditions. Prior work has demonstrated that venous sinus stenosis is the most sensitive MR imaging finding in patients with IIH, occurring in 94%. This reported sensitivity is higher than previous work, possibly due to continued improvements in MRI technique, which will lead to increased recognition and characterization of BHAG. While not all patients with IIH will present with PT, prior studies have demonstrated that sigmoid sinus wall dehiscence can be correlated with PT in IIH patients. Our results build upon these prior studies and suggest that the presence of BHAG may increase the specificity of diagnosis.

### Objectification and differential diagnosis of vascular pulsatile tinnitus by transcanal sound recording and spectrotemporal analysis: A preliminary study [^1177ALky]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Although frequently classified as "objective tinnitus", in most cases, vascular pulsatile tinnitus (VPT) is not equal to objective tinnitus because it is not easy to objectively document VPT. The present study was conducted to develop a novel transcanal sound recording and spectrotemporal analysis method for the objective and differential diagnosis of VPT.

The study utilized a case series with a control group at a tertiary referral center. Patients included six VPT subjects with radiological abnormalities and six normal controls. The method was tested based on recordings obtained from the ipsilateral external auditory canal (EAC) using an insert microphone with the subject's head in four different positions. The recorded signals were first analyzed in the time domain, and short-time Fourier transform was performed to analyze the data in the time-frequency domain.

From the temporal analysis, the ear canal signals recorded from the VPT subjects exhibited large peak amplitudes and periodic structures, whereas the signals recorded from the control subjects had smaller peak amplitudes and weaker periodicity. The spectrotemporal analysis, represented by two-dimensional spectrograms and three-dimensional waterfall diagrams, showed that all of the VPT subjects demonstrated pulse-synchronous acoustic characteristics representative of their respective presumptive vascular pathologies, whereas the control subjects did not display such characteristics.

The present diagnostic approach may provide additional information regarding the origin and characteristics of VPT.

### Pseudo-low frequency hearing loss and its improvement after treatment may be objective signs of significant vascular pathology in patients with pulsatile tinnitus [^112Bbw9g]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

In patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT), physical examination, such as auscultation with head position change or digital compression over the ipsilateral jugular vein, provides physicians with important information. However, the objective diagnosis of PT is sometimes limited for several reasons. Firstly, an audible bruit is absent on auscultation in some patients. Secondly, abnormal vascular structures found during radiologic evaluations are not always pathognomonic, as they can also be found in asymptomatic subjects. Lastly, although an objective diagnostic tool using transcanal sound recording has recently been introduced, special equipment is needed.

Recent studies have reported ipsilateral low-frequency hearing loss (LFHL) on pure-tone audiometry (PTA) in some patients with PT and its recovery after successful management. This prompted us to conduct a retrospective observational study on the characteristics of the audiometric profile, its association with radiologic findings, and pre- and post-treatment changes in low-frequency hearing thresholds in PT patients. We tested two hypotheses: PT patients with marked vascular pathologies located close to the cochlea may show ipsilateral pseudo-LFHL (PLFHL) due to the masking effects of the PT itself, and their PLFHL may disappear if their vascular pathology is successfully managed by surgical or endovascular intervention.

- **Study design**: Retrospective case review.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: A total of 85 PT subjects who underwent both audiologic and radiologic examinations.

### Carotid endarterectomy relieves pulsatile tinnitus associated with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis [^116ohFkj]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare and often disabling condition that sometimes occurs in patients with severe atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. It is uncertain whether carotid endarterectomy (CEA) relieves pulsatile tinnitus in these patients.

- **Design, materials and methods**: This is a retrospective study of 14 patients with pulsatile tinnitus who underwent CEA. Demographic and clinical features, along with pre-operative duplex results, were recorded. The operative results in this group were assessed.

- **Results**: CEA relieved symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus in 10 out of 14 cases (70%). Of the 10 patients that had lateralisable tinnitus and underwent ipsilateral surgery, 9 (90%) reported symptomatic improvement.

- **Conclusions**: CEA is effective in improving pulsatile tinnitus in patients with unilateral symptoms and severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis.

### Spontaneous bilateral dural arteriovenous fistulas with pulsatile tinnitus [^115mVLPs]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus with normal otoscopic findings often presents a diagnostic challenge to otolaryngologists and can be attributed to serious vascular malformations such as dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs). Spontaneous DAVFs are relatively rare. A 65-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset subjective/objective pulsatile tinnitus on the right side that had persisted for 2 months. Angiography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed DAVF formation. Stereotactic radiosurgery was performed, and total remission of the DAVFs was achieved.

### Cerebral venous stenting for pulsatile tinnitus after unsuccessful jugular ligation: Case report and literature review [^116h9ueA]. Ear, Nose & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus constitutes up to 10% of all tinnitus cases. Cerebral venous stenosis is a known etiology of pulsatile tinnitus. Treatment of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to venous stenosis with venous stenting has been reported in the literature but is not performed routinely. We would like to report a case of chronic pulsatile tinnitus treated with a venous stent in a patient who previously underwent jugular vein ligation.

### CT angiography of the carotid arteries in trauma to the neck [^114dZJMS]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Serious vascular injuries to the neck may be asymptomatic or masked by other life-threatening conditions. Angiography, the "gold standard" vascular imaging modality, is an invasive procedure. Moreover, it is time-consuming and thus may delay a needed vascular intervention. The results of screening angiography are negative in more than 80% of cases. Therefore, other less invasive and faster screening tests, such as Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography, have been tested. This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the use of CT angiography (CTA) in suspected vascular injuries of the neck.

From 1995 to 1998, 16 patients with suspected traumatic carotid artery injury underwent CTA. Twelve of these patients had penetrating injuries and four had blunt injuries to the neck. CTAs were obtained using an Elscint Twin Flash Spiral Scanner, while MIP reconstructions were carried out on an Omnipro, Elscint (Indy, Silicon Graphics) workstation and interpreted by a radiologist.

All the CTAs were diagnostic. Positive findings included one complete tear of the right common carotid artery (confirmed by surgery) due to a penetrating injury and one bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis after blunt injury to the neck. In addition, three patients with multiple trauma were operated on due to proximity only or questionable neurological findings. Surgical exploration confirmed the negative findings seen on CTA.

CT angiography of the carotid arteries in cervical trauma may be used as an accurate and decisive tool for necessary surgical intervention.

### Pulsatile tinnitus due to stenosis of the marginal sinus: Diagnosis and endovascular treatment [^112nv6qv]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). High credibility.

Venous pulsatile tinnitus is a disabling condition mainly caused by a stenosis of the lateral sinus. Here, we aimed to report a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, stenosis of the marginal sinus.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed patients with isolated venous pulsatile tinnitus, for which the suspected cause was a stenosis of the marginal sinus, treated or not, between January 2017 and December 2020. Patient charts and imaging were systematically reviewed. All patients underwent noncontrast temporal bone CT and MR imaging.

- **Results**: Eight patients (7 women; median age, 36 years) were included. Six patients (75%) were overweight, and 1 patient had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. All patients presented with a typical venous pulsatile tinnitus. The stenosis of the marginal sinus was detected using oblique reconstructions on postcontrast 3D MR imaging. There was no other pathologic finding except ipsilateral stenosis of the lateral sinus in 3 patients. Four patients underwent endovascular therapy with placement of a stent in the marginal sinus, leading to complete resolution of the pulsatile tinnitus for all of them. No complication occurred. Of note, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension also regressed after stent placement in that patient.

- **Conclusions**: Marginal sinus stenosis is a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, which can be easily detected on MR imaging. Marginal sinus stent placement is safe and efficient. We hypothesized that the marginal sinus stenosis pathophysiology is similar to that of the lateral sinus.

### Is there a relationship between subjective pulsatile tinnitus and petrous bone pneumatization [^112SXdtx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between subjective pulsatile tinnitus and petrous bone pneumatization. Twenty-five patients admitted between January 2012 and March 2012 were assessed. The control group data were obtained by assessment of petrous bone images of 25 cases in which paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) was performed because of chronic sinusitis and in which no ear pathology was present. Temporal bone CT images of patients with subjective pulsatile tinnitus were compared with those of patients with no ear complaints. The presence of petrous bone pneumatization was evaluated by CT.

Subjective pulsatile tinnitus complaints were present for 32 of 50 ears. Pneumatization was detected in the petrous bone of 22 (68.8%) of 32 ears with subjective pulsatile tinnitus. In the control group, 25 patients (50 ears) with no ear complaints were assessed. Petrous bone pneumatization was detected in 12 (24%) of 50 ears comprising the control group. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.000 < 0.001). Petrous bone pneumatization might be the cause of the subjective pulsatile tinnitus.

### Bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by bilateral dilated mastoid emissary vein [^1172uczm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmic type of tinnitus most often caused by vascular disorders, presenting synchronously with the patient's heartbeat. A dilated mastoid emissary vein can cause pulsatile tinnitus. Here, we report the first case of bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by dilated bilateral mastoid emissary veins. The patient experienced bilateral pulsatile tinnitus for two years, with temporary disappearance when the bilateral mastoid processes were compressed. Temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scans revealed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary canals. Cranial magnetic resonance venograms (MRV) showed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary veins. We explained the surgical risks to the patient. As the patient could tolerate the tinnitus and did not have a hemangioma or tumor, he opted not to undergo surgery.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^117Jdchw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that has a variable presentation, including pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The frequency and characteristics of PT in FMD are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PT in FMD and compare characteristics between patients with and without PT.

- **Methods and results**: Data were queried from the US Registry for FMD from 2009 to 2020. The primary outcomes were the frequency of PT among the FMD population and the prevalence of baseline characteristics, signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement in patients with and without PT. Of 2613 patients with FMD who were included in the analysis, 972 (37.2%) reported PT. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to explore factors associated with PT. Compared with those without PT, patients with PT were more likely to have involvement of the extracranial carotid artery (90.0% versus 78.6%; odds ratio, 1.49; P = 0.005) and to have a higher prevalence of other neurovascular signs/symptoms, including headache (82.5% versus 62.7%; odds ratio, 1.82; P < 0.001), dizziness (44.9% versus 22.9%; odds ratio, 2.01; P < 0.001), and cervical bruit (37.5% versus 15.8%; odds ratio, 2.73; P < 0.001) compared with those without PT.

- **Conclusions**: PT is common among patients with FMD. Patients with FMD who present with PT have higher rates of neurovascular signs/symptoms, cervical bruit, and involvement of the extracranial carotid arteries. The coexistence of the two conditions should be recognized, and providers who evaluate patients with FMD should be aware of these associations.

### Dying art of a history and physical: Pulsatile tinnitus [^112Xtja1]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

This case is a prime example of the importance of using physical diagnosis before any adjunctive techniques. The patient had seen several doctors before, and none could determine her condition. However, after auscultating her right retroaural region, the bruit was extremely distinct and pathognomonic for pulsatile tinnitus, most likely secondary to some sort of anatomical vascular issue. It was so clear, in fact, that even a medical student could discern something was amiss. This further emphasizes the importance of utilizing basic techniques such as auscultation, palpation, and others. After performing a thorough physical exam, we reasoned that additional techniques such as MRI, MRA, and MRV were necessary to further the diagnosis so the patient could receive the best care possible.

Before metals and electronics, a physician's diagnosis was based solely on history and what they could feel with their hands. According to Roguin, centuries later, the stethoscope was invented by Laënnec in 1816. Since then, it has become one of the hallmark symbols of medicine. Every physician is taught to use this instrument and, as a result, needs to actually examine the patient themselves. Since then, there has been an explosion of technological development in the field of medicine. All of it is extremely beneficial, but it has driven physicians to rely more on technology rather than their own senses.

For instance, the MRI has rapidly risen to become a staple imaging and diagnostic technique in many fields of medicine.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^112pMX4L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic arterial disease that can affect most arteries, resulting in stenoses, aneurysms, dissection, or arterial tortuosity. Clinical manifestations are variable and include several neurologic manifestations. Tinnitus is the conscious perception of auditory sensation in the absence of corresponding external stimuli and has been described in 10% to 15% of the general population. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a swooshing or whooshing sound synchronous with the heartbeat. While PT has been described in patients with FMD, reports have been limited.

The aims of this study were to report the frequency of PT in patients enrolled in the US Registry for FMD and to compare differences in characteristics between patients with and without PT within the US Registry.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia [^112ncebs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Anatomically, extracranial carotid artery involvement was more common among patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) than those without (90.0% versus 78.6%; P < 0.05). Involvement of more than one vascular bed was also more prevalent (62.7% versus 58.3%; P = 0.029) among patients with PT.

Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated findings similar to the univariate analysis. There was an association between PT and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) involving the extracranial carotid artery (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; P = 0.005) but not the vertebral artery (OR, 0.94; P = 0.56). Patients with PT were more likely to be women (OR, 3.00; P = 0.002), younger at the age of diagnosis (OR, 1.12 for each 10‐year decrease in age; P = 0.011), have a history of headaches (OR, 1.82; P < 0.001), present with neck pain (OR, 1.64; P < 0.001) and dizziness (OR, 2.01; P < 0.001), and have a cervical bruit (OR, 2.73; P < 0.001).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^1129JRm4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a temporal bone CT for patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus with a suspected retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy. This evaluation seeks to identify lesions such as glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulotympanicum, and vascular variants like the aberrant internal carotid artery, dehiscent jugular foramen, and persistent stapedial artery.

- **Vascular imaging**: Consider obtaining dedicated vascular imaging with head and neck CTA and head CTV. Thin-section bony reconstructions from the raw data can show bony details of the temporal bone and characterize most retrotympanic lesions.

### Toward a diagnostic imaging algorithm for undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus [^116mmKTr]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Low credibility.

Decisions around the diagnostic evaluation for pulsatile tinnitus (PT) remain challenging. We describe the usage patterns and diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities and propose an evidence-based diagnostic approach for undifferentiated PT.

- **Study design**: Retrospective.

- **Setting**: Single otology/neurotology clinic.

- **Subjects**: Patients with PT presenting between 2009 and 2020.

- **Main outcome measures**: Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic yield, and diagnostic accuracy.

A total of 315 subjects met inclusion criteria (74% female, mean ± SD age = 52 ± 17 years). Subjects were divided into four cohorts based on exam findings: normal (n = 229), venous cohort (n = 34), arterial cohort (n = 16), and outer/middle ear pathology cohort (n = 40). In total, 53% of patients received a nonidiopathic diagnosis for PT. The most common identifiable cause was sigmoid sinus dehiscence (78%) in the venous cohort, carotid stenosis (36%) in the arterial cohort, and glomus tumor (56%) in the outer/middle ear pathology cohort. There was a higher diagnostic rate among patients with positive exam findings compared to those with unrevealing exams (p = 0.04). Imaging studies with the highest diagnostic yield were computed tomography (CT) venography (44%), formal angiography (42%), and magnetic resonance venography (40%). Studies with the highest specificity were formal angiography (0.82), CT angiography (0.67), and CT venography (0.67).

Conclusions suggest that reaching a diagnosis in patients with PT requires a systematic approach, taking into account both clinical findings and imaging interpretations. A diagnostic algorithm is proposed.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111p3Hcg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The cause of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) remains unclear. PT can be caused by vascular disorders, including stenosis or tortuosity of the carotid artery, intraluminal webs resulting in turbulent flow, and other vascular abnormalities, such as aneurysms, dissections, or arteriovenous fistulas, which may be present in patients with FMD. Another potential contributor to PT in patients with FMD is the presence of an S‐curve, or extreme arterial tortuosity, of the internal carotid artery, resulting in turbulent blood flow and PT. A review of 116 patients with FMD found that 32% had an S‐curve present in the internal carotid artery.

We are unable to comment on the prevalence of S‐curve presence in this study, as these data are not collected by the US Registry. Notably, carotid involvement in FMD is typically in the mid or distal artery, close to the ear, which may be a contributing factor. From non‐FMD literature, other factors associated with PT include nonvascular disorders such as intracranial tumors, intracranial hypertension, and sarcoidosis. However, in many cases of PT, there is no clear cause. In a single‐center review of 84 patients with PT, 68% were found to have an underlying etiology, usually vascular in nature; however, an underlying etiology could not be identified in the remaining 32% of patients. Among patients with PT in this study, 22.9% were found to have a carotid or vertebral dissection, 8.8% had a carotid or vertebral aneurysm, and 37.5% had a cervical bruit, a manifestation of turbulence.

### Improving diagnostic yield in patients with pulsatile tinnitus: A ten-year analysis [^1165KkKM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). High credibility.

To determine the yield of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT), this study conducted a retrospective chart review from 2013 to 2023. Charts were evaluated for demographic data (age, sex, BMI), side of PT (or bilateral), specialty clinic of initial evaluation, coexistent symptoms in addition to PT, and final diagnosis (or non-diagnosis). Clinical, audiometric, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected, and putative chart diagnoses were reviewed by the authors and deemed likely or unlikely as the source of the patient's PT. Those labeled "unlikely" were grouped in the "idiopathic" cohort. The diagnostic algorithm is presented in detail.

Two hundred and ninety patients were included for analysis. The overall diagnostic yield was 90.7% for all patients and 95.6% for those who completed the recommended workup, marking a substantial improvement over published rates. Twenty-nine etiologies were identified, with the most common being idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Twenty-one diagnoses comprised no more than 5% of patients. Seventy-three patients (25.2%) had more than one pathology as a potential source for their PT.

The study concludes that PT can present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. However, the findings reveal that a thorough evaluation, based on obtaining a comprehensive history, performing a physical examination, and utilizing properly directed imaging studies and blood testing, can achieve a high diagnostic yield.

### An innovative technique for detecting the caudal end of occluded inferior petrosal sinus in cavernous arteriovenous fistula using intravascular ultrasonography — technical note [^113QU9V1]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

The patient was a 73-year-old woman who developed pulsatile tinnitus and diplopia three months before admission. Two months later, although the tinnitus had disappeared, she developed a pulsatile headache. Diagnostic angiography revealed bilateral CS d-AVF, supplied by the dural branches of the bilateral external and internal carotid arteries. Shunt blood flow mainly drained through bilateral superficial middle cerebral veins (SMCVs) in a retrograde pattern. Bilateral IPSs and superior orbital veins (SOVs) could not be visualized angiographically.

- **Diagnostic angiography in case 1**: Bilateral (a right, b left) common carotid angiography demonstrates CS d-AVF involving bilateral CSs. Shunt blood flow mainly drains to bilateral SMCVs in a retrograde pattern. Bilateral IPSs are not angiographically visualized.

TVE through the left IPS was performed under general anesthesia in accordance with the protocol described above. In this case, the tip of the IVUS catheter could not pass through the JB due to its tortuosity. Almost the entire rostral half of the JV was investigated with IVUS, and the angiographically invisible IPS was visualized, identifying a low-set caudal end of the IPS. ChromaFlo® imagery could also detect the angiographically undetectable blood flow in the IPS. Under this guidance, we were able to easily navigate the microcatheter to the IPS and finally to the CS. Initially, we aimed to occlude the shunt point selectively, but this proved to be difficult. We therefore performed sinus packing, and the shunt was then addressed.

### MRI and ultrasonographic imaging of a patient with carotidynia [^117G6YSJ]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

A patient presented with a painful, pulsating nodosity with marked tenderness on the right side of her neck. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibited pathological signal changes in the perivascular tissue of the carotid bifurcation area and around the external carotid artery. Similarly, Doppler sonography revealed an echo-poor wall change with outward bulging and slight narrowing of the affected vessel lumen. The clinical symptoms and our findings led to the diagnosis of carotidynia. We proposed that cervical MRI and Doppler sonography could be used for diagnosing carotidynia.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia [^111dogWF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

This study has limitations. A comparison could not be offered with patients who have pulsatile tinnitus (PT) but do not have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). As the study uses data from the US Registry for FMD, the reported data are observational and descriptive. Data are obtained via a standardized data collection form to maintain uniformity between registry sites; thus, open-ended questions are not used. The data collection form does not capture information about the frequency of PT as a self-reported symptom within the registry. Unfortunately, information on tortuosity of cerebrovascular arteries, a potential contributor to PT, was not available. Lastly, there are limited longitudinal data within the registry, such as the effect of medical therapy for PT and rates of resolution of PT. Despite these limitations, this study represents the largest dataset on FMD and PT.

### Venous outflow and otosclerosis: An unusual case of pulsatile tinnitus [^117VrNTg]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Low credibility.

We report the resolution of right-sided pulsatile tinnitus in a 44-year-old male who underwent a stapedectomy for fenestral otosclerosis. Initial workup revealed a mixed hearing loss and absent stapedial reflexes, consistent with ossicular fixation. CT angiography demonstrated near-complete stenosis of the left-sided transverse and sigmoid sinuses and dominant contralateral venous outflow. We hypothesized that the dominant right cerebral venous outflow tract created turbulent flow that was conducted to the cochlea. A successful stapedectomy was performed, and the pulsatile tinnitus resolved. This case report provides evidence that the sound of turbulent blood flow can be conducted through bone and highlights an instance where the perception of vascular tinnitus was eliminated with stapedectomy.

### Ct arteriography and venography in pulsatile tinnitus: preliminary results [^1134gHyD]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT), a common disorder, can be caused by a variety of otologic and vascular lesions. Various imaging modalities, including CT, MR imaging and angiography, and conventional angiography, have been used in the assessment of PT. Ideally, a single imaging study to evaluate for the largest variety of etiologies would be optimal. In our study, we examine the potential for CT arteriography and venography (CTA/V) in the evaluation of PT.

- **Methods**: Sixteen patients with PT were prospectively evaluated by an otolaryngologist, had a normal otologic examination, and were referred for a CTA/V. All examinations were performed on a 16-section multidetector CT. The carotid bifurcations, internal carotid artery course, transverse and sigmoid sinuses, jugular foramen, internal jugular vein, sella turcica, and temporal bones were evaluated.

- **Results**: Seven of the 16 patients had lesions on CTA/V that could account for their PT. Examples of pathologic conditions in the series included a significantly dominant venous system, a venous diverticulum with stricture, and a transverse sinus stenosis.

- **Conclusions**: Preliminary findings indicate that CTA/V can be a valuable imaging tool in the assessment of PT. With this technique, arterial, venous, middle, and inner ear causes of PT can be excluded.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: A review of the literature and an unusual case of iatrogenic pneumocephalus causing pulsatile tinnitus [^113NHWjT]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is frequently attributed to identifiable and treatable causes, in contrast to the more common subjective non-pulsatile tinnitus. It usually originates from vascular structures as a result of either increased blood flow or lumen stenosis; atherosclerotic carotid or subclavian artery disease; arterial, venous, or arteriovenous malformations; fistulas; dissection; and paragangliomas. Other causes have also been reported, often with unclear pathophysiology.

- **Objective**: The aim of this paper is to present a case of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to iatrogenic pneumocephalus and to review the literature on pulsatile tinnitus.

- **Subject**: A 48-year-old white woman had a roaring, very disturbing pulsatile tinnitus after the removal of a cerebellar lobe meningioma. When the patient experienced the symptom of tinnitus, a pulsatile movement of the tympanic membrane could be clearly seen, and this was synchronous with the patient's heartbeat. Computed tomography revealed an epidural pneumocephalus in the left posterior fossa communicating freely with the air cell system of the left mastoid cavity without any sign of residual tumor. A simple mastoidectomy was performed; the whole air cell system was removed, and the mastoid cavity was filled with abdominal fat. After the operation, the pulsatile tinnitus ceased completely and the pneumocephalus disappeared gradually. The patient is free of symptoms 11 months after surgery.

Conclusion: Otologists, neurosurgeons, and skull base surgeons should be aware of this surgical complication and be careful to identify potential issues during surgery.

### Pulsatile tinnitus from reversal of flow in an aberrant occipital artery: Resolved after carotid artery stenting [^112rqdwe]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stent placement, performed for the correction of an asymptomatic, severe stenosis, leads to the resolution of persistent and troublesome pulsatile tinnitus. Tinnitus has been reported as a consequence of severe carotid stenoses on previous occasions. This case highlights how an aberrant occipital artery originating above a carotid artery stenosis can result in flow reversal and be a mechanism by which tinnitus may develop.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a first symptom of essential thrombocythemia [^116mYCXo]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of sound inside the head and is a common symptom encountered daily by otorhinolaryngologists. Pulsatile tinnitus sufferers hear rhythmical noise at the same rate as a heartbeat and can present a diagnostic challenge. In this report, we present a 32-year-old patient with pulsatile tinnitus that led to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The symptom of pulsatile tinnitus allowed an early diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia and a more favorable prognosis. The case demonstrates the importance of blood tests for all patients who present with pulsatile tinnitus of unknown origin.

### Pathology of the carotid space [^116o2SNj]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The complex anatomy of the carotid space within a small confined area is unique to the head and neck and allows for a vast array of pathology. This paper reviews the anatomy of the carotid space from the skull base to the thorax, defining its borders at multiple levels, as well as its contents. It describes the myriad of mass lesions and vascular pathologies that may occur within the carotid space.

- **Anatomic considerations in differential diagnoses**: The paper discusses imaging features and lesion characteristics across multiple imaging modalities, including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and conventional angiography.

- **Entities discussed include**: Paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors, meningioma, fibromuscular dysplasia, carotidynia, thrombus, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, and pathology of the deep cervical chain lymph nodes.

Understanding the complex and unique anatomy of the carotid space, as well as the nuances of navigating a broad differential, will empower the reader to make an accurate diagnosis.

### Validity of duplex ultrasound as a diagnostic modality for internal carotid artery disease [^113Dfs6D]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

There is an increasing trend to rely on duplex ultrasound rather than angiography to measure internal carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of ultrasound assessment of carotid stenosis performed in community-based vascular laboratories. We compared ultrasound with angiography in 225 patients referred to us for carotid intervention.

- **Mild lesions**: Diagnosed by ultrasound with a sensitivity of 54%, specificity of 89%, and a positive predictive value of 89% compared with angiography.

- **Severe lesions**: Had a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 67%, and a positive predictive value of 45%.

Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated the optimal ultrasound cut-off value of 66% stenosis as a predictor of > 60% stenosis measured angiographically, is associated with a false positive rate of 38% and a false negative rate of 9%. Similarly, using a cut-off of 76% on ultrasound to predict > 70% stenosis measured angiographically would be associated with a 29% false positive rate and an 11% false negative rate.

Despite the value of non-invasive testing for carotid disease, duplex ultrasonography performed in non-accredited and some accredited laboratories may produce highly variable results. Using ultrasound as the sole diagnostic test to determine the severity of a carotid stenosis may result in a high number of inappropriate operations and a large proportion of patients who may not be offered treatment due to false negative diagnoses.

### Occipital artery anastomosis to vertebral artery causing pulsatile tinnitus [^111vhmLt]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus can result from various vascular etiologies that cause the transmission of pulsatile turbulent flow into the inner ear. Less commonly, non-vascular sources cause increased blood flow and transmission of sound perceived as tinnitus. Thorough clinical examination leads to appropriate imaging evaluation and therapeutic planning. Most pulsatile tinnitus results from expected mechanisms, such as dural arteriovenous fistula, jugular bulb dehiscence, or paraganglioma; however, the literature contains reports of numerous rare causes, particularly variant anatomic morphologies. We present the case of a novel cause of pulsatile tinnitus in which collateral vascular flow compensated for decreased normal intracranial cerebral arterial supply and might have caused catastrophic consequences if intervened upon after assumptions based on an incomplete evaluation.

### Pulsatile tinnitus and the intrameatal vascular loop: Why do we not hear our carotids [^113KyDXf]? Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the heartbeat or respiration in one or both ears. In 15% of patients with pulsatile tinnitus, no cause can be found. Other investigators have suggested that a vascular loop entering the internal auditory meatus can be another cause of arterial, pulse-synchronous tinnitus. If this is the case, we should constantly hear the arterial pulsations of the carotid arteries passing through the petrous bone.

- **Methods**: Using magnetic resonance imaging, 17 patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus and 46 with non-pulsatile tinnitus were analyzed for the presence of a vascular loop entering into the internal acoustic meatus. Four temporal bones were sectioned to find structural differences between the internal acoustic meatus and the pericarotid area. Four patients with intrameatal vascular loops and ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus underwent surgery involving Teflon interpositioning between the loop and the cochlea.

- **Results**: In unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, a statistically highly significant number of intrameatal vascular loops were noted in comparison to non-pulsatile tinnitus. A well-developed pericarotid venous plexus was found histologically. Three of the four patients who underwent surgery were initially tinnitus free, but pulsations recurred after 3 months in one patient.

- **Conclusion**: Vascular loops in the internal auditory canal may generate pulsatile tinnitus. This condition may be treated by placing Teflon between the cochlea and the intrameatal vascular loop. The dampening effect of a pericarotid venous plexus may prevent the perception of carotid pulsations.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^112B8eAz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 2,814 patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) enrolled in the registry, 2,613 (92.9%) had data regarding pulsatile tinnitus (PT) as a presenting symptom of FMD at the time of diagnosis. Among these, 972 (37.2%) reported experiencing PT, while 1,641 (62.8%) did not. Patients with PT were more often women (98.9% compared to 93.8%; P < 0.001) and were younger at the time of FMD diagnosis (53.3 years compared to 55.2 years; P < 0.001).

Patients with PT were less likely to have hypertension (56.0% versus 64.9%; P < 0.001) or use antihypertensive medications. These medications included diuretics (19.5% versus 24.9%; P = 0.002), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (16.4% versus 20.6%; P = 0.011), angiotensin receptor blockers (15.5% versus 20.8%; P = 0.001), beta blockers (30.6% versus 38.0%; P < 0.001), and calcium channel blockers (18.4% versus 22.0%; P = 0.030).

A history of headaches was more common among patients reporting PT (82.5% versus 62.7%; P < 0.001), but there was no significant difference in headache type, such as migraine (56.6% compared to 54.5%; P = 0.38) and tension-type headaches (25.7% versus 22.2%; P = 0.084). Patients with PT were more likely to present with a cervical bruit (37.5% compared to 15.8%; P < 0.001), cervical artery dissection (19.4% versus 14.1%; P < 0.001), and other neurovascular signs or symptoms, including transient ischemic attack (10.8% compared to 7.3%; P = 0.003), dizziness (44.9% versus 22.9%; P < 0.001), neck pain (41.3% versus 19.4%; P < 0.001), and nonpulsatile tinnitus (28.5% versus 19.6%; P < 0.001) at the time of FMD diagnosis. There was no significant difference in the presentation of stroke among those without or with PT (7.2% versus 8.4%; P = 0.31).

### Vertebro-vertebral fistula presenting as a pulsatile tinnitus [^112v3Ucd]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Tinnitus may be classified as pulsatile (PT) or continuous (non-PT), and may be subjective (heard only by the patient) or objective (also audible to the examiner). PT is usually related to vascular causes and is pulse synchronous, coinciding with the patient's heartbeat. PT is much less common, affecting approximately 4% of patients with tinnitus, but unlike non-PT, it usually has a specific identifiable cause.

We present a case of a man without previous otological disease or head trauma, presenting with a left-ear subjective PT. MR angiography detected a left vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula, which was treated by endovascular embolisation with significant symptomatic relief.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111u5iXu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In this analysis of 2613 patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), we found that 37.2% reported pulsatile tinnitus (PT) as a presenting symptom at FMD diagnosis. There were many clinically relevant differences between patients with and without PT. Patients with PT were more likely to be women. A possible explanation for this finding is the known difference in FMD distribution by sex; women have a higher rate of carotid involvement with FMD. PT was associated with a younger age at the time of FMD diagnosis and several neurovascular symptoms/signs, including cervical bruit. Indeed, patients with PT were more likely to have FMD involving the extracranial carotid but not the vertebral artery. Additionally, a history of headache was more common among patients reporting PT. Importantly, we could not identify differences in headache subtypes, likely because of missing data.

The association between FMD and PT has been previously described. The European/International FMD Registry reported PT as a presenting symptom of FMD in 16.9% of patients. We report a more than two-fold higher rate of PT. The difference likely speaks to the heterogeneity of the FMD population and the differences between the two registries, notably the higher prevalence of cerebrovascular FMD among patients in the US Registry. The study expands upon our understanding of the association between FMD and PT by providing more granular information regarding baseline characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement. Importantly, it also provides a comparison with patients with FMD who do not have PT.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: a symptom of chronic subclavian artery occlusion [^116YefK5]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

We report the unusual case of pulsatile tinnitus caused by muscular branches of the occipital artery, which developed to supply the distal vertebral artery after subclavian artery occlusion. Anatomical findings and options for endovascular treatment are discussed. To our knowledge, subclavian artery occlusion causing objective tinnitus has not been reported.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: A report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^112ePkF2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) often experience pulsatile tinnitus (PT). Those with PT show higher rates of neurovascular symptoms and extracranial carotid artery involvement compared with patients without PT. Additional studies are necessary to better understand the mechanisms of PT in FMD and to delineate optimal treatment strategies. The data also support investigating the prevalence of FMD among individuals presenting with PT and increasing awareness among providers about FMD as a potential cause.

### A compartment-based approach for the imaging evaluation of tinnitus [^112uTyZB]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus affects 10% of the U.S. general population and is a common indication for imaging studies. We describe a sequential compartment-based diagnostic approach, which simplifies the interpretation of imaging studies in patients with tinnitus. The choice of the initial imaging technique depends on the type of tinnitus, associated symptoms, and examination findings. Familiarity with the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tinnitus and the imaging findings is a prerequisite for a tailored diagnostic approach by the radiologist.

### Sigmoid sinus diverticulum, dehiscence, and venous sinus stenosis: Potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111evAVQ]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is experienced by most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The pathophysiology remains uncertain; however, transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence have been proposed as potential etiologies. We aimed to determine whether the prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence was increased in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus relative to those without pulsatile tinnitus and a control group.

- **Materials and methods**: CT vascular studies of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus (n = 42), without pulsatile tinnitus (n = 37), and controls (n = 75) were independently reviewed for the presence of severe transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence according to published criteria. The prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus was compared with that in the nonpulsatile tinnitus idiopathic intracranial hypertension group and the control group. Further comparisons included differing degrees of transverse sinus stenosis (50% and 75%), laterality of transverse sinus stenosis/sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence, and ipsilateral transverse sinus stenosis combined with sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence.

- **Results**: Severe bilateral transverse sinus stenoses were more frequent in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in controls (P < .00).
