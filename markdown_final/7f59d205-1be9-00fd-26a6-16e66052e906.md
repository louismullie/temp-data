## Question

Is 2 liters of water daily recommended

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether 2 liters of water per day is a recommended intake and, if so, for whom and under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between total water intake and drinking water alone. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say for the general population. Next, I will examine randomized trials and systematic reviews for outcome-level evidence. After that, I need to check condition-specific recommendations where 2 liters is explicitly advised. Finally, I will consider individual variability, safety, and how to translate this into practical guidance with monitoring strategies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating total water intake from foods and beverages with plain drinking water. Total water intake includes water from foods, which typically contributes about 20% of total water, so 2 liters of total water is not the same as 2 liters of drinking water, and that distinction matters for recommendations and safety [^33329e2d].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines for the general population. The European Food Safety Authority proposes adequate total water intakes of about 2.5 liters per day for men and 2.0 liters per day for women, with roughly 80% from fluids, which implies about 2.0 and 1.6 liters per day from beverages, respectively. The Institute of Medicine sets higher totals at 3.7 liters per day for men and 2.7 liters per day for women, again including water from foods, so the beverage-only portion is lower than the total figures [^58e045d7] [^58730049]. Wait, let me verify the translation: yes, that aligns with commonly cited beverage-only targets near 2–3 liters for men and 1.5–2 liters for women, acknowledging variability in diet and environment [^58730049].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal benefits of pushing everyone to 2 liters of plain water. I will now examine the randomized evidence. A 2024 systematic review of 18 RCTs found limited high-quality evidence that increasing water intake improves health outcomes broadly; benefits were suggested for weight loss in some trials and for nephrolithiasis prevention, but many endpoints were assessed in single studies and adherence to prescribed water targets was often modest, underscoring that blanket prescriptions may not translate into consistent clinical gains in the general population [^c48c0b26] [^867eb3ee]. I should double-check the weight-loss signal: yes, premeal water strategies in adults with overweight/obesity showed greater weight loss in some RCTs, but an adolescent RCT testing 2 liters per day without premeal timing did not show BMI z-score benefit, highlighting context dependence and adherence challenges [^c7146ef4] [^fe1887ee].

> Now, I need to check condition-specific contexts where 2 liters per day is explicitly recommended. For autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with preserved kidney function, KDIGO suggests adapting water intake to achieve at least 2–3 liters per day of total water, spread through the day, to suppress vasopressin and potentially slow cyst growth, with individualized assessment for contraindications and monitoring for hyponatremia risk. This is a targeted, disease-specific recommendation rather than a general-population rule [^f7460f5a] [^a86bb609]. For secondary prevention of nephrolithiasis, guidelines recommend generous fluid intake to achieve a urine volume above 2.0–2.5 liters per day, which typically requires total fluid intake around 2–3 liters per day depending on diet and climate; again, this is condition-specific and evidence-based for stone prevention [^3fde0719] [^e3a4b3b6]. For women with recurrent UTIs who drink less than 1.5 liters per day, increasing intake to at least 1.5–2.0 liters per day reduced recurrences in an RCT and is endorsed by urology guidelines as a conditional strategy, reinforcing that the benefit is clearest in those with low baseline intake [^6b272f79] [^42a10ccc]. In neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, expert consensus suggests 2–3 liters per day to expand blood volume and mitigate symptoms, illustrating another niche where higher water intake is therapeutic rather than routine [^c17df7c6].

> But wait, what if the person is an athlete, older adult, or has comorbidities that alter needs and risks. I should confirm individualization principles. Hydration needs vary with age, sex, body size, activity, climate, and health status; recent analyses using doubly labeled water show substantial interindividual variability in water turnover, and sports guidelines emphasize individualized, drink-to-thirst strategies with avoidance of overhydration rather than fixed-volume targets during exertion [^fd4459d1] [^b5e372ea]. For older adults, thirst perception is blunted and dehydration risk is higher, so practical targets often aim for about 1.6–2.0 liters per day from fluids, but forced overhydration can precipitate hyponatremia, so monitoring and moderation are key [^28dcc1f2] [^44e98daa]. I should also remember that in heart failure, cirrhosis, or advanced CKD, unrestricted high water intake may be unsafe, reinforcing the need to tailor advice to comorbidities and medications [^a86bb609].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center. Excessive water intake can cause hyponatremia, particularly in those with impaired water excretion or on interacting drugs; case series and guidelines document iatrogenic or psychogenic polydipsia leading to life-threatening hyponatremia, and exercise-associated hyponatremia prevention hinges on avoiding overdrinking and using thirst-guided strategies rather than fixed quotas [^44e98daa] [^660d45f6]. Let me reconsider whether 2 liters per day is inherently risky: for most healthy adults with normal kidney function, it is generally safe, but risk rises when intake is very high, when solute intake is low, or when there is impaired free water clearance, so individualized counseling is prudent [^a86bb609].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this in practice. For generally healthy adults, I would frame 2 liters per day of total fluids as a reasonable reference point within guideline ranges, while emphasizing that about 20% of water comes from food and that intake should be adjusted to thirst, urine color, activity, and environment. Pale yellow urine and minimal thirst suggest adequate hydration for most, whereas dark urine or concentrated 24-hour collections indicate underhydration and may warrant targeted increases in those at risk for stones or UTIs [^33329e2d] [^df80ce43]. For patients with ADPKD, nephrolithiasis, recurrent UTIs, or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, I would specify higher, condition-appropriate targets with monitoring of urine volume or osmolality when relevant and screening for contraindications to high intake [^f7460f5a] [^3fde0719] [^42a10ccc] [^c17df7c6]. For athletes, I would avoid prescriptive volumes and instead use individualized sweat-loss assessments and thirst-guided replacement to prevent both dehydration and overhydration [^b5e372ea].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Two liters of water per day is not a universal mandate for everyone, but it sits within evidence-based adequate intake ranges for total fluids in many adults and is a specific therapeutic recommendation for several conditions such as ADPKD, nephrolithiasis, recurrent UTIs in those with low baseline intake, and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. For the general population, I would individualize around 1.5–2.5 liters per day of total fluids, prioritize plain water, and adjust based on diet, activity, climate, and health status, while monitoring for safety and adherence [^58e045d7] [^58730049] [^f7460f5a] [^3fde0719] [^42a10ccc].

The idea that everyone should drink 2 liters (about 8 cups) of water per day is a **myth** [^d9dc2f69]. There is **no universal requirement** for 2 liters of plain water daily; fluid needs vary with age, sex, activity, climate, and health status [^fd4459d1]. Authoritative guidelines suggest **about 2.7 liters/day for women and 3.7 liters/day for men** from all fluids and foods, with roughly 20–30% from food, so plain water intake is typically 1.5–2.2 liters/day [^58730049] [^858849f5]. For most healthy adults, a practical approach is to drink to thirst and adjust intake based on urine color (aim for pale yellow), activity, and environment [^b5e372ea] [^df80ce43]. Exceptions include certain medical conditions (e.g. kidney stones, UTIs, ADPKD) where higher, individualized fluid targets are recommended [^3fde0719] [^6b272f79] [^f7460f5a].

---

## Origins of the 2-liter rule

The "8x8" rule (8 glasses of 8 ounces) likely originated from a **1945 Food and Nutrition Board recommendation** that adults consume about 2.5 liters of water daily, noting that much of this comes from food. Over time, this was simplified to "drink 8 glasses of water a day", ignoring the contribution from food and other beverages [^d7e4f807].

---

## Scientific evidence and current guidelines

Current evidence does not support a **universal 2-liter rule**. Fluid needs vary widely, and guidelines emphasize individualized intake:

- **European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)**: 2.0 liters/day for women and 2.5 liters/day for men from fluids, with about 20% of total water intake from food [^858849f5].
- **Institute of Medicine (IOM)**: 2.7 liters/day for women and 3.7 liters/day for men from all sources, including food [^58730049].
- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Intake should match individual needs based on climate, activity, and diet.

These guidelines refer to **total water intake**, including water from foods (about 20–30%) and other beverages, so plain water intake is typically 1.5–2.2 liters/day, not a fixed 2 liters.

---

## Individual factors influencing water needs

Water needs vary with **individual and environmental factors**:

| **Factor** | **Effect on water needs** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults may have reduced thirst sensation; children have higher needs relative to body weight |
| Sex | Men generally require more fluids due to higher muscle mass |
| Body weight | Larger individuals need more fluids |
| Physical activity | Increases fluid needs significantly |
| Climate | Hot, humid, or high-altitude environments increase needs |
| Health status | Certain conditions (e.g. kidney stones, UTIs, ADPKD) require higher intake [^3fde0719] [^6b272f79] [^f7460f5a] |

---

## Risks of excessive water intake

Drinking too much water can cause **hyponatremia** (low sodium), especially in people with kidney, liver, or heart conditions, or in athletes who overhydrate [^751e5b8a]. Symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, seizures, and coma. Individualized advice is essential in vulnerable populations [^a86bb609].

---

## Practical hydration recommendations

Instead of a fixed 2 liters, use these **practical strategies**:

- **Drink to thirst**: For most healthy adults, thirst is a reliable guide [^b5e372ea].
- **Monitor urine color**: Pale yellow indicates adequate hydration; dark yellow suggests more fluids are needed.
- **Adjust for activity and climate**: Increase intake with exercise, heat, or altitude [^df80ce43].
- **Include fluids from foods**: Fruits, vegetables, and soups contribute to hydration [^33329e2d].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations benefit from **higher, individualized fluid targets**:

- **Kidney stones**: Aim for ≥ 2 liters/day of urine to reduce recurrence [^3fde0719] [^e3a4b3b6].
- **Urinary tract infections**: Increased intake reduces recurrences in those with low baseline intake [^6b272f79] [^42a10ccc].
- **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)**: 2–3 liters/day is recommended to slow cyst growth, with individualized assessment [^f7460f5a] [^a86bb609].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no universal requirement** to drink 2 liters of water daily. Fluid needs are individual and context-dependent; a practical approach is to drink to thirst, monitor urine color, and adjust for activity, climate, and health status. Fixed rules like "8 glasses a day" are oversimplified and not evidence-based for everyone [^d9dc2f69].

### Effects of advice to drink 8 cups of water per day in adolescents with overweight or obesity: a randomized clinical trial [^fe1887ee]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Health care professionals commonly recommend increased water consumption, typically to 8 cups per day, as part of a weight-reducing diet. However, this recommendation is based on limited evidence and virtually no experimental data from the pediatric population.

Objective

To compare 2 standardized weight-loss diets among adolescents with overweight or obesity, either with or without additional advice and behavioral support to increase habitual water intake to 8 cups per day.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical, parallel-group trial was conducted between February 2, 2011, and June 26, 2014, at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, among 38 adolescents with overweight or obesity who reported drinking 4 cups or less of water per day.

Interventions

All participants in both groups received similar weight-reducing interventions, differentiated by advice about water intake (the water group received advice to increase water intake to 8 cups per day; the control group did not receive such advice) but controlled for other dietary recommendations and treatment intensity. The interventions included dietary counseling, daily text messages, and a cookbook with health guides. To support adherence to 8 cups of water per day, the water group received well-defined messages about water through counseling and daily text messages, a water bottle, and a water pitcher with filters.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 6-month change in body mass index z score. Data analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.

Results

All 38 participants (27 girls and 11 boys; mean [SD] age, 14.9 [1.7] years) completed the study. Both groups reported drinking approximately 2 cups of water per day at baseline. Self-reported change in water intake at 6 months was greater in the water group (difference from baseline, 2.8 cups per day [95% CI, 1.8 to 3.8]; P < .001) compared with that in the control group (difference from baseline, 1.2 cups per day [95% CI, 0.2 to 2.2]; P = 0.02) (difference between groups, 1.6 cups per day [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.0 cups per day]; P = 0.03). The 6-month change in body mass index z score did not differ between the water group (difference from baseline, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to -0.0]; P = 0.005) and the control group (difference from baseline, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.2 to -0.0]; P = 0.008) (difference between groups, -0.0 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.1]; P = 0.88).

Conclusions and Relevance

Advice and behavioral supports to consume 8 cups of water per day in the context of a weight-reducing diet did not affect body weight among adolescents with overweight or obesity. Despite intensive behavior supports, few adolescents achieved the target of 8 cups of water per day. Environmental interventions to reduce barriers to water consumption at school may be necessary in future research of the feasibility and effectiveness to achieve the target of an intake of 8 cups of water per day in adolescents.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^d9dc2f69]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Water is a major constituent of the human body and is considered an essential nutrient that cannot be sufficiently produced by metabolism. The National Academy of Medicine suggests a daily fluid intake of approximately 13 eight-ounce cups for men and 9 for women, respectively. A common public health-related recommendation is to drink 8 cups of water per day, yet the supporting evidence is not clear. Given the wide variability of body weight, activity level, and health status at the population level and the numerous mechanisms that regulate water balance, a single optimal amount of daily water consumption is a challenging concept.

Behavioral factors and hydration status have been widely studied in relation to health conditions owing to the known detrimental effects of dehydration. To our knowledge, there has been no study to compile reports of the benefits of water interventions on clinical outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the impact of increased daily water consumption on health-related outcomes.

### Association between water consumption and body weight outcomes: a systematic review [^2f1ebf15]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Drinking water is often applied as a dietary means for weight loss and overweight/obesity prevention, but no evidence-based recommendation exists for this indication.

Objective

We summarized the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in adults of any body weight status.

Design

In a systematic review, we retrieved studies from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE), cross-references by PubMed functions and hand-searching, and experts' recommendations. Any type of study including adults aged > 18 y that reported the association between daily water consumption and any weight-related outcome, such as body weight, body mass index, or body weight classifications, was eligible.

Results

Of 4963 retrieved records, 11 original studies and 2 systematic reviews were included. In participants dieting for weight loss or maintenance, a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized controlled trial, and an observational longitudinal study showed that increased water consumption, in addition to a program for weight loss or maintenance, reduced body weight after 3–12 mo compared with such a program alone. In mixed-weight populations not primarily dieting for weight loss or maintenance, 2 short-term randomized trials showed no effect of water consumption on body weight; 6 cross-sectional studies showed inconsistent results.

Conclusions

Studies of individuals dieting for weight loss or maintenance suggest a weight-reducing effect of increased water consumption, whereas studies in general mixed-weight populations yielded inconsistent results. The evidence for this association is still low, mostly because of the lack of good-quality studies. This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero as CRD42012002585.

Limitations

There are some limitations to our findings. Mainly, the results of RCTs are interpreted from an intention-to-treat perspective; thus, the actual causal effect of water might not have been accurately demonstrated. While interventions consisted of a recommendation for increasing water intake, adherence to these recommendations and actual intake are not guaranteed. Moreover, since observational studies on the topic may be heavily confounded and subject to several biases, especially recall bias, we restricted our study to RCTs that led to fewer included studies. Lastly, many end points were examined by single studies and thus only limited evidence is available for these end points. The literature would benefit from further studies confirming these results, especially in cases in which the primary end point is a clinical outcome and when the current available studies have obvious limitations or could not achieve target recruitment or participants did not adhere to the intervention. Although current RCTs specify a certain volume of water as the intended intervention, they do not establish what the optimal or target total daily intake should be, which could be addressed in future studies.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^c48c0b26]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Several public recommendations exist regarding the amount of daily water intake, yet the supporting evidence is not clear, and benefits of increasing water consumption are not well-established.

Objective

To summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the health-related outcomes associated with increased or decreased daily water consumption.

Evidence Review

A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase was performed up to April 6, 2023. Studies were included if they aimed to assess the impact of daily water consumption by any defined amount on any health-related outcome.

Findings

Of 1464 records screened, 18 (1%) eligible studies were included in the review. Among eligible studies, 15 (83%) were parallel group RCTs, and 3 (16%) were crossover studies. Interventions in these studies consisted of a recommendation to alter the daily amount of water intake by a specific amount for a predefined period ranging between 4 days and 5 years, while the control groups were mostly asked to maintain their usual intake habits. The studies assessed various populations. Recurring primary end points included weight loss, fasting blood glucose level, headache, urinary tract infection, and nephrolithiasis. Consuming additional water was associated with greater weight loss (range, 44%-100% more than control conditions) and fewer nephrolithiasis events (15 fewer events per 100 participants over 5 years). Single studies suggested benefits related to migraine prevention, urinary tract infection, diabetes control, and hypotension. Ten studies (55%) reported at least 1 positive result, and 8 studies (44%) reported negative results.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review found that there is a limited number of clinical trials in the literature assessing the benefits of increasing water intake related to a large variety of health outcomes. While the quality and quantity of evidence is limited, a small number of studies suggested benefits of water intake on weight loss and nephrolithiasis, while single studies raised the possibility of benefits for patients with migraine, urinary tract infection, diabetes, and hypotension. Given the low cost and low adverse-effect profile of water, further well-designed studies should assess benefits in these specific conditions.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^c7146ef4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Four studies (22%), evaluated the effect of water on weight change in participants with overweight and obesity. In 3 parallel group RCTs, adults with overweight and obesity randomized to consume 1500 mL of water per day before meals for a period of 12 weeks to 12 months had greater weight loss compared with those in the control groups (approximately 100%, 87%, and 44% more weight vs control groups).

In a fourth studyincluding 38 participants who reported drinking less than 1000 mL/d, drinking 2000 mL/d was not associated with weight over a 6-month period (effect estimate, 0.0 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0.1]; P = 0.88). The study recruited only 63% of its target, and at 6 months, the intervention group reported drinking 1135 (95% CI, 900 to 1400) mL/d. Compared with the other 3 studies assessing weight change, this study was distinct because it included adolescents aged 17 years or younger, whereas the other studies included adults only, and the water intervention in this study was not premeal intake.

Fasting Blood Glucose

Two studies (11%), assessed the effect of a water intervention on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Sedaghat et alrandomized 40 patients with recently diagnosed (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes into a water intervention or control group that received no water recommendation. The water intervention consisted of drinking 250 mL before breakfast, 500 mL before lunch, and 250 mL before dinner for a total of 8 weeks. There was a significant between-group difference in mean change in FBG in the intervention (−32.6 mg/dL) vs the control group (5.3 mg/dL) (P = 0.003) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). On the other hand, Nakamura et altested a water intervention consisting of drinking 550 mL within 2 hours of waking and 550 mL before bedtime and found that FBG increased by approximately 0.6 mg/dL after 12 weeks in both groups. This RCT consisted of 60 adults with baseline FBG between 90 and 126 mg/dL and excluded participants receiving medication and/or lifestyle modification for diabetes. Baseline FBG of study participants was approximately 97 mg/dL, substantially lower than that in Sedaghat et al, which was approximately 225.7 mg/dL in the intervention group and 221.7 mg/dL in the control group.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^309829cf]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review to assess the benefits of altered daily water intake interventions. Our study was restricted to RCTs to focus on the reported causal effects of water. We found that increased water intake (and decreased intake in one study) was statistically significantly associated with beneficial effects on several clinical outcomes. Some end points were assessed by more than 1 study and showed mixed results as to whether a statistically significant effect was detected.

### Water intake in drinks and food: how should we advise patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction on their water intake and / or urine output, as a cornerstone of lifestyle interventions? ICI-RS 2024 [^e517809e]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

Water intake in drinks and food is essential for life. Multiple guidelines exist to help give recommendations for healthy water intake and urine output, but few of these are specific to patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.

Methods

A debate held at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society meeting, held in Bristol in June 2024, considered ways to improve this situation.

Results and Conclusion

There are challenges in measuring both total water intake and also urine output, but we suggest that urine output may be the most helpful measure to focus on for future guidelines for patients.

### Nutrition and water: drinking eight glasses of water a day ensures proper skin hydration-myth or reality? [^f84693b2]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

How-to books, beauty journals, the Internet, and the media usually recommend drinking six to eight glasses of water each day for keeping the skin hydrated, helping it look healthier, and making it less prone to wrinkles. We have found no scientific proof for this recommendation; nor is there proof, we must admit, that drinking less water does absolutely no harm. The only certainty about this issue is that, at the end of the day, we still await scientific evidence to validate what we know instinctively to be true — namely, that it is all a myth.

### Impact of fluid intake in the prevention of urinary system diseases: a brief review [^f8f89793]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

We are often told that we should be drinking more water, but the rationale for this remains unclear and no recommendations currently exist for a healthy fluid intake supported by rigorous scientific evidence. Crucially, the same lack of evidence precludes the claim that a high fluid intake has no clinical benefit. The aim of this study is to describe the mechanisms by which chronic low fluid intake may play a crucial role in the pathologies of four key diseases of the urinary system: urolithiasis, urinary tract infection, chronic kidney disease and bladder cancer. Although primary and secondary intervention studies evaluating the impact of fluid intake are lacking, published data from observational studies appears to suggest that chronic low fluid intake may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^d7e4f807]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Classic 'recommendations', such as 'at least 8 × 8 ounce glasses of water per day', have been questioned in an elaborate review by Valtin (2002). However, although there seems to be little scientific support for such recommendations, there is no evidence to show that drinking such a level of fluid might be bad for health. Recently, experts have suggested that such a level of intake may actually be insufficient to appropriately cover bodily needs, even in a sedentary middle-aged individual living in a temperate environment. As much as 3 l of fluid daily have been recommended recently by American experts (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2004). This report did not specify the exact requirements for water intake, but set general recommendations for women at ∼2.7 l of total water — from all beverages and foods — each day, and for men an average of ∼3.7 l of total water. The panel did not set an upper level for water.

This report is the first specific description of beverage intake among the French, based on a quota sample of the population. Differences have appeared between the four age groups in the selection of various types of beverages, as well as consistencies (the major part of daily fluid intake is water). The proportion of daily energy obtained from drinks (all types combined) is ∼10%. Wide variations are observed around mean values, suggesting that fluid intake could be insufficient in some people, or that energy intake from fluids might contribute significantly to adequate or inadequate total energy intake. Longitudinal studies should be carried out in different populations (different countries, different age groups, different socioeconomic levels, etc.) to determine whether the chronic contribution of beverages does impact health or body weight control, as suggested in studies examining the longitudinal changes in body weight associated with the intake of energy-containing drinks (Ludwig et al. 2001; Schulze et al. 2004; Stookey et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009).

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^858849f5]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To maintain adequate hydration status, several countries and public organizations have proposed water intake recommendations for the public. These recommendations have been determined based on data from population studies and accounted for water from beverage and food sources. For instance, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), based on data from population studies from 13 European countries, proposed the dietary reference values (DRV) for the adequate intake (AI) of water which increases with age up to 2.5 L and 2.0 L of water daily for men and women (aged 14 to 70 years), respectively. Similarly, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) proposed increasing water intake levels with age up to 3.7 L/day and 2.7 L/day (aged 19 to 70 years) in men and women, respectively. Yet, the World Health Organization and other guidelines related to cognitive health do not currently include recommendations related to water intake or hydration status. Further understanding of health behaviors, such as cognitive functioning, related to something as fundamental as water intake can have a substantial impact on public health.

Inadequate water intake and dehydration have been associated with existing signs of cognitive impairment among older adults living in long-term care facilities. Moreover, acute studies have shown that dehydration and water supplementation affect mood and cognitive performance. However, fluid and water intake has received limited attention in epidemiological studies, and the literature scarcely examines water intake as a predictor of cognitive performance among older adults. The few studies that have assessed hydration status as a potential predictor of cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults have been inconclusive. Furthermore, to date, few studies have prospectively captured and examined the impact of water and hydration status on cognitive function over a multi-year period. Therefore, the objective of the present analyses was to prospectively investigate the relation between hydration status, water intake, and 2-year changes in cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity.

### Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration [^1b42cdd1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

How much water we really need depends on water functions and the mechanisms of daily water balance regulation. The aim of this review is to describe the physiology of water balance and consequently to highlight the new recommendations with regard to water requirements. Water has numerous roles in the human body. It acts as a building material; as a solvent, reaction medium and reactant; as a carrier for nutrients and waste products; in thermoregulation; and as a lubricant and shock absorber. The regulation of water balance is very precise, as a loss of 1% of body water is usually compensated within 24 h. Both water intake and water losses are controlled to reach water balance. Minute changes in plasma osmolarity are the main factors that trigger these homeostatic mechanisms. Healthy adults regulate water balance with precision, but young infants and elderly people are at greater risk of dehydration. Dehydration can affect consciousness and can induce speech incoherence, extremity weakness, hypotonia of ocular globes, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Human water requirements are not based on a minimal intake because it might lead to a water deficit due to numerous factors that modify water needs (climate, physical activity, diet and so on). Water needs are based on experimentally derived intake levels that are expected to meet the nutritional adequacy of a healthy population. The regulation of water balance is essential for the maintenance of health and life. On an average, a sedentary adult should drink 1.5 l of water per day, as water is the only liquid nutrient that is really essential for body hydration.

### Water intake and risk of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^563dec2c]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The association of water intake with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the knowledge about the relationship between water intake and the risk of T2DM.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and Scopus up to June 2018 for observational studies. Risk ratios (RR)s and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)s were calculated and fixed effects models were used.

Results

Overall, 6 studies were included in the meta-analyses. There was an inverse relationship between water intake and risk of T2DM (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91–0.97, P < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 24%, P = 0.24).

Conclusion

Our findings indicated that the intake of water was correlated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in women and men. These results support the current recommendations of water intake as an inseparable part of a diet with the lowest risk of diabetes mellitus.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^1998c46c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review followed an a priori registered protocol and conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. We used data from published RCTs in which the original authors obtained informed consent from participants.

Study Eligibility

Studies were eligible if their research question was to assess the impact of daily water consumption by any defined amount on any health-related outcome. Study design of interest was restricted to RCTs because our aim was to focus on reports of the causal effect of water consumption and to overcome the confounding bias that would be present in observational studies.

Search Strategy

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to April 6, 2023. We developed search strategies in consultation with a research librarian (P.T.). In brief, our searches were developed around 2 main topics: water consumption and health-related issues. For each topic, multiple synonyms were included such as daily water intake or water consumption (topic 1) and urinary symptoms or headache (topic 2). Additional synonyms were developed besides these examples. Full search strategies for each database are in eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1. Manual screening of citations from articles selected for data extraction was also performed.

Study Selection

Titles and abstracts of each of the search results were screened by 2 reviewers (N.H. J.L.G.F. B.N. A.S. K.D.L. C.N. and J.L.) independently and in duplicate. Full texts for citations identified as eligible by at least 1 reviewer were obtained and screened by 2 reviewers who used a standardized form to record reasons for exclusion. Disagreements were resolved by referring to a senior investigator (C.P.J. and B.N.B.). Results of the selection process were summarized using a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure). Two of the reviewers independently abstracted the following data: type of clinical trial, year of publication, description of study target population, description of intervention and comparator groups, primary end point assessed, results, and effect estimate (if reported).

### A study of fluid intake from beverages in a sample of healthy French children, adolescents and adults [^134be03a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

The French national recommendations for daily fluid intake encourage a level of intake adequate for body weight, age, physical activity and other factors (Martin, 2001). For adults, it is stated that fluid intake should be sufficient to cover daily needs that vary according to each individual's characteristics and lifestyle. Seniors should be particularly careful that their fluid intake is sufficient, as dehydration can have dramatic consequences. In addition to fluid intake from drinks, about one more liter of water should be obtained from the fluid contained in ingested foods, so that under the usual conditions, the total daily intake of fluid should be ∼2.6 l (Martin, 2001).

In spite of the general consensus that an appropriate level of fluid intake is of paramount importance for health and even survival, the actual intake of fluid or total water is not often reported as such in studies of food or nutrient intakes. A study of water intake in the participants of the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 1999–2002 indicated a mean total water intake (from foods and beverages) of ∼1.4 l a day in children and adolescents (4–18 years) and of 2 l in adults (Fulgoni, 2007). Plain drinking water contributed to more than half of this total intake (0.78 l in 4–18 year olds; 1.28 l in adults). By contrast, in a recent study of beverage intake in American preschool children, beverage intake was examined but water intake was excluded, because water is not part of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database categories (O'Connor et al. 2006). Clearly, more information is required regarding the total fluid intake of populations, whether or not it is associated with the intake of nutrients.

This study presents the self-reported intake of beverages, recorded in a quota sample recruited to be representative of the general population in France. Intake in different age groups was assessed: children, adolescents, adults and seniors.

### A randomized trial on the effects of regular water intake in patients with recurrent headaches [^5f0d8320]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previously published investigations suggest a positive effect of increased water intake on headache, but a randomised controlled trial has not been done.

Objective

To investigate the effects of increased water intake on headache.

Methods

Randomised controlled trial in primary care with two groups and a follow-up period of 3 months. Patients were included if they had at least two episodes of moderately intense headache or at least five mildly intense episodes per month and a total fluid intake of less than 2.5 l/day. Both groups received written instructions about stress reduction and sleep improvement strategies. The intervention group additionally received the instruction to increase the daily water intake by 1.5 l. The main outcome measures were Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL) and days with at least moderate headache per month.

Results

We randomised 50 patients to the control group and 52 patients to the intervention group. Drinking more water resulted in a statistically significant improvement of 4.5 (confidence interval: 1.3–7.8) points on MSQOL. In addition, 47% in the water group reported much improvement (6 or higher on a 10-point scale) on perceived intervention effect against 25% in the control group. However, drinking more water did not result in relevant changes in days with at least moderate headache.

Conclusions

Considering the observed positive subjective effects, it seems reasonable to recommend headache patients to try this non-invasive intervention for a short period of time to see whether they experience improvement.

### Consensus recommendations on training and competing in the heat [^a0762bba]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pre-exercise hydration

Resting and well-fed humans are generally well hydrated, and the typical variance in day-to-day total body water fluctuates from 0.2% to 0.7% of body mass. When exposed to heat stress in the days preceding competition, it may, however, be advisable to remind athletes to drink sufficiently and replace electrolyte losses to ensure that euhydration is maintained. Generally, drinking 6 mL of water per kg of body mass during this period every 2–3 h, as well as 2–3 h before training or competition in the heat, is advisable.

There are several methods available to evaluate hydration status, each one having limitations depending on how and when the fluids are lost. The most widely accepted and recommended methods include monitoring body mass changes, measuring plasma osmolality and urine specific gravity. Based on these methods, one is considered euhydrated if daily body mass changes remain < 1%, plasma osmolality is < 290 mmol/kg and urine specific gravity is < 1.020. These techniques can be implemented during intermittent competitions lasting for several days (eg, cycling stage race, tennis/team sports tournament) to monitor hydration status. Establishing baseline body mass is important, as daily variations may occur. It is best achieved by measuring post-void nude body mass in the morning on consecutive days after consuming 1–2 L of fluid the prior evening. Moreover, since exercise, diet and prior drinking influence urine concentration measurements, first morning urine is the preferred assessment time point to evaluate hydration status. If first morning urine cannot be obtained, urine collection should be preceded by several hours of minimal physical activity, fluid consumption and eating.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^6c1d8395]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Hypertonic dehydration is predominantly a water deficit; isotonic dehydration is a deficit of both water and salt.
Clinical examination is of limited diagnostic value when diagnosing dehydration in older people.
Recent research suggests daily fluid requirements may not be as high as previously recommended.
Oral rehydration salts or milk are superior to water alone when treating dehydration orally.
Subcutaneous fluid replacement is much safer than the intravenous route but is slower

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^44e98daa]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) water intake and diet — people with ADPKD should be advised to maintain optimal hydration; plain drinking water, mainly obtained from tap water, is the preferred fluid for drinking in people with ADPKD, and the consumption of drinks with added sugar and/or salt or alcohol should be minimized. A high dietary solute load requires a higher fluid intake to maintain dilute urine, and people with ADPKD should be educated about the importance of dietary solute intake in determining obligatory urine volume; as outlined in Chapter 7, people with ADPKD should be advised to achieve and maintain a moderate protein intake (0.8–1.0 g/kg/d, per WHO recommendations) and limit sodium (Na) intake (Na < 2 g/d [< 90 mmol/d] or < 5 g salt/d). No evidence indicates that the source or type of water (tap, bottled, filtered) is important to the progression of kidney cyst growth; prior self-reported estimates suggest most people (61%) with ADPKD probably have a high habitual intake of fluid (≥ 2 L/d). For implementation context, the increase in urine volume in 3 RCTs was ~0.8 L/d. Safety considerations include that water intake that vastly exceeds population-based recommendations can lead to life-threatening hyponatremia, and in a systematic review of 590 people without ADPKD with life-threatening hyponatremia, psychogenic polydipsia and iatrogenic advice were identified as underlying factors in 68% of cases. The overall grade of certainty of evidence is very low.

### Effect of increased daily water intake in premenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections: a randomized clinical trial [^6b272f79]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013–2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (≥ 3 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5 L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5 L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5–1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0–3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.8; P < .001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.2) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3–4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3–2.1; P < .001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95% CI, 127.4–160.1) and 84.4 (95% CI, 75.4–94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95% CI, 39.4–77.4; P < .001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04] L; P < .001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.2]; P < .001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] vs -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^07213043]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Water intake assessment and research in ADPKD — Measurement guidance notes that "Measurement of urine volume and osmolality from a 24-hour urine test provides the best method of estimating fluid intake and osmotic load, but it has the disadvantages of day-to-day variability in fluid intake, errors due to incomplete collections, and the inconvenience to people with ADPKD". The text adds, "Although a daily water intake of approximately ≥ 2 l/d is recommended for people with ADPKD, in view of its kidney-protective benefits, the effect of high water intake on liver cyst progression remains to be investigated". Current evidence is limited as "Only one RCT has evaluated the long-term effect of increasing water intake on the progression of ADPKD", and research priorities include "short-term clinical trials to assess the efficacy of adjunctive tools to facilitate sustained change to increase water intake (e.g., smartphone app, smart water bottles)" and "interventional RCTs evaluating the combination of vaptan and water intake".

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^b1fafd15]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review found that there is a limited number of clinical trials in the literature assessing the benefits of increasing water intake related to a large variety of health outcomes. While the quality and quantity of evidence was limited, a small number of studies suggest benefits of water intake on weight loss and nephrolithiasis, while single studies raise the possibility of benefits related to migraine prevention, UTIs, diabetes control, and hypotension. Given the obvious low cost and low adverse-effect profile of water, further well-designed studies should assess benefits in these specific conditions.

ADPKD — General advice regarding water intake in the absence of tolvaptan — We suggest adapting water intake, spread throughout the day, to achieve at least 2–3 liters of water intake per day in people with ADPKD and an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² without contraindications to excreting a solute load (2D). People with ADPKD should be provided individualized advice about the amount of water consumption that they need for maintaining hydration, what behaviors achieve this, what drinks to drink, and how to recognize signs of dehydration. The Work Group defined high water intake as habitual water intake to achieve at least 2 liters of urine per day in people with ADPKD and an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² who do not have contraindications, and minimal risks are associated with increased water intake to produce a urine output of between 2–3 l/d in people with an eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and without contraindications to excreting a solute load. Relative contraindications include baseline hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/l), risk of fluid overload (heart failure, cirrhosis), requirement for fluid restriction, and use of medications that may increase the risk of hyponatremia (SSRIs, TCAs) or thiazides used for BP control.

### Water: neglected, unappreciated and under researched [^0f6db735]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Water, an essential nutrient, is often ignored in reports of dietary surveys and nutrition. Although it is ubiquitous in foods and beverages, the attention is often focused on the minerals or calorific values of the fluids imbibed rather than the water per se. Water is often taken for granted by many in Western countries due to its abundant availability through water systems. In developing countries, however, water and sanitation raise significant problems. This review overviews (i) the global perspective of the potable water supply, (ii) human rights and water, (iii) dietary guidelines and sources of water and (iv) the physiology of water balance. Gaps in knowledge and understanding around hydration and water requirements are also discussed. Nutritionists are urged to look at the bigger picture of the global water supply and to use good judgement and common sense when advising on water requirements.

### Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters [^b2cfd6b8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because of growing concern that constituents of drinking water may have adverse health effects, consumption of tap water in North America has decreased and consumption of bottled water has increased. Our objectives were to 1) determine whether North American tap water contains clinically important levels of calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺), and sodium (Na⁺) and 2) determine whether differences in mineral content of tap water and commercially available bottled waters are clinically important.

Design

We obtained mineral analysis reports from municipal water authorities of 21 major North American cities. Mineral content of tap water was compared with published data regarding commercially available bottled waters and with dietary reference intakes (DRIs).

Measurements and Main Results

Mineral levels varied among tap water sources in North America and among bottled waters. European bottled waters generally contained higher mineral levels than North American tap water sources and North American bottled waters. For half of the tap water sources we examined, adults may fulfill between 8% and 16% of their Ca²⁺ DRI and between 6% and 31% of their Mg²⁺ DRI by drinking 2 liters per day. One liter of most moderate mineralization European bottled waters contained between 20% and 58% of the Ca²⁺ DRI and between 16% and 41% of the Mg²⁺ DRI in adults. High mineralization bottled waters often contained up to half of the maximum recommended daily intake of Na⁺.

Conclusion

Drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+ and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals. Physicians should encourage patients to check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs.

### Dietary and pharmacologic management to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^3fde0719]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — Recommendation 1 (fluid intake) states: "ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent recurrent nephrolithiasis. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". Low-quality evidence showed that increased fluid intake is associated with a reduction in stone recurrence, with no difference between tap water and Fiuggi brand oligomineral water; persons already drinking recommended amounts or with contraindications "should not be directed to increase their fluid intake further". Decreasing consumption of soft drinks is associated with reduced recurrence only for beverages "acidified by phosphoric acid, such as colas", and not for drinks "acidified by citric acid, such as fruit-flavored sodas".

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. exercise and fluid replacement [^8f6c314a]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

This Position Stand provides guidance on fluid replacement to sustain appropriate hydration of individuals performing physical activity. The goal of prehydrating is to start the activity euhydrated and with normal plasma electrolyte levels. Prehydrating with beverages, in addition to normal meals and fluid intake, should be initiated when needed at least several hours before the activity to enable fluid absorption and allow urine output to return to normal levels. The goal of drinking during exercise is to prevent excessive (> 2% body weight loss from water deficit) dehydration and excessive changes in electrolyte balance to avert compromised performance. Because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals, customized fluid replacement programs are recommended. Individual sweat rates can be estimated by measuring body weight before and after exercise. During exercise, consuming beverages containing electrolytes and carbohydrates can provide benefits over water alone under certain circumstances. After exercise, the goal is to replace any fluid electrolyte deficit. The speed with which rehydration is needed and the magnitude of fluid electrolyte deficits will determine if an aggressive replacement program is merited.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^58e045d7]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Finally, the strong relation between fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers, notably 24hU osmolality, provides an opportunity to revisit the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in establishing its total water intake guidelines for adults (2.5 and 2.0 l per day of total water for men and women, respectively, with ∼80% coming from fluids). EFSA bases its water daily reference values on observed intakes as well as relative to a 'desirable' urine osmolarity of 500 mOsm/l, calculated from the renal solute load derived from European dietary surveys. The EFSA recommendations incorporated a calculation of the theoretical amount of water required to excrete solute at a urine osmolarity of < 500 mOsm/l. Osmolarity (expressed in mOsm/l) and osmolality (expressed in mOsm/kg) are not synonymous; however, the difference between the two is negligible in solutions of low concentration. Thus, our study data provided an opportunity to test the cutoff of 500 mOsm/kg relative to daily fluid intake. Overall, the calculations and recommendations made by EFSA were well adapted to the majority of adults in our sample. On days when subjects met or exceeded EFSA reference value for water from fluid, urine osmolality was < 500 mOsm/kg 80% of the time. Similarly, urine osmolality exceeded 500 mOsm/kg in 82% of the cases where fluid intake was inferior to daily recommendations. It is worth noting, however, that the reference values for daily water intake may not be sufficient to ensure a low urine osmolality in ∼20% of the population, which is nonetheless substantial. This underscores the large interindividual variability in daily water needs, as well as the necessity of developing biomarkers for adequate fluid intake that are tailored to physiological indicators.

### Daily water intake among US men and women, 2009–2012… [^58730049]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Key findings Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012.
- Among U. S. adults, men consumed an average of 3. 46 liters of water per day, and women consumed
2. 75 liters per day.
- Men aged 60 and over consumed less water than men aged 20–39 and 40–59. Similarly, women aged 60 and over consumed less water than women aged 20–39 and 40–59. Water is an essential nutrient for life. Institute of Medicine recommendations from 2004 set adequate levels for total water intake from all foods and liquids at 3. 7 liters for men and
2. 7 liters for women. Consuming inadequate amounts of water increases the risk of dehydration, kidney stones, and poorer cognitive performance. Did total water intake per day vary by age group for men and women during 2009–2012. Men consumed an average of
3.

46 liters or 117 ounces of water from all foods and liquids per day, while women consumed an average of 2. 75 L or 93 ounces. On average, men aged 20–39 and 40–59 consumed water at about the recommended adequate intake level of 3. 7 L, while those aged 60 and over consumed
0. 78 L less water than the recommended adequate intake. Women aged 20–39 consumed water at about the adequate intake level of 2. 7 L, while women aged 40–59 consumed
0. 2 L more than the adequate intake, and women aged 60 and over consumed 0. 19 L less than the recommended adequate intake. W ere there differences in mean total water intake per day by physical activity level among men and women. Previous studies have shown that adults aged 60 and over are among the most vulnerable to dehydration. This report found that men aged 60 and over consumed 2. 92 L, roughly
0. 8 L less than the adequate intake, and women aged 60 and over consumed 2. 51 L, approximately
0. 2 L less.

### Replacing sweetened caloric beverages with drinking water is associated with lower energy intake [^23f1bdbf]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Reduced intake of sweetened caloric beverages (SCBs) is recommended to lower total energy intake. Replacing SCBs with non-caloric diet beverages does not automatically lower energy intake, however. Compensatory increases in other food or beverages reportedly negate benefits of diet beverages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate drinking water as an alternative to SCBs.

Research Methods and Procedures

Secondary analysis of data from the Stanford A TO Z intervention evaluated change in beverage pattern and total energy intake in 118 overweight women (25 to 50 years) who regularly consumed SCBs (> 12 ounces/d) at baseline. At baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months, mean daily beverage intake (SCBs, drinking water, non-caloric diet beverages, and nutritious caloric beverages), food composition (macronutrient, water, and fiber content), and total energy intake were estimated using three 24-hour diet recalls. Beverage intake was expressed in relative terms (percentage of beverages).

Results

In fixed effects models that controlled for total beverage intake, non-caloric and nutritious caloric beverage intake (percentage of beverages), food composition, and energy expenditure [metabolic equivalent (MET)], replacing SCBs with drinking water was associated with significant decreases in total energy intake that were sustained over time. The caloric deficit attributable to replacing SCBs with water was not negated by compensatory increases in other food or beverages. Replacing all SCBs with drinking water was associated with a predicted mean decrease in total energy of 200 kcal/d over 12 months.

Discussion

The results suggest that replacing SCBs with drinking water can help lower total energy intake in overweight consumers of SCBs motivated to diet.

Background

Cognitive decline is an important public health concern given 55 million people have been diagnosed with dementia and almost 80 million people are projected to be affected by 2030. Cognitive function is particularly important, especially as the population ages, because it determines the maintenance of our independence, the performance of everyday activities, and the quality of life. Cognitive decline and dementia have a diverse etiology, and effective treatment is still not available. For this reason, prevention strategies targeting modifiable factors, such as nutritional habits and dietary intake to slow the development of cognitive impairment, remain a promising public health approach. Evidence to date assessing individual dietary factors and dietary patterns in relation to cognitive health has been summarized in the Lancet Neurology, while there is information related to various macro- and micronutrients and patterns, evidence related to water appears limited.

Water intake is a nutritional habit that is often overlooked, yet it is considered essential for the optimal physiological function of the human body. As the most abundant component of the human body, water intake and optimal hydration are considered key aspects for the proper functioning of organ systems, aiding, among others, in efficient digestion, elimination of toxins, energy production, thermoregulation, and joint lubrication, as well as a multitude of biochemical reactions. Furthermore, proper hydration is thought to be important for optimal cognitive functioning as it plays a vital role in neural conductivity.

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more water than is taken in, whereas hypohydration refers to the state of water deficit; these conditions result in less-than-optimal hydration and may elicit adverse physiological consequences. For the purposes of this paper, dehydration will be the term used to encompass the state of improper hydration due to unbalanced water loss or water deficit. In Europe, the percentage of the population reported to have inadequate water intake is estimated to vary from 5 to 35%. Understanding water intake and hydration status is of particular importance in older adults as this population tends to be less likely to meet recommendations on water intake and is at greater risk for dehydration due to blunted sensitivity to thirst signals, lower body reserves due to reduced muscle mass, reduced ability to deal with heat stress, and use of medications or laxatives with diuretic effects. Multiple health organizations and dietary guidelines have acknowledged that adequate hydration status is associated with the preservation of physical and mental functions and that water intake is the best way to achieve hydration.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^14454c11]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Water is essential for a wide variety of physiological functions, and water intake must be sufficient to compensate for daily losses. Low daily water intake and low urine output increase long-term risk of kidney dysfunction, and insufficient intake may also have a role in the development of hyperglycemia. Guidelines for adequate total water intake for the general adult population have been proposed by several international governing bodies. Yet, these recommendations are based on population median water intakes, with limited consideration of links between water intake and hydration status and without links between water intake and health. Moreover, the recommendations do not provide a method for individuals to ensure they are consuming enough water to meet their specific hydration needs.

Establishing the adequacy of fluid intake based on physiological indicators of hydration is challenging, because there are multiple biological indicators of hydration in average adults in free-living conditions, each sensitive to a different aspect of hydration. The accurate measurement of hydration status is complicated because body water turnover occurs constantly and water moves between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Proposed biomarkers of hydration include the direct measurement of blood, urine, saliva and tears, as well as estimates of body water via bioelectrical impedance or spectroscopy. No single method appears to be ideal for all situations. Serum osmolality is considered a good marker for acute or critical dehydration situations, but is tightly regulated and insensitive to mild hydration deficits in healthy sedentary individuals with ad libitum access to fluids. In contrast, urinary hydration biomarkers do vary according to fluid intake, and are biologically significant in terms of predicting health outcomes such as chronic kidney disease.

Results

Summary of Literature Search

Our search strategy yielded a total of 1464 unique studies that were screened to finally include 18 RCTs, published between 1999 and 2023 (Figure). Of these, 15 (83%), were parallel group RCTs, and 3 (16%), were crossover studies. The median sample size was 48 participants and ranged between 14 and 631 participants. Interventions in these studies consisted of a recommendation to alter the daily amount of water intake by a specific amount for a predefined period, while the control groups were mostly asked to maintain their usual intake habits. Duration of the increased water intake intervention ranged between 4 days and 5 years. The studies assessed various populations and primary end points. In total, 10 studies (55%), reported at least 1 positive result and 8 studies (44%), reported negative results. Characteristics and summaries of positive and negative results in studies are depicted in the Table. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, 9 studies (50%), had a low risk of bias, 5 (27%), had some concern for bias, and 4 (22%), had high risk for bias (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1). Common sources of bias were related to the allocation sequence randomization and concealment and loss to follow-up.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^fd4459d1]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid requirements

The UK NHS's Eatwell Guide recommends a daily intake of six to eight glasses of fluid per day and the European Food Safety Authority recommends 2.5 l of water for males over 14 years and 2 l for females. However, these recommendations have recently been called into doubt following a large international study. This cross-sectional study analysed water turnover (fluid balance, ml/day) data from over 5,604 subjects, from birth to 96 years old, from 23 different countries, available from the International Atomic Energy Agency International Doubly Labelled Water database. Each participant consumed a weight-adjusted dose of deuterated water. The level of deuterated water was measured before and after the isotope drink using either saliva, urine or serum, allowing an estimation of the amount of deuterated water left in the body and therefore the total body water volume. The study team found that water turnover reduced with advancing age and was lowest in females aged > 65 years. Total body water also declined with advancing age, presumed secondary to reduced muscle mass. The authors then used extensive data on geography, climate, activity levels and water turnover to produce an equation to estimate an individual's daily water requirements:

[1,076 × PAL] + [14.34 × body weight (kg)] + [374.9 × sex] + [5.823 × humidity (%)] + [1,070 × athlete status] + [104.6 × HDI] + [0.4726 × altitude (m)] − [0.3529 × age (years)²] + [24.78 × age (years)] + [1.865 × ambient temperature (°C)²] − [19.66 × temperature (°C)] − 713.1.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^4c42a682]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Water intake and hydration status have been suggested to impact cognition; however, longitudinal evidence is limited and often inconsistent. This study aimed to longitudinally assess the association between hydration status and water intake based on current recommendations, with changes in cognition in an older Spanish population at high cardiovascular disease risk.

Methods

A prospective analysis was conducted of a cohort of 1957 adults (aged 55–75) with overweight/obesity (BMI between ≥ 27 and < 40 kg/m²) and metabolic syndrome from the PREDIMED-Plus study. Participants had completed bloodwork and validated, semiquantitative beverage and food frequency questionnaires at baseline, as well as an extensive neuropsychological battery of 8 validated tests at baseline and 2 years of follow-up. Hydration status was determined by serum osmolarity calculation and categorized as < 295 mmol/L (hydrated), 295–299.9 mmol/L (impending dehydration), and ≥ 300 mmol/L (dehydrated). Water intake was assessed as total drinking water intake and total water intake from food and beverages and according to EFSA recommendations. Global cognitive function was determined as a composite z -score summarizing individual participant results from all neuropsychological tests. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted to assess the associations between baseline hydration status and fluid intake, continuously and categorically, with 2-year changes in cognitive performance.

Results

The mean baseline daily total water intake was 2871 ± 676 mL/day (2889 ± 677 mL/day in men; 2854 ± 674 mL/day in women), and 80.2% of participants met the ESFA reference values for an adequate intake. Serum osmolarity (mean 298 ± 24 mmol/L, range 263 to 347 mmol/L) indicated that 56% of participants were physiologically dehydrated. Lower physiological hydration status (i.e.g.reater serum osmolarity) was associated with a greater decline in global cognitive function z -score over a 2-year period (β: − 0.010; 95% CI − 0.017 to − 0.004, p -value = 0.002). No significant associations were observed between water intake from beverages and/or foods with 2-year changes in global cognitive function.

Conclusions

Reduced physiological hydration status was associated with greater reductions in global cognitive function over a 2-year period in older adults with metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity. Future research assessing the impact of hydration on cognitive performance over a longer duration is needed.

### The most essential nutrient: defining the adequate intake of water [^e95d0cc4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Although water is quantitatively the most import nutrient, there are no recommended dietary allowances (RDA) or adequate intake (AI) values. Based on 718 assessments of 24-hour total water intake, urine volume, and urine osmolality, individual hydration status was characterized in 479 healthy boys and girls of the DONALD study aged 4.0 to 6.9 years and 7.0 to 10.9 years. Mean 24-hour total water intake ranged from 0.90 mL/kcal to 0.96 mL/kcal, and median 24-hour urine osmolality ranged from 683 mosm/kg to 854 mosm/kg. A maximum urine osmolality of 830 mosm/kg (mean - 2 SD) in healthy children with a typical affluent Western-type diet was the physiologic criterion of the upper limit of euhydration. "Water reserve" (24-hour urine volume - hypothetical urine volume to excrete 24 urine solutes at a concentration of 830 mosm/kg) was a quantitative measure of individual 24-hour hydration status and ensuring euhydration in 97% of the subjects in each group; AI values of total water in the 4 age and sex groups ranged from 1.01 mL/kcal to 1.05 mL/kcal. These procedures to quantify 24-hour hydration status may prove valuable in investigating the effects on health of different states of euhydration.

### Norovirus outbreaks from drinking water [^7a905a51]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

National recommendations for volumes of water to be tested vary between tens and hundreds of liters. Such volumes pose a serious practical problem for the testing laboratory. For viral detection by RT-PCR, a smaller volume (1 L) is preferred, as suggested by Gilgen et al. Independent of the concentration method, the increase in RT-PCR inhibitors usually sets limits on the water concentration. Sensitive methods are needed to detect viruses in environmental samples. Recent reports on the applicability and sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR for noroviruses also offer new possibilities to enhance its sensitivity. Another factor is that the test then becomes more rapid, which is essential in monitoring water quality, particularly in epidemic situations. The third advantage is that a quantitative estimate of the contamination level is obtained.

Microbial risks from water are recognized, with much emphasis on risk assessment. Assessment of water, however, depends on indicator organisms, such as coliforms or enterococci, whose survival in water is shorter than that of enteric viruses, especially norovirus and hepatitis A virus. Therefore, viruses can easily be harbored in "microbiologically immaculate" water. In situations in which a well is contaminated by sewage, coliforms are nearly always found. When sewage is released into lake water that serves as raw water downstream, indicator organisms may no longer be detectable, but noroviruses can still be present and cause illness. This sequence of events probably led to the first outbreak we examined (E1).

When water plants use surface water, the contamination may be short-lived and may have vanished by the time the outbreak is detected. A "rolling sample" system might be used in which samples are collected in water plants at risk for contamination at regular intervals (e.g. daily, weekly) and stored at 4°C. Unless signs of an outbreak appear, the samples can be discarded at the same pace that new ones are collected. In case of contamination, water samples would be available for analyses.

The evidence presented here together with several recent reports mentioned above show the role of viruses as contaminants of drinking water. In Finland, the finding that noroviruses frequently cause waterborne outbreaks has led to authorities' increased awareness of viral risks. As a consequence, laboratory techniques have been improved, and the capacity for analyzing environmental samples, especially water, has increased. Legislative measures for viral monitoring as part of the microbial risk assessment in drinking water production should be seriously considered.

### Water for preventing urinary stones [^d9ffe1b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary stone disease is a common condition characterised by increasing prevalence and high rates of recurrence. Observational studies have reported that increased water intake played a role in the prevention of urinary stone formation but with limited strength of evidence.

Objectives

To compare the effects of increased water intake with standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with or without a history of urinary stones.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (Ovid) and the Cochrane Library to 15 October 2019. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles. We did not apply any restrictions to publication language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at the benefits and harms of increased water intake versus standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with or without a history of urinary stones.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled dichotomous outcomes (e.g. incidence/recurrence rate of urinary stones; adverse events) using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We calculated hazard ratio (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs to assess the intervention effect for time-to-event outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Our search identified no RCTs investigating the role of increased water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in participants with no history of urinary stones (primary prevention). We found one RCT assessing the effects of increased water intake versus standard water intake for the prevention of urinary stone formation in people with a history of urinary stones (secondary prevention). This trial randomised 220 participants (110 participants in the intervention group with increased water intake and 110 in the control group with standard water intake). Increased water intake was defined as achieving a urine volume of at least 2.0 L per day by drinking water. Based on this study, increased water intake may decrease stone recurrences (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84; 199 participants; low-certainty evidence); this corresponds to 149 fewer (43 fewer to 205 fewer) stone recurrences per 1000 participants with 270 stone recurrence per 1000 participants over five years in the control group. Increased water intake may also prolong the time to urinary stone recurrence compared to standard water intake (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79; 199 participants; low-certainty evidence); based on a stone recurrence rate of 270 per 1000 participants over five years, this corresponds to 152 fewer (209 fewer to 50 fewer) recurrences per 1000 participants. For both outcomes we downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision. We found no evidence for the outcome of adverse events AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no RCT evidence on the role of increased water intake for primary prevention of urinary stones. For secondary prevention, increased water intake achieving a urine volume of at least 2.0 L/day may reduce urinary stone recurrence and prolong time to recurrence for people with a history of urinary stone disease. However, our confidence in these findings is limited. We did not find evidence for adverse events.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — water intake augmentation may be offered for women with low baseline intake. The guideline states, "When women with rUTIs have a water intake below 1.5 L/day (50 oz), clinicians may offer increased water intake for prophylaxis" (Conditional Recommendation; Grade C). In one trial of women with baseline < 1.5 L/day (N = 140; mean age 36 years), increasing intake above 1.5 L reduced recurrences (1.7 versus 3.2 UTI episodes over 12 months; p < 0.001), reduced the likelihood of at least 3 episodes (< 10% versus 88%), and lengthened intervals between episodes (143 versus 84.4 days; p < 0.001). The intervention provided three 500 mL water bottles daily, increasing intake from 0.9 L/day to 2.2 L/day compared with no change in controls, and "increasing water intake may be a low‑risk, effective method" to reduce rUTI risk.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^0e22ecfe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Alternatives to sugar‐sweetened beverages

Plain water has been the most commonly used source of hydration for the largest part of the evolution of the human species (Wolf 2008). In the context of obesity and obesity‐related diseases, increased consumption of drinking water has been linked to a reduced total energy intake among certain populations (Daniels 2010; Muckelbauer 2013). This effect of drinking water on energy intake may be due to a concomitantly reduced intake of caloric beverages, and possibly also to a reduced intake of solid foods when water is consumed with or before meals, even though this second effect is disputed (Daniels 2010; Muckelbauer 2013). Current dietary guidelines therefore recommend drinking water as a preferred alternative to SSB (DGE 2015; USDA 2015b).

### Commentary: tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-an update [^20e69b66]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dehydration

Recommendation 22: We suggest that a clinical assessment should be performed prior to initiation to identify risk factors for dehydration, fluid retention and/or dilution hyponatraemia.

Recommendation 23: We suggest that people with ADPKD, normal thirst and an eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m² should be informed of the increased need for hydration throughout the day and to ensure regular access to fluids.

Recommendation 24: We suggest that people with ADPKD and an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² or those with a clinical contraindication to high fluid intake should drink to thirst and/or follow individualised clinical advice.

Given the need for high compensatory water intake before starting tolvaptan, people with ADPKD should be assessed for potential fluid intake issues and ability to meet the increased fluid requirements alongside their lifestyle and existing comorbidities. People with a compromised capacity to perceive and communicate thirst may be at higher risk of dehydration and hypernatremia. Otsuka advises healthcare professionals to instruct people taking tolvaptan to water when thirsty, and throughout the day and night if awake. In clinical practice, the advice often given to people with ADPKD taking tolvaptan is to match their intake to their urine output, but this can be difficult to measure in practice. Target daily fluid intake volumes are often given but there is no clear evidence for any specific target volume. Best practice would be to personalise fluid intake for individual patients. In cases of reduced kidney function (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) or comorbidities such as heart failure, we suggest that people on tolvaptan should be advised to drink to thirst or have a lower fluid intake recommendation due to the risk of fluid overload.

### Oral hydration before and after hip replacement: the notion behind every action [^3bfcaaea]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Historically, the appropriateness of intraoperative fluid balance has gone through phases promoting liberalization, goal-directed fluid therapy, or a zero-balance approach, with hip replacement never really attracting the attention of researchers. At present, over 500 patients every day undergo hip replacement just in Italyand United Kingdom. We believe that a true understanding of the physiology of fluids and electrolytes is necessary also in this major orthopedic surgery. Effectively, the fluid management must be projected in time, remodeling pharmacotherapy or lifestyle habits affecting the balance before surgery. Patients should be recommended to follow a healthy diet that provides up to 500 mL of water from non-liquid food. If this dietary requirement is satisfied, then men must be instructed to daily drink 10 glasses of water (glass ≈200 mL) and women up to 8 glasses, which should be evenly distributed over the 16 waking hours (1 glass every 1.5–2 hours). On the day of surgery, water is allowed until 2 hours before the induction of anesthesia, being always the reference choice over caffeinated or sugar-sweetened beverages. Other clear fluids can be pulp-free extracts from a small quantity of fresh fruit or vegetables. In determining the correct fluid management, the perioperative staff must consider the reduced water output from urine, respiration, and exudation, the extent of the bleeding, the intravenous volumes administered in theatre, the endogenous water production, and the exogenous water introduced with food (Table 1).

Table 1.
Daily water balance for patients undergoing hip replacement.

The core of fluid management is mastering the undesirable changes in volume, tonicity, composition, and distribution of body fluids that undermine the appropriate central euvolemia. The practices of oral hydration are usually addressed according to local experiences and procedures. However, we reasoned that it is suitable for most patients on the day of surgery to drink no more than 1 L to be evenly distributed in 12 hours (apart from the 8 hours of sleep, the 2 hours of preoperative fasting, and the 2 hours of anesthetic and surgical times). In consideration of the different points of view that we reported, we conclude that staying closer to dehydration is more acceptable than liberalizing water intake until resumption of normal physiological functions. Great value is placed on patient experience, and we believe that the patient's journey and outcome would be highly enhanced if both patients and health professionals are instructed on the quantity, quality, and timing of drinking water.

### A new proposed guidance system for beverage consumption in the United States [^84f2adb7]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The Beverage Guidance Panel was assembled to provide guidance on the relative health and nutritional benefits and risks of various beverage categories. The beverage panel was initiated by the first author. The Panel's purpose is to attempt to systematically review the literature on beverages and health and provide guidance to the consumer. An additional purpose of the Panel is to develop a deeper dialog among the scientific community on overall beverage consumption patterns in the United States and on the great potential to change this pattern as a way to improve health. Over the past several decades, levels of overweight and obesity have increased across all population groups in the United States. Concurrently, an increased daily intake of 150–300 kcal (for different age-sex groups) has occurred, with approximately 50% of the increased calories coming from the consumption of calorically sweetened beverages. The panel ranked beverages from the lowest to the highest value based on caloric and nutrient contents and related health benefits and risks. Drinking water was ranked as the preferred beverage to fulfill daily water needs and was followed in decreasing value by tea and coffee, low-fat (1.5% or 1%) and skim (nonfat) milk and soy beverages, noncalorically sweetened beverages, beverages with some nutritional benefits (fruit and vegetable juices, whole milk, alcohol, and sports drinks), and calorically sweetened, nutrient-poor beverages. The Panel recommends that the consumption of beverages with no or few calories should take precedence over the consumption of beverages with more calories.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^3f5d659f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dietary water restriction counseling — Attempts at water restriction commonly are futile if sodium limitation is not observed simultaneously, and reducing a patient's water intake alone is not prudent most of the time because excessive sodium ingestion increases ECF osmolality and stimulates thirst; advising water limitation without curtailing sodium intake will cause suffering from unnecessary thirst.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Drinking water from private wells and risks to children [^4a9cd559]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Drinking water from private wells — sodium and chloride content and guidance — The sodium content of drinking water varies from 4 to 80 mg/L, with a mean concentration of 28 mg/L. Adults have an estimated adequate and safe intake of 1100 to 3300 mg/day and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2300 mg/day; infant requirements vary from 115 to 750 mg/day, with some sources recommending less than 200 mg/day. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not mandate a maximum sodium level, the Drinking Water Equivalence Level recommends that sodium levels not exceed 20 mg/L, and the secondary MCL for chloride is 250 mg/L. Hypertension is associated with increased daily sodium intake, and home reverse osmosis units can remove sodium and chloride.

### Associations between hydration state and pregnancy complications, maternal-infant outcomes: protocol of a prospective observational cohort study [^56d7ae96]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to promote enough water intake, it is necessary to propose recommendations on water intake for pregnant women. Only some countries or organizations have made specific recommendations on water intake for pregnant women: 2.7 L/d is recommended by the American Institute of Medicine and 4.8 L/d is advised by the World Health Organization (WHO). A survey of dietary guidelines in 84 countries revealed that only 8 countries had quantitative recommendations for fluid intake. Of the four editions of Dietary Guidelines (1989, 1997, 2007, and 2016) released in China, the first two editions had no recommendation for fluid intake. In 2007, the recommended amount of daily fluid intake was 1.2 L/d for adults, but no recommendation was given for pregnant women. In 2016, the recommendation was 2.7 L/d for women and 3.0 L/d for men and pregnant women. However, the recommendation for water intake for pregnant women was based on data of the water intake survey among pregnant women in other countries, not the data in China. Water requirements vary among pregnant women in different countries due to differences in dietary pattern, environment, and other factors; thus, it is necessary to undertake studies related to water intake during pregnancy in China.

Two hypotheses are proposed in this study: one is that some pregnant women are dehydrated due to having insufficient water intake and the other is that dehydration has negative effects on pregnancy and maternal and infant outcomes. The objectives of this study are, firstly, to investigate the fluid intake among pregnant women, secondly, to assess their hydration state, and finally, to investigate the associations with pregnancy complications and maternal-infant outcomes. This preliminary exploratory study on will provides some related reference data for updating the recommendation for adequate water intake among pregnant women. In addition, it will provide some evidences on water-related education. Based on this preliminary study, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required for the development of clinical guidelines and recommendations. The ultimate goals are to promote adequate water intake, to maintain optimal hydration state, and to improve mater health and birth outcomes.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^df80ce43]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration principles

Healthy humans are generally well hydratedwith a day-to-day variation in total body water of 0.2%–0.7% of body mass. However, the rise in sweat rate when exercising in the heat can dramatically change this fluid balance. A reduction in total body water is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolalitythat will increase the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating, reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperatureand decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. Dehydration will therefore exacerbate the rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain imposed by exercising in the heat, thus reducing exercise heat tolerance. Given the potential limit in accessing and ingesting fluid during the competition (see further), the general principle of hydration should be to avoid hypohydration (less than 2% body mass) during the periods of training in the heat, especially immediately before and during intense training and competition exercise in the heat. Any increase in fluid consumption should be progressive and not limited to competition day as an acute increase in fluid absorption may first increase the urine production. The fluid needs for an athlete training in the heat are highly individual but consistent within the individual when influencing variables are consistent. Fluid needs should be adapted based on changes in body mass and/or plasma osmolality and/or urine specific gravity. Hydration measures should be obtained in the morning to avoid confounding effects of recent diet and exercise. The following examples can also be used as a general guide at first before individualised data are ascertained: 6 mL of fluid per kg of body mass every 2–3 hour, or 2 L per day plus 1–2 L per hour of exercise plus 1 L for each 5°C increase in ambient temperature above 21.5°C.

Recommendations

Hydration capacity during exercise itself is limited; therefore, athletes should ascertain sufficient fluid intake "out of exercise", from the days before and throughout the period of training/competing in the heat.
A simple way to monitor hydration status during a period of training/competing in the heat is to follow the weight–urine–thirst principle with daily monitoring of body mass (changes should remain < 1–2%), urine specific gravity (should remain < 1.020) or colour and thirst. If available to the team, plasma osmolality (< 290 mmol/kg) can be included in cases of suspected chronic dehydration.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^83c0eadc]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the general acknowledgment that an appropriate level of fluid intake and hydration status is important for health, there have been limited investigations to date assessing the relationship between fluid intake or hydration status and cognitive function. Existing evidence suggests that good hydration status may be associated with better cognitive test results and that mild, induced dehydration can impair cognitive abilities, but findings are not consistent and there are only a few studies exploring the relationship of hydration status and hardly any assessing amount of water intake, with cognitive performance in older community-dwelling adults.

Of the few relevant and recent studies that have been conducted, one cross-sectional analysis of 2506 community-dwelling older American adults (aged ≥ 60 years) from the Nutrition and Health Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014 cycles assessed both hydration status and water intake in relation to cognitive performance. In comparison with the present findings, this study found women (but not men) considered to be hydrated, based on a SOSM level between 285 and 289 mmol/L, had better attention and processing speeds, based on a Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST), than women not at optimal hydration. These cross-sectional findings differ from the present observations where global cognitive function, but not individual tests related to attention and processing, was associated with hydration status. Whereas, correspondingly, water intake (but not hydration status) was positively associated with DST-f, which is similar to the DSST in that it is an indicator of attention as well as short-term memory capacity, and this was seen across all older adults (both men and women). Additionally, in the NHANES study, cognitive test scores were significantly lower among adults who failed to meet EFSA recommendations on adequate intake (AI) of water in bivariate analyses, yet this significance was attenuated in the multivariable analyses among both women and men. Yet, using the alternative AI of daily water intake of 1500 mL or more, which is comparable to the highest drinking water intake group in the present study, women scored higher on the Animal Fluency Test, a measure of verbal fluency and hence executive function, and DSST than women with intake levels below this amount, and findings among men trended in the same direction.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^73c2aeba]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

ADPKD — Rationale and evidence for high water intake — The basal circulating arginine vasopressin (AVP) level typically ranges between 0.5 and 2 pg/ml, which results in a urine osmolality that is ~ 1–2-fold higher than the serum osmolality, and a urine volume of 1–3 l/d. The maximal suppression of AVP to < 0.5 pg/ml will produce a urine volume of > 3 l/d, but it requires a level of fluid consumption that exceeds population-based recommendations (> 8 l/d) and increases the risk for life-threatening hyponatremia. Overall, the empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing water intake to reduce kidney disease progression is limited, and long-term data include a single 3-year multicenter study comparing usual ad libitum water intake to individualized, prescribed, and closely monitored water intake intended to reduce urine osmolality to ≤ 270 mOsmol/kg, with a mean 24-hour urine volume of 3 l/d in the intervention group and 2.5 l/d in the control arm. In large studies, most people with ADPKD had a mean urine volume of 2.4 l/d at baseline, and in the El-Damanawi et al. study and the PREVENT-ADPKD trial in people with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² who increased water intake approximately 10% developed mild reversible hyponatremia without clinical significance. In the PREVENT-ADPKD study, the target osmolality of urine from a 24-hour test was achieved in only half of the prescribed water group and by 17% of the ad libitum water group, and serum copeptin levels were not different in the 2 groups.

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^26e4df3a]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1957 participants (mean age 65.0 ± 4.9 years and 50.5% women) were available for the assessment of water and fluid intake and 1192 participants for the assessment of hydration status after excluding missing values or implausible data (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the study population according to sex, water (tap and bottle) intake amount, and hydration status. The median (range) consumption of drinking water intake in men and women was 900 (0 to 3100) and 900 (0 to 2700) mL/day, respectively. Compared with participants in the group with the lowest drinking water intake (< 500 mL/day), those with the highest drinking water intake (1.8 to 3.1 L/day) were more likely to be younger (p < 0.001), have a higher BMI (p = 0.001), and have a lower alcohol intake (p < 0.001). Compared to participants considered to be hydrated according to serum osmolarity status, participants considered to be dehydrated tended to be older (p = 0.008), women (p = 0.008), have type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001), have depressive symptoms (p = 0.025), and less likely to drink alcohol (p = 0.002). Participants involved in the present analyses did not differ from the rest of the participants enrolled in the PREDIMED-Plus trial in terms of age, sex, BMI, and prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Furthermore, 80% of participants (69% of men and 90% of women) met the EFSA fluid intake recommendations based on questionnaire responses, yet serum osmolarity values indicated over 50% of participants were physiologically dehydrated with only 10% of participants being considered physiologically hydrated based on serum osmolarity levels.

### Influence of water drinking on resting energy expenditure in overweight children [^77a39115]. International Journal of Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It was previously demonstrated that drinking water significantly elevates the resting energy expenditure (REE) in adults, and that low water intake is associated with obesity and lesser success in weight reduction. This study addressed the potential of water drinking to increase the REE in children, as an additional tool for weight management.

Objective

To examine the effect of drinking water on the REE of overweight children.

Design

A total of 21 overweight, otherwise-healthy children (age 9.9 ± 1.4 years, 11 males) drank 10 mL kg⁻¹ cold water (4 °C). REE was measured before and after water ingestion, for 66 min. The main outcome measure was the change in mean REE from baseline values.

Results

Immediately after drinking water, there was a transient decrease in REE, from a baseline value of 3.32 ± 1.15kilojoule (kJ) per min to 2.56 ± 0.66kJ per min at minute 3 (P = 0.005). A subsequent rise in REE was then observed, which was significantly higher than baseline after 24min (3.89 ± 0.78kJ/min (P = 0.021)), and at most time points thereafter. Maximal mean REE values were seen at 57 min after water drinking (4.16 ± 1.43kJ per min (P = 0.004)), which were 25% higher than baseline. REE was significantly correlated with age, height, weight and fat-free mass; the correlations with maximal REE values after water drinking were stronger than with baseline REE values.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated an increase of up to 25% in REE following the drinking of 10 mL kg⁻¹ of cold water in overweight children, lasting for over 40min. Consuming the recommended daily amount of water for children could result in an energy expenditure equivalent to an additional weight loss of about 1.2 kg per year. These findings reinforce the concept of water-induced REE elevation shown in adults, suggesting that water drinking could assist overweight children in weight loss or maintenance, and may warrant emphasis in dietary guidelines against the obesity epidemic.

### The medicinal use of water in renal disease [^74635153]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Although water is essential for life, its use for medicinal purposes is not universally accepted. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to determine where the evolving state of knowledge lies regarding the benefits of water as a therapy for renal diseases. In the past two decades, water has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent in nephrolithiasis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in particular. In nephrolithiasis, the benefit of drinking water beyond that demanded by thirst is a cornerstone of therapy for both primary and secondary disease. In CKD, recent observational studies suggest a strong, direct association between preservation of renal function and fluid intake. In PKD, increased water intake slows renal cyst growth in animals via direct vasopressin suppression, and pharmacologic blockade of renal vasopressin-V2 receptors has recently been shown to be efficacious in retarding cyst growth in PKD patients. Although evidence is lacking to support increased water intake in the general population, available evidence indicates that individuals who are at risk for nephrolithiasis as well as those with CKD and PKD may benefit from 3 to 4l of urine output each day, a level of excretion that is likely to be safe.

### Is it safe to reduce water intake in the overactive bladder population? A systematic review [^66b7a347]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Overactive bladder imposes a significant socioeconomic burden on the health care system. It is a commonly held belief that increased fluid intake (8 glasses of water per day) is beneficial for health. However, increased fluid intake exacerbates overactive bladder symptoms. Thus, it is imperative that clinicians appropriately educate patients for whom increased water intake may be detrimental (women with overactive bladder), in contrast to patients with comorbidities that necessitate increased water intake (nephrolithiasis). We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the potential health advantages of increased water intake and identify specific subpopulations that need increased hydration.

Materials and Methods

We systematically reviewed published articles from 1972 through 2017 on PubMed® and the Cochrane Library. The data were reviewed independently by 2 individuals. Studies were included if they explored water intake in relation to the risk of a particular disease.

Results

Level 1 evidence supported increased fluid intake in patients with nephrolithiasis. There was no available evidence to support increased fluid intake in patients with cardiovascular disease, constipation, venous thromboembolism, headaches, cognitive function or bladder cancer. Dehydration may exacerbate some conditions, specifically chronic constipation and headache intensity. Increased fluid intake may have a role in preventing stroke recurrence but not in preventing primary stroke.

Conclusions

The available reviewed literature suggests no benefit to drinking 8 glasses of water per day in patients without nephrolithiasis. Also, excess fluid intake can exacerbate symptoms of overactive bladder.

### Patiromer (Veltassa) [^a41f87f1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	General Information

Administer Veltassa at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other oral medications except those shown to not have a clinically important interaction [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not heat Veltassa (e.g., microwave) or add to heated foods or liquids. Do not take Veltassa in its dry form.

2.2 	Recommended Dosing and Titration

The recommended starting dose of Veltassa varies with age and is shown below. Multiple packets may be used to achieve the prescribed dose. Monitor serum potassium and adjust the dose of Veltassa based on the serum potassium level and the desired target range. The dose may be increased or decreased, as necessary, to reach the desired serum potassium concentration, up to a maximum dose of 25.2 grams once daily in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.

Adults: The recommended starting dose of Veltassa is 8.4 grams patiromer orally once daily. The dose can be up-titrated based on serum potassium level at 1-week or longer intervals, in increments of 8.4 grams.

Pediatric Patients Ages 12 years and older: The recommended starting dose of Veltassa is 4 grams patiromer orally once daily. The dose can be titrated based on serum potassium level at 1-week or longer intervals, in increments of 4 grams.

2.3	Preparation of Veltassa

Prepare each dose immediately prior to administration.

Measure 1/3 cup of water. Pour half of the water into a glass, then add the packet(s) of Veltassa and stir. Add the remaining half of the water and stir thoroughly. The powder will not dissolve and the mixture will look cloudy. Add more water to the mixture as needed for desired consistency.

Drink the mixture immediately. If powder remains in the glass after drinking, add more water, stir and drink immediately. Repeat as needed to ensure the entire dose is administered.

Other beverages or soft foods (e.g., apple sauce, yogurt, pudding) can be used instead of water to prepare the mixture by following the same steps as described above. A minimum volume of 45 mL (3 tablespoons) can be used to prepare doses up to and including 4 grams patiromer.

The potassium content of liquids or soft foods used to prepare the mixture should be considered as part of the dietary recommendations on potassium intake for each individual patient.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^cf662663]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^c17df7c6]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Treating nOH — step 2: non-pharmacological measures

The next step in the treatment algorithm is to have the patient incorporate a number of simple non-pharmacological measures into their daily routines to address symptoms due to nOH. From a practical perspective, these measures are often incorporated into a treatment plan in parallel to the changes to pharmacology outlined in step 1 above. For patients who are experiencing syncope, near-syncope, or falls, there is some urgency to eliminating destabilizing postural changes. Hence, non-pharmacologic measures may be used individually, but are most effective when used in combination or while concomitantly titrating pharmacologic treatments.

Blood volume repletion

Patients with nOH require interventions which are aimed at ensuring normal or even expanded blood volume. Many patients with nOH, especially older patients, are often blood volume depleted due to inadequate oral fluid intake. This may be due to voluntary restriction of intake for self-management of common conditions causing urinary urgency and urinary frequency including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), overactive bladder, neurogenic bladder, stress incontinence or similar bladder dysfunctions as are commonly seen in many neurodegenerative disorders. However, the most common identifiable and readily treatable problem is decreased daily water intake. Most patients are unaware of the volume of water intake necessary during a typical day. A minimum of 64 oz (approximately 2 L) of water daily is recommended to achieve adequate daily hydration, although many clinicians recommend over 100 oz (3 L) daily to ensure blood volume repletion, depending on cardiac status. Modifications in fluid volume recommendations also need to be considered in geographic areas with warmer weather or during the summer season.

In addition to maintaining intravascular blood volume and to support standing blood pressure, patients with nOH who rapidly consume (within 5 min) 16 oz (approximately 500 ml) of free water can raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mmHg within 5 min. The effect is due to a hypo-osmolar reflex in the portal circulation and can last for an hour to help alleviate the symptoms of nOH experienced on standing. Liquids other than water do not provide the same blood pressure response. Thus, proper hydration can produce both acute and long-lasting significant clinical benefits to patients with nOH.

### Deficiency and excess of groundwater iodine and their health associations [^e747bd7e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Integrated iodine provision is invariably necessary since daily iodine intake is jointly influenced by food, edible salt, and drinking water. Most foods have low native iodine content and contribute little to dietary intake, though marine foods ingestion could be important to a small number of countries in East Asia, North America and Europe. As an auxiliary measure, staple food iodine fortification (e.g. agronomic biofortification on wheat or rice) might be of potential in the short- to medium-term. Salt has a proven record as an excellent vehicle for iodine fortification to maintain world population iodine sufficiency(Fig. 6a). A relatively overlooked issue concerns iodine in drinking water, which has recently been reported as a major contributor to excess iodine intake in dozens of countries. Noting that the importance of drinking water as a major iodine donor in the dietary structure, we estimate iodine-related health risks under three scenarios with varying proportions of groundwater in drinking water utilization aimed to design the optimal scheme of iodine provision. Scenario 1 denotes thyroid risks from groundwater iodine as sole source of drinking water iodine (Fig. 6b). Scenario 2 considers the thyroid risks after reducing the proportions of groundwater in drinking water utilization (Case 1: 2010 ~ 2014 water supply scheme, Supplementary Fig. 12; Case 2: 2015 ~ 2019 water supply scheme, Fig. 6e). Scenario 3 further evaluates the thyroid risks relevant to iodized salt under 2015 ~ 2019 water supply scheme, mainly considering current daily salt intake in China (Case 1: 9.3 g/day) (Supplementary Fig. 13) and that recommended by WHO (Case 2: 5.0 g/day) (Fig. 6h). As a result, thyroid risks are significantly reduced (mean R E reduced from 3.13 in Scenario 1 to 1.09 ~ 1.29 in Scenario 2) by decreasing the proportion of groundwater in iodine-excess regions (Fig. 6c, f). With the promotion of iodized salt (Fig. 6f, i) in the iodine-deficient regions, thyroid risk is also greatly reduced (mean R D reduced from 15.08 ~ 16.76 in Scenario 2 to 0.37 ~ 0.66 in Scenario 3). Otherwise, higher proportion of groundwater utilization in iodine-excess regions would induce greater risks (mean R E 0.94 ~ 1.55 in Scenario 3) peaked in Zone II (mean R E 1.15 ~ 1.76) (Fig. 6i).

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^b611a559]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration is a fundamental aspect of clinical practice and yet it is an under-researched topic, particularly in older people, leading to many areas of uncertainty. There are two types of dehydration; hypertonic, which is a water deficit, and isotonic, which is a deficit of both water and salt. Individual clinical signs and bedside tests are poor diagnostic tools, making dehydration difficult to identify. However, the diagnostic value of a holistic clinical approach is not known. The gold-standard clinical test for dehydration is serum osmolality, but this cannot diagnose isotonic dehydration and may delay diagnosis in acute situations. Salivary osmolality point-of-care testing is a promising and rapid new diagnostic test capable of detecting both hypertonic and isotonic dehydration in older people, but further evidence to support its clinical utility is needed. Daily fluid requirements may be less than previously thought in adults, but the evidence specific to older people remains limited. Hydration via the subcutaneous route is safer and easier to initiate than the intravenous route but is limited by infusion speed and volume. Prompting older adults more frequently to drink, offering a wider selection of drinks and using drinking vessels with particular features can result in small increases in oral intake in the short-term. The ongoing clinically-assisted hydration at end of life (CHELsea II) trial will hopefully provide more evidence for the emotive issue of hydration at the end of life.

### Water (bacteriostatic water) [^551af38b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

The small volume of fluid provided by Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP when used only as a pharmaceutic aid for diluting or dissolving drugs for parenteral injection, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid balance except possibly in very small infants.

### Self-reported lifestyle behaviours in families with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes across six European countries: a cross-sectional analysis from the feel4Diabetes-study [^57a263fa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is highly preventable through adopting a healthy lifestyle. Several lifestyle behaviours contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, including insufficient levels of physical activity (PA), high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) and unhealthy dietary behaviours. Guidelines and recommendations for these behaviours have been developed for children and adults. PA guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommend children to engage in at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) per day and adults to engage in at least 150 min of MVPA per week (corresponding to at least 30 min of MVPA during 5 days). For SB, studies and national guidelines recommend for both children and adults to minimise the amount of time spent in prolonged sitting and to break up long periods of sitting as often as possible. Further, specifically for children it is recommended not to exceed two hours of recreational screen-time per day. Finally, the WHO recommends to consume at least 400 g of fruit and vegetables, corresponding to five portions per day (for both children and adults), and to limit the daily consumption of unhealthy snacks and soft drinks (not exceeding WHO recommendations for free sugar, < 10% of total energy intake). In addition, recommendations based on previous research, suggest to consume breakfast on a daily basis and the European Food Safety Authority recommends a daily water (fluid) intake of 1.6–2.0 L of water per day for girls and women and boys and men respectively.

### Projecting future fluid intake of Chinese children in a warming world [^c419219e]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Water is an essential component of human life and accounts for ~60–70% of body mass, playing a crucial role in maintaining optimal health and function of various physiological processes. Both excessive and insufficient water intake negatively impact human health. Adequate water intake sustains fundamental body functions and fosters cognitive alertness, concentration and overall academic performance, which is particularly critical for school-aged children and adolescents in a phase of rapid physical and cognitive growth characterized by increased metabolic rates. Ensuring adequate water intake is essential to support educational progress, participation in extracurricular activities, and overall well-being. Therefore, there is a need to establish water intake guidelines and enhance public awareness about the significance of maintaining sufficient hydration. An investigation on water consumption among National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants in the United States from 1999 to 2002 revealed an average daily total water intake (including both foods and beverages) of approximately 1.4 L for children and adolescents (aged 4–18 years). In China, only three surveys have been carried out specifically focusing on total fluid intake (TFI), which encompasses drinking water and all other types of beverages –. The Chinese Nutrition Society recommends a daily TFI of approximately 1 L for children aged 7–10 years, 1.3–1.4 L for boys aged 11–17 years, and 1.1 to 1.2 L for girls aged 11–17 years.

However, TFI often falls short of adequate intake (AI) recommendations in some countries. Such recommendations usually consider age, sex, activity, and environmental conditions. Prior research has indicated the association between environmental temperature and water consumption –. For instance, a cross-sectional community study conducted in the US-Mexico population showed a 28% increase in water consumption when outdoor air temperatures exceeded 90 °F. Another study involving Japanese adults revealed that total water intake was about 10% higher during summer compared to winter. During warmer months, individuals exhibit higher water intake to regulate body temperature and replace lost fluids, while cooler months witness comparatively lower water consumption. However, none of these studies have thoroughly investigated the exposure-response relationships between ambient temperature and TFI, and understanding this association will be helpful in assessing how individuals modify their fluid intake in response to different ambient temperatures conditions.

Iodine use for water disinfection — intake and precautions — states that disinfecting 3 L per day with 2 to 4 mg·L⁻¹ of iodine would yield 6 to 12 mg daily intake, that tablet regimens can result in 16 to 32 mg/d, and therefore iodine use should be limited to short periods; those planning prolonged use should undergo thyroid evaluation. It further specifies that certain groups should not use iodine for water treatment: pregnant women, those with known hypersensitivity to iodine, persons with a history of thyroid disease (even if controlled), persons with a strong family history of thyroid disease (thyroiditis), and persons from countries with chronic iodine deficiency.

### Improving hydration among hospitalised older adults in an acute geriatric ward with a bundled multi-component intervention [^28dcc1f2]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Previously, a service improvement project in Singapore Changi General Hospital (CGH) was carried out in 2020, trialling the use of a dysphagia cup to encourage oral intake in geriatric inpatients. The study found that 90% of geriatric patients did not consume the recommended daily fluid allowance of 1.6 L/day for females and 2.0 L/day for males as recommended by ESPEN guidelines. With similar problems of inadequate oral hydration among geriatric inpatients in a local institution, the CGH study provided valuable insight into the potential issues that our study could face. The CGH study noted that the mean amount of water consumed daily by hospitalised older adults was 1030 mL (range of 500–2200 mL), with only 10% meeting the lower limit of daily recommended water consumption. Therefore, when caring for hospitalised older adults, the practical approach to aiming for optimal hydration is to achieve the best oral fluid intake possible under ongoing circumstances even though it may not meet the recommended daily fluid allowance as per guidelines. A practical target when aiming for the best daily oral fluid intake among hospitalised older adults was 1 L based on the mean amount of water consumed in our local geriatric inpatient population and literature. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the percentage of geriatric inpatients who consume at least 1 L of fluids per day, analyse the problem of poor oral hydration, identify workflow gaps, then generate and test solutions that would improve oral hydration.

Re-treatment of Paget's Disease

Re-treatment with alendronate sodium tablets may be considered, following a six-month post-treatment evaluation period in patients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum alkaline phosphatase, which should be measured periodically. Re-treatment may also be considered in those who failed to normalize their serum alkaline phosphatase.

2.6 Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients to do the following:

Take alendronate sodium tablets at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day with plain water only [see Patient Counseling Information (17.2)]. Other beverages (including mineral water), food, and some medications are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1]. Waiting less than 30 minutes, or taking alendronate sodium tablets with food, beverages (other than plain water) or other medications will lessen the effect of alendronate sodium tablets by decreasing its absorption into the body.

Take alendronate sodium tablets upon arising for the day. To facilitate delivery to the stomach and thus reduce the potential for esophageal irritation, an alendronate sodium tablet should be swallowed with a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces). Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes and until after their first food of the day. Alendronate sodium tablets should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse experiences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.2)].

### Water intake, hydration status and 2-year changes in cognitive performance: a prospective cohort study [^8645bd2b]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The FFQ collected data on food intake based on the year prior to the visit according to nine possible frequency categories, which ranged from "never or almost never" to " > 6 portions/day" and based on the dietary guidelines for the Spanish population. The information collected was converted into grams per day, multiplying portion sizes by consumption frequency and dividing the result by the period assessed. Ten food groups composed of vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, dairy beverages, meat and poultry, fats, nuts, fish/seafood, and other foods were determined to assess the contribution of foods to total water intake. Food groups and energy intake were estimated using Spanish food composition tables. Drinking water intake, water intake from all fluids, total water intake, EFSA total fluid water intake (TFWI), and EFSA total water intake (TWI) were computed (descriptions summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1). Drinking water intake was estimated based on tap and bottled water intakes based on BIAQ responses. Water intake from all fluids was computed from tap and bottled water, plus water from other beverages based on responses to the BIAQ. Total water intake encompassed water intake from all fluids in addition to water present in food sources based on responses to the FFQ. Water intake was further categorized based on established reference values. The EFSA recommendations for total water intake (EFSA TWI) for older adults (2.5 L/day and 2.0 L/day for men and women, respectively) in conditions of moderate environmental temperature and moderate physical activity were used as reference values. Further categorizations were determined based on total water intake from fluids alone, based on EFSA recommendations (EFSA TFWI), where recommended levels for older adults are set to at least 2.0 L/day and 1.6 L/day for men and women, respectively.

Assessment of hydration status

Hydration status was estimated based on calculated serum osmolarity (SOSM), which is considered a more reliable biomarker of hydration status than urinary markers in older adults. Fasting serum glucose, urea, sodium, and potassium were measured by standard methods. Blood urea nitrogen was determined from urea values using the conversion factor of 0.357 and reported in mmol/L. With all relevant serum analyte measures presented in mmol/L, SOSM was estimated using the following equation:

Based on this equation, dehydration, impending dehydration, and hydrated statuses were defined as SOSM > 300, 295–300, and < 295 mmol/L, respectively.

### Relation between urinary hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake in healthy adults [^5ece2743]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Recent work by Armstrong et al. established reference ranges for various urinary and plasma hydration biomarkers relative to deciles of total water intake volume; this suggests the possibility of a linear association between intake and hydration biomarkers. If strong linear relations exist between urinary hydration biomarkers and fluid intake, it may be possible to link daily fluid intake volume to biomarkers that are easily measured. This would represent an important advancement in the ability to monitor daily fluid intake, hydration and disease risk, and may help individuals determine a daily fluid intake volume appropriate for their individual hydration requirements.

Our research group recently published an assessment of the impact of habitually different total fluid intake behaviors (low consumption: < 1.2 l per day versus high consumption: > 2.0 l per day) on multiple biomarkers of hydration status in free-living conditions. Hydration biomarkers in first-morning and 24-h urine (24hU) collections, but not plasma osmolality, were significantly different between low and high volume drinkers, and urine osmolality, volume and specific gravity (USG) were distributed over a broad range of values. The study database also included individuals whose fluid consumption fell between the established low and high drinker thresholds, and who were therefore excluded from the previous low/high analysis. This presented us with an opportunity to further explore the associations between hydration biomarkers and total fluid intake over a wide range of fluid intake behaviors. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the strength of correlations between total daily fluid intake and urinary hydration biomarkers in sedentary adults in free-living conditions, and to model fluid intake relative to urinary hydration biomarkers using simple and multivariate regression methods.

### Water intake and urinary hydration biomarkers in children [^c07f4dbc]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

The aims of the study were as follows: (1) examine fluid intake and urinary hydration markers of children in Greece, (2) determine the calculated relative risk of hypohydration in children who did not meet the recommendations for daily water intake provided by the Institute of Medicine and the European Food Safety Authority compared with those who did and (3) analyze the efficacy of the recommendations as a method to achieve euhydration in children.

Subjects/Methods

One hundred and fifty Greek boys and girls (age 9–13) recorded their fluid intake for 2 consecutive days. A 24-h urine collection was obtained during the second day. Fluid intake records were analyzed for total water intake from fluids (TWI-F), and urine samples were analyzed for osmolality, color, specific gravity and volume. Urine osmolality ⩾800mmol/kg H₂O was defined as hypohydration.

Results

Water intake from fluids was 1729 (1555–1905) and 1550 (1406–1686) ml/d for boys and girls, respectively. Prevalence of hypohydration was 33% (44% of boys, 23% of girls). Children who failed to meet TWI-F recommendations demonstrated a risk of hypohydration that was 1.99–2.12 times higher than those who met recommendations (P ≤ 0.01). Boys between 9 and 13 years displayed urine osmolality of 777 (725–830) mmol/kg, and urine specific gravity of 1.021 (1.019–1.022), which was higher than those in girls between 9–13 years (P ≤ 0.015), and > 27% were classified as hypohydrated despite meeting water intake recommendations.

Conclusions

Failure to meet TWI-F guidelines increased calculated relative risk of hypohydration in children. Boys between 9 and 13 years are at greater hazard regardless of meeting guidelines and may require greater water intake to avoid elevated urine concentration and ensure adequate hydration.

### New horizons in the diagnosis and management of dehydration [^feceafac]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Dehydration may, in its simplest form be considered a deficiency of water, but even this simplistic definition is controversial. The lack of formal definition has hindered academic progress, with several professional societies differing in even the basic principles of whether the definition should include factors such as osmolality, intake or output, clinical findings and volume distribution. In 2019, a group of UK academics convened to reach consensus. The group which identifies as multidisciplinary was drawn from anaesthesia/critical care (50%), sports science, cardiology and dietetics and was largely based in southeast England. The group of 12 experts used expert opinion, literature reviews and a modified Delphi process to produce a series of recommendations.

Two types of dehydration were defined by the consensus group:

Hypertonic dehydration, an uncompensated, predominantly pure water deficit (e.g. inadequate water intake or excessive loss) resulting in a raised extracellular osmolality.
Isotonic dehydration, which is a deficiency of water with an associated reduction in salt (e.g. caused by diarrhoea) which does not increase the extracellular osmolality.

While these definitions may have a role in standardising diagnosis, the narrow geographical membership and lack of diverse expertise will likely lead to a lack of uptake by the wider community. However, the definitions are clear and compared with other existing definitions are easily translated into clinical practice.

### Nutrition in pressure injury prevention [^33329e2d]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Diet and hydration guidance for individuals at risk of pressure injuries — It is good practice to encourage individuals at risk of a pressure injury to consume a balanced diet that includes nutrient dense food and adequate hydration. For most individuals, nutritional requirements can be met with a healthy oral diet, and dietary/nutrition guidelines outline recommended dietary intake based on individualized circumstances (e.g., medical condition, lifestyle, demographics, geographic context, etc.). In healthy individuals who are adequately hydrated, water released from food and metabolism accounts for 20% or more of total water intake.
