## Question

what antibiotic is best for dishydrotic eczema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is best for dyshidrotic eczema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether dyshidrotic eczema is primarily inflammatory or infectious. Then, I should verify what high-quality evidence says about antibiotics in eczema without overt infection. Next, I will examine when antibiotics are actually indicated and which agents are reasonable choices. After that, I should review first-line anti-inflammatory therapies for dyshidrotic eczema. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note any special considerations for dyshidrotic presentations on the hands and feet.

> Let me first confirm the nature of dyshidrotic eczema. Dyshidrotic eczema, also called dyshidrosis or acute palmoplantar eczema, is a recurrent vesicular dermatitis of the palms and soles; it is fundamentally an inflammatory skin disease, not a primary bacterial infection, though secondary infection can occur during flares due to barrier disruption and scratching [^114uut3H] [^117XBtT5].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antibiotics in noninfected eczema before jumping to any drug names. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same point: antibiotics, whether topical or oral, do not improve outcomes in eczema without clear clinical infection, and their routine use is discouraged due to lack of benefit and risk of resistance and sensitization [^116C31qV] [^112n2eKj] [^1138dHf1] [^111rbf5V].

> Hold on, I should double-check the nuance about colonization versus infection. Staphylococcus aureus colonizes many patients with atopic dermatitis, and higher bacterial density correlates with severity, but colonization alone is not an indication for antibiotics; clinical benefit appears limited to settings with overt infection or very high bacterial burden, and even then the evidence is mixed and generally low quality [^114C3egS] [^112JWxeh].

> Next, I should review when antibiotics are actually indicated. I need to ensure I am aligning with guidelines: antibiotics are reserved for clinically infected eczema with features such as weeping, crusting, pustules, malodor, or systemic signs, and even then, the benefit is modest and must be balanced against resistance risks; in widespread or severe S. aureus infection, a short course of a first-generation cephalosporin may be considered, but this is not routine care for dyshidrotic eczema without infection [^111WtdJp] [^114MjUqB] [^114LqiK7].

> I will now examine reasonable antibiotic choices if infection is confirmed or strongly suspected while awaiting culture. For localized, mild secondary infection, topical mupirocin or fusidic acid are acceptable short-course options; mupirocin has shown comparable clinical success to oral cephalexin in secondarily infected eczema and is generally well tolerated, though local resistance patterns should guide selection and duration should be minimized to reduce resistance risk [^114tRxe9] [^114LqiK7] [^1138dHf1].

> But wait, what if the infection is more extensive or there is concern for MRSA? In that scenario, I should consider oral agents active against community staphylococci, such as cephalexin for MSSA, or clindamycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if MRSA is suspected based on local epidemiology or prior culture data; again, this is reserved for overt infection, not for uninflamed or minimally colonized dyshidrotic eczema [^114LqiK7] [^111WtdJp].

> Let me reconsider the original question about the "best antibiotic". Given that dyshidrotic eczema is inflammatory, the best approach is no routine antibiotic at all in the absence of clear infection; if infection is present, there is no single universally "best" antibiotic — choice should be guided by clinical severity, local resistance patterns, and patient factors, with a preference for the narrowest effective agent and the shortest effective course to support antimicrobial stewardship [^114LqiK7] [^1138dHf1] [^116C31qV].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy for dyshidrotic eczema itself. Potent topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone for acute flares, with calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus as steroid-sparing options; network meta-analyses consistently rank potent topical steroids and tacrolimus among the most effective topical anti-inflammatories for eczema, and small studies in dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema support the efficacy of both superpotent steroids and tacrolimus, often with rapid improvement when used correctly [^116a2u2o] [^111vkvTP] [^113SJwCM].

> I need to ensure supportive care is not overlooked. Liberal emollients, trigger avoidance, and education on proper application of anti-inflammatories are essential; for dyshidrotic eczema on the hands and feet, occlusion can enhance penetration of topical therapy, and addressing hyperhidrosis may reduce flares in selected patients, though evidence for anticholinergic agents in dyshidrotic eczema is limited to case reports and should be individualized [^115vFuj2] [^113ziywL].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make it actionable. There is no "best antibiotic" for dyshidrotic eczema itself because antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of clinical infection; treat the inflammation with potent topical corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors, reserve antibiotics for clearly infected lesions, choose narrow-spectrum agents like topical mupirocin for limited disease or oral beta-lactams for more extensive MSSA infection, and tailor MRSA-active therapy when appropriate, always using the shortest effective course and local resistance data to guide selection [^113SJwCM] [^111WtdJp] [^114tRxe9] [^114LqiK7].

---

There is **no single best antibiotic** for dyshidrotic eczema because antibiotics are not first-line therapy and are only used if there is a secondary bacterial infection [^114LqiK7] [^111WtdJp]. For localized infection, **topical mupirocin** is preferred for its efficacy and low resistance risk [^114tRxe9]; for widespread or severe infection, a short course of oral cephalexin or clindamycin is reasonable, guided by local resistance patterns [^111WtdJp] [^114LqiK7]. Routine antibiotic use is discouraged due to limited benefit and resistance risk; treat the underlying inflammation with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors and reserve antibiotics for confirmed infection [^116C31qV] [^116a2u2o].

## Indications for antibiotic use in dyshidrotic eczema

Antibiotics are **not indicated for uninfected dyshidrotic eczema**; they are reserved for secondary bacterial infection, most often due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes [^114C3egS]. Clinical signs of infection include weeping, crusting, pustules, erythema, warmth, tenderness, and systemic symptoms such as fever or malaise [^114SxvoB]. The decision to use antibiotics should be based on **clinical judgment**, culture results, and local resistance patterns [^114LqiK7].

## Recommended antibiotics for dyshidrotic eczema with secondary infection

### Topical antibiotics

Topical antibiotics are preferred for localized secondary bacterial infections in dyshidrotic eczema, with **mupirocin** as first-line therapy because of its efficacy, safety, and low resistance risk [^114tRxe9]. Alternative options include fusidic acid and retapamulin, though resistance concerns limit their use [^112pCvG3].

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage and administration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mupirocin | Localized secondary bacterial infection | Apply 2% ointment or cream twice daily for 7–10 days | - First-line therapy <br/> - Low resistance risk <br/> - Effective against S. aureus and S. pyogenes [^114tRxe9] |
| Fusidic acid | Localized secondary bacterial infection | Apply 2% cream or ointment twice daily for 7–10 days | - Alternative to mupirocin <br/> - Resistance concerns limit use [^112pCvG3] |
| Retapamulin | Localized secondary bacterial infection | Apply 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days | - Alternative to mupirocin <br/> - Limited availability in some regions [^115zLZM6] |

---

### Systemic antibiotics

Systemic antibiotics are indicated for widespread or severe secondary bacterial infections, or when topical therapy is impractical or ineffective. First-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin) are commonly recommended for their efficacy against S. aureus and S. pyogenes [^111WtdJp]. Clindamycin is an alternative, particularly in patients with penicillin allergy or when MRSA is suspected [^114LqiK7].

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dosage and administration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | Widespread or severe secondary bacterial infection | 250–500 mg orally four times daily for 7–10 days | - First-line systemic therapy <br/> - Effective against S. aureus and S. pyogenes [^notfound] |
| Clindamycin | Widespread or severe secondary bacterial infection, MRSA suspected | 300–450 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | - Alternative to cephalexin <br/> - Effective against MRSA [^114LqiK7] |
| Doxycycline | MRSA suspected or confirmed | 100 mg orally twice daily for 7–10 days | - Alternative to clindamycin <br/> - Effective against MRSA [^114LqiK7] |

---

## Antibiotics to avoid or use with caution

Certain antibiotics should be avoided or used with caution due to resistance patterns, side effects, or limited efficacy:

- **Topical neomycin**: High risk of allergic contact dermatitis and limited efficacy; avoid use [^113SJwCM].
- **Topical bacitracin**: High risk of allergic contact dermatitis; avoid use [^113SJwCM].
- **Topical fusidic acid**: Resistance concerns limit use; consider only if mupirocin is unavailable [^112pCvG3].
- **Oral macrolides (e.g. erythromycin)**: Limited efficacy against S. aureus; avoid use unless no alternatives are available [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic use in dyshidrotic eczema

Limited clinical evidence specifically addresses antibiotic use in dyshidrotic eczema; most data derive from studies of atopic dermatitis with secondary bacterial infection. A randomized controlled trial found no significant clinical benefit from adding topical or oral antibiotics to standard topical corticosteroid and emollient therapy in children with clinically infected eczema [^1141NJ9x]. Cochrane reviews likewise report **insufficient evidence** to support routine use of topical or systemic antibiotics in atopic dermatitis without overt infection, citing resistance risk and limited clinical benefit [^116C31qV] [^112JWxeh].

---

## Risks and side effects associated with antibiotic use

Antibiotic use carries several risks and side effects, including:

- **Allergic reactions**: Ranging from mild dermatitis to severe anaphylaxis [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic resistance**: Particularly concerning with topical antibiotics, leading to colonization with resistant organisms [^112pCvG3].
- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Common with systemic antibiotics, including nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia [^115zLZM6].
- **Secondary infections**: Such as fungal infections, particularly with systemic antibiotics [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatments for dyshidrotic eczema

Given the limited role of antibiotics, **alternative treatments focus on controlling inflammation, restoring the skin barrier, and preventing secondary infection**:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: First-line therapy for inflammation and pruritus [^112Jn4BH].
- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Alternative to corticosteroids, particularly for maintenance therapy [^1139ztJ3] [^112Jn4BH].
- **Emollients and moisturizers**: Essential for restoring the skin barrier and preventing secondary infection [^114zRFJS].
- **Phototherapy**: Effective for chronic or refractory cases [^115mZbVM].
- **Systemic therapies**: Such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, or biologics (e.g. dupilumab) for severe or refractory cases [^114Z4G5H] [^112SpssK].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **limited antibiotic use** in dyshidrotic eczema. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) recommend against adding topical antimicrobials to standard topical therapy in patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis without serious bacterial infection [^113SJwCM]. European guidelines similarly advise against long-term topical antibiotics because of resistance and sensitization risks [^1138dHf1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single best antibiotic** for dyshidrotic eczema; antibiotics are reserved for secondary bacterial infections. Topical mupirocin is the preferred first-line therapy for localized infections, while systemic antibiotics such as cephalexin or clindamycin are reserved for widespread or severe infections. Routine antibiotic use is discouraged due to limited clinical benefit and resistance risk. Alternative treatments focusing on inflammation control, skin barrier restoration, and infection prevention remain the cornerstone of management.

### What is the evidence base for atopic eczema treatments? A summary of published randomized controlled trials [^111rbf5V]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic eczema (AE) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition. While many AE treatment options are available, the evidence to support their efficacy varies in depth and quality. In 2000, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment systematic review identified and evaluated existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AE treatments. To ensure continuing utility, the NIHR commissioned an update to the review. Here, we present an overview of the updated report and its key findings. Systematic reviews and RCTs of AE treatments that included participants with AE (criteria based or diagnosed) were identified using Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register [searched to 31 August 2013 (RCTs) and 31 December 2015 (systematic reviews)]. Outcome measures included symptoms, AE severity, quality of life and adverse effects. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Of the 287 new RCTs identified, only 22 (8%) were judged to have a low risk of bias. When combined with RCTs from the previous review (n = 254), we found 'reasonable evidence of benefit' for corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, Atopiclair ®, ciclosporin, azathioprine, ultraviolet radiation and education programmes. Interventions with reasonable evidence of 'no benefit' included some dietary interventions, ion exchange water softeners, multiple daily applications of topical corticosteroids and antibiotic-containing corticosteroids for noninfected AE. Many common treatments lack evidence of efficacy and warrant further evaluation. The evidence base for AE is still hampered by poor trial design and reporting. The trials included in this review were used to establish the Global Resource of EczemA Trials (GREAT) database.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2017. part 1: treatment and prevention [^1133bUzU]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual updates that summarize the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 25 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2017, and focuses on the treatment and prevention of AE. There is high-quality evidence to demonstrate that dupilumab is better than placebo for the treatment of AE, is not associated with a higher incidence of adverse effects and does not increase the risk of infection compared with placebo; however, comparison studies with other systemic treatments are necessary. Topical tofacitinib is a promising treatment for mild-moderate AE, but currently lacks sufficient evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing with other active treatments. Topical doxepin may be effective for pruritus in AE, but available studies have short follow-up periods and longer-term outcomes are needed. Bleach baths were no more effective than water baths alone at reducing AE severity. Topical antibiotics cannot be recommended for infected AE, owing to insufficient evidence of benefit. There is little comparison of different emollients in RCTs, but overall evidence indicates that they reduce AE severity, are steroid-sparing and lead to better outcomes in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) than TCS alone. No clear benefit was demonstrated for vitamin D/C/E supplementation in pregnancy for eczema prevention.

### Secondary bacterial infections in patients with atopic dermatitis or other common dermatoses [^117XBtT5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary bacterial infections of common dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis, ectoparasitosis, and varicella zoster virus infections are frequent, with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes being the bacteria most involved. There are also Gram-negative infections secondary to common dermatoses such as foot dyshidrotic eczema and tinea pedis. Factors favoring secondary bacterial infections in atopic dermatitis, ectoparasitosis, and varicella zoster virus infections mainly include an epidermal barrier alteration as well as itch. Mite-bacteria interaction is also involved in scabies and some environmental factors can promote Gram-negative bacterial infections of the feet. Furthermore, the bacterial ecology of these superinfections may depend on the geographical origin of the patients, especially in ectoparasitosis. Bacterial superinfections can also have different clinical aspects depending on the underlying dermatoses. Subsequently, the choice of class, course, and duration of antibiotic treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the suspected bacteria, primarily targeting S. aureus. Prevention of these secondary bacterial infections depends first and foremost on the management of the underlying skin disorder. At the same time, educating the patient on maintaining good skin hygiene and reporting changes in the primary lesions is crucial. In the case of recurrent secondary infections, decolonization of S. aureus is deemed necessary, particularly in atopic dermatitis.

### Interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus in the management of eczema [^116C31qV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can cause secondary infection in eczema, and may promote inflammation in eczema that does not look infected. There is no standard intervention to reduce S. aureus burden in eczema. It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatments help eczema or promote bacterial resistance. This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to reduce S. aureus for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched five trials registers and three sets of conference proceedings. We checked references of trials and reviews for further relevant studies. We contacted pharmaceutical companies regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of products intended to reduce S. aureus on the skin in people diagnosed with atopic eczema by a medical practitioner. Eligible comparators were a similar treatment regimen without the anti-staphylococcal agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our key outcomes were participant- or assessor-rated global improvement in symptoms/signs, quality of life (QOL), severe adverse events requiring withdrawal, minor adverse events, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms.

Main Results

We included 41 studies (1753 analysed participants) covering 10 treatment categories. Studies were conducted mainly in secondary care in Western Europe; North America; the Far East; and elsewhere. Twelve studies recruited children; four, adults; 19, both; and six, unclear. Fifty-nine per cent of the studies reported the mean age of participants (range: 1.1 to 34.6 years). Eczema severity ranged from mild to severe. Many studies did not report our primary outcomes. Treatment durations ranged from 10 minutes to 3 months; total study durations ranged from 15 weeks to 27 months. We considered 33 studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain. We present results for three key comparisons. All time point measurements were taken from baseline. We classed outcomes as short-term when treatment duration was less than four weeks, and long-term when treatment was given for more than four weeks. Fourteen studies evaluated topical steroid/antibiotic combinations compared to topical steroids alone (infective status: infected (two studies), not infected (four studies), unspecified (eight studies)). Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may lead to slightly greater global improvement in good or excellent signs/symptoms than topical steroid alone at 6 to 28 days follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.21; 224 participants; 3 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL in children, at 14 days follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; 42 participants; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: severe adverse events were rare (follow-up: between 6 to 28 days): both groups reported flare of dermatitis, worsening of the condition, and folliculitis (325 participants; 4 studies). There were fewer minor adverse events (e.g. flare, stinging, itch, folliculitis) in the combination group at 14 days follow-up (218 participants; 2 studies). One study reported antibiotic resistance in children at three months follow-up, with similar results between the groups (65 participants; 1 study). Four studies evaluated oral antibiotics compared to placebo (infective status: infected eczema (two studies), uninfected (one study), one study's participants had colonisation but no clinical infection). Oral antibiotics may make no difference in terms of good or excellent global improvement in infants and children at 14 to 28 days follow-up compared to placebo (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.50; 75 participants; 2 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL (in infants and children) at 14 days follow-up (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.32, 45 participants, 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: adverse events requiring treatment withdrawal between 14 to 28 days follow-up were very rare, but included eczema worsening (both groups), loose stools (antibiotic group), and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (placebo group) (4 studies, 199 participants). Minor adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach and joint pains, at 28 days follow-up were also rare and generally low in both groups (1 study, 68 infants and children). Antibiotic resistance at 14 days was reported as similar in both groups (2 studies, 98 infants and children). Of five studies evaluating bleach baths compared to placebo (water) or bath emollient (infective status: uninfected (two studies), unspecified (three studies)), one reported global improvement and showed that bleach baths may make no difference when compared with placebo at one month follow-up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.63; 36 participants; low-quality evidence). One study showed there is probably little or no difference in QOL at 28 days follow-up when comparing bleach baths to placebo (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.32 to 3.12) (80 infants and children; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain if the groups differ in the likelihood of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events at two months follow-up (only one dropout reported due to worsening itch (placebo group)) as the quality of evidence was very low (1 study, 42 participants). One study reported that five participants in each group experienced burning/stinging or dry skin at two months follow-up, so there may be no difference in minor adverse events between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.87, 36 participants, low-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence means we are also uncertain if antibiotic resistance at four weeks follow-up is different between groups (1 study, 80 participants ≤ 18 years).

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence on the effects of anti-staphylococcal treatments for treating people with infected or uninfected eczema. Low-quality evidence, due to risk of bias, imprecise effect estimates and heterogeneity, made pooling of results difficult. Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may be associated with possible small improvements in good or excellent signs/symptoms compared with topical steroid alone. High-quality trials evaluating efficacy, QOL, and antibiotic resistance are required.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^116a2u2o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1–16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' Conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.

Abstract

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta‐analysis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria

We included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti‐inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti‐inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient‐reported eczema symptoms, clinician‐reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, long‐term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application‐site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high‐income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry‐funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) was only possible for short‐term outcomes.

Patient‐reported symptoms

NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE‐4 inhibitors.

NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25 to ‐0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐1.57, 95% CI –2.42 to ‐0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI.

A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Clinician‐reported signs

NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE‐4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness.

NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐2.69, 95% CI ‐3.36, ‐2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.87, 95% CI ‐2.69, ‐1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class‐level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI.

A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Investigator Global Assessment

NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE‐4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI.

Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta‐analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants).

Local adverse effects

NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application‐site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions.

NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%.

NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term (median 3 weeks, range 1‐16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE‐4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application‐site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term TCS but an increase with longer‐term TCS.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114axaz3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

Eczema is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are commonly used to control symptoms. The relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments is uncertain.

Design

Network meta‐analysis performed within a Cochrane systematic review to compare and statistically rank efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory eczema treatments.

Data Sources

Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries to June 2023.

Eligibility Criteria for Selected Trials

Included trials were within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials. Participants had eczema that was not clinically infected and was not contact dermatitis, seborrheic eczema or hand eczema. Interventions were topical anti‐inflammatory treatments but not complementary treatments, antibiotics alone, wet wraps, phototherapy or systemic treatments. Comparators were no treatment/vehicle or another topical anti‐inflammatory.

Results

We identified 291 trials (45,846 participants), mainly in high‐income countries. Most were industry‐funded with median 3 weeks treatment duration. Risk of bias assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was high in 89% of trials, mainly due to risk of selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis of binary outcomes ranked potent and/or very potent topical steroids, tacrolimus 0.1% and ruxolitinib 1.5% among the most effective treatments for improving patient‐reported symptoms (40 trials, all low confidence) and clinician‐reported signs (32 trials, all moderate confidence). For investigator global assessment, the Janus kinas inhibitors ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% or 0.25%, very potent/potent topical steroids and tacrolimus 0.1% were ranked as most effective (140 trials, all moderate confidence). Continuous outcome data were mixed. Local application site reactions were most common with tacrolimus 0.1% (moderate confidence) and crisaborole 2% (high confidence) and least common with topical steroids (moderate confidence). Skin thinning was not increased with short‐term use of any topical steroid potency (low confidence) but skin thinning was reported in 6/2044 (0.3%) participants treated with longer‐term (6–60 months) topical steroids.

Conclusion

Potent topical steroids, Janus kinase inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as among the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema.

Combination therapy with topical corticosteroids and antibiotics — adding topical antibiotics to TCS did not improve outcomes. An 8-week randomized control trial of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment with mupirocin ointment showed no benefit, a 4-week crossover study of clobetasol butyrate with mupirocin had similar results, and gentamicin with betamethasone valerate cream versus betamethasone valerate alone showed no significant difference in overall severity score change from baseline between groups.

### Interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus in the management of atopic eczema [^115eZf2v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus can cause secondary infection in atopic eczema, and it may promote inflammation in eczema that does not look infected. Many antimicrobial products exist for eczema, but it is unclear if they work or if they promote bacterial resistance.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus for treating infected or uninfected atopic eczema.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2008), MEDLINE (OVID) (from 2002 to March 2008), EMBASE (OVID) (from 2002 to March 2008), Ongoing trials registers (March 2008). References from trials and reviews were searched, pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished trials. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with atopic eczema who have been treated with a product intended to reduce S. aureus on the skin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two people independently performed the study selection, data abstraction and quality assessment.

Main Results

We included 21 studies (1018 participants) covering 7 treatment categories. Most studies were poorly reported and study differences limited pooling of results. Adverse effects were especially poorly reported, and only one study reported the emergence of resistant bacterial strains following oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics were not associated with benefit in non-infected (2 trials, 66 participants) or infected eczema (1 trial, 33 participants). We did not find any benefit for antibacterial soaps (1 trial, 50 participants), or antibacterial bath additives (2 trials, 41 participants), or topical antibiotics/antiseptics (4 studies, 95 participants). Adding antibiotics to topical corticosteroids reduced numbers of Staphylococcus aureus in 4 trials (302 participants), but there was no evidence of any clinical benefit in 9 trials involving 677 participants: betamethasone plus neomycin vs clobetasol (MD 1.2; 95% CI 0.25, 2.15), prednicarbate plus antimicrobial vs prednicarbate (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.25, 1.68), or betamethasone valerate plus gentamicin vs betamethasone (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.07, 1.35). One trial (30 participants) showed no significant improvement in eczema for those using silver textiles (RR 2.67; 95% CI 0.98, 7.22), despite using 10 times the amount of topical steroids.

Authors' Conclusions

We failed to find clear evidence of benefit for antimicrobial interventions for people with atopic eczema, despite their widespread use. This does not necessarily mean they do not work because the studies were small and poorly reported. Further large studies with long-term outcomes and clearly defined participants are urgently required.

### Dupilumab in the treatment of dyshidrosis: a report of two cases [^112SpssK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dupilumab (Dupixent, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi Genzyme) is a novel biologic medication recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults who have not achieved adequate control with topical medications. Dyshidrotic eczema is a distinct entity, often considered on the spectrum of atopic dermatitis, that primarily effects the palms and soles; it is often associated with considerable morbidity yet is frequently challenging to treat. We report two cases of recalcitrant dyshidrotic eczema treated successfully with dupilumab at standard dosing. Further studies to establish the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of dyshidrosis are warranted. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(3):355–356.

### Topical tacrolimus (FK506) and mometasone furoate in treatment of dyshidrotic palmar eczema: a randomized, observer-blinded trial [^112Jn4BH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema is a frequent disease often running a chronic relapsing course. Topical glucocorticosteroids form the mainstay of therapy, and alternatives are urgently warranted.

Objective

This study was performed to compare the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) 0.1% ointment and mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment in the treatment of dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema.

Methods

Sixteen patients were included in the study after a randomized, observer-blind, intrapersonal comparison protocol. After a 2-week washout period, the active treatment phase amounted to 4 weeks with twice-daily topical application of test substances and additional use of emollients at will. Thereafter, patients were monitored at weekly intervals up to 8 weeks.

Results

The dyshidrotic area and severity index showed a more than 50% reduction of baseline values after 2 weeks of active treatment both for FK506 (P = 0.003) and mometasone furoate (P = 0.022) in palmar areas. After active treatment, a nonsignificant increase in the dyshidrotic area and severity index was seen with FK506 treated areas. Fourteen of 16 patients had recurring symptoms requiring further therapy within 3 weeks after the active treatment phase.

Conclusion

Treatment with FK506 offers the possibility for rotational therapy with mometasone furoate in long-standing cases of chronic dyshidrotic palmar eczema.

### Successful treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis with chemical peeling and gentian violet [^111wbrKk]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 70-year-old African American woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to our clinic with a 10-year history of a pruritic rash of her hands, previously diagnosed as "eczema" by an outside physician. She had a personal and family history of seasonal allergies but denied eczema as a child, and she did not have asthma. She used triamcinolone 0.1% and clobetasol 0.05% ointments, camphor/menthol lotion, urea cream, bacitracin ointment, and triple antibiotic ointment in the past without any significant improvement. For the weeks leading up to her visit to our clinic, she used only triamcinolone ointment.

On examination, scaly, ill-defined erythematous plaques on the soles and palms were noted (Fig 1), as well as linear excoriations on the back in a butterfly distribution. A differential diagnosis of dyshidrotic eczema versus palmoplantar psoriasis versus allergic/irritant contact dermatitis of the palms and soles was established, though no triggers were identified. The patient deferred biopsy of the palms or soles. PPP was considered the most likely diagnosis, as the patient lacked the history of vesicles that is characteristic of dyshidrotic eczema, and also had an extensive smoking history, which predisposes to PPP rather than dyshidrotic eczema. The patient's history was not consistent with allergic contact dermatitis. Initial management included increasing to clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily under occlusion with a cotton glove, cetirizine 10 mg by mouth every morning, hydroxyzine 25 mg by mouth as needed at night, and camphor and menthol lotion as needed for the itch. Frequent unscented emollient use was also strongly encouraged, and she was instructed to stop all other topical treatments. Four months later, the patient returned to our clinic and reported no improvement of her rash; at the time, she rated her disease severity as 10/10. Potassium hydroxide preparation test was negative for spores and hyphae, and a decision was made to treat the palms and soles with 40% trichloroacetic acid followed immediately by 1% gentian violet application. The patient was instructed to continue with clobetasol twice daily to the hands. She was to wash her hands as normal, but it was recommended that gentian violet stays on the palms and soles for at least 2 hours before washing them. No side effects were observed by the patient. The hands did not require any pretreatment before application of TCA.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^113SJwCM]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical antimicrobials vs no addition in uncontrolled atopic dermatitis (AD) without serious bacterial infection: In patients with uncontrolled AD and no serious bacterial skin infection, the JTF panel suggests against adding topical antimicrobials to standard topical treatment (conditional recommendation, very low-certainty evidence), and remarks that this recommendation applies to typical infected AD lesions, not other skin and soft tissue infections for which separate guidance from the Infectious Disease Society of America is available. Evidence summaries indicate that few studies of adding topical antimicrobials to TCS or TCI provided low certainty for no difference between groups, and allergic contact dermatitis to topical antimicrobials is a recognized possible complication, with a retrospective patch test series of 43,722 patients identifying 6374 (15%) patients with 8787 reactions to topical medications; neomycin (29%) and bacitracin (29%) were most common. Patients without serious infection who value avoiding polypharmacy and antimicrobial resistance will prefer to avoid adding topical antimicrobials, whereas those who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, have more severe infection (particularly impetigo or ecthyma), a history of severe infections, or severe AD may prefer adding them.

### Efficacy and tolerance of upadacitinib in the treatment of dyshidrotic eczema [^114Z4G5H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dyshidrotic eczema (DE), also known as dyshidrosis and acute palmoplantar eczema, is a recurrent vesicular eruption of the palms and soles that is typically associated with extreme pruritus. Although its etiology is unknown, DE is likely multifactorial and has an unclear association with atopic diseases. Treatment has classically involved topical medications, such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, followed by immunomodulating agents for refractory cases, including dupilumab, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, or methotrexate. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs that inhibit Janus kinases (JAKs) have been employed to treat inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the use of such medications for the treatment of DE has not been reported. We present a case of a patient achieving remission of his DE on initiation of upadacitinib.

### Interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus in the management of atopic eczema: an updated cochrane review [^112JWxeh]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

An association between the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and atopic eczema has been recognized for many years. Although few would dispute the benefit of systemic antibiotics in people with overtly clinically infected eczema, the clinical role of S. aureus in causing inflammatory flares in clinically uninfected eczema is less clear.

To see if atopic eczema can be improved by antistaphylococcal agents, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Cochrane Skin Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (from 2000), EMBASE (from 1980), the metaRegister of Current Controlled Trials (to March 2009), plus manual searching of references and conference proceedings. RCTs that compared interventions to reduce S. aureus in people with atopic eczema with no treatment, vehicle, or another active compound were included. Publication status and language were not barriers to inclusion.

Results

Twenty-six studies involving 1229 participants were included. The studies were generally short term and of poor quality. There was no significant difference in global outcome for clinically infected eczema when oral antibiotics were compared with placebo [one study, relative risk (RR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13–1.24] or when topical steroid antibiotic combinations were compared with steroid alone (two studies, RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.23–1.16). One study of children with infected eczema that added bleach to bathwater showed a significant improvement in eczema severity when compared with bathwater alone, although the difference could have been explained by regression to the mean. Although antistaphylococcal interventions reduced S. aureus numbers in people with clinically uninfected eczema, none of the studies showed any clinical benefit.

Conclusions

We failed to find any evidence that commonly used antistaphylococcal interventions are clinically helpful in people with eczema that is not clinically infected. Their continued use should be questioned in such situations, until better and longer-term studies show clear evidence of clinical benefit.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^115EfmcT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

As topical anti‐inflammatories were assessed, trials assessing: emollients alone, topical antibiotics alone, complementary therapies, topical probiotics, bandaging/wet wraps, systemic treatments, lasers, and phototherapy were not included. Trials where systemic anti‐inflammatory treatments such as dupilumab, methotrexate, ciclosporin, corticosteroids, or phototherapy were used in combination with topical anti‐inflammatory agents were not included. These were excluded because the primary mechanism of action is not anti‐inflammatory, or because the treatment is not topically applied. Trials where participants in both intervention and comparator groups were using oral antihistamines were excluded, as these are not thought to be effective treatments for eczema.

In general, standard, licenced treatment regimens, such as once‐ or twice‐daily application of topical anti‐inflammatory cream, gel, lotion, or ointment to affected skin, were considered. Once‐ or twice‐daily frequency of application and variations in duration of treatment were pooled for meta‐analysis. Trials where anti‐inflammatory treatments are used differently to standard licenced recommendations (e.g. initiated at less than once per day or more than twice per day for TCS and TCI) or for durations of less than one week were excluded. Treatment regimens which start with a standard regimen as per licenced recommendations, but then reduce to less frequent application after the initial daily treatment period, were still included in the review, but the variations in treatment regimens used may impact the Confidence In Network Meta‐Analysis (CINeMA) certainty of evidence assessments.

### TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) registry taskforce: an international Delphi exercise to identify a core set of domains and domain items for national atopic eczema photo-and systemic therapy registries [^1139pwuo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Consensus meeting

Minutes of the meeting are available online at treat‐registry‐taskforce.org. Forty‐two participants (Table 1), representing all stakeholder groups except regulatory bodies, ratified the 30 obvious and 29 domain items for which 'consensus in' was reached. Six of the 29 items were merged into three by discussion and voting, i.e. 'follow‐up reporting of disease control by physician' with 'follow‐up reporting of disease control by patient' into 'follow‐up reporting of disease control' (93% consensus), 'dermatology‐specific quality of life (QoL) score' with 'AE‐specific QoL score' into 'skin‐specific QoL score' for both baseline and follow‐up (77% consensus). The two 'disease control' items were combined as this core domain is still under research by the HOME initiative. 28 Merging of 'QoL scores' was done as the opinion was that too many items on QoL in the core set would overburden patients.

Discussion and voting was performed for the remaining 70 domain items where 'no consensus, voting required' had been reached. Twelve (5 from the proposed and 7 from the additional list) were added, making a total of 38 domain items that reached consensus to be included in the core set together with the 30 obvious items (Table 3; Tables S3 and S4; see Supporting Information). The items concerning frequency of safety investigations and follow‐up frequency for registry data entry were not voted on, as they were considered to be part of the 'when to measure' instead of the 'what to measure'.

Table 3
Core set of domains and domain items

After a final discussion within the TREAT research group the items 'antibiotics, oral' and 'antibiotics, topical' were merged into one item ('antibiotics, oral or topical'), and 'days lost from usual activities' and 'safety bloods' (as already included at baseline) were added as obvious follow‐up items making a total of 69 items mapped to 19 domains.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, EAACI/EADV/EDF/EFA/ESDaP/ESPD/ETFAD/UEMS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering a short course of systemic antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, in patients with S. aureus infection.

### Oral and topical antibiotics for clinically infected eczema in children: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in ambulatory care [^1141NJ9x]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Eczema may flare because of bacterial infection, but evidence supporting antibiotic treatment is of low quality. We aimed to determine the effect of oral and topical antibiotics in addition to topical emollient and corticosteroids in children with clinically infected eczema.

Methods

We employed a 3-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial in UK ambulatory care. Children with clinical, non-severely infected eczema were randomized to receive oral and topical placebos (control), oral antibiotic (flucloxacillin) and topical placebo, or topical antibiotic (fusidic acid) and oral placebo, for 1 week. We compared Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores at 2 weeks using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

Results

We randomized 113 children (40 to control, 36 to oral antibiotic, and 37 to topical antibiotic). Mean (SD) baseline Patient Oriented Eczema Measure scores were 13.4 (5.1) for the control group, 14.6 (5.3) for the oral antibiotic group, and 16.9 (5.5) for the topical antibiotic group. At baseline, 104 children (93%) had 1 or more of the following findings: weeping, crusting, pustules, or painful skin. Mean (SD) POEM scores at 2 weeks were 6.2 (6.0) for control, 8.3 (7.3) for the oral antibiotic group, and 9.3 (6.2) for the topical antibiotic group. Controlling for baseline POEM score, neither oral nor topical antibiotics produced a significant difference in mean (95% CI) POEM scores (1.5 [-1.4 to 4.4] and 1.5 [-1.6 to 4.5] respectively). There were no significant differences in adverse effects and no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

We found rapid resolution in response to topical steroid and emollient treatment and ruled out a clinically meaningful benefit from the addition of either oral or topical antibiotics. Children seen in ambulatory care with mild clinically infected eczema do not need treatment with antibiotics.

Dyshidrotic hand eczema is a common condition, which can be resistant to various treatments. Although a number of etiologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of dyshidrotic eczema, hyperhidrosis is assumed to play a significant role. Oxybutynin is an alternative treatment for hyperhidrosis. We present the cases of two patients suffering from hyperhidrosis and dyshidrotic eczema, who were treated with oxybutynin with impressive results.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116QcV4r]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

This systematic review and NMA was conducted using standard Cochrane methodology, and according to its own pre‐published protocol and statistical analysis plan. In brief, we included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Eligible trials evaluated people of any age with a clinical diagnosis of eczema (also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema) of any severity. Specific, non‐atopic forms of eczema such as contact dermatitis, hand eczema or seborrheic eczema and clinically infected eczema were excluded. Eligible interventions included any well‐characterised topical anti‐inflammatory treatment. Emollients alone, topical antibiotics alone, complementary therapies, wet wraps, systemic treatment and phototherapy were excluded. In general, non‐licensed or non‐standard treatment regimens were excluded — for example application less than once daily or more than twice daily, or treatment durations of under 1 week. Comparison was to other topical anti‐inflammatory treatments, placebo/vehicle/emollient or no treatment. TCS were classified as mild, moderate, potent or very potent, as previously described. Outcomes and outcome measures were prioritised according to the Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative; and informed by patient and public involvement during preliminary surveys and workshops as part of trial protocol development. Outcomes evaluated are summarised below:

2.1 Primary Outcomes

Patient‐reported symptoms of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly a visual analogue scale of pruritus.
Clinician‐reported signs of eczema. Data were extracted based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index or, if not available, alternative instruments ranked in order of preference in the protocol, most commonly the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) was considered separately from other clinician‐reported signs of eczema, since the construct of IGA as a single global assessment is emphasised by some regulatory authorities and may differ from other measures of eczema signs.

### Efficacy of a 3% K ā nuka oil cream for the treatment of moderate-to-severe eczema: a single blind randomised vehicle-controlled trial [^115jVAsd]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eczema typically presents as a chronic, relapsing, pruritic rash affecting children and adults. In a 2010 global burden of disease survey, eczema ranked second in disability-adjusted life-years when compared to other common skin conditions. Patients and their families experience significant quality of life impact and financial burden from eczema. Patients often experience significant sleep disturbance caused by itching as well as limitations to their social life and everyday activities. A study assessing out of pocket cost for eczema patients across nine European countries found an average out of pocket cost of 927 euros (1,585 New Zealand Dollars) per year per patient with the primary cost purchase of emollients and moisturisers.

Eczema lesions develop due to an impaired skin barrier, leading to exposure to environmental allergens which triggers a heightened cutaneous T-helper cell mediated immune response. There is no known cure for eczema and current treatments focus instead on long term symptom management, and disease control. Treatment is often based on the cyclical nature of the disease, with maintenance use of emollients and moisturisers to maintain skin integrity. Topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, are typically used to dampen the inflammation that occurs during exacerbations, but they can also be used as a maintenance therapy. If topical anti-inflammatory treatments prove ineffective then phototherapy and systemic immune modulating therapies may be considered. Eczema lesions are also prone to secondary infection potentially resulting in the need for antiseptic or antibiotic therapy. Poor treatment adherence is a key reason for treatment failure in eczema, a particular issue for topical corticosteroids due to a negative patient perception around side effects. Providing patients with novel non-steroidal options may be viewed more favourably, and lead to improved treatment adherence.

### Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^116u6aUq]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin disease affecting one in 10 people in their lifetime. Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of immune dysregulation, epidermal gene mutations, and environmental factors that disrupts the epidermis causing intensely pruritic skin lesions. Repeated scratching triggers a self-perpetuating itch-scratch cycle, which can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The American Academy of Dermatology has created simple diagnostic criteria based on symptoms and physical examination findings. Maintenance therapy consists of liberal use of emollients and daily bathing with soap-free cleansers. Use of topical corticosteroids is the first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis flare-ups. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are topical calcineurin inhibitors that can be used in conjunction with topical corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Ultraviolet phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis when first-line treatments are not adequate. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics are effective in treating secondary skin infections. Oral antihistamines are not recommended because they do not reduce pruritus. Evidence is lacking to support the use of integrative medicine in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Newer medications approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, such as crisaborole and dupilumab, are effective in treating atopic dermatitis but are currently cost prohibitive for most patients.

### Efficacy and tolerance of upadacitinib in the treatment of dyshidrotic eczema [^116Rt1uW]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 22-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease and RA presented to dermatology clinic with a 2-month history of a pruritic and painful rash mainly on his palms and soles that emerged shortly after completing a course of prednisone for a flare of RA. Over the previous 2 years, he had reported similar pruritic but milder rashes in the same distribution that were self-limited and resolved without any intervention. Physical examination was notable for deep-seated pustulovesicles on the bilateral palmar and plantar surfaces of the extremities that evolved into areas of desquamation with collarettes of scale. The rash also spread beyond the palmar and plantar surfaces to involve the medial and lateral surfaces of the hands and feet, as in a moccasin distribution (Fig 1). He denied a history of seasonal allergies or asthma. Topical corticosteroids had been yet ineffective; the patient was a longstanding user of methotrexate and had initiated ustekinumab 5 months prior. In addition to Crohn's disease and RA, the patient's medical history was significant for Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, for which topiramate was a longstanding therapy. Longstanding supplements included ferrous sulfate and folic acid.

Fig 1
Fitzpatrick skin type II afflicted with probable dyshidrotic eczema. A, Pustules and vesicles with collarettes of scale on the palmar surfaces of the hands bilaterally. B, Few vesicles with collarettes of scale within a background of erythema extending from the plantar surface to the medial aspect of the foot.

The differential diagnosis included DE, pustular psoriasis, and tinea pedis et manuum. A potassium hydroxide scraping was negative for fungal elements, and the patient was started on topical 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate ointment twice daily to affected areas. Before returning to dermatology clinic, the patient's rheumatologist transitioned his ustekinumab to upadacitinib, which was administered daily as 15 mg extended-release oral tablets. Due to improvement in his rash noted specifically after such change in medication, the patient was able to decrease his frequency of topical steroid use to once daily. After 3 months of taking upadacitinib, the patient reported a noticeable decrease in pain and pruritus. Physical examination revealed the absence of pustules and only sparse vesicles.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2012 and 2013. part 1. epidemiology, mechanisms of disease and methodological issues [^113o5m8T]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review provides a summary of key findings from nine systematic reviews on atopic eczema (AE) published over the 2-year period from January 2012 to 31 December 2013, focusing on epidemiology, mechanisms of disease and methodological issues. There is now reasonable evidence to suggest that antibiotic exposure in early life is associated with increased incidence of AE, but delivery by caesarean section is not. The prevalence of AE is increasing in Africa, eastern Asia, western Europe and parts of northern Europe. Autoimmunity may play a part in the development and subsequent severity of AE. For researchers conducting clinical trials and other prospective studies involving patients with AE, the two best-validated scales for capturing objective clinical signs of AE are the Eczema Assessment Severity scale (EASI) and the objective SCORing Atopic Dermatitis scale (objSCORAD). For the assessment of quality of life in children aged 0–3 years, the Infant Dermatitis Quality of Life scale (IDQoL) is reasonably well validated. A standardized definition of an incident case of AE for use in prevention studies is still required.

### Treatment of eczema: corticosteroids and beyond [^1139ztJ3]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that requires a manifold approach to therapy. The goal of therapy is to restore the function of the epidermal barrier and to reduce skin inflammation. This can be achieved with skin moisturization and topical anti-inflammatory agents, such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Furthermore, proactive therapy with twice weekly use of both topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors in previously affected areas has been found to reduce the time to the next eczematous flare. Adjunctive treatment options include wet wrap therapy, anti-histamines, and vitamin D supplementation. Bacterial colonization, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, can contribute to eczematous flares and overt infection. Use of systemic antibiotics in infected lesions is warranted; however, empiric antibiotics use in uninfected lesions is controversial. Local antiseptic measures (i.e., bleach baths) and topical antimicrobial therapies can be considered in patients with high bacterial colonization. Difficult-to-treat AD is a complex clinical problem that may require re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of AD, especially if the onset of disease occurs in adulthood. It may also necessitate evaluation for contact, food, and inhaled allergens that may exacerbate the underlying AD. There are a host of systemic therapies that have been successful in patients with difficult-to-treat AD, however, these agents are limited by their side effect profiles. Lastly, with further insight into the pathophysiology of AD, new biological agents have been investigated with promising results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea: state of the art [^1175GeV2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common disorder that is both under recognized and undertreated. Prevalence figures indicate that it may be present in 1 of every 10 adults in a primary care waiting room. Untreated, patients with rosacea can suffer significant emotional, workplace, and social impairments. While rosacea has been recognized since ancient times, only recently have investigators begun to identify the pathophysiologic elements responsible for the characteristic erythema, flushing, dysesthesias, and papulopustular manifestations of the disease. Although the etiology of rosacea is unclear, inflammation appears to be a central element. Experimental evidence suggests that abnormalities of the skin's innate and adaptive immune responses may play pivotal roles. Once recognized, effective topical and systemic therapies can be prescribed to lessen the impact of the disease on the patient's life. Although initially administered in an empiric fashion, it now seems clear that the role of antibiotics in patients with rosacea depends upon their anti-inflammatory rather than their antimicrobial properties. Consequently, practitioners have the opportunity to practice good antibiotic stewardship when treating the disease, particularly with systemic therapies. Therapy with subantimicrobial dosing and with topical treatments can modulate the inflammation of rosacea without exerting antibiotic pressure responsible for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

### Low-cobalt diet for dyshidrotic eczema patients [^1173PJBR]. Contact Dermatitis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Dyshidrotic eczema is a type of chronic intermittent dermatitis characterized by vesicles, dystrophic fingernail changes, and rarely bullae that affects the hands and feet. Many exogenous factors may trigger a flare including dermatophyte infections, contact irritants, and metal hypersensitivity. Although metal hypersensitivity does not play a role in all cases of dyshidrotic eczema, high oral ingestion of nickel and/or cobalt should be considered, regardless of patch test results.

Objective

We updated and simplified existing published guidelines for low-cobalt diets. A recent review of the literature showed that dietary cobalt restriction, a safe yet burdensome treatment option for dyshidrosis, is referenced to dated sources.

Methods

We have analysed current data for the cobalt content in common food items.

Conclusion

We propose a revised, point-based diet that will eliminate much of the dietary cobalt (and nickel) and reduce dyshidrotic eczema flares.

### Local antibiotics in dermatology [^114bRcaY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although the vast majority of skin infection must be treated with systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics are used overwhelmingly in the world, often as self-prescribed medications without taking into account the sensitivity of the presumed bacteria. Dermatologists are aware that different types of topical antibiotics kill different species of bacteria and tend to be more specific in their prescriptions. At present local antibiotics are advised to treat minor superficial uncomplicated skin infections (e.g., impetigo) and to prevent bacterial infections caused into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. The role of topical antibiotics in the management of acne and atopic dermatitis is controversial. Retapamulin, a novel topical antibacterial agent, will probably replace the use of the old mupirocin and fusidic acid.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: expert statement and review from the international eczema council skin infection group [^114C3egS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus colonization in atopic dermatitis

Most patients with AD are colonized by S. aureus. A recent meta‐analysis found that the pooled prevalence of S. aureus colonization of lesional AD skin is 70%, of nonlesional AD skin 39% and of the nares 62%. 59 However, the prevalence varies greatly across studies, from 22% to 99% in lesional skin and 3% to 79% in nonlesional skin. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 Most patients colonized by S. aureus do not exhibit overt signs of infection, and 10% of healthy individuals carry S. aureus. 62, 64

Staphylococcus aureus colonization can be associated with three main clinical scenarios in AD: (i) stable or baseline AD without clinical evidence of overt infection; (ii) AD flare without clinical evidence of overt infection; and (iii) overtly infected AD with the classical symptoms as described above. Although antimicrobial therapy is clearly essential for patients with overtly infected AD, the clinical significance, recognition and management of S. aureus colonization without clinical evidence of infectious disease are not fully understood. Some studies show that patients with AD improve with topical and systemic antibiotic treatments, even without overt signs of secondary infection. 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70 However, other studies have found no clinical benefit of antibiotic treatment over corticosteroid therapy alone. 63, 71 A 2010 Cochrane review found no support for routine topical or systemic antistaphylococcal interventions in AD that is not clinically infected, although the studies were generally short term and of poor quality. 72

It is likely that the density of S. aureus is more relevant than simply the presence of the bacteria. The density of S. aureus colonization correlates with the severity of AD. 73, 74, 75, 76 Williamson and Kligman used an early method of quantitative bacteriology to compare the effects of topical and systemic antibiotics on S. aureus in AD. 77 The detergent scrub technique was used on AD lesions to obtain bacterial samples, which were incubated before the S. aureus density was measured. They found that appreciable clinical improvement with antibiotic therapy occurred only in patients whose AD lesions were infected by S. aureus at a density of greater than 10⁶ colony‐forming units per cm². 61, 68 Similarly, microbiome studies of paediatric patients with AD show that the relative abundance of S. aureus is associated with disease flares and correlates with severity. 78, 79, 80, 81

### Dyshidrotic eczema associated with the use of IVIg [^114dHEPi]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment is highly effective for autoimmune diseases including myasthenia gravis. Recovery is observed at approximately. 75% of myasthenia gravis patients through IVIg treatment. As a result of many clinical studies, the recommended dose is determined as 0.4 g/kg for 5 days (maximum total dose at 2 g/kg body weight). If an additional immunomodulatory treatment is not administered, IVIg maintenance treatment is needed mostly. However, some side effects may inhibit long-term treatment. For this reason, it is important to know the effect profile well and when the treatment should be discontinued. A female myasthenia gravis patient case is presented here, where dyshidrotic eczema has occurred after the second dose of intravenous Ig medication and whose treatment is despite further IVIg therapy.

### Ixekizumab (Taltz) [^116gqJin]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infections

TALTZ may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the TALTZ group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group (27% vs. 23%). Upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group. A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials in patients with pediatric psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the postmarketing setting, serious bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors including TALTZ. Instruct patients treated with TALTZ to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves.

5.2 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis

Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TALTZ. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating TALTZ in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.

5.3 Hypersensitivity

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria (each ≤ 0.1%), occurred in the TALTZ group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in post marketing use with TALTZ [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.

5.4 Eczematous Eruptions

In the postmarketing setting, cases of severe eczematous eruptions, including atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, dyshidrotic eczema, and erythroderma were reported in patients receiving TALTZ; some cases resulted in hospitalization. The onset of eczematous eruptions was variable, ranging from days to months after the first dose of TALTZ. Treatment may need to be discontinued to resolve the eczematous eruption. Some patients with limited psoriasis treatment options were successfully treated for eczema while continuing TALTZ.

### Does early life exposure to antibiotics increase the risk of eczema? A systematic review [^1143aG29]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

A number of studies have suggested that early life exposure to antibiotics can lead to an increased risk of developing eczema. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, involving children or young adults aged 0–25 years, assessed the impact of antibiotic exposure either in utero or during the first 12 months of life on subsequent eczema risk. Twenty studies examined the association between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to antibiotics and development of eczema. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the 17 studies examining postnatal antibiotic exposure was 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30–1.53]. The pooled OR for the 10 longitudinal studies was 1.40 (95% CI 1.19–1.64), compared with a pooled OR of 1.43 (95% CI 1.36–1.51) for the seven cross-sectional studies. There was a significant dose-response association, suggesting a 7% increase in the risk of eczema for each additional antibiotic course received during the first year of life [pooled OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02–1.11)]. Finally, the pooled OR for the four studies relating to antenatal exposure was 1.30 (95% CI 0.86–1.95). We conclude that exposure to antibiotics in the first year of life, but not prenatally, is more common in children with eczema.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: expert statement and review from the international eczema council skin infection group [^1118Gcyi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In addition to bacterial abundance, there are several additional factors that determine whether S. aureus successfully colonizes the skin in AD and whether this results in clinically relevant infection. Casadevall and Pirofski described the 'damage–response framework' approach to microbial pathogenesis. 82, 83 The basic tenets of this concept are that host and microbe interact to create a spectrum of possible states, ranging from commensalism and colonization to disease. Disease results from damage to the host, which can come from the host response, the microbe or both. The damage–response framework defines infection as the acquisition of a microbe, but it does not necessarily mean the microbe is causing disease. Infection results in disease when the host–microbe interaction produces sufficient damage to become clinically apparent. 84

This approach is a framework that advances thinking beyond the classic microbe‐centric Koch's postulates that dominated microbiological thought for more than a century. It may be a useful approach for understanding the S. aureus –host interaction in AD and the range of clinical scenarios that can arise (Fig. 6). We have some understanding of the various bacterial and host factors that contribute during S. aureus infection in AD. However, the key questions to be answered are (i) which of these factors lead to worsening inflammation in AD? and (ii) can a threshold of host damage resulting from the S. aureus –host interaction be defined, beyond which antibiotics prove beneficial? If the key host and microbial factors that determine these outcomes are identified, then targeting of these specific factors with novel immunotherapies or selective antimicrobial therapies may become a reality. 14, 85

Figure 6
Hypothetical damage–response framework for Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis. 82 Different host– S. aureus interactions result in different damage–response relationships. Curves A and B represent the damage–response relationships of S. aureus with two different hosts or those of a single host with two different S. aureus strains. The outcome for the host depends on the strength of the host response to S. aureus or the virulence of S. aureus. During intermediate host responses neither interaction (A or B) causes clinical evidence of infection, as the amount of damage incurred by the host is insufficient (1). However, in the setting of weak or strong responses both interactions cause anflare (2) and interaction B causes overtly infected(3). The position of the curve is determined by multiple host and S. aureus factors.

### A comparison of the efficacy and safety of mupirocin cream and cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema [^114tRxe9]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of mupirocin calcium cream were compared with those of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema. In this multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy study, 159 patients with secondarily infected eczema (suitable for treatment with topical antimicrobials) and a total skin infection rating scale score of 8 or more were randomized to receive either topical mupirocin cream three times daily or oral cephalexin, 250 mg four times daily, for 10 days (intent-to-treat group). Clinical success (per-protocol group), defined in part as a patient with a response of improvement in the skin infection rating scale, was similar in the two groups: 89% for mupirocin (n = 44) and 82% for cephalexin (n = 38) [P = 0.29; 95% confidence interval (-8.4%, 22.5%)]. Bacteriological success (intent-to-treat group), defined as a patient with a response of eradication, improvement or colonization of bacteria at the end of therapy, however, was significantly higher for mupirocin [50% and 28% in the mupirocin (n = 48) and cephalexin (n = 47) groups, respectively; P = 0.005]. Mupirocin cream was as well tolerated as cephalexin; 9% and 13% of patients reported adverse events related or possibly related to study medication in the mupirocin and cephalexin groups, respectively. The most common adverse events overall were diarrhoea and nausea. Mupirocin cream applied three times daily is as effective clinically and superior bacteriologically compared with oral cephalexin given four times daily in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema of limited depth and severity. Mupirocin cream is as well tolerated as oral cephalexin, and more patients prefer the topical regimen, which should improve patient compliance.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^115VUbDH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

The intervention is topical anti‐inflammatory treatments. The following interventions were included.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS), including combinations with antimicrobials (with the caveat that studies where eligibility is limited to clinically infected eczema will not be included) or salicylic acid. TCS were grouped by potency (i.e. mild, moderate, potent, and very potent);
Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus;
Topical phosphodiesterase IV (PDE‐4) inhibitors, such as crisaborole;
Topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib or delgocitinib;
Topical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activators, such as tapinarof;
Any other well‐characterised novel anti‐inflammatory treatments.

In general, eligible interventions are listed in the British National Formulary (BNF) as suitable products for treating eczema, but products not included in the BNF were included if they were clinically relevant. To ensure our review was relevant and focused, trials of historical topical therapies that are no longer used worldwide for managing eczema (such as coal tar), were not included, except for trials of discontinued TCS, for which the potency of the TCS preparation can be inferred.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^116GWmAh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data not included in the meta‐analyses

We did not include three trials in any meta‐analyses because the numerical data were unsuitable for pooling (Bryden 2009; Murphy 2003; Pei 2001), and are summarised in Analysis 10.3. In line with the Analysis 10.1, Bryden 2009 found no significant difference in SASSAD between groups in a small trial of 51 children with moderate to severe eczema. One multiple arm trial of 40 children with moderate to severe eczema, who used a newer, second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (Pei 2001), showed improvement in clinical signs in all groups, but baseline severity differed significantly between the groups making it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusion. One trial suggested an improvement in clinical signs in the wet‐wraps group but provided no numerical data to support this statement (Murphy 2003).

One trial in children with moderate‐severity eczema reported limited follow‐up data (Beattie 2004). At one week of follow‐up (week 3), SASSAD had increased in the twice daily, without wet‐wraps group to 22.8 (9 participants) and to 21.9 in the once daily, wet‐wrap group (10 participants). Beattie 2004 did not report dispersion data at this time point.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Two trials reported itch and sleep data and we have summarised them in Analysis 10.4 (Beattie 2004; Hindley 2006). These trials included a very low number of participants (19 and 45 respectively) but there were no relevant differences suggestive of benefit in using wet wraps.

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Two small short‐term trials in children with moderate and severe eczema (Beattie 2004; Hindley 2006; Analysis 10.5), found that seven of 33 participants treated with wet wraps reported skin infections or required antibiotics whilst none were reported in the group that did not use wet wraps (31 participants).

None of the trials included under this comparison reported skin thinning and related signs, and local site reactions.

Safety: number of relevant systemic adverse events (secondary outcome)

Relevant systemic adverse events were not reported.

Unspecified adverse events (safety)

Foelster‐Holst 2006 reported that no adverse events occurred up to end of treatment (48 to 72 hours) in the 14‐day follow‐up period (adults and children; mild to moderate eczema; 24 participants).

### Educational and psychological interventions for managing atopic dermatitis (eczema) [^112fpfoz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

From an economic perspective, the rising prevalence of eczema suggests that the economic burden of treating this disease on healthcare services, people with eczema and society, can be expected to grow in the future. However, a common factor amongst all cost‐of‐illness trials identified is that the economic burden of eczema is driven by the severity of disease. This suggests that the emergence of new treatment approaches may have substantial potential for cost‐effectiveness if they can lead to better disease control for patients, prevention of disease progression to more severe disease stages, and improvement of quality of life of people with eczema.

It is important to conduct this review to assess the cost‐effectiveness of eczema interventions. Globally, healthcare systems have insufficient resources (e.g. money or staff) to provide treatment for all who have this common health problem and there is a paucity of economic evidence for treatments in comparison to clinical outcomes (Sach 2019). Some interventions now have sufficient evidence to suggest little or no benefit for people with eczema, such as the application of topical corticosteroids twice daily rather than once daily; topical corticosteroids containing antibiotics when used for the management of non‐infected eczema; the use of ion exchange water softeners; and dietary supplements, such as probiotics, borage oil and evening primrose oil (Nankervis 2017). This provides options for disinvestment, ensuring that available funds are channelled to the most effective and efficient treatments. Non‐concordance to eczema treatment is widely reported, though the reasons remain poorly understood. Poor treatment concordance results in a complex and sizeable problem for global healthcare, as it has a vast impact on clinical outcomes, health economics, and patient safety (Eicher 2019). Eczema places a substantial economic burden on healthcare providers, patients, and society. Given the need to ensure efficient allocation of scarce healthcare funding resources, it is important to include a summary of the cost‐effectiveness evidence base that evaluates the use of educational and psychological interventions for the treatment of eczema.

This Cochrane review was prioritised by Cochrane Skin in their 2020 prioritisation exercise, which aimed to identify the most important systematic review titles within the group's scope (Cochrane Skin 2020).

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^114zRFJS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

While eczema often improves during early childhood or puberty, a significant proportion of individuals still require treatment in adult life (Abuabara 2018), and in others, eczema does not start until adulthood. Eczema is managed with long‐term treatments. For the majority of people, treatment is topical. Emollients (bland moisturisers) are a mainstay of eczema treatment, but predominantly have a preventative role through hydrating the skin and improving the skin barrier; they are inadequate to reduce inflammation, except in very mild cases. To treat actively inflamed areas, topical anti‐inflammatory agents are needed (NICE 2007).

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first‐line topical anti‐inflammatory treatment for eczema (NICE 2007; Wollenberg 2020). TCS are typically applied once or twice daily to actively inflamed areas of skin for seven to 14 days, or until resolution. Prolonged, continuous use of TCS is not usually advised. However, 'weekend therapy' (i.e. the proactive regular twice‐weekly application of treatment) is used, and can improve long‐term control in people with frequent flares (Williams 2004). TCS preparations can be classified into different potency groups based on vasoconstriction assays (Eichenfield 2014), and different potencies are used for treatment depending on the individual's age, site of application, and disease severity. Antimicrobials and salicylic acid may also be added to TCS preparations. TCS agents have a very well‐established safety profile as they have been used extensively since the 1950s. Despite this, research suggests that many people with eczema and their carers have a number of concerns about TCS (Teasdale 2021), including skin thinning (Charman 2000). Although such adverse effects are typically associated with inappropriate use of more potent TCS agents (Charman 2000; Hajar 2015), people with eczema and their carers also have concerns when using mildly potent agents (Bos 2019; Charman 2000). These concerns can have important implications for treatment adherence and, consequently, disease control.

### Use of antibiotics in early life and development of diseases in childhood: nationwide registry study [^116yHjMk]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Similarly, the association to eczema outcomes still held after applying the sibling analysis. Because antibiotics are seldom used to treat symptoms of eczema, this association might be more robust. Hospital admission for eczema is uncommon, and in our study population only a small number of individuals received inpatient care compared with the rate of eczema diagnosed by drug treatment. A common reason for inpatient treatment of eczema is an infected rash. Thus some of the patients admitted to hospital might represent a subgroup who, as part of their disease course, are more prone to skin infections leading to antibiotic treatment before a proper diagnosis. This question needs to be investigated further because our sibling analysis did not suggest this effect.

Based on the sibling comparison, we hypothesise that familial susceptibility to infections, rather than use of antibiotics, could explain part of the underlying mechanism. We previously showed that infections, including viral pathogens, were associated with a higher risk of asthma. We further speculate that within families, baseline predispositions exist to both infections and subsequent immune mediated diseases. In a registry based cohort study, we previously showed that maternal use of antibiotics was linked to asthma in the offspring, regardless of whether the mother received antibiotics before, during, or after pregnancy. These results were supported by a Swedish study that included a sibling design. These findings are consistent with our sibling analysis, highlighting that intrinsic factors shared within the family should be investigated further, beyond those considered in previous studies.

Although our study did not fully establish that antibiotics are an independent risk factor for most of the immune mediated diseases that we studied and overweight, antibiotic treatment practices vary greatly worldwide, with notable differences between European countries and the US. Even within Europe, Denmark ranks low in antibiotic useand, compared with the US, dispenses much more conservatively. In Denmark, antibiotics are used cautiously, and human consumption and livestock usage are monitored. In countries with less strict antibiotic regulations and over-the-counter access, our analysis showing a dose-response relation could suggest potential threshold effects of antibiotics on the risk of disease. This finding implies that risks might escalate with cumulative use of antibiotics, but this effect requires further investigation.

The results of our study challenge the notion of antibiotics as a risk factor for many immune mediated diseases, instead pointing to familial predisposition as a key factor. Clinically, this finding highlights the importance of evaluating the family history and shared environmental exposures to guide antibiotic prescribing practices, ensuring that treatment is appropriately tailored to the individual child's risk profile while minimising unnecessary use of antibiotics.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: expert statement and review from the international eczema council skin infection group [^111UekoT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Untreated bacterial skin infection in AD may become systemic and lead to life‐threatening complications including sepsis, endocarditis and bone and joint infections. 20, 21, 22 Despite the significant morbidity caused by bacterial skin infection in AD, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and treat associated bacterial colonization and infection. Although there are many diagnostic criteria for AD itself, there are no validated diagnostic criteria for infected AD. 23

The International Eczema Council, a group of approximately 100 experts in AD worldwide, has recently initiated a taskforce to define the role of bacterial skin infections and their management in AD through consensus statements in an effort to provide level D evidence. It is hoped that input from clinical experts will contribute to better defining the wide‐ranging clinical presentations of S. aureus infection in AD and, more importantly, to identify better those who may benefit from existing or novel antimicrobial treatments. Based on a systematic search of the literature, including terms for AD and 'infection', 'bacteria', 'staphylococcus aureus' and 'microbiome' (detailed search strategy available on request), this narrative review defines the clinical features of bacterial infection in AD and our current understanding of the host and bacterial factors that influence microbial colonization and virulence.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: post hoc pediatric subgroup analysis from a 44-week open-label extension study [^115vw4Vs]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1 TEAEs

The pediatric subgroup had a similar safety profile in the double‐blind 9 trials and OLE (Table 2). Over 44 weeks of open‐label treatment, 22/38 (57.9%) of pediatric patients reported ≥ 1 TEAE; most were mild or moderate in severity. Notably, only 1 pediatric patient discontinued due to TEAEs (12 years old; dry mouth [related to treatment] and concurrent upper abdominal pain [unrelated]). The most frequently reported TEAEs in the OLE among pediatric patients were dry mouth (15.8%), vision blurred (10.5%), and mydriasis (7.9%). No pediatric patients experienced a serious TEAE. One pediatric patient, a 14‐year‐old male, who was randomized to vehicle in the double‐blind trials, reported treatment‐related, severe application site dermatitis in the OLE. Study drug was interrupted on day of onset and concomitant medication was administered on the second and fifth day after onset (1 dose of a topical triple‐antibiotic containing neomycin, bacitracin, and polymyxin and a topical antifungal/steroid cream containing clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [1%/0.05%], respectively); the event resolved in 20 days, the patient resumed study drug after resolution, and completed study.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), where individuals or groups are randomised, were included. Trials that did not state that they were randomised, along with trials that were explicitly quasi‐randomised or non‐randomised designs, were excluded. The first phase of cross‐over trials (due to the risk of carry‐over effects to subsequent periods), cluster‐randomised trials and within‐participant trials were included. Trials where participants might be equally likely to receive alternative treatments, so that the transitivity assumption is not violated, were also included.

Types of participants

Trials of participants with a clinical diagnosis of eczema (i.e. atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis; Johanssen 2004) established using diagnostic criteria for eczema (or a modified version of such criteria) or diagnosis by a healthcare professional were included. Participants with clinically infected eczema were not included. There were no restrictions on age, sex, ethnicity, or disease severity.

Specific forms of eczema that were not atopic eczema, such as irritant contact eczema, allergic contact eczema, hand eczema, discoid eczema, asteatotic eczema, frictional eczema, stasis eczema, photosensitive eczema, and seborrhoeic eczema were excluded. Where trials included both eligible and non‐eligible participants (e.g. where some participants have eczema, but others have irritant contact eczema), only trials where data on eligible participants with eczema were available separately were included.

### Infections in patients with atopic dermatitis and the influence of treatment [^114LqiK7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is increasingly used for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although skin reactions to IVIg therapy are usually minor, rare, and not life-threatening, dermatologists need to recognize the nature of these adverse reactions.

### Empiric antibiotics and outcomes of children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum [^114yMakV]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although patients with eczema herpeticum often receive antibiotics for presumed bacterial coinfection, the effect of empiric antibiotic therapy is unknown. Our objective therefore was to determine the association between empiric antibiotics and outcomes in children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum. We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 1,150 children ages 2months to 17years admitted with eczema herpeticum between January 1, 2001, and March 31, 2010, to 42 tertiary care children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System. All patients received antibiotics during the hospitalization. Multivariable linear regression models determined the association between empiric antibiotic therapy and the main outcome measure: hospital length of stay (LOS). There were no deaths during the study period. Receipt of empiric antibiotics was not associated with a change in the LOS on unadjusted or multivariable analysis. The class of empiric antibiotic was not associated with the LOS except for receipt of vancomycin, which was associated with a longer LOS (21% adjusted longer LOS, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8–35%; p = 0.001). When restricted to patients with a bloodstream infection, receipt of empiric antibiotics was associated with a 51% adjusted shorter LOS (95% CI = -24 to -68%; p = 0.002). In children hospitalized with eczema herpeticum, empiric antibiotic therapy was not associated with a shorter LOS overall, but was associated with a shorter LOS in patients with a bloodstream infection. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition of systemic bacterial illness in children with eczema herpeticum. Empiric antibiotics did not affect mortality, which is low.

### Management of difficult-to-treat atopic dermatitis [^113wTAwj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex disorder caused by the interplay between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Particularly in patients with severe disease, the effect is not just an itchy rash but also the secondary effects on the psychological well-being of the patient and their carers, particularly disturbed sleep. The aim of this review is to provide health care professionals with a holistic approach to the management of difficult-to-treat atopic dermatitis, defined as atopic dermatitis seemingly unresponsive to simple moisturizers and mild potency (classes VI and VII) topical corticosteroids. The critical importance of education and advice is emphasized, as is the seminal role of secondary bacterial infection and polyclonal T-cell activation in causing acute flares in patients with severe, generalized disease. In atypical cases or those that do not respond to treatment, alternative diagnoses should be considered.

### Impetigo incidence and treatment: a retrospective study of Dutch routine primary care data [^11671oit]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of recently published data on impetigo presentation incidence and treatment practices in the routine Western European primary care setting.

Objectives

To investigate impetigo incidence, treatments and recurrence in primary care in the Netherlands.

Methods

A retrospective, observational study. Electronic records of patients treated for impetigo in 2015 at 29 general practices in Utrecht and surrounds were reviewed. An episode of impetigo was defined as one or more patient-doctor contacts within 8 weeks of the index consultation. Within an episode, patient demographics and prescribing patterns were analysed including number of treatments, and the category and sequence of individual medicines.

Results

A total of 1761 impetigo episodes were managed, with an incidence rate of 13.6 per 1000 person years. Impetigo peaked in summer. Most patients, the majority children, experienced a single episode (93%), and 25% had eczema as comorbidity. Topical antibiotics (primarily fusidic acid) were the most prescribed initial treatments (85%), followed by oral antibiotics (14%). Topical antibiotics were progressively used less over subsequent treatments, while there was an inverse increase in oral antibiotic use. Topical fusidic acid as the most common first line treatment seemed satisfactory as only 12% of initial treatments with this drug received further therapy. Repeat treatments generally occurred within 7 days.

Conclusion

This study of impetigo prescribing patterns in primary care highlighted that Dutch general practitioners were generally adherent to national treatment guidelines. Topical treatment, and if needed systemic small-spectrum antibiotic treatment, appeared satisfactory; these findings aid in antimicrobial stewardship.

### Probiotics for treating eczema [^111QuTVg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font).

Main Results

We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics. For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period. Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile. We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments. Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points. We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall. We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events. Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes. Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.

Background

Description of the condition

Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema, is a common and burdensome skin disease. Eczema is most common in early life, affecting up to 20% of infants and about 6% of school‐age children and adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide (De Lusignan 2021; Hay 2014; Langan 2023; Williams 2008). It is a chronic, fluctuating condition that varies in severity. In mild eczema, individuals may have only occasional localised patches of inflamed skin that cause minimal symptoms, but severe eczema causes extensive erythema, excoriations and chronic skin changes such as lichenification.

Eczema can have a substantial impact on quality of life and psychosocial domains (social, academic, and occupational) through persistent itch and the stigma associated with having visibly affected skin (Carroll 2005; Chamlin 2004; Drucker 2017; Lewis‐Jones 2006). The impact on quality of life can exceed that reported in other chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, especially when eczema is severe or affects readily visible areas (Beattie 2006; Drucker 2017; Kemp 2003; Vittrup 2023). Eczema also causes an economic burden and, in the United States alone, the direct costs of eczema are estimated as over 1 billion US dollars per year (Drucker 2017). Costs which affect people with eczema and their families include buying moisturisers, washing products or special clothing and taking time off work to care for a child with eczema (Carroll 2005).

### Topical antibacterial agents in dermatology [^11393eSw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Topical antibacterials are being widely used for the treatment or prevention of superficial bacterial infections. Emergence of drug resistant mutant strains of microorganisms and development of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis is a common problem with many of the topical antibacterials. Topical antibacterials are being reviewed with special emphasis on their spectrum of activity, resistance patterns, contact sensitivity potential and clinical uses. Factors which help the physician to choose a particular antibacterial for the specific indication in order to have the maximum efficacy and minimum adverse effects are discussed.

### Intestinal microbiota composition after antibiotic treatment in early life: the INCA study [^113WcdNL]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Power calculation

The power of this observational cohort study and the number of participants is based on one of the clinical relevant primary endpoints: incidence of eczema after antibiotic exposure in early life. Eczema is the most common inflammatory skin disease of childhood, affecting 5 to 20% of children at any time. The cumulative prevalence of eczema varies from 20% in Northern Europe and the United States to 5% in the south-eastern Mediterranean. In high-risk populations in Northern Europe (e.g. infants with a positive family history of atopy), the incidence of eczema is increased and estimates 60%. Based on these data, in this study the incidence of eczema in the control group (healthy, non-antibiotic-treated infants) is estimated 20%, whereas in the antibiotic-treated group (infants we assume at increased risk for developing eczema) the incidence may rise to 35%. This percentage, to our opinion, reflects a slightly increased risk for developing eczema after antibiotic treatment in early life in a general population of infants. Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, a total of 450 children (150 antibiotics, 300 controls) have to be included to demonstrate this difference (20% ↔ 35%) with a power of 80% and an alpha of 5%.

The prevalence of other disease outcomes is variable. For example, prevalence rates of infantile colic vary between 5 and 40%, and literature shows that almost half of the children experience wheezing during the first years of life. So far, the effect of antibiotics (prospectively investigated) on these frequencies is unknown. Defining the size of potential differences to capture is therefore limited.

### Interventions for impetigo [^115zLZM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this. For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08). There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference. Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Recommendation 1 — good practice statement (atopic dermatitis): Clinicians managing all severities of atopic dermatitis (AD) should, before issuing any new therapy, ensure the correct diagnosis and identify complicating diagnoses, provide education (for instance an information guide and an action plan), address trigger avoidance, ensure proper medication use/adherence, and encourage application of a bland moisturizer titrated to symptomatic benefit (at least once, often multiple times, per day). Mimickers and complicating disorders are common and must be ruled out, including irritant and/or allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, photodermatoses, primary immunodeficiency disorders, infestations (eg, scabies), and local and systemic infections (eg, Streptococcal, Staphylococcal, fungal, syphilis). Inborn errors of immunity or other rare syndromes should be considered in infants and young children with concerning constellations of signs and symptoms that should prompt referral, and venous stasis dermatitis and cutaneous lymphoma are more common in adults.

### Interventions for impetigo [^114bYxtN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938–1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949–1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.

Side Effects

The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^1163vtrY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) systemic and phototherapy guideline — clinical questions, outcomes, and study scope are defined as follows: The clinical questions address the "efficacy and safety of systemic immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and antihistamine agents for the treatment of AD", the "efficacy and safety of phototherapy or photochemotherapy for the treatment of AD", the "comparative efficacy and safety of individual systemic therapies for the treatment of AD", and the "efficacy and safety of combination therapies including a systemic agent for the treatment of AD". Outcomes of interest include efficacy outcomes of "Change in clinical signs/symptoms of disease as assessed by a clinician" and "Prevention of flares"; safety outcomes of "Serious adverse events", "Withdrawal due to adverse events", and "Infection"; and patient-reported outcomes of "Change in patient-reported signs/symptoms", "Change in quality of life", and "Change in itch severity". The scope specifies a population of "Adults (≥ 18 y of age) with a clinical diagnosis of AD (including "eczema" or "atopic eczema")" while excluding "Immunocompromised patients, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, varicose eczema, discoid eczema; infected AD". Included interventions are "Systemic therapies or phototherapy/photo chemotherapy interventions available and approved for use (for any indication) in the US", excluding "Treatments not available or approved for use (for any indication) in the US". Eligible study designs are "Published RCTs in which study participants are investigated (inter-individual, parallel-arm trials)" with exclusions of "Unpublished research, observational studies, case series, case reports, modeling studies, narrative reviews".

### Secondary infections in patients with atopic dermatitis [^114SxvoB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians have long since been aware that bacteria and other microorganisms play a role in the etiology of atopic dermatitis. Indeed, the immunological profile of atopy favors colonization by Staphylococcus aureus, and the bacteria are present in most patients with atopic dermatitis, even in the absence of skin lesions. Clinical signs of impetiginization, such as weeping and crusting, periauricular fissuration, or small superficial pustules are a sensitive indicator that the numbers of S. aureus may have increased and a clinical indication of secondary infected dermatitis. However, recent research that has focussed on the role of S. aureus in atopic dermatitis, offers a reversed perspective, by presenting evidence that the underlying pathology of atopic dermatitis, i.e. an alteration of the skin barrier and inflammation of the upper dermis, depends itself on the presence of an infectious process. In other words, secondary infection with S. aureus emerges as a cause of atopic dermatitis. Secondary infections due to fungi have, comparatively, received less attention, but there is evidence for a role for Malassezia spp. as a factor in dermatitis with a head and neck distribution pattern. Viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, and mixed infections of intertriginous spaces, may complicate an underlying atopic dermatitis, but are not perceived as etiologic factors. Recent research has greatly contributed to our understanding of the pathophysiological potential of S.aureus superantigens in atopic dermatitis, suggesting that antibiotic therapy might be an important element in the therapeutic management of atopic dermatitis. At present, however, the clinical evidence is scarce with regards to demonstrating a clear advantage of combined anti-inflammatory and antibiotic treatment, compared with anti-inflammatory treatment alone. If there is a consensus that the presence of clinically infected lesions in atopic dermatitis warrants a course of specific antibiotic topical therapy, the clinical benefit of antibiotic agents in apparently uninfected atopic dermatitis, as present in the majority of patients, remains an open question. Moreover, the impact of adjuvant skin care on the cutaneous microflora needs to be quantified in order to properly assess the role of specific antibiotic therapy in clinically uninfected atopic dermatitis. In the meantime, secondary infections in atopic dermatitis remain a secondary problem in clinical atopic dermatitis management, and specific anti-infective therapy remains a method of fine-tuning for optimizing individual atopic dermatitis treatment.

### Disease features, treatments, and burden of palmoplantar pustulosis in Korea: the EPPPIK study [^114TNZf4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

PPP is a challenging disease to diagnose as it shares many similar clinical and histological features with other inflammatory skin diseases, such as dyshidrotic eczema. Clear characterization of PPP histopathologic features (e.g. vesicles lacking spongiosis, microabscesses on the edge of vesicles, loss of granular layer) has been reported in studies by Masuda‐Kuroki et al. and Yoon et al. further improving the differential diagnosis of PPP. However, there are currently no established standards of care or guidelines. Commonly used treatments include topical and systemic therapies, phototherapy, biologics, and other oral therapies. There is a lack of well‐documented clinical trial data to support a standardized treatment paradigm for PPP. However, topical corticosteroids are often suggested for first‐line therapy or mild disease. For patients with moderate to severe PPP, phototherapy or a systemic agent, such as a systemic retinoid, methotrexate, or cyclosporine, may be effective, although variable and unpredictable clinical responses have been reported. Since many patients become refractory to or have contraindications with topical or traditional systemic medications, biologic therapies, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 17, and IL‐23 inhibitors, can be considered. Although there are no specific treatment guidelines for PPP in Korea, in general, topical treatments are commonly used for patients with mild PPP and systemic treatments are typically reserved for patients with moderate to severe PPP. Based on the results of a phase 3 trial, the IL‐23 inhibitor guselkumab was approved to treat PPP in Japan. In Korea, guselkumab is also approved for the treatment of PPP and is the only biologic currently approved in this setting. In practice, guselkumab is reserved for adults with moderate or severe disease who have inadequate response to conventional treatments.

### Mycosis fungoides palmaris et plantaris mimicking "Dyshidrotic eczema": a case report [^112sC7TQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mycosis fungoides palmaris et plantaris (MFPP) is a rare variant of mycosis fungoides (MF), a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. MFPP primarily affects the palms and soles of the feet and is often misdiagnosed as dyshidrotic eczema due to its similar clinical presentation. This case report presents a middle-aged woman with MFPP whose initial presentation was mistaken for dyshidrotic eczema. Despite treatment with topical corticosteroids, the patient's lesions persisted, prompting further investigations that led to the diagnosis of MFPP. The patient was initiated on betamethasone dipropionate ointment and hydroxyzine for pruritus management, with a pivotal referral to oncology for comprehensive evaluation. This case highlights the importance of considering MFPP in the differential diagnosis of persistent eczematous lesions on the palms and soles, especially when treatment with topical corticosteroids is ineffective.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced dyshidrotic eczema following tremelimumab therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma [^112NsdEA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ICIs cause upregulation of the immune response, leading to cirAEs. CirAEs occur in up to 68% of patients treated with ICIs, with most reactions being pruritic and those that are non-specific in nature. Although less common, eczematous reactions in the setting of ICIs are most often observed as scaly macules and papules but can range from localized patches and plaques to nummular plaques and asteatotic eczema. Reports of dyshidrotic vesicles or morphologies are limited. Although clinical presentation of cirAEs can be nonspecific, most rashes are low grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 1–2) and occur mainly on the trunk, with less frequent involvement of the extremities, digits, or face. Lesions typically appear after the first few ICI treatments, with rashes caused by anti-CTLA-4 agents often appearing sooner than those caused by anti-PD-1 agents (5 weeks with anti-PD-1 vs 3–4 weeks with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies). Eczematous reactions are histopathologically defined by spongiotic dermatitis with sparse to abundant eosinophils and perivascular T-lymphocyte infiltrate, consistent with the present case. Such eruptions are often self-limited, with good response to oral antihistamines and topical steroids in most patients. Cessation of ICI treatment is rarely required; some literature suggests that development of cirAEs may portend better prognostic outcome. However, clinical severity of cirAEs must be thoroughly evaluated, as systemic corticosteroids or biologic agents may be warranted for severe, persistent reactions. Further, clinicopathologic and laboratory evaluation may be necessary to rule out life-threatening cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^113Cvq12]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:

A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### Dermatologic toxicity occurring during anti-EGFR monoclonal inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a systematic review [^1152JWf8]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Skin Rash and Dermatitis.

The treatments commonly used for the management of skin rash are detailed in Table 3. The reported data have described treatment of patients with grade 1 or 2 skin rash to include petrolatum emollients, medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids, oral minocycline or doxycycline, 0.5% to 2.5% hydrocortisone cream, H 1 antihistaminic loratadine, and saline/boric acid compresses.– Topical antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole and benzoyl peroxide can be used to treat skin toxicities; however, these are usually avoided in patients with papulopustular or acneiform eruption because these treatments have drying properties that can induce rosacea and can be irritating. Additionally, the use of topical retinoids is typically avoided because of their greater potential for irritation. Patients are cautioned to avoid sunbathing, direct sunlight, hot temperatures, and humidity. Patients should avoid manipulation of skin or hot blow-drying of the hair because these can increase the risk of infection. Although the use of greasy creams such as petroleum jelly is highly effective, the treatment can cause folliculitis owing to its occlusive properties.

For patients with grade 3/4 skin rash, the reports most commonly suggested temporary dose interruption and/or reduction of anti-EGFR therapy, depending on the severity of the rash and the patient's tolerance level. In addition to the suggested reductions, other possible recommended treatment methods include the administration of doxycycline; minocycline; oral; intramuscular; intravenous antihistamine; high-dose tetracycline; oral corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisone); oral retinoids (low-dose isotretinoin); or intravenous antibiotics.,

Treatment of xerosis and/or pruritus often includes the use of moisturizers or oral antihistamines. Emollients and cyanoacry-late tissue adhesives can effectively treat xerosis but must be used with care because their occlusive properties can lead to folliculitis. For patients who experience eczema, treatment with cortico steroids is recommended; for those who experience eczema with blisters (wet eczema), cultures should be conducted to ensure no bacterial or viral infection is present.

### Comparison of localized high-dose UVA1 irradiation versus topical cream psoralen-UVA for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema [^115mZbVM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Vesicular dyshidrotic palmoplantar eczema is a common disorder but treatment is difficult. Localized photochemotherapy (cream psoralen-UVA [PUVA]) has widely been used for therapy. Although the efficacy of cream PUVA therapy is well known, potential side effects may occur. Therefore, a more standardized safe and effective UV therapy should be carried out.

Objective

This study compared the effects of localized high-dose UVA1 irradiation versus topical cream PUVA for treatment of chronic vesicular dyshidrotic eczema.

Methods

On the basis of the assessment of the Dyshidrotic Area and Severity Index, the decrease of score points on the UVA1-treated side was compared with the decrease on the cream PUVA-treated side in 27 patients. In addition, analysis of serum markers was performed.

Results

Of 27 patients, 24 showed a good response to localized UVA1 irradiation or cream PUVA. Dyshidrotic Area and Severity Index scores significantly decreased on both sides and were reduced to half of the pretreatment values. No statistically significant differences between localized UVA1 irradiation or cream PUVA could be detected.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that localized UVA1 phototherapy is easy to perform and appears to be an effective and safe treatment for vesicular dyshidrotic eczema.

### Treating impetigo in primary care [^114YuHN1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a superficial, but contagious, bacterial infection of the skin that predominantly affects children and is common in primary care. In UK general practice, around half of the people with impetigo are treated with topical fusidic acid. However, bacterial resistance to this antibacterial drug is increasing. Here we discuss how patients with impetigo should be treated.

### Atopic dermatitis guidelines: diagnosis, systemic therapy, and adjunctive care [^112rg1WB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1–4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5–7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### The widespread use of topical antimicrobials enriches for resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis [^112pCvG3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

While fusC prevalence seems clonally influenced, the fusA mutations are indicative of prior exposure and adaptation to fusidic acid therapy. Numerous fusA SNPs were identified across the whole population (Fig. 2), demonstrating that this was the consequence of repeated independent events. Several case isolates had multiple mutations in fusA. Previously it has been reported that secondary mutations in fusA provide a potential mechanism to offset the fitness deficit incurred by maintaining this amino acid change. 32

These observations raise several important points for clinical consideration. Firstly, do our prescribing practices at a population level select for specific colonizing strains in AD? Strain prevalence in AD is an emerging area of interest, and little is presently understood about the genetic basis of the preferential success of certain lineages, but this study supports the recent findings of strain preponderance. 20 Secondly, does patient behaviour in addition to prescribing practice contribute to the accumulation of fusA mutations in cases? Anecdotally, patients often report using repeated short bursts of fusidic acid preparations at home for disease flares. Several studies have that suggested both intermittent and prolonged usage of such therapies is very likely to contribute to the development of resistance. 30, 33 The patients with AD in this study were attending a tertiary clinic for the first time, and will likely have received this antibiotic in the community.

One limitation of this study was the lack of detailed prescribing records for the participants. The results nonetheless highlight the importance of antimicrobial stewardship in this specific disease context. Finally we have to consider whether the use of any antibiotic is warranted in many cases of AD flare. Recent clinical trial evidence has clearly demonstrated a lack of objective benefit of antimicrobials over use of a moderate‐potency topical steroid, at least in mild disease exacerbation. 34, 35

Future studies are specifically needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial usage on S. aureus populations in AD. Topical antimicrobials, both antibiotics and antiseptics, are of particular interest. These studies must incorporate both community‐based patients and those under specialist dermatological care, and correlate with prescribing data. Patients of different ages must be assessed to allow examination of the selective impact of prescribing in dermatological and wider clinical practice. With increasing evidence of lack of benefit of these treatments, and growing resistance, we must reassess and change our clinical practice accordingly.

### Xerosis and pruritus in the elderly: recognition and management [^116AHJsJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Xerosis (dry skin) is characterized by pruritic, dry, cracked and fissured skin. Dry skin may be diagnosed as xerosis, eczema craquelé, dyshidrotic eczema, or asteatotic eczema. Two of the most common dermatologic problems found in nursing home residents are xerosis and pruitus. This article focuses on the recognition and treatment of these conditions, and stresses the importance of comprehensive treatment for these conditions as a preventative against stasis dermatitis and ulcer formation.
