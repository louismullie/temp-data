## Question

In a 54-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding, a history of breast cancer and deep vein thrombosis, and who is taking tamoxifen and apixaban, what is the next step in management?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next step in management for a 54-year-old presumed postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding, a history of breast cancer and deep vein thrombosis, and who is taking tamoxifen and apixaban, with attention to endometrial cancer risk and appropriate diagnostics and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is true postmenopausal bleeding and why that is a red flag. Then, I should quantify how tamoxifen changes the risk profile, especially for polyps, hyperplasia, and cancer. Next, I will decide on the initial diagnostic approach (transvaginal ultrasound versus endometrial biopsy) and how the 4 mm endometrial thickness threshold applies. After that, I need to consider tamoxifen-specific caveats, indications for hysteroscopy, and what to do if bleeding persists despite negative tests. Finally, I will plan management by pathology (polyp, hyperplasia with or without atypia, carcinoma), coordinate with oncology about tamoxifen continuation or switching, and ensure the patient receives clear counseling on prompt reporting of bleeding and follow-up needs [^111Q5nrD] [^113BKfDe] [^113kALam] [^1123BrEo].

> Let me first confirm the high-risk context. Any bleeding after 12 months of amenorrhea is postmenopausal bleeding and is the cardinal symptom of endometrial carcinoma, mandating prompt evaluation to exclude malignancy, and tamoxifen adds further concern given its endometrial agonist effects and boxed warnings for endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, carcinoma, and uterine sarcoma [^111Q5nrD] [^113BKfDe] [^113kALam].

> I should quantify risk and specific patterns. Wait, let me verify the polyp piece: endometrial polyps are indeed the most common endometrial pathology associated with postmenopausal tamoxifen exposure, and in the postmenopausal setting and with tamoxifen, their premalignant/malignant potential is higher, which is why these features (postmenopausal state, PMB, and tamoxifen exposure) place patients among the highest-risk groups for premalignant/malignant polyps [^115b2ixY] [^1123BrEo] [^114tLaGM].

> Next, I should review the recommended initial diagnostic approach. For an initial episode of postmenopausal bleeding, guideline-concordant first-line testing is either transvaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness or direct endometrial sampling in the office; both are acceptable starting points, and the choice can be individualized based on availability, risk factors, and patient preference [^111Q5nrD] [^114yjSi9] [^113AgABM].

> Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions about thresholds. A thin endometrial echo of ≤ 4 mm on transvaginal ultrasound confers a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer in general PMB populations, and ACOG notes that endometrial sampling is not required if the stripe is ≤ 4 mm for an initial episode — but I should double-check the caveats here because tamoxifen alters endometrial imaging and rare type II cancers can occur with thin stripes [^111Q5nrD] [^1128Ma2a] [^112euQah].

> Wait, I should correct and refine that for tamoxifen users. Tamoxifen is associated with endometrial thickening and sonographic artifacts; there are no validated endometrial thickness thresholds in asymptomatic tamoxifen users, and ultrasound has a high false-positive rate in this group, so in symptomatic tamoxifen users with PMB I should have a low threshold for histologic evaluation, and if bleeding persists or recurs, biopsy is indicated regardless of endometrial thickness, given that some cancers (especially type II) can present with ET < 3–4 mm [^115BhAYU] [^112HVy99] [^112euQah].

> I will now examine how to proceed when ultrasound is nonreassuring or inadequate. If endometrial thickness is > 4 mm, if the endometrium is not well visualized, or if focal lesions are suspected, next steps include sonohysterography or office hysteroscopy with directed biopsy; if a blind biopsy is nondiagnostic and bleeding continues, hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage is warranted to localize focal pathology such as polyps in this high-risk tamoxifen context [^112QwGLP] [^113YhX3B] [^111Q5nrD].

> Let me think through pathology-driven management. For an endometrial polyp in a postmenopausal tamoxifen user with bleeding, polypectomy is indicated because malignancy risk is higher in this setting; histopathology guides follow-up intervals and the need for further sampling if symptoms recur [^1123BrEo] [^114tLaGM]. If endometrial hyperplasia is found, I should confirm whether atypia is present; when hyperplasia occurs in a tamoxifen user, guidelines recommend reassessing the need for tamoxifen in collaboration with oncology, and patients should be advised to re-present if bleeding recurs after treatment completion because relapse can occur [^111quEEY] [^113eyQu6].

> But wait, what about preventive strategies while on tamoxifen? The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system can reduce tamoxifen-associated polyps and hyperplasia, but evidence is insufficient to recommend routine use for tamoxifen users with breast cancer because effects on breast cancer outcomes and endometrial cancer risk are uncertain; this needs individualized risk–benefit discussion with oncology and gynecology if considered [^1153Bzkr] [^116t9frb].

> I should double-check endocrine therapy options if significant endometrial pathology emerges. In appropriate postmenopausal patients, switching from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor (e.g., exemestane) after 2–3 years can reduce gynecologic adverse events, and longer tamoxifen duration clearly increases endometrial cancer risk; these decisions must be coordinated with the breast oncologist to balance oncologic benefit and uterine risk [^112zsVJo] [^113V2kNN] [^114PK2VV] [^111Pm8LS].

> Next, I should review counseling and follow-up. Postmenopausal women should be explicitly counseled to report any vaginal bleeding promptly; this is emphasized in FDA labeling for tamoxifen and echoed by professional guidance, and it is important to mitigate disparities because delays in evaluating PMB are associated with more advanced-stage endometrial cancer at diagnosis, particularly among Black women; routine annual gynecologic examinations are reasonable during tamoxifen therapy, but routine surveillance TVUS is not recommended [^113kALam] [^112pfDhi] [^113hXUqf] [^111rV6sk].

> In summary, I need to ensure an efficient, guideline-concordant pathway: confirm PMB and tamoxifen exposure, choose TVUS or office endometrial biopsy as the first test, remember that a ≤ 4 mm stripe is generally reassuring but maintain a low threshold for histologic sampling in tamoxifen users or if bleeding persists, escalate to hysteroscopy when imaging is nonreassuring or sampling is insufficient, manage pathology with polypectomy or hyperplasia-directed therapy while reassessing tamoxifen with oncology, and reinforce prompt symptom reporting and close follow-up to avoid delayed cancer diagnoses [^111Q5nrD] [^114yjSi9] [^112QwGLP] [^111quEEY] [^113vt5n7].

In a 54-year-old woman with vaginal bleeding, breast cancer, and DVT who is taking tamoxifen and apixaban, the next step is to perform an urgent endometrial biopsy [^1117D2Q1] to rule out endometrial cancer, as tamoxifen increases this risk [^113kALam] [^113V2kNN]. Continue apixaban to prevent thromboembolism [^notfound] and coordinate with gynecology and oncology for further management. If the biopsy is inconclusive or bleeding persists, proceed to hysteroscopy with directed biopsy [^113YhX3B]. Do not stop tamoxifen or apixaban without specialist input.

---

## Clinical significance of vaginal bleeding in tamoxifen users

Tamoxifen increases the risk of **endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer**, particularly with prolonged use [^113V2kNN]. Vaginal bleeding in tamoxifen users is a red flag for **endometrial pathology**, including malignancy [^112pfDhi].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial diagnostic steps

- **Focused history and physical examination**: Assess bleeding characteristics, duration, and associated symptoms [^113AgABM] [^1163XPsE].

- **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)**: Evaluate endometrial thickness and uterine pathology; thickness > 4 mm in postmenopausal women suggests further evaluation [^112QwGLP] [^111Q5nrD].

- **Endometrial biopsy**: Essential to rule out hyperplasia or malignancy; perform promptly in tamoxifen users with abnormal bleeding [^1123BrEo] [^1117D2Q1].

---

### Further diagnostic steps if initial evaluation is inconclusive

If the initial evaluation or biopsy is inconclusive or bleeding persists, perform **hysteroscopy with directed biopsy** or dilation and curettage (D&C) as appropriate [^113YhX3B] [^111Q5nrD].

---

## Management considerations

### Anticoagulation management

Continue **apixaban** to maintain anticoagulation and prevent thromboembolism, given the history of DVT and tamoxifen-associated risk [^113kALam] [^115E6Wtq]. Coordinate with **hematology** if invasive procedures are needed to plan peri-procedural anticoagulation management.

---

### Tamoxifen management

Do not discontinue **tamoxifen** without specialist input, as it is critical for breast cancer management. Any change should be coordinated with oncology [^111rV6sk]. If significant endometrial pathology is confirmed, **consider alternative endocrine therapy** by discussing a switch to an aromatase inhibitor with oncology [^112zsVJo].

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A **coordinated approach** involving gynecology, oncology, and hematology is essential to balance cancer risk, manage bleeding, and prevent thromboembolism.

---

## Summary of recommended next steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Focused history and physical examination [^113AgABM] |
| 2 | Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) [^111Q5nrD] |
| 3 | Urgent endometrial biopsy [^1117D2Q1] |
| 4 | Continue apixaban anticoagulation [^115E6Wtq] |
| 5 | Coordinate with gynecology, oncology, and hematology |
| 6 | Hysteroscopy with directed biopsy if initial biopsy inconclusive or bleeding persists [^113YhX3B] |

---

The next step is to **perform an urgent endometrial biopsy** to rule out malignancy, while **continuing apixaban** and coordinating care with gynecology, oncology, and hematology [^1117D2Q1] [^114yjSi9].

### Endometrial pathologies associated with postmenopausal tamoxifen treatment [^115b2ixY]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

To evaluate various endometrial pathologies associated with postmenopausal tamoxifen treatment, as well as the clinical aspects of these endometrial pathologies, a comprehensive search was conducted in PUBMED. The search included studies published in English up to the end of 2003, all reporting on endometrial pathologies in association with postmenopausal tamoxifen treatment. Overall, 106 studies were available and included in this review. The types of studies reviewed mostly consisted of randomized clinical trials, non-randomized cohort studies, and both prospective and retrospective case-controlled studies.

- **Results**: Endometrial polyps represent the most common endometrial pathology associated with postmenopausal tamoxifen exposure, with a high rate of malignancy reported in these polyps. Other conditions such as endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, and malignant mixed mesodermal tumors and sarcoma are more commonly diagnosed in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen compared to those not treated. Long-term tamoxifen users are more likely to develop endometrial cancer and sarcomas than non-users, attributed to the unfavorable histology of the endometrial malignancy and an advanced stage at diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians should be vigilant about these pathologies, as they may potentially increase patient mortality. Therefore, careful monitoring is crucial, particularly for patients presenting with gynecological symptoms such as pelvic pain or pressure.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 440: The role of transvaginal ultrasonography in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding [^111sefTY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose carcinoma. Women with postmenopausal bleeding may be assessed initially with either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography; this initial evaluation does not require performing both tests. Transvaginal ultrasonography can be useful in the triage of patients in whom endometrial sampling was performed but tissue was insufficient for diagnosis.

When transvaginal ultrasonography is performed for patients with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 mm is found, endometrial sampling is not required. Meaningful assessment of the endometrium by ultrasonography is not possible in all patients. In such cases, alternative assessment should be completed. When bleeding persists despite negative initial evaluations, additional assessment usually is indicated.

### Baseline endometrial assessment before tamoxifen for breast cancer in asymptomatic menopausal women [^114MB99G]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of endometrial pathology before the start of tamoxifen therapy in menopausal breast cancer patients. Ninety-one gynecologically asymptomatic patients, suffering from estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and scheduled for adjuvant tamoxifen, underwent pretreatment endometrial assessment. In all patients, a transvaginal ultrasonography was carried out; a double-layered endometrial stripe measuring above 4 mm was considered as abnormal. In these patients, outpatient hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were performed. Pathologic findings were considered the reference test in estimating the prevalence of endometrial morbidity.

In 34 patients (37.3%) a thickened endometrium was an indication for hysteroscopic and pathologic assessment. Endometrial polyps, simple hyperplasias, and complex atypical hyperplasias were found in 10 (10.9%), 4 (4.3%), and 3 (3.2%) patients, respectively, leading to an overall prevalence of baseline endometrial morbidity of 18.6%. Established individual risk factors for the development of endometrial pathology, such as body mass index, age at menarche and menopause, and parity, did not significantly differ in patients with and without endometrial abnormalities. Only patients' age (63.8 ± 8.6 and 52.2 ± 11.8; P = 0.03) and endometrial thickness (10.5 ± 3.5 and 3.9 ± 3.0; P > 0.001) were significant predictive factors of endometrial pathology.

Menopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer appear to have a high risk of baseline subclinical endometrial pathology.

### Endometrial bleeding in postmenopausal women: With and without hormone therapy [^111RvGTf]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to present a review of the potential mechanisms involved in the occurrence of endometrial bleeding in postmenopausal women using hormone therapy. Selected literature on the incidence of bleeding in postmenopausal women using estrogen progestogen therapy was reviewed. The incidence of spotting and bleeding in women using continuous-combined hormone therapy was presented.

Relevant articles related to the role of angiogenic factors and vasculogenesis in the endometrium, endometrial leukocytes, and endometrial metalloproteinases were used for the review. The cause or etiology of endometrial bleeding with hormone therapy is unknown. Several options are known to alter angiogenesis or be involved in tissue remodeling during normal menstruation. Vascular endothelial growth factor and thrombospondin-1 are proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors that could cause dysfunction in vasculogenesis, resulting in blood vessel fragility and bleeding. The role of pericytes in maintaining vessel morphology and integrity is discussed.

Endometrial leukocytes and metalloproteinases are involved in normal menstruation, but their role in postmenopausal bleeding is not clear, suggesting involvement of mechanisms in the bleeding. There is limited information on clinical investigation into the etiology of postmenopausal bleeding associated with hormone therapy. The major cause of hormone therapy-related bleeding is unknown. Alterations in angiogenic factors that could result in vascular dysfunction and vessel breakdown provide a working hypothesis as to the potential cause.

### Role of bleeding recognition and evaluation in Black-White disparities in endometrial cancer [^113hXUqf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Advanced stage at diagnosis is an independent, unexplained contributor to racial disparity in endometrial cancer. The study sought to investigate whether, prior to diagnosis, provider recognition of the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, differs by patient race.

- **Study design**: Black and White women diagnosed with endometrial cancer (2001 through 2011) from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare who had at least 2 years of claims prior to diagnosis were identified. Bleeding diagnoses along with procedures done prior to diagnosis were captured via claims data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with diagnostic workup, and multivariate models were built to determine the association of appropriate diagnostic procedures with stage at diagnosis.

- **Results**: In all, 4,354 White and 537 Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer were included. Compared to White women, Black women were less likely to have guideline-concordant care: postmenopausal bleeding and appropriate diagnostic evaluation (70% vs. 79%, P < .001), with adjusted relative risk ratios of 1.12–1.73 for different nonguideline-concordant pathways: bleeding without diagnostic procedures, alternative bleeding descriptions, and neither bleeding nor procedures. These pathways were associated with higher odds of advanced stage at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.90–2.88).

- **Conclusion**: The lack of recognition and evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding is associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in endometrial cancer.

### Outcome of investigations for postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in women under the age of 50 years [^116JYSGQ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of endometrial cancer in young postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding conducted in a gynecological oncology center in the United Kingdom. All participants underwent transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) as the initial investigation to evaluate the endometrium. Endometrial biopsy was performed only in cases where the endometrial thickness measured equal to or greater than 5 mm. The patients were divided into two groups based on their age: those less than 50 years (Group A) and those 50 years or older (Group B).

- **Results**: Over a 57-month period, 4454 women were investigated for postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Of these, 259 (5.8%) women were diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. A total of 260 (5.8%) women were younger than 50 years. Endometrial biopsy was not performed in 130 women in Group A who had an endometrial thickness measurement of less than 5 mm on ultrasonography. With a median follow-up period of 3 (1–5) years, no cases of endometrial cancer were found in women under the age of 50 who did not undergo endometrial biopsy at the time of initial evaluation. Overall, no cases of endometrial cancer were diagnosed in postmenopausal women under the age of 50 years.

- **Conclusions**: The study found no cases of endometrial cancer amongst the 260 women presenting with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding under the age of 50 years. It suggests that these women could be investigated on a less urgent basis depending on available resources.

### Management of endometrial hyperplasia (Green-top Guideline No. 67) [^1153Bzkr]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for endometrial hyperplasia, particularly in patients receiving tamoxifen, the BSGE/RCOG 2016 guidelines report insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems in patients with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. The effect on breast cancer recurrence risk is unknown. However, there is evidence that levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems prevent polyp formation and reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in patients receiving tamoxifen.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^116M61E2]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the gynecology clinic with a one-week history of vaginal bleeding. She underwent investigations to rule out local and systemic causes, including genital malignancy. The results were negative for genital malignancy, and her symptoms resolved spontaneously. The bleeding was attributed to corticosteroid treatment for shoulder joint pain. A short literature review of this rare side effect is discussed.

### Committee opinion no. 601: Tamoxifen and uterine cancer [^112pfDhi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen agent, is widely used as adjunctive therapy for women with breast cancer, and it has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and reduction in breast cancer incidence in high-risk women. Tamoxifen use may be extended to 10 years based on new data demonstrating additional benefit.

Women taking tamoxifen should be informed about the risks of endometrial proliferation, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, and uterine sarcomas, and any abnormal vaginal bleeding, bloody vaginal discharge, staining, or spotting should be investigated. Postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen should be closely monitored for symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

Premenopausal women treated with tamoxifen have no known increased risk of uterine cancer and require no additional monitoring beyond routine gynecologic care. Unless the patient has been identified to be at high risk of endometrial cancer, routine endometrial surveillance has not proved to be effective in increasing the early detection of endometrial cancer in women using tamoxifen and is not recommended. If atypical endometrial hyperplasia develops, appropriate gynecologic management should be instituted, and the use of tamoxifen should be reassessed.

### Levonorgestrel intrauterine system for endometrial protection in women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen [^112o9hhh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but it also increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) provides profound endometrial suppression. This systematic review evaluated the evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents the development of endometrial pathology in women using tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in pre- and postmenopausal women taking adjuvant tamoxifen following breast cancer. The focus was on outcomes related to endometrial and uterine pathology, including abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting, and secondary breast cancer events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (MDSG), Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register (CBCG), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), The Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, The World Health Organisation International Trials Registry, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycINFO, Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed, and Google. The final search was conducted in October 2015.

### Locally recurrent endometrial cancer: A case report [^115g64pK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women and often presents with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. In 75% of cases, it is diagnosed at an early stage and is associated with better overall survival rates than many malignancies.

The appropriate staging surgery for patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer is a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. Adjuvant radiation therapy in early-stage disease is associated with decreased rates of locoregional recurrences but does not improve overall survival. The role of chemotherapy is not well established for early-stage disease.

Treatment recommendations for locoregional recurrence of endometrial cancer after hysterectomy are poorly defined and include tumor-directed radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or surgical resection. These guidelines are not specific, resulting in confusion among clinicians. To illustrate this, this report presents a patient who was diagnosed with stage IA endometrial cancer and developed vaginal cuff recurrence three months after surgery.

### Prospective endometrial assessment of breast cancer patients treated with third generation aromatase inhibitors [^111Pm8LS]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was a prospective evaluation of the effects on the endometrium of third generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs). These were administered as adjuvant up-front therapy or switched therapy in menopausal patients suffering from breast cancer.

- **Methods**: Forty-five patients suffering from estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer were treated with AIs as adjuvant endocrine therapy. Twenty-seven patients switched from tamoxifen to AIs (group 1) due to adverse medical events related to tamoxifen intake (22 patients) or to extend endocrine treatment after 60 months of tamoxifen therapy (5 patients), while 18 patients received AIs as up-front adjuvant therapy (group 2). All patients underwent endometrial investigation before the start of AIs therapy and at 12-month intervals thereafter. Endometrial assessment was based on transvaginal ultrasonography (TU), followed by hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy when a double-layered endometrial stripe above 4 mm was measured on the longitudinal plane of uterine scanning. Six patients showing endometrial hyperplasia before the start of AIs therapy underwent hysteroscopy on a yearly basis, disregarding the endometrial thickness measured by TU. Histopathologic results on endometrial biopsies represented the reference test to estimate the prevalence of endometrial morbidity.

- **Results**: Demographic and clinical variables evaluated (such as age, parity, age at menarche and menopause, body mass index, and previous chemotherapy and radiotherapy) did not differ between groups 1 and 2. The average period of endometrial surveillance after the start of AIs therapy was 24 months.

### Metastatic breast lobular carcinoma to tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyp: Case report and literature review [^114DeZH2]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen is a widely used adjuvant treatment for breast carcinoma with a partial estrogenic agonist effect. This activity may result in a spectrum of proliferative endometrial abnormalities, including uterine polyps. We report a case of a 53-year-old woman receiving tamoxifen for previously excised breast lobular carcinoma who presented with vaginal bleeding. Histologic examination of the endometrium revealed the typical morphology of a tamoxifen-associated polyp with foci of metastatic lobular carcinoma.

Metastatic breast carcinoma to a tamoxifen-associated polyp has rarely been described in the literature. Pathologists and gynecologists should be aware of this possibility in women who have a history of breast carcinoma and are receiving tamoxifen. Careful histologic evaluation of the endometrium is crucial.

### The small blue cell dilemma associated with tamoxifen therapy [^117Dd4rU]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Several endometrial diseases, such as endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma, and endometrial polyps, have been reported to be associated with tamoxifen administration. We recently observed a high incidence of distinctive small blue cells in Papanicolaou tests of women who had received tamoxifen treatment for breast carcinoma.

- **Objectives**: To define the characteristics of these small blue cells, to identify the patient population in which they are found, and to determine the clinical significance and possible etiology of these findings.

- **Design**: A total of 154 Papanicolaou tests from 60 patients with a clinical history of tamoxifen therapy were reviewed retrospectively.

- **Results**: Small blue cells were found in 40% of Papanicolaou tests from patients who received tamoxifen therapy. Patients with small blue cells in their Papanicolaou tests were an average of 9 years older at the time tamoxifen therapy was initiated than those without. Among the available follow-up surgical biopsies, no malignant diagnoses were made.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that these distinctive small blue cells are found more frequently in older patients and most probably represent proliferative reserve cells of cervical/vaginal epithelium resulting from the estrogenic agonist effect of tamoxifen. More importantly, they are nonneoplastic in nature.

### Levonorgestrel intrauterine system for endometrial protection in women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen [^116t9frb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen also increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) provides profound endometrial suppression. This systematic review considered evidence on whether the LNG-IUS prevents the development of endometrial pathology in women taking tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in pre- and postmenopausal women taking adjuvant tamoxifen following breast cancer, focusing on outcomes such as endometrial and uterine pathology, including abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting, and secondary breast cancer events.

- **Search methods**: We searched multiple databases on 29 June 2020, including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We also searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register on 4 March 2020. Additionally, we searched two trial registers, checked references for relevant trials, and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen that compared the effectiveness of the LNG-IUS with endometrial surveillance.

### ACOG committee opinion No. 734 summary: The role of transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating the endometrium of women with postmenopausal bleeding [^111Q5nrD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Cancer of the endometrium is the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the United States. Vaginal bleeding is the presenting sign in more than 90% of postmenopausal women with endometrial carcinoma. Clinical risk factors for endometrial cancer, including but not limited to age, obesity, use of unopposed estrogen, specific medical comorbidities (e.g. polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atypical glandular cells on screening cervical cytology), and family history of gynecologic malignancy, should also be considered when evaluating postmenopausal bleeding.

The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose endometrial carcinoma and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Transvaginal ultrasonography usually is sufficient for an initial evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding if the ultrasound images reveal a thin endometrial echo (less than or equal to 4 mm), as an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less has a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer.

Transvaginal ultrasonography is a reasonable alternative to endometrial sampling as a first approach in evaluating a postmenopausal woman with an initial episode of bleeding. If blind sampling does not reveal endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, further testing, such as hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage, is warranted in the evaluation of women with persistent or recurrent bleeding. An endometrial measurement greater than 4 mm that is incidentally discovered in a postmenopausal patient without bleeding need not be routinely evaluated further.

Hormones

Patients receiving treatment with tamoxifen have an increased prevalence of endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyps, and endometrial carcinoma (see Fig. 10). Transvaginal ultrasound (US) and hysterosonography are useful tools for endometrial assessment, particularly in women treated with tamoxifen. While the agonistic effects of tamoxifen on estrogen receptors are beneficial in some tissues — for example, in lowering serum cholesterol and protecting against bone loss and cardiovascular disease — its proliferative effects on the uterine endometrium increase the risk of endometrial cancer. On transvaginal US, endometrial carcinomas are typically diffusely or partially echogenic. As many patients treated with tamoxifen have endometrial thickening and underlying adenomyosis, poorly defined endometrial thickening is not a specific sign. Hysterosonography may further help in identifying an irregular, inhomogeneous mass or focal thickening in the endometrium. Lack of distensibility of the endometrial cavity may also suggest carcinoma. MRI is useful for the characterization of endometrial abnormalities associated with tamoxifen therapy.

### Meta-analysis of the cumulative risk of endometrial malignancy and systematic review of endometrial surveillance in extended tamoxifen therapy [^114PK2VV]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Optimal management of the endometrium in patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer taking extended tamoxifen therapy (for 10 years) remains uncertain. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the cumulative risk ratio (RR) for endometrial malignancy following extended compared with standard tamoxifen treatment. A systematic review was undertaken to identify whether routine endometrial surveillance in patients receiving tamoxifen is associated with earlier detection and reduced incidence of endometrial malignancy.

- **Methods**: Two independent searches were undertaken in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and MEDLINE. A meta-analysis was performed of RCTs reporting on endometrial malignancy risk in extended tamoxifen therapy. A systematic review included prospective studies investigating the benefit of endometrial surveillance during tamoxifen therapy.

- **Results**: Four RCTs reported on endometrial risk in extended tamoxifen therapy. The cumulative risk of endometrial malignancy increased twofold from 1.5 to 3.2 percent with extended therapy compared with the standard 5 years of tamoxifen (RR 2.29, 95 percent CI 1.60 to 3.28; P < 0.001). Four studies analyzed the value of endometrial screening in 5-year cohorts. Endometrial cancer rates of up to 2 percent were reported, which is higher than rates in the large extended tamoxifen trials.

- **Conclusion**: Extended adjuvant tamoxifen is associated with an increase in endometrial cancer. No clear benefit has been shown for routine endometrial surveillance in asymptomatic patients on tamoxifen therapy.

### Effect of adjuvant tamoxifen on the endometrium in women with breast cancer: a prospective study using office endometrial biopsy [^116UASbb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2000). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of abnormal pathological changes in the endometria of women treated with tamoxifen.

Between October 1991 and September 1998, a total of 159 patients, all initiating tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer confined to the breast and axillary lymph nodes, were enrolled in this prospective study. Office endometrial biopsies (EMBs) were obtained at the initiation of tamoxifen treatment and then at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period. Additionally, three subsequent annual EMBs were recorded for each patient, culminating in a 5-year surveillance period.

Among the participants, 159 patients with a median age of 50 years were included in the study. Patients were considered assessable if EMBs were performed at least 1 year after initiating tamoxifen treatment. Nine patients (5.7%) were noted as protocol violations. The remaining 111 assessable patients underwent a total of 635 EMBs, averaging 5.8 EMBs per patient, with a median surveillance time of 36 months. Of these biopsies, 82 (12.9%) were insufficient for diagnosis. Fourteen patients (12.6%) required dilation and curettage (D&C) due to abnormal EMB results, persistent bleeding, or adnexal mass evaluation during laparoscopy. Findings at D&C included complex hyperplasia (n = 1), abnormal histiocytes (n = 1), simple hyperplasia (n = 2), polyps (n = 4), endocervical polyp (n = 1), and decidualization (n = 2). Three D&Cs returned negative results. Additionally, three patients underwent hysterectomy.

In conclusion, EMB was employed to monitor the endometrium in these patients, effectively providing surveillance for pathological changes associated with tamoxifen therapy.

### Tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention: A framework for clinical decisions [^116G7QPb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Given the potential side effects and an uncertain survival benefit, decisions about tamoxifen treatment for the primary prevention of breast cancer remain complex. Primary care providers, including gynecologists, will need to counsel patients regarding this form of preventive care. In this report, we update cost-effectiveness calculations for tamoxifen chemoprevention and establish reasonable parameters for clinicians' use.

- **Methods**: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis that compared women aged 50 years who were treated with tamoxifen for 5 years with an untreated cohort. In the base model, we assumed a 3.4% 5-year breast cancer risk. Quality-of-life estimates for important outcomes (breast cancer, endometrial cancer, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, metastatic cancer, and hot flushes) were obtained from 106 women. Probabilities and costs of outcomes were derived from the Breast Cancer Chemoprevention Trial and other published estimates. Broad sensitivity analyses were performed. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained as a result of tamoxifen breast cancer prevention was the main outcome measure.

- **Results**: The use of tamoxifen led to a remaining life expectancy of 26.07 quality-adjusted life-years compared with 25.97 without treatment. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $43,300. Sensitivity analysis revealed that younger age, the absence of the uterus, higher initial risk of breast cancer, increased fear of curable breast cancer, and reduced tamoxifen cost further favored treatment.

- **Conclusion**: Tamoxifen chemoprevention for breast cancer involves various factors that influence its cost-effectiveness and decision to use it for primary prevention.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^116q9w68]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a cardinal symptom of carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix, but not one of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this unusual mode of presentation is important.

- **Case**: We report a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a 60-year-old woman who presented primarily with postmenopausal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a "thickened" area on the posterior vaginal wall. Repeated vaginal biopsies showed fibrosis and inflammatory tissue only. Immunohistochemistry revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges such a complex case presents.

- **Conclusion**: This case not only represents a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with genital involvement, but also highlights the importance of diagnosis and management of such complex cases.

### Risk assessment for endometrial cancer in women with abnormal vaginal bleeding: Results from the prospective IETA-1 cohort study [^111rtze1]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

Detailed information on timing, duration, and intensity of bleeding was available for 1236 out of 2417 patients (51.1%). The majority, 60.1% (743/1236), presented with non‐cyclical bleeding only, whereas 23% (284/1236) had cyclical bleeding and 16.9% (209/1236) had combined cyclical and non‐cyclical bleeding. Malignancy/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia was found in 11.4% (85/743) of women with non‐cyclical bleeding, 2.8% (8/284) with cyclical bleeding, and 1.9% (4/209) with combined bleeding.

When all bleeding types were graded and analyzed together, malignancy/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia presented with slight blood loss or spotting in 60.4% (61/101) compared with 40.2% (540/1344) in benign outcomes. Blood loss was moderate in 20.8% (21/101) and heavy‐to‐extreme in 18.8% (19/101) for malignancy/endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, versus 18.2% (245/1344) and 41.6% (559/1344), respectively, for benign outcomes.

Information on age, menopausal status, age at menopause, parity, BMI, hormonal and anticoagulant therapy, and use of intrauterine contraceptive devices was available for all 2417 women. Additionally, information pertaining to past medical history or family history of cancer was available for 51.1% (1236/2417).

Summary statistics for the 2131 patients with available histology are depicted in various tables. Of the 2417 women included, the median age was 50 years, with a range from 19 to 94 years, and median parity was documented.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for endometrial cancer, and more specifically with respect to the management of recurrent disease, the ESGO/ESP/ESTRO 2021 guidelines recommend offering hormone therapy with progestogens. This includes medroxyprogesterone acetate at a dose of 200–300 mg or megestrol acetate at 160 mg. Alternatively, aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, or fulvestrant may be used as the preferred first-line systemic therapy in patients with low-grade carcinomas without rapidly progressive disease.

### The cost of diagnosing endometrial cancer: Quantifying the healthcare cost of an abnormal uterine bleeding workup [^112u8ZVY]. Gynecologic Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

The evaluation of women with perimenopausal abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) to detect endometrial cancer (EC) and its precursors is not standardized and can vary widely. Consequently, costs associated with the workup and management undoubtedly vary. This study aimed to quantify the costs of AUB/PMB evaluation to understand the healthcare burden associated with securing a pathologic diagnosis.

- **Methods**: Women aged 45 years and older presenting to a single institution gynecology clinic with AUB/PMB for diagnostic workup were prospectively enrolled from February 2013 to October 2017 for a lower genital tract biospecimen research study. Clinical workup of AUB/PMB was determined by individual provider discretion. Costs of care were collected from administrative billing systems from enrollment to 90 days post-enrollment. Costs were standardized and inflation-adjusted to 2017 US Dollars (USD).

- **Results**: In total, 1017 women were enrolled, with 5.6% diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (EC). Within the full cohort, the 90-day median cost for AUB/PMB workup and management was $2279 (IQR $512–4828). Among patients with a diagnostic biopsy, median 90-day costs ranged from $2203 (IQR $499–3604) for benign or disordered proliferative endometrium (DPE) diagnosis to $21,039 (IQR $19,084–24,536) for a diagnosis of EC.

- **Conclusions**: The costs for diagnostic evaluation of perimenopausal AUB and PMB vary greatly according to the ultimate tissue-based diagnosis. Even reassuring benign findings that do not require further intervention — the most common.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with imaging [^1152E2kC]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The major role of ultrasound in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, aside from that occurring during pregnancy, is in postmenopausal women. Because postmenopausal bleeding can be a presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, any woman with this symptom should be evaluated to diagnose or exclude carcinoma. Over the last two decades, the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding has changed markedly, from little or no role in 1990 to a major role today. Numerous studies have shown that ultrasound is at least as sensitive as endometrial biopsy for endometrial cancer and that ultrasound can reliably exclude cancer without the need for biopsy in some women with postmenopausal bleeding. In particular, studies have indicated that women with an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less have an extremely low likelihood of endometrial cancer and thus do not need to undergo endometrial biopsy.

Ultrasound can also assist in selecting the appropriate biopsy technique. In a woman with postmenopausal bleeding and a thick endometrium, a sonohysterogram can determine whether the endometrium is diffusely thick or has focal areas of thickening. With diffuse thickening, a blind endometrial biopsy is appropriate, whereas focal thickening suggests that hysteroscopic biopsy is likely to be the better choice.

- **Clinical algorithms**: We present two clinical algorithms, either of which is an acceptable approach to using ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding: the "ultrasound-first" approach and the "biopsy-first" approach.

### Relationship between tamoxifen use and high risk endometrial cancer histologic types [^113RyHvW]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a pre-existing diagnosis of breast cancer or the use of tamoxifen among patients with pre-existing breast cancer influences the histologic type of subsequently diagnosed endometrial carcinoma, the interval between these diagnoses, or survival.

A single institution retrospective review was conducted, involving all patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial carcinoma from 1995 to 2005. The histologic type of endometrial carcinoma among patients with a prior history of breast cancer was compared to those without such a history. Further analysis of patients with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer was performed by comparing histologic type, progression-free, and overall survival between tamoxifen users and non-users.

Among 732 women with endometrial carcinoma, 59 patients (8%) had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, of whom 29 (49%) had used tamoxifen. Women with a history of breast cancer were more likely to have a high risk uterine histologic type (grade 3 endometrioid, papillary serous, or clear cell) (18/59; 31%) than those without this prior malignancy (120/670, 18%; p = 0.024). Breast cancer survivors whose endometrial carcinoma was of a high risk histologic type had a longer median duration of prior tamoxifen use compared to those with lower risk histologic types (60 versus 46 months, p = 0.034).

This study concludes that among women with endometrial carcinoma, those with a history of breast cancer are more likely to harbor a high risk uterine histologic subtype. Tamoxifen use of at least 60 months is associated with high risk uterine histologic subtypes.

### Risk assessment of endometrial cancer and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia in women with abnormal bleeding and implications for clinical management algorithms [^115CgKPw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Most endometrial cancer cases are preceded by abnormal uterine bleeding, offering a potential opportunity for early detection and cure of endometrial cancer. Although clinical guidelines exist for the diagnostic workup of abnormal uterine bleeding, consensus is lacking regarding the optimal management to diagnose endometrial cancer among women with abnormal bleeding.

We report the baseline data from a prospective clinical cohort study of women referred for endometrial evaluation at the Mayo Clinic. This study is designed to evaluate risk stratification in women at increased risk for endometrial cancer. Here, we introduce a risk-based approach to evaluate diagnostic tests and clinical management algorithms in a population of women with abnormal bleeding undergoing endometrial evaluation at the Mayo Clinic.

A total of 1,163 women aged 45 years or older were enrolled from February 2013 to May 2019. We evaluated baseline absolute risks and 95% confidence intervals of endometrial cancer and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia according to clinical algorithms for the diagnostic workup of women with postmenopausal bleeding. This involved the assessment of initial vs. re-bleeding episodes and endometrial thickness measured through transvaginal ultrasound.

We also evaluated risks among women with postmenopausal bleeding according to baseline age. The study assessed the clinical efficiency of each strategy by estimating the risks in women with an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm.

### Recurrent endometrial polyps in postmenopausal breast cancer patients on tamoxifen [^116JzzQ8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The study focuses on endometrial polyps, which are the most common endometrial pathology associated with postmenopausal tamoxifen exposure. These polyps have an incidence of malignancy of up to 10.7%. However, no specific risk factors have been identified for the development of recurrent endometrial polyps (rePolyps) in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.

- **Methods**: The study compared various clinical features of 64 postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen who had a primary endometrial polyp (Group I) with 27 similar patients who developed rePolyps (Group II).

- **Results**: Previous exposure to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was significantly more common and the duration of tamoxifen treatment before the diagnosis of a primary endometrial polyp was significantly shorter in Group II patients (P = 0.0217 and P = 0.0148, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the combination of shorter tamoxifen exposure before the diagnosis of a primary polyp, lower parity, lower menopausal age at diagnosis, and longer tamoxifen treatment duration significantly increased the risk of developing rePolyps. Each additional year of tamoxifen treatment may increase the risk of developing rePolyps by fivefold. There was no significant difference in ultrasonographic endometrial thickness measured before the resection of primary polyps in both groups and before the resection of rePolyps in Group II.

- **Conclusions**: Previous use of HRT, shorter duration of tamoxifen exposure, and additional factors were found to increase the risk of developing recurrent endometrial polyps.

### Public awareness and provider counseling regarding postmenopausal bleeding as a symptom of endometrial cancer [^112uLka2]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

Our study aims to understand public knowledge of postmenopausal bleeding as an endometrial cancer symptom and how past provider counseling on postmenopausal bleeding affects knowledge and care-seeking behaviors related to postmenopausal bleeding.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional survey study of people assigned female at birth. Study participants were recruited at a university research facility located at the Minnesota State Fair in September 2021. Participants answered questions about demographics, endometrial cancer knowledge, whether they had received counseling about postmenopausal bleeding, and whether and when they would present for care after experiencing postmenopausal bleeding.

- **Results**: Six hundred forty-eight surveys were completed and included in analyses. Sixty-three percent of participants identified postmenopausal bleeding as a symptom of endometrial cancer. Those who correctly selected this symptom were more likely to be born in the United States, have a college education or higher, and have private insurance. Of the 145 postmenopausal participants, 46.5% reported that their provider counseled them on postmenopausal bleeding. Fifty-nine percent of the postmenopausal participants reported that they would tell their provider if they had postmenopausal bleeding after only one episode.

- **Conclusions**: There is a need for increased recognition of postmenopausal bleeding and provider counseling on postmenopausal bleeding, and educational interventions should focus on public and provider awareness of endometrial cancer risks and symptoms.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with biopsy or hysteroscopy [^114vd7mk]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in women is a common cause for gynecologic consultation. Physicians must maintain a low threshold for endometrial assessment in such cases. Accurately determining the etiology of the bleeding permits appropriate treatment, minimizes unnecessary delays in therapy, and prevents needless worry in women. There are few national consensus guidelines, best practice guidelines, or treatment algorithms that provide gynecologists with scrupulous data to make concise decisions for the utilization of technology such as endometrial biopsy, transvaginal ultrasound, saline infusion sonography, or hysteroscopy in the evaluation of menstrual aberrations. Using technology with high sensitivity to detect a disease allows a physician to make concise decisions for proceeding with minimally invasive procedures or reliance on medical therapies that will probably be effective.

### Baseline hysteroscopic assessment of endometrium in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [^111eXxCP]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the true prevalence of endometrial pathology in asymptomatic postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer patients and to determine if certain patients are particularly at risk.

A preliminary cross-sectional study was conducted with 130 postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer patients. Prior to any treatment, diagnostic hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were performed on all participants. Histopathological findings were considered the gold standard in estimating the prevalence of endometrial disease, which was analyzed based on various risk factors.

Hysteroscopic evaluation was successful in 118 patients (90.7%). Of these, 68.6% were older than 60 years, and 51.4% were obese. Endometrial polyps were detected in 35 patients (29.6%; with 1 polyp showing simple hyperplasia), and simple endometrial hyperplasia was found in 1 patient (0.8%). This resulted in an overall morbidity of the endometrium of 31.3%. Among the well-established individual risk factors for endometrial pathology, patient age, body mass index, and time since menopause were significant predictors of endometrial pathology and/or polyps. There was no statistical difference in the thicknesses of the endometrial lining, although many patients with an endometrial lining less than 4 mm had polyps smaller than 5 mm.

In conclusion, asymptomatic postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer exhibit a very high prevalence of baseline subclinical endometrial abnormalities. Therefore, endometrial screening before tamoxifen treatment may be justified.

### Executive summary of the uterine cancer evidence review conference [^115BhAYU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen users are at increased risk of developing benign polyps and endometrial cancer, with the risk increasing with the duration of use. Tamoxifen use is associated with endometrial thickening, and there are no established thresholds for ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in this population.

Two studies found that transvaginal ultrasonography of asymptomatic premenopausal and postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen yields a high false-positive rate, leading to unnecessary intervention. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society recommend against routine screening. Because emerging evidence suggests tamoxifen users with baseline endometrial polyps are more likely to develop atypical hyperplasia, ACOG states there may be a role for pretreatment screening before the initiation of tamoxifen therapy. (See Appendix 5 for a complete evidence summary.)

### Effects of adjuvant tamoxifen on the endometrium in postmenopausal women with breast cancer: A prospective long-term study using transvaginal ultrasound [^112HVy99]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2000). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) in endometrial screening of postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.

In this study, 247 women treated with tamoxifen (20 to 30 mg/d for ≥ 2 years) and 98 control subjects were prospectively monitored. The endometrium was assessed using TVS every 6 months for up to 5 years. Patients exhibiting a homogeneous endometrium thicker than 10 mm underwent additional scans every 3 months.

The results indicated that the mean endometrial thickness increased from 3.5 ± 1.1 mm before treatment to a maximum of 9.2 ± 5.1 mm after 3 years of tamoxifen therapy (P < .0001). This thickness was significantly greater compared to the controls (P < .0001). Among 52 asymptomatic patients with thickened or morphologically suspicious endometrium, hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage (D&C) were performed, resulting in four uterine perforations. Histopathological findings revealed atrophy in 38 patients (73.1%), polyps in nine, hyperplasia in four, and one case of endometrial cancer. In the group of 20 screened patients who reported vaginal bleeding, five cases of atrophy (25%), five polyps, four hyperplasias, and two cases of endometrial cancer were identified. Prior to undergoing hysteroscopy and D&C, 36 (69.2%) of 52 asymptomatic and four (20%) of 20 symptomatic patients had repeated TVS scans over a period of 2 to 30 months. Invasive diagnostic procedures were significantly more frequent (P < .05) in younger and obese patients. Among the controls, one asymptomatic polyp and one symptomatic hyperplasia were detected.

In conclusion, TVS in tamoxifen-treated patients offered a high false-positive rate for endometrial abnormalities.

### Prevention strategies in endometrial carcinoma [^112PyYpG]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used for the prevention and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. It has been associated with increased endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, and an increased relative risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women of 4.01 (95% CI 1.7–10.9). There is no endometrial surveillance programme in place for tamoxifen users, but women and clinicians should be aware of the risks, and investigation of vaginal bleeding should include hysteroscopy as well as endometrial biopsy and ultrasound scan, as sensitivity and specificity of transvaginal ultrasound are low in this group. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) has been shown to reduce the development of endometrial polyps in tamoxifen users, but no convincing effect on endometrial cancer risk has yet been demonstrated.

PCOS affects 6–8% of women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS are overrepresented in young endometrial cancer patients, and a meta-analysis has estimated the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in women with PCOS to be around 9% (odds ratio (OR) 2.89), with the increase likely driven by a combination of insulin resistance and anovulatory cycles leading to oligo or amenorrhoea. For this reason, a crucial aspect of PCOS management is the induction of regular withdrawal bleeds in an attempt to reduce the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

While diet and weight reduction have been shown to improve the clinical manifestations of PCOS, such as insulin resistance and reproductive manifestations, further research is needed to determine their long-term impact on endometrial cancer risk.

### Tamoxifen use and endometrial lesions: Hysteroscopic, histological, and immunohistochemical findings in postmenopausal women with breast cancer [^115e93ew]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate immunohistochemical, hysteroscopic, and histological findings in postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen for breast cancer, forty postmenopausal women taking 20 mg/day tamoxifen for breast cancer underwent hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy from January 2000 to December 2003. Medical records and paraffin blocks were analyzed retrospectively, and Ki-67, estrogen receptors (ERs), and progesterone receptors were measured using an immunohistochemical technique.

The mean ± SD age of the women was 59 ± 14 years at hysteroscopy (95% CI, 54.2–63.7) and 45.1 ± 7 years at menopause (95% CI, 42.6–47.6). The mean ± SD duration of tamoxifen therapy was 27.3 ± 16.5 months (95% CI, 22.0–32.5). Hysteroscopies were performed because of abnormal sonographic findings in 60% of the women and postmenopausal bleeding in 40%. The most common hysteroscopic and histological findings were endometrial polyps (32.5%) and atrophic endometria (22.5%). Immunohistochemistry showed that 85% of the women were progesterone receptor positive, 75% were ER positive, and 50% were Ki-67 positive. Endometrial polyps and polyps associated with atrophic endometrium were ER positive (P = 0.019). Results that were ER negative were more frequent in atrophic endometria (P = 0.01). The longer the time since menopause, the lower the Ki-67 expression in the endometrium was (P = 0.03). Ki-67 expression was greater in the endometrium of younger postmenopausal women (P = 0.01).

In conclusion, the expression of steroid receptors in the endometrium was high in our series.

### Estradiol [^113DGVwf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Malignant neoplasms**: An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in women with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users and appears dependent on the duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.

	- Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology.

	- There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

- **Breast cancer**: The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.

### Molecular genetic characterization of tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer [^116biedy]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

The non-steroidal, selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen is currently the most extensively used hormonal agent for the prevention and treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer with tamoxifen exposure; however, few studies have examined these tumors on a molecular level. We sought to elucidate the molecular genetic alterations found in tamoxifen-associated endometrial cancer.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine breast cancer patients with a history of tamoxifen use who subsequently developed endometrial cancer were retrospectively identified and matched for endometrial histologic subtype and grade to 29 endometrial cancers from breast cancer patients never exposed to tamoxifen. Endometrial tumor tissue was microdissected, and genomic DNA was extracted for each case. Direct DNA sequencing of the most commonly mutated genes in sporadic endometrial cancer — PTEN, K-RAS, TP53, and CTNNB1 — was performed, in addition to microsatellite instability (MI) studies. Fisher's Exact Test was utilized for statistical analyses.

- **Results**: Of 29 tamoxifen-associated cancers, 10 (34.5%) contained PTEN mutations compared to 13 (44.8%) of the non-tamoxifen-associated cancers (P = 0.59). All PTEN mutations were found in tumors with endometrioid histology, reflecting what is seen in sporadic endometrial cancers. Mutations of K-RAS, TP53, and microsatellite instability were present in similar frequencies between the two breast cancer groups. Moreover, these were similar to mutational frequency trends.

### Prospective longitudinal study of ultrasound screening for endometrial abnormalities in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen [^114JUMK7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The goal of this work was to study the role of transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) together with colorflow Doppler imaging (CFDI) in the detection of significant endometrial abnormalities induced by tamoxifen.

- **Methods**: Over a 6-year period, 304 women on tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer were recruited into the study. Standard demographic data as well as duration of tamoxifen use were collected. Patients were assessed at study entry and at yearly intervals with TVUS together with CFDI. All patients had an endometrial biopsy at the time of study entry, and repeat endometrial evaluations were done subsequently only if there were abnormal ultrasound findings or the presence of irregular vaginal bleeding. All ultrasonic characteristics and Doppler flow measurements were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study group. Logistic regression was used to identify significant treatment- and ultrasound-related factors associated with the presence of significant uterine pathology.

- **Results**: One thousand and sixty-one ultrasound assessments were performed on 304 patients over a 6-year period. The mean age was 52.33 (range, 29–79). Seventy-two percent of the patients were postmenopausal at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. The median concentrations of estrogen and progesterone receptor were 75 and 73 fmol/L, respectively. Fifty-eight percent of the patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The mean duration of tamoxifen use was 48.2 months. Thirty-two percent of the ultrasound examinations had associated significant uterine pathology.

### Chemoprevention for breast cancer [^115E6Wtq]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer (RR 2.53; 95% CI 1.35–4.97; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 0.91 vs. tamoxifen 2.30), venous thromboembolic events, including stroke (RR 1.59; 95% CI 0.93–2.77; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 0.92 vs. tamoxifen 1.45), pulmonary embolus (RR 3.01; 95% CI 1.15–9.27; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 0.23 vs. tamoxifen 0.69), deep vein thrombosis (RR 1.60; 95% CI 0.91–2.86; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 0.84 vs. tamoxifen 1.34), cataract development (RR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01–1.29; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 21.72 vs. tamoxifen 24.82), and the need for cataract surgeries (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.16–2.14; absolute annual risk per 1000: placebo 3.00 vs. tamoxifen 4.72). These risks were not significantly different in the 2010 analysis. The serious risks were not significantly increased in women under the age of 50 years, thus identifying a population of women who obtain significant risk reduction benefits without incurring serious harm. Common side effects reported included bothersome hot flashes and vaginal discharge.

The STAR demonstrated that raloxifene was equivalent to tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women at increased risk of the disease while on therapy. In the 2010 updated analysis, with a median follow-up of 81 months, benefits with tamoxifen were greater, while the risks were lower with raloxifene. Raloxifene retained 76% of the effectiveness of tamoxifen in preventing invasive disease. Raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk.

### Executive summary of the uterine cancer evidence review conference [^1163XPsE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis and care coordination**: Medical history is crucial in detecting endometrial cancer and assessing patients with a new diagnosis. Relevant risk factors include age, obesity, use of unopposed estrogen, medical comorbidities such as PCOS and type 2 diabetes mellitus, atypical glandular cells on cervical cytology, and a family history of gynecologic malignancy. Postmenopausal bleeding is the most common symptom of endometrial cancer and warrants evaluation. Our review did not identify studies establishing an age after which continued menstrual bleeding is considered abnormal. A systematic review did not find any studies on counseling or educational interventions, but counseling postmenopausal women about the significance of bleeding may address this unmet need.

- **Family history and genetics**: Endometrial cancer may be the presenting cancer in approximately 50% of patients with Lynch syndrome. Any patient with a known family history of Lynch syndrome should be referred to a genetic counselor or tested for Lynch syndrome. Patients with a personal history of colorectal or endometrial cancer diagnosed before age 50, with another Lynch-related cancer, with any relative having Lynch-related cancer younger than age 50, or with two or more relatives with a Lynch-related cancer at any age, should also be evaluated for Lynch syndrome. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends universal testing of endometrial carcinomas for mismatch repair proteins or microsatellite instability.

### Combining ultrasonography and endometrial aspiration as a one-stop screening for endometrial neoplasia [^111LHqnk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Patients' demographic and clinical information was collected from patient interviews and medical records, including indication for the procedure, last menstrual period, race and ethnicity, estrogen and tamoxifen exposure, and history of breast cancer. We examined the sociodemographic factors of race and ethnicity in our analysis, focusing on our institution's diverse patient population, primarily Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black individuals who are historically underrepresented in research. This evaluation is paramount to identifying the optimal screening approaches in diverse patient populations.

Data was also collected on any additional endometrial biopsy performed within six months of the simultaneous endometrial aspiration and sonohysterography performed by the patient's physician. The study group included women who completed the simultaneous endometrial aspiration and sonohysterography procedure and had available outcome confirmation. The term "outcome confirmation" included: 1) surgical histology by hysterectomy or hysteroscopy; 2) confirmation of benign endometrial aspiration histology by an additional benign endometrial biopsy; 3) benign endometrial aspiration followed by clinically uneventful surveillance of at least one year; and 4) cases of endometrial cancer or hyperplasia that had conservative management secondary to medical contraindication or delay in surgery related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

All participants had their slides reviewed in a tumor board, and their slides were read again for this study by the senior gynecologic pathologist (K.W.) for confirmation.

### Depo-estradiol [^113tmxdt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:

	- **Estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer**: Close clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogens is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding. There is no evidence that "natural" estrogens result in a different endometrial risk profile than "synthetic" estrogens at equivalent doses.

	- **Cardiovascular and other risks**: Estrogens, with and without progestins, should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study reported increased risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, invasive breast cancer, pulmonary emboli, and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens (CE 0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA 2.5 mg) relative to placebo.

	- **The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS)**: A substudy of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years or older during 4 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate relative to placebo. It is unknown if this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women or to those taking estrogen-alone therapy.

### Long-term outcome of postmenopausal women with proliferative endometrium on endometrial sampling [^1158wQZR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Proliferative endometrium has been reported in 15% of endometrial biopsies of women aged 50 years and older. Contrary to endometrial hyperplasia, proliferative endometrium has not been associated with the risk of endometrial cancer.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to report on the long-term outcome of postmenopausal women who received a diagnosis of proliferative endometrium.

- **Study design**: This is a retrospective cohort study of 1808 women aged 55 years and older who underwent endometrial sampling between January 1997 and December 2008. Outcome data were available through February 2018. Women with a proliferative endometrium were compared with those with an atrophic endometrium for future development of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. A subanalysis was performed for those who presented with postmenopausal bleeding. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess for confounders.

- **Results**: In this study, 297 women (16.4%) received a diagnosis of proliferative endometrium. Furthermore, 962 women met the inclusion criteria. Among those women, 278 had a proliferative endometrium, and 684 had an atrophic endometrium. Women with a proliferative endometrium were younger (61.2 vs. 64.5 years; p < 0.0001) and had a higher body mass index (33.9 vs. 30.6 kg/m²; p < 0.0001). More African American women had a proliferative endometrium. Both groups had a similar length of surveillance (11.9 vs. 11.5 years; p = 0.27). Women with a proliferative endometrium had a higher risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (11.9% vs. 2.9%; p < 0.0001).

### Tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer and risk of endometrial cancer: a case-control study [^113V2kNN]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2005). Low credibility.

Tamoxifen treatment of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, but tamoxifen-related risks of endometrial cancer are unclear in premenopausal women, in long-term users of tamoxifen, and in women for whom several years have passed since ending treatment. We conducted a case-control study in Britain to investigate these risks.

- **Methods**: We compared treatment information on 813 case patients who had endometrial cancer after their diagnosis for breast cancer and 1067 control patients who had breast cancer but not subsequent endometrial cancer. We assessed risk by conditional logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: Overall, tamoxifen treatment, compared with no treatment, was associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 3.0). Risk increased statistically significantly (P(trend) with 5 or more years of treatment compared with no treatment, OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.6 to 4.8). As an indication of background levels of treatment, 16% of control patients received 5 years or more of treatment. Risk of endometrial cancer adjusted for treatment duration did not diminish in follow-up to at least 5 years after the last treatment ended. Risk of endometrial cancer was not associated with the daily dose of tamoxifen and was comparable in pre- and postmenopausal women. Ever treatment with tamoxifen was associated with a much greater risk of Mullerian and mesodermal mixed endometrial tumors (OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 4).

### Levonorgestrel intrauterine system for endometrial protection in women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen [^112haZeg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). High credibility.

Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen also increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and endometrial cancer. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) causes profound endometrial suppression. This systematic review considered the evidence that the LNG-IUS prevents the development of endometrial pathology in women taking tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system in preventing the development of endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and adenocarcinoma in premenopausal and postmenopausal women taking adjuvant tamoxifen following breast cancer.

- **Search strategy**: All reports that described randomized controlled trials of effects of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system on the endometrium in breast cancer patients taking adjuvant tamoxifen were obtained through searches of the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009), MEDLINE (1996 to August 2009), EMBASE (1980 to August 2009), and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1982 to August 2009).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of women with breast cancer on adjuvant tamoxifen that compared endometrial surveillance or placebo alone versus the LNG-IUS. Women with known endometrial pathology or contraindications to LNG-IUS were excluded.

### No. 291-epidemiology and investigations for suspected endometrial cancer [^113AgABM]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for endometrial cancer, specifically concerning initial evaluation, the SOGC 2018 guidelines recommend eliciting a complete focused history and performing a physical examination in patients with suspected endometrial cancer. Attention should be paid to predisposing factors for excess estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, such as a long history of anovulation, obesity, menstrual irregularity, or long-term use of unopposed estrogen or tamoxifen.
