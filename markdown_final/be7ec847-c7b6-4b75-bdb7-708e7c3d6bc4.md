## Question

What is the appropriate management for an iron saturation of four?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage an "iron saturation of four", meaning a transferrin saturation (TSAT) around 4%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what TSAT measures and how abnormal 4% truly is. Then, I should verify the clinical urgency and whether transfusion is indicated. Next, I will decide on the route of iron repletion, including when to prioritize intravenous over oral therapy. After that, I should detail dosing and monitoring to confirm response. Finally, I need to ensure we investigate the underlying cause and tailor management to special populations like CKD, heart failure, IBD, and pregnancy.

> Let me first confirm the meaning and severity of TSAT ≈ 4%. TSAT reflects circulating iron availability, calculated as serum iron divided by total iron-binding capacity; physiologically, roughly 16–45% of transferrin is iron-loaded, so 4% is profoundly low and indicates critically limited iron supply to the marrow, strongly suggesting absolute iron deficiency unless there is extreme inflammation biasing ferritin or transferrin measurements downward, which I should keep in mind as a confounder [^116c5dpZ] [^115bHVQo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about urgency without the clinical context. I need to check for symptomatic or hemodynamically significant anemia (fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, syncope, orthostasis) and cardiorespiratory comorbidity; if anemia is life-threatening, a restrictive packed red blood cell transfusion strategy can be used while recognizing it does not correct the iron deficit, so iron repletion must still follow, whereas in stable patients with severe deficiency, prompt iron replacement without transfusion is appropriate [^113re6W6] [^114wkrGu].

> I initially thought, per many guidelines, that oral iron is the default first-line for IDA, but wait, I should verify whether such profound TSAT depletion changes the route decision. With TSAT around 4%, the deficit is severe, oral absorption may be limited by hepcidin dynamics or comorbid inflammation, and rapid repletion is often needed; thus intravenous iron is generally preferred for severity, poor absorption, intolerance, or when a rapid rise is desired, and therapy should not be delayed while investigations proceed unless colonoscopy is imminent [^1115AV6R] [^1114eHoJ] [^111vEPEQ] [^112xn7j2].

> Let me think about oral iron if IV is unavailable or declined. I should confirm optimal dosing to maximize absorption and tolerability: one standard approach is ferrous sulfate providing about 60–65 mg elemental iron once daily on an empty stomach, and if intolerance occurs, alternate-day dosing can improve absorption by avoiding the 24-hour hepcidin surge; importantly, coadministration of vitamin C does not enhance hematologic response and is not recommended, and food impairs absorption markedly, so timing matters [^1115rbrv] [^115rYBb2].

> Next, I should review intravenous options and practical dosing. Ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose enable single or limited infusions with weight-based dosing to deliver 1 g rapidly, while iron sucrose or ferric gluconate require multiple smaller infusions; modern IV formulations have a low rate of serious hypersensitivity, but I should still observe during and after infusion and document cumulative dosing, and pharmacokinetic data for agents like ferric gluconate support efficient transferrin loading within 24 hours, which aligns with the need for rapid repletion in TSAT 4% [^1115AV6R] [^11126u9P].

> I should double-check monitoring to verify response and decide whether to escalate. A practical plan is to recheck hemoglobin in about 2 weeks for a ≥ 10 g/L rise as an early signal of response, continue replacement for roughly 3 months after hemoglobin normalizes to rebuild stores, and monitor for nonresponse which should prompt switching to IV iron, reassessing adherence, absorption, ongoing bleeding, or alternate diagnoses; I need to ensure we do not stop prematurely before stores are repleted [^115bHVQo] [^116DCPpr].

> Let me verify iron targets and lab timing. Reassessing iron indices at about 4 weeks helps confirm repletion progress; in CKD and ESA-treated contexts, maintaining ferritin above 100–200 mcg/L depending on dialysis status and TSAT above 20% supports erythropoiesis, and in non-CKD settings a ferritin above roughly 50 mcg/L is a common minimum store target, though clinical context matters; I should also consider reticulocyte hemoglobin or percent hypochromic cells if inflammation obscures ferritin/TSAT interpretation [^112xn7j2] [^111vEPEQ] [^113DECq2].

> But wait, what if we correct the iron and miss the cause of loss or malabsorption. I need to ensure appropriate evaluation in parallel: in men and postmenopausal women, upper and lower GI endoscopy are first-line, with celiac serology and noninvasive H. pylori testing considered and treated if positive; in premenopausal women, a careful menstrual and gynecologic assessment is key while still considering GI evaluation if anemia is severe, refractory, or atypical, and importantly, iron therapy should usually proceed without deferral [^116JMk3z] [^1114eHoJ] [^115Z6QrC].

> I will now examine special scenarios where the route decision is particularly influenced by comorbidity. In CKD, functional iron restriction and high hepcidin favor IV iron and careful ESA use with routine iron monitoring and supplementation when ferritin is below 100 mcg/L or TSAT below 20–30%, consistent with KDIGO, UKKA, and ESA labeling; in heart failure, oral iron failed to improve exercise capacity in HFrEF, and guidelines often favor IV iron to correct deficiency; in IBD, IV iron is generally preferred to avoid intolerance and to overcome inflammation, with regular post-correction monitoring to detect recurrence; in pregnancy, oral iron remains first-line in the first trimester, with IV iron considered after the first trimester when deficiency is severe or oral therapy fails [^111vEPEQ] [^112xn7j2] [^115jdb58] [^117TVcio] [^114R1Kbf] [^1161Q38A] [^114k8Tww] [^1112CM7u] [^116dVjra].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and avoid overshooting. With IV iron, I need to monitor for rare hypersensitivity and infusion reactions and track cumulative dosing, and in CKD programs, ferritin persistently above about 500 mcg/L should prompt review of ongoing iron administration to minimize overload risk, noting ferritin can be confounded by inflammation; if transfusion is used for instability, I must still give iron afterward because each RBC unit provides only about 200 mg of elemental iron and will not replete stores [^115jn7J4] [^114wkrGu].

> Let me reconsider the practical "bottom line" for TSAT ≈ 4%. This degree of iron restriction almost always reflects severe absolute iron deficiency with inadequate iron for erythropoiesis, so I should initiate iron promptly, typically with intravenous iron for rapid, reliable repletion, assess symptom burden to decide on any need for restrictive transfusion, verify early hematologic response within 2 weeks, continue replacement for several months after normalization to rebuild stores, and pursue cause-directed evaluation in parallel so we treat both the deficiency and its source [^1115AV6R] [^115bHVQo] [^116JMk3z] [^115Z6QrC].

---

An iron saturation of 4% indicates **severe iron deficiency** [^116c5dpZ] and requires prompt treatment. The correct approach is to **start oral iron** (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) [^115rYBb2] [^1115rbrv] if tolerated, and switch to intravenous iron if oral therapy is not tolerated, ineffective, or if rapid correction is needed [^116DCPpr] [^1115AV6R]. Concurrently, identify and treat the underlying cause, and monitor hemoglobin and iron indices every 2–4 weeks [^116DCPpr] until normalization, then every 3–6 months to prevent recurrence.

---

## Clinical significance of iron saturation at 4%

Iron saturation (transferrin saturation, TSAT) reflects the proportion of transferrin bound to iron [^111sFJG3]; the normal range is 20–50%. A TSAT of 4% is **severely low**, signifying minimal circulating iron available for erythropoiesis and consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) [^115LH3LE].

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

Before initiating therapy, **confirm iron deficiency and exclude other causes of anemia**:

- **Confirm iron deficiency**: Low ferritin [^113DECq2], low serum iron, high TIBC, low TSAT [^111sFJG3].
- **Exclude other causes**: Vitamin B12/folate deficiency, chronic inflammation, hemolysis, bone marrow disorders [^111sFJG3].
- **Identify underlying causes**: Chronic blood loss (GI, menstrual), malabsorption (celiac, IBD) [^111sFJG3], dietary insufficiency, chronic disease [^115LH3LE].

---

## Recommended treatment strategies

### Oral iron therapy (first-line)

Oral iron is **first-line** because of its efficacy, safety, and cost [^111sFJG3]. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg elemental) once daily or every other day is recommended [^116DCPpr]; alternate-day dosing can improve absorption and tolerability [^115rYBb2] [^1115rbrv]. Continue for approximately 3 months after Hb normalization to replete stores [^116DCPpr] [^113K8Kha].

---

### Intravenous iron therapy (second-line)

IV iron is **indicated** when oral iron is not tolerated, ineffective, or rapid correction is needed (e.g. severe anemia, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, CKD, IBD) [^116DCPpr] [^1115AV6R]. Common formulations include ferric carboxymaltose, iron sucrose, and ferric derisomaltose; dosing is individualized based on weight, Hb, and iron deficit [^111uowxP].

---

### Red blood cell transfusion (reserved)

Transfusion is **reserved** for severe symptomatic anemia or hemodynamic instability [^114wkrGu]. It provides temporary relief but does not correct iron deficiency; thus, iron therapy is still required [^116DCPpr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring** to assess response and prevent recurrence includes checking hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks [^116DCPpr]; a rise of ≥ 10 g/L at 2 weeks predicts success [^1149wkcb]. Recheck ferritin and TSAT after 4 weeks of therapy, then monitor every 3–6 months after correction to detect recurrence [^111W7Ed9].

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identifying and treating the **cause** is critical to preventing recurrence:

- **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: Upper and lower endoscopy for unexplained IDA, especially in men and postmenopausal women [^116JMk3z].
- **Gynecological evaluation**: Assess and manage menorrhagia or other gynecologic bleeding [^116dVjra].
- **Malabsorption**: Treat celiac disease, IBD, or other causes [^1112CM7u].
- **Dietary counseling**: Improve iron intake and absorption [^115LH3LE].

---

## Potential complications of untreated severe iron deficiency

Untreated severe **iron deficiency** can cause:

- **Cardiovascular complications**: Heart failure, arrhythmias, ischemia [^111sFJG3].
- **Neurological complications**: Cognitive impairment, fatigue, restless legs.
- **Immune dysfunction**: Increased infection risk.
- **Pregnancy complications**: Preterm birth, low birth weight, maternal morbidity [^115LH3LE].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm iron deficiency and exclude other causes of anemia |
| 2 | Identify and address underlying causes |
| 3 | Initiate oral iron therapy (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) [^116DCPpr] [^115rYBb2] |
| 4 | If oral iron is not tolerated or is ineffective, initiate intravenous iron therapy [^1115AV6R] |
| 5 | Reserve red blood cell transfusion for severe symptomatic anemia [^114wkrGu] |
| 6 | Monitor hemoglobin and iron indices regularly |
| 7 | Continue iron therapy until normalization of hemoglobin and iron stores |
| 8 | Long-term monitoring to prevent recurrence [^111W7Ed9] |

---

The correct treatment for an iron saturation of 4% is to **initiate oral iron therapy** promptly, escalate to intravenous iron if needed, and address the underlying cause, with regular monitoring to ensure correction and prevent recurrence [^111sFJG3].

	- We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first four weeks for a hemoglobin (Hb) response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around three months after normalization of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

	- We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated. This consideration should be at an early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective, and/or if the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. While low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be due to multiple different aetiologies including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. The investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis is not addressed here and is the subject of a separate guideline.

The IRONOUT-HF study, published in 2017 in JAMA, examined the effect of oral iron repletion on exercise capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and iron deficiency. It was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 225 patients (80 female, 145 male). Patients included had heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 40%) and iron deficiency.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized to receive either oral iron polysaccharide (150 mg twice daily for 16 weeks; n = 111) or a matched placebo (twice daily for 16 weeks; n = 114).

- **Primary outcome**: The study found no significant difference in the change in peak oxygen uptake at 16 weeks between the groups (23 mL/min vs. -2 mL/min; difference of 21, 95% confidence interval of -34 to 76).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with heart failure with reduced LVEF and iron deficiency, oral iron polysaccharide was not superior to placebo regarding the change in peak oxygen uptake at 16 weeks.

### Iron supplementation to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111uowxP]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the use of oral and intravenous iron in patients with CKD who do not require dialysis might obviate or delay the need for treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients on hemodialysis have lower intestinal iron absorption, greater iron losses, and require greater iron turnover to maintain the ESA-driven red cell mass than do healthy individuals. In these patients, intravenous iron reduces ESA dose requirements and increases the likelihood of maintaining levels of hemoglobin within the desired range. Oral iron is inferior to intravenous iron in patients on hemodialysis, in part because elevated serum levels of hepcidin prevent intestinal absorption of iron. Increased levels of hepcidin also impair the normal recycling of iron through the reticuloendothelial system. Levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation below 450 pmol/l and 20%, respectively, are indicative of iron deficiency, but values above the normal range lack diagnostic value in patients with CKD on dialysis. The availability of various iron preparations and new developments in delivering iron should enable adequate provision of iron to patients with CKD. This review examines the efficacy, safety, and use of iron supplementation therapy for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112BCrPS]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). One unit of blood contains approximately 200–250 mg of iron, depending on the hemoglobin concentration, and should be removed once or twice per week as tolerated. In patients with HH who may have total body iron stores exceeding 30 g, therapeutic phlebotomy may take up to 2–3 years to adequately reduce iron stores.

Each phlebotomy should be preceded by measurement of hematocrit or hemoglobin to avoid reducing the hematocrit/hemoglobin to less than 80% of the starting value. Transferrin saturation (TS) usually remains elevated until iron stores are depleted, whereas ferritin, which may initially fluctuate, eventually begins to fall progressively with iron mobilization and reflects the depletion of iron stores.

Serum ferritin analysis should be performed after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately every 3 months) in the initial stages of treatment. Excess iron stores can be confidently considered mobilized when serum ferritin drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L. As the target range of 50–100 μg/L is approached, testing may be repeated more frequently to preempt the development of overt iron deficiency. It is not necessary for patients to achieve iron deficiency, and in fact, this should be avoided.

Phlebotomy can be stopped once iron stores are depleted, and the patient should be assessed for whether they require maintenance phlebotomy. For reasons that are unclear, not all patients with HH reaccumulate iron, and accordingly, they may not need maintenance therapy.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^111f7YBB]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre. These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

- **Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients**: The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels.

	- **Case 1**: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow-up. At age 26 (6 years post-diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range.

	- **Case 2**: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32-year-old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non-pregnancy periods.

	- **Case 3**: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (total amount not specified) was administered, and the course of treatment is ongoing.

These detailed case descriptions underscore the complexity of managing IRIDA in different age groups and highlight the progress and challenges in finding effective treatment strategies.

### Management of severe peri-operative bleeding: Guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care: Second update 2022 [^1128uafv]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly concerning patients undergoing surgery, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend considering a period of 1–2 weeks after parenteral stimulation of erythropoiesis and in cases of uncomplicated anemia. For the oral correction of iron deficiency anemia and more complex causes of anemia, 3–8 weeks are suggested.

### Gaps in knowledge and management of iron deficiency in heart failure: a nationwide survey of cardiologists in China [^116vwjyn]. Heart (2025). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend routine testing for iron deficiency (ID) and, for those with ID, intravenous iron if the left ventricular ejection fraction is < 50%. Guideline adherence to these recommendations by cardiologists in China is unknown.

- **Methods and results**: An independent academic web-based survey was designed and distributed via social networks to cardiologists across China. Overall, 1,342 cardiologists (median age 34 years, IQR 30–39, 51% women) from all provinces of China completed this survey. More than half were unaware of the need to screen for ID in HF and did not do so routinely in their clinical practice. Approximately 80% were not familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ID in HF guidelines, and only 0.8% recognized transferrin saturation < 20% as an independent marker of ID. Regarding iron repletion, only 14% preferred intravenous to oral iron for correcting ID compared with 68% favoring oral iron. Three-quarters were unfamiliar with methods for calculating intravenous iron dose. Furthermore, over 80% were unaware that guidelines only recommend ferric carboxymaltose or ferric derisomaltose for correcting ID. The main barriers to using intravenous iron were lack of knowledge and experience. Despite such poor awareness and practice, most cardiologists were interested in learning more about managing ID in HF.

- **Conclusions**: In this nationwide survey of cardiologists in China, we identified large gaps in both knowledge and management of ID. This survey will help guide the development of educational programs to improve care for those with HF and ID.

### Mircera [^115jdb58]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Mircera. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Individualization of dosing**: Individualize and use the lowest dose of Mircera sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL for adult patients. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the increased risks of death and other serious cardiovascular adverse events.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, with at least half of these cases attributed to iron deficiency. Over the past decade, the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations has led to uncertainty about when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy remains appropriate and effective.

Numerous guidelines are available; however, they lack detailed information regarding therapeutic start and end points, as well as best treatment practices for iron-deficiency anemia based on the underlying cause or in the context of concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

The study highlights major considerations for revising future guidelines to optimize iron replacement therapy. These include how to assess the need for treatment, determining when to start and stop treatment, establishing follow-up protocols for potential relapses, recommending appropriate dosages and types of therapy, and identifying patients who should not undergo treatment.

### Ferrlecit [^11126u9P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ferrlecit is used to replete the body content of iron, which is critical for normal hemoglobin synthesis to maintain oxygen transport. Additionally, iron is necessary for metabolism and various enzymatic processes.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Multiple sequential single-dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy iron-deficient volunteers. Entry criteria included hemoglobin levels of ≥ 10.5 gm/dL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤ 15% or serum ferritin value ≤ 20 ng/mL. In the first stage, each subject was randomized 1:1 to receive undiluted Ferrlecit injection of either 125 mg/hr or 62.5 mg/0.5 hr (2.1 mg/min). Five days after the first stage, each subject was re-randomized 1:1 to receive undiluted Ferrlecit injection of either 125 mg/7 min or 62.5 mg/4 min (> 15.5 mg/min).

	- Peak drug levels (Cmax) varied significantly by dosage and rate of administration, with the highest Cmax observed in the regimen in which 125 mg was administered in 7 minutes (19.0 mg/L). The terminal elimination half-life for drug-bound iron was approximately 1 hour. Half-life varied by dose but not by rate of administration, with values of 0.85 and 1.45 hours for the 62.5 mg/4 min and 125 mg/7 min regimens, respectively. Total clearance of Ferrlecit was between 3.02 to 5.35 L/h. The AUC for Ferrlecit-bound iron varied by dose from 17.5 mg-h/L (62.5 mg) to 35.6 mg-h/L (125 mg). Approximately 80% of drug-bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen.

### Attendance at iron deficiency anaemia clinic: Audit of outcomes 5 years on [^114pnnz2]. Colorectal Disease (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the long-term outcomes of patients in whom no initial cause for their anaemia is established. Six hundred and thirty-nine patients presenting to an iron deficiency anaemia pathway were prospectively entered onto a database. Initial assessment included haematological review, coeliac screen, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, and colonic imaging as per British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. A 5-year audit of outcomes was undertaken using patient medical records and hospital laboratory databases.

The results indicated that a diagnosis was initially found in 266 (42%) patients, with 124 (19%) having a gastrointestinal (GI) luminal neoplasm, of which 54 (8%) were malignant. Twelve patients had a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. Eighty-eight (14%) had benign upper GI bleeding, and 23 (4%) had coeliac disease. One hundred and forty-three (22%) did not have confirmed iron deficiency anaemia upon review of haematinics. Complete records were available for 595 (93%) patients at 5 years. Of the 373 patients in whom a cause was not initially diagnosed, 6 (2%) were ultimately diagnosed with a GI luminal malignancy and 18 (5%) with a nonluminal or non-GI malignancy. There was no difference in the incidence of malignancies between those with or without confirmed iron deficiency.

In conclusion, most patients in whom no cause was found during the initial investigation resolve on oral iron supplements. Patients with normal ferritin values had as high an incidence of GI malignancies as those with low values and should be investigated.

### Disorders of iron metabolism. Part II: Iron deficiency and iron overload [^116cS6G1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Increased iron requirements, limited external supply, and increased blood loss may lead to iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anaemia. In chronic inflammation, the excess of hepcidin decreases iron absorption and prevents iron recycling, resulting in hypoferraemia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis, despite normal iron stores (functional iron deficiency), and finally anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), which can evolve to ACD plus true ID (ACD+ID).

In contrast, low hepcidin expression may lead to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) type I, characterized by mutations of the HFE gene, and type II, which involves mutations of the hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes. Mutations of transferrin receptor 2 lead to HH type III, whereas mutations of the ferroportin gene result in HH type IV. All these syndromes are characterized by iron overload. As transferrin becomes saturated in iron overload states, non-transferrin bound iron appears. Part of this iron is highly reactive (labile plasma iron), inducing free radical formation. Free radicals are responsible for the parenchymal cell injury associated with iron overload syndromes.

- **Role of laboratory testing in diagnosis**: In iron deficiency status, laboratory tests may provide evidence of iron depletion in the body or reflect iron-deficient red cell production. Increased transferrin saturation and/or ferritin levels are the main cues for further investigation of iron overload. The appropriate combination of different laboratory tests with an integrated algorithm will help to establish a correct diagnosis of iron overload and iron deficiency.

### Aranesp [^117TVcio]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Following the initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

### Predictors of the response to treatment in anemic hemodialysis patients with high serum ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^113WdYn3]. Kidney International (2007). High credibility.

Treating hemodialysis patients to combat anemia corrects hemoglobin but exacerbates iron deficiency by utilizing iron stores. Patients needing iron should receive this by intravenous (i.v.) means. The Dialysis Patients' Response to IV Iron with Elevated Ferritin (DRIVE) trial investigated the role of i.v. iron in anemic patients with high ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and adequate epoetin doses. We examined whether baseline iron and inflammation markers predict the response of hemoglobin to treatment. Patients (134) were randomized to no added iron or to i.v. ferric gluconate for eight consecutive hemodialysis sessions spanning six weeks, with epoetin increased by 25% in both groups. The patients started with hemoglobin less than or equal to 11 g/dL, ferritin between 500 and 1200 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation of less than 25%.

Significantly, patients with a reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than or equal to 31.2 pg were over five times more likely to achieve a clinically significant increase in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dL. Lower reticulocyte hemoglobin contents did not preclude a response to i.v. iron. Significantly higher transferrin saturation or lower C-reactive protein, but not ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor levels, predicted a greater response; however, their influence was not clinically significant in either group. We conclude that none of the studied markers is a good predictor of response to anemia treatment in this patient sub-population.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought.

- **Defining iron deficiency anaemia**: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia. Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency. The lower the haemoglobin, the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation. Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation. Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency.

- **Investigations**: Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss. All patients should be screened for coeliac disease. If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation.

### Oral iron supplementation: New formulations, old questions [^115rYBb2]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

The elemental iron content, or the actual amount of iron available for absorption, differs between commercial iron formulations. Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing approximately 60–70 mg of elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach to reach a daily dose of about 200 mg of elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies have provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple doses per day. These studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption (Figure 2).

The effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate on different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, ensuring that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered the induction of hepcidin for up to 24 hours, which decreased further iron absorption.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^116c5dpZ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Transferrin saturation is a measure of the iron load of circulating transferrin. It does not, however, provide information about the condition of the iron stores, giving only an indirect indication of the extent of iron utilization. Under physiological conditions, 16–45% of transferrin molecules in plasma are loaded with iron (3–4 mol of iron per mol of transferrin). A saturation of less than 16% is considered to represent a suboptimal iron supply for the erythropoietic process. While reduced transferrin saturation (less than 20%) is associated with relatively high sensitivity (90%) for recognizing iron deficiency states, its specificity is poor (40–50%).

Since measurements of both serum iron and serum transferrin are subject to significant circadian effects, blood samples should always be obtained at the same time of day and repeated frequently. Serum transferrin levels are increased in patients taking oral contraceptive steroids but reduced in the presence of inflammation (negative acute phase protein). This means that, in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory disorders, transferrin saturation may be reduced despite normal iron stores.

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation below 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common.

This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron-replete to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin range while receiving ESAs:

- **Percentage hypochromic red cells**: Less than 6%.
- **Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH)**: Greater than 31 picograms (pg).
- **Ferritin and transferrin saturation for patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis**: Greater than 100 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) and transferrin saturation greater than 20%.
- **Ferritin for patients on hemodialysis**: Greater than 200 mcg/L.
- **Ferritin for children with CKD on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs**: Greater than 100 mcg/L.

Consider administering iron when ferritin is less than 500 micrograms per liter (mcg/L) and/or transferrin saturation is less than 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half of these cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia, notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to searching for and treating the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but recent intravenous iron formulations, available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively.

Hepcidin plays a key role in iron homeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, along with outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Retacrit [^114R1Kbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) therapy.

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating RETACRIT. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants, use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of RETACRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions.

The absorption of oral iron salts is significantly impaired if taken with food, reducing bioavailability by up to 75%. This necessitates taking iron either in the fasting state first thing in the morning or during periods between meals throughout the day. It is not clear how soon after taking oral iron food can be consumed, but the inhibitory effect of tea on iron absorption dissipates within 60 minutes. Despite previous suggestions of benefit, coadministration of vitamin C with oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) is not recommended. A recent large randomized controlled trial confirmed that vitamin C neither enhances the hematological response or rate of iron loading nor diminishes side effects.

Iron absorption from oral preparations is determined by a complex interplay involving total body iron stores, erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow, recent exposure of the small intestine to iron, and systemic inflammation. Hepcidin is the most important inhibitor of iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a diurnal pattern and increase after oral iron intake, impairing fractional absorption of subsequent doses.

Short-term studies of iron-depleted but otherwise healthy women have shown that oral doses of 60 mg elemental iron stimulate increased hepcidin levels for the next 24 hours, thus reducing subsequent iron absorption by 35%–45%. As a consequence, the overall absorption of iron from 60 mg of elemental iron taken once a day was similar to that from 60 mg taken twice a day. Therapy with low-dose oral iron has been reported to be successful and safe in elderly patients with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), with a daily dose of 15 mg being effective.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning the initiation of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron replete to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The guidelines specify the following parameters for iron repletion:

- **Percentage of hypochromic red cells**: Less than 6% in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis or on peritoneal dialysis.

- **Ferritin and transferrin saturation**: Greater than 100 mcg/L and greater than 20%, respectively, in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis; greater than 200 mcg/L in patients on hemodialysis.

- **Children with CKD**: Ferritin greater than 100 mcg/L for those on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs.

- **Iron administration consideration**: It is recommended to consider administering iron when ferritin is less than 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation is less than 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111LvPzd]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

When adequate iron status is achieved, CKD patients on ESA therapy should be given maintenance iron treatment. Several studies have reported that the dose of ESA required to achieve and maintain a given Hb level is inversely related to iron stores. Iron deficiency (absolute or functional) was the main cause of ESA resistance in the UK, but this has now been addressed by parenteral iron replacement strategies. The evidence supporting the statement that TSAT generally should be maintained at greater than 20% is based on a single RCT comparing higher to lower TSAT targets. Patients randomized to a target TSAT of 30% to 50% demonstrated a 40% reduction in ESA dose compared with those assigned to a target of 20% to 30%.

In a randomized controlled study involving 157 haemodialysis patients comparing iron management based on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation versus CHr, CHr was a markedly more stable analyte than serum ferritin or transferrin saturation. Iron management based on CHr resulted in similar haematocrit and epoetin dosing while significantly reducing IV iron exposure.

In another study involving 164 chronic haemodialysis patients, low CHr (< 26 pg) was suggestive of functional iron deficiency. When a subgroup of patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of IV iron dextran (1000 mg), a CHr < 26 pg at baseline predicted iron deficiency with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 80%. The serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and percentage of hypochromic red blood cells were all less accurate. The time to correction of iron deficiency at the level of the re [Content seems to be truncated].

### Gastrointestinal causes of refractory iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms [^116P5kHG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The standard evaluation of a patient with iron deficiency anemia includes a complete evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract to identify a source of bleeding. However, even following a careful examination, many patients remain without a diagnosis. Because iron deficiency anemia results from iron loss or defective absorption, we sought to determine the prevalence of potential gastrointestinal sources for iron deficiency anemia in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Methods**: Over a 10-month period, 668 outpatients were referred to the University Hematology Department with iron deficiency anemia, defined by a hemoglobin concentration less than 14 g/dL (less than 12 g/dL in women), mean corpuscular volume less than 80 fL, and ferritin level less than 30 microg/L. After excluding patients with obvious causes of blood loss, inadequate diet, chronic diseases, or malignancies, there were 81 eligible patients, 10 of whom refused investigation. The remaining 71 patients (51 women, median age 59 years) underwent colonoscopy, as well as gastroscopy with gastric (antrum and body) and duodenal biopsies.

- **Results**: A likely cause of iron deficiency anemia was detected in 60 patients (85%). Diseases associated with bleeding were found in 26 patients (37%), including colon cancer (10 patients), gastric cancer (2), peptic ulcer (7), hiatal hernia with linear erosions (5), colonic vascular ectasia (3), colonic polyps (2), and Crohn's disease (1). Causes not associated with bleeding were found in 36 patients (51%), including 19 with atrophic gastritis and 4 with celiac disease.

### Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: Clinical opinion [^116dVjra]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin — an acute phase reactant — may be elevated in inflammatory states and during the first trimester of pregnancy, even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status.

Unfortunately, guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or non-pregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data.

While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority — a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequelae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting.

Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentration…

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^115jn7J4]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 2.4 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy, upper limit for iron therapy**: We recommend that serum ferritin should not exceed 800 microgram/L in patients treated with iron. To achieve this, iron management should be reviewed when the ferritin is > 500 microgram/L (1B).

- **Rationale**:
	- Iron overload is defined as increased total body iron content with the possible risk of organ dysfunction.
	- There is no clinically available method that accurately determines total body iron content.
	- An elevated serum ferritin does not always correlate with elevations in liver iron content.
	- Magnetic resonance imaging provides a reliable assessment of tissue iron content in HD patients regularly treated with parenteral iron. However, the clinical relevance of increased liver iron remains unclear.
	- Elevated serum ferritin together with elevated serum transferrin saturation remains the most clinically accurate parameter of iron overload in CKD patients.
	- Discontinuation of adequate maintenance IV iron when an individual's ferritin is > 500 microgram/L produces a population mean that straddles the 500 microgram/L ceiling. Ongoing iron therapy in patients with ferritin > 500 microgram/L results in a higher median ferritin outcome.
	- Interpretation of iron status results and deciding on the need for further iron therapy should include a concomitant assessment of changes in Hb level and ESA dose over time. Examples:
		- A dropping ferritin as well as decreasing Hb levels signifies blood loss, e.g. on HD or bowel-related anaemia; iron therapy is indicated. Further investigation may be needed.

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Iron deficiency**:
	- We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

- **Response to iron therapy**:
	- We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia definitions**:
	- The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO-defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines provide no specific threshold, creating variability in clinical practice.

During therapy, monitor serum ferritin levels monthly to assess the patient's response to therapy and to minimize the risk of overchelation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Interrupt treatment when serum ferritin is less than 300 mcg/L and obtain a liver iron concentration (LIC) measurement to determine whether the LIC has fallen to less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve a trend of decreasing ferritin. Monitor LIC every 6 months. After 6 months of therapy, if the LIC remains greater than 7 mg Fe/g dw, increase the dose of deferasirox to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day. Do not exceed a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day. If, after 6 months of therapy, the LIC is 3–7 mg Fe/g dw, continue treatment with deferasirox at no more than 10 mg/kg/day. When the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw, interrupt treatment with deferasirox and continue to monitor the LIC.

Monitor blood counts, liver function, renal function, and ferritin levels monthly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)]. Increase the frequency of monitoring for pediatric patients with acute illness, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake. Consider dose interruption until oral intake and volume status normalize [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Restart treatment when the LIC rises again to more than 5 mg Fe/g dw.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat IDA, first because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Second, as parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful Hb response within a week, it should always be considered as an alternative. Transfusion should therefore be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, and so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of IRT, and early monitoring should detect those patients not responding to or intolerant to oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding, and a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113K8Kha]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

For patients with intolerance or failure of hemoglobin (Hb) response at the 2–4 week point, alternate day traditional iron salts (if not already used) or ferric maltol may be alternatives to parenteral iron for those with mild to moderate anemia (Hb > 95 g/L). The tolerability and response should be assessed, and failure of the Hb to rise by 10 g/L at 4 weeks for alternate day iron or 6 weeks for ferric maltol indicates the need for parenteral iron replacement therapy (IRT).

Regular Hb monitoring is recommended to ensure an ultimately satisfactory response. The optimal interval is not clear, but every 4 weeks until the Hb is in the normal range seems reasonable. After normalization of the Hb, oral iron needs to be continued to replenish the iron stores. Traditionally, it has been recommended that oral iron is continued for 2–3 months to achieve this. However, the duration required and the appropriate measure of true iron repletion are both unclear. In healthy, almost iron-replete subjects, 2 months of continued iron was considered sufficient. However, in patients with chronic disease, continuing blood loss, impaired absorption, or gastrointestinal (GI) inflammatory disease (where iron is lost from the GI mucosa), it is likely that a longer period would be required.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). Additionally, we recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Prospective evaluation of a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^115YNPhS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We examined the effect of introducing an evidence-based clinical guideline on the diagnosis and evaluation of iron deficiency anemia. The guideline recommended measurement of serum ferritin levels for all anemic patients with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) ≤ 95 fL and endoscopic evaluation for those with a serum ferritin level less than 45 ng/mL. Physicians practicing in the general medicine inpatient and outpatient services of two university-affiliated hospitals were informed about the guideline and the data supporting it. Clinical evaluations during the 9 months before ("control period", n = 3341 patients) and the 9 months after ("intervention period", n = 3173 patients) the introduction of the guideline were compared.

There was a 30% increase (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22% to 39%) in the proportion of anemic patients who underwent serum ferritin evaluation in the intervention period (41% [n = 1284]) compared with in the control period (31% [n = 1040]), and a 24% increase (95% CI: 4% to 48%) in the proportion with a serum ferritin level < 45 ng/mL (8.1% [n = 256] vs. 6.5% [n = 217]). The proportion of anemic patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within 4 months of measurement of low serum ferritin level in the intervention period (3.3% [n = 106]) was 67% higher (95% CI: 23% to 125%) than in the control period (2.0% [n = 67]), and the proportion with serious gastrointestinal lesions found as a result of endoscopy was 62% (95% CI: 8% to 145%) higher (1.8% [n = 57] vs. 1.1% [n = 37]).

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis and is defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.

- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (inflammatory bowel disease, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (chronic kidney disease).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5% to 18.0%, while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.

- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased quality of life, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Moreover, iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### VAFSEO [^115WRUmV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating VAFSEO. Evaluate iron status in all patients before and during treatment and administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Measure hemoglobin (Hb) at baseline and as recommended in section 2.4.

- **Liver testing**: Measure serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin prior to the initiation of VAFSEO and monthly after initiation for the first 6 months, then monitor as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue VAFSEO if there are persistent ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or if ALT or AST elevations greater than 3 times ULN are accompanied by a bilirubin increase greater than 2 times ULN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin level higher than 11 g/dL. VAFSEO can be taken with or without food. It should be swallowed whole. Tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed.

### Intravenous versus oral iron supplementation for correction of post-transplant anaemia in renal transplant patients [^114L8W2J]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Post-transplant anaemia remains a common problem after kidney transplantation, with an incidence ranging from nearly 80% at day 0 to about 25% at 1 year. It has been associated with poor graft outcomes and has recently also been shown to be associated with increased mortality.

Our transplant unit routinely administers oral iron supplements to renal transplant recipients, but this is frequently accompanied by side effects, mainly gastrointestinal intolerance. Intravenous iron is frequently administered to dialysis patients, and we sought to investigate this mode of administration in transplant recipients after noticing less anaemia in several patients who had received intravenous iron just prior to being called in for transplantation.

- **Methods**: This study is a single-centre, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled trial of oral versus intravenous iron supplements in renal transplant recipients and aims to recruit approximately 100 patients over a 12-month period. Patients will be randomised to receive a single dose of 500 mg iron polymaltose (intravenous iron group) or 2 ferrous sulphate slow-release tablets daily (oral iron group). The primary outcome is the time to normalisation of haemoglobin post-transplant. Prospective power calculations have indicated that a minimum of 48 patients in each group would have to be followed up for 3 months in order to have a 90% probability of detecting a halving of the time to correction of haemoglobin levels to ≥ 110 g/l in iron-treated patients, assuming an α of 0.05.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias, and Hb E — and most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log 10 ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, but is dependent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective, and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia, particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116UwsGD]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common following resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel, including bariatric surgery (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

In new presentations of IDA, it is recommended that a history of GI or bariatric surgery should not preclude a search for other causes of IDA (evidence quality — low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Resection or bypass surgery involving the stomach and/or small bowel generally predisposes individuals to IDA. This includes the expanding population with a history of bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy. Reduced nutritional intake and malabsorption are probably the major underlying mechanisms. Consequently, IDA in this situation may occur alongside other nutritional deficiencies, particularly of vitamin B12.

The prevalence of IDA depends on the specific diagnostic criteria employed. It is found in approximately a quarter of subjects two years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and is more common in women and in those with preoperative evidence of low iron stores. The figure for sleeve gastrectomy is likely lower.

Predictably, the yield of other causative lesions on BDE is lower in individuals with IDA and a history of GI surgery than in those without. Nevertheless, it is unsafe to automatically attribute IDA to previous surgery without excluding other possibilities, particularly in those at risk of underlying GI malignancy. This is important to consider since partial gastrectomy may predispose individuals to the later development of cancer in the gastric remnant.

### Monitoring recovery from iron deficiency using total hemoglobin mass [^113S6cwS]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2015). Low credibility.

Using hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) to diagnose borderline iron deficiency and monitor the progress of its treatment is difficult because of the confounding effects of plasma volume. Since hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) is not affected by plasma volume, it may be a more sensitive parameter. The aim of this study was to monitor Hbmass, iron storage, and maximal oxygen consumption (V˙O2max) during and after oral iron therapy in subjects with severe and moderate iron deficiency.

- **Methods**: Three groups of female recreational athletes were monitored for at least 22 weeks, as follows: 1) severe iron deficiency group (SID) (n = 8; ferritin, ≤ 12 ng·mL), 2) moderate iron deficiency group (MID) (n = 14; ferritin, ≤ 25 ng·mL), and 3) control group (n = 8; ferritin, > 25 ng·mL). Hbmass and iron status were determined before, during, and up to 12 weeks after at least 10 weeks of oral iron supplementation. In total, five V˙O2max tests were performed before, during, and after the supplementation period.

- **Results**: Hbmass increased markedly in the SID group (15.6% ± 11.0%, P < 0.001) and slightly in the MID group (2.2% ± 3.7%, P < 0.05) by the end of the supplementation period and remained at this level for the following 12 weeks. [Hb] and Hbmass were similarly affected, but Hbmass was more closely related to mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin than [Hb]. The SID group incorporated 534 ± 127 mg of iron into ferritin and hemoglobin, whereas the MID group incorporated 282 ± 68 mg of iron. V˙O2max increased only in the SID group by 0.20 ± 0.18 L·min (P < 0.05).

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, and serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST). Additionally, we discuss testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration.

We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Iron deficiency in chronic pediatric heart failure: Overall assessment and outcomes in dilated cardiomyopathy [^112dFuev]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

To evaluate the frequency of iron status assessment in pediatric heart failure and the prevalence and adverse effects of absolute iron deficiency in dilated cardiomyopathy-induced heart failure, a study was conducted.

- **Study design**: We retrospectively reviewed records of children with chronic heart failure at our center between 2010 and 2020. In children with dilated cardiomyopathy, we analyzed baseline cardiac function, hemoglobin level, and subsequent risk of composite adverse events (CAE), including death, heart transplant, ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, and transplant registry listing. Absolute iron deficiency and iron sufficiency were defined as transferrin saturations < 20% and ≥ 30%, respectively; indeterminate iron status was defined as 20%-29%.

- **Results**: Of 799 patients with chronic heart failure, 471 (59%) had no iron-related laboratory measurements. Of 68 children with dilated cardiomyopathy, baseline transferrin saturation, and quantitative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 33 (49%) and 14 (21%) were iron deficient and sufficient, respectively; 21 (31%) were indeterminate. LVEF was reduced to 23.6 ± 12.1% from 32.9 ± 16.8% in iron deficiency and sufficiency, respectively (P = 0.04), without a significant difference in hemoglobin levels. After stratification by New York Heart Association classification, in advanced class IV, hemoglobin was reduced to 10.9 ± 1.3 g/dL vs 12.7 ± 2.0 g/dL in iron deficiency and sufficiency, respectively (P = 0.01), without a significant difference in LVEF.

In this single-center study, iron deficiency was not monitored in most children.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^116Ln8KB]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common condition, and automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany it. These measurements include reduced mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), known as hypochromia, and reduced mean cell volume (MCV), known as microcytosis. MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, with a reduction seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited because microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemia, where the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia. This also occurs in sideroblastic anaemia and some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary gastrointestinal investigation, hemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended in individuals with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte hemoglobin (Retic-Hb), and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of less than 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^111gPYEe]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Functional iron deficiency describes a scenario where the supply of iron for erythropoiesis is inadequate despite apparently normal iron stores in cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. This condition, distinct from absolute iron deficiency where body iron stores are insufficient to meet demands, is modulated by hepcidin, which restricts iron absorption through the gut mucosa.

A prevalent clinical context for functional iron deficiency (FID) is chronic kidney disease (CKD), where parenteral iron therapy enhances the response to administered erythropoietin to correct anaemia. FID is also a component of the anaemia of chronic disease, seen in numerous chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Detailed exploration of the complex pathogenesis of anaemia of chronic disease is beyond the scope of these guidelines.

An area of challenge is determining whether patients with presumed FID (indicated by raised inflammatory markers and a serum ferritin in the normal range) have diminished iron stores suggestive of absolute deficiency. When attributing anaemia to FID, it is essential to assess whether there is adequate evidence of a chronic illness. Research in CKD indicates that, in the absence of thalassaemia, both the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte haemoglobin (Retic-Hb) are superior to transferrin saturation in predicting response to intravenous iron therapy. A transferrin saturation of less than 20% signals iron restriction, particularly in thalassaemia carriers.

Similar findings show that low Retic-Hb is an independent marker of iron restriction in a non-CKD context, offering a reliable indicator.
