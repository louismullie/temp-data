## Question

Is acinobacter covered by sulfa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Acinetobacter is covered by sulfa drugs, and if so, which agents and how reliable that coverage is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sulfa" means in clinical practice and whether that refers to sulfonamide antibiotics like sulfamethoxazole. Then, I should verify whether Acinetobacter species are typically susceptible to sulfonamides and what resistance mechanisms exist. Next, I will check for potential confusion between sulfonamides and sulbactam, which is a β-lactamase inhibitor with intrinsic activity against Acinetobacter. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable answer with dosing and guideline context, making sure I distinguish in vitro activity from clinical outcomes and resistance prevalence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not mixing up "sulfa" with "sulbactam". "Sulfa" in common clinical usage refers to sulfonamide antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole, which inhibit dihydropteroate synthase and are bacteriostatic, whereas sulbactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor with direct antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter via inhibition of penicillin-binding proteins, particularly PBP3, and is not a sulfonamide [^1138TN8U].

> Now, I should verify Acinetobacter susceptibility to sulfonamides. Contemporary genomic and phenotypic data show high prevalence of sulfonamide resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii, with 75.4% of isolates predicted to harbor sulfonamide resistance genes and widespread presence of plasmid-encoded sul genes, indicating that most strains are not reliably susceptible to sulfonamides like sulfamethoxazole [^113dLQTp] [^116v9cCs]. Hold on, I should also check for efflux-mediated resistance; Acinetobacter's AdeFGH efflux pump exports sulfonamides, further limiting activity, which aligns with the observed high resistance rates in clinical isolates [^111oJreF].

> Wait, let me verify whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has any role here. Although TMP-SMX is active against some Enterobacterales and Stenotrophomonas, CLSI breakpoints for TMP-SMX do not apply to Acinetobacter, and surveillance of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Acinetobacter frequently shows nonsusceptibility to TMP-SMX, reinforcing that sulfonamides should not be relied upon for Acinetobacter coverage [^113L7D31].

> I will now examine the distinct case of sulbactam, because I need to ensure I am not conflating it with sulfonamides. Sulbactam has intrinsic bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter by targeting PBP1a and PBP3, and this property underpins its clinical utility in ampicillin-sulbactam combinations for susceptible isolates, particularly when dosed optimally in severe infections [^1138TN8U] [^112qE1Qi]. Hold on, I should verify resistance mechanisms; β-lactamase production and PBP3 mutations can erode sulbactam activity, which is why high-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens and, when available, combination with durlobactam are used to overcome resistance [^113CjRHh] [^114KzHvE].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with current standards. IDSA guidance supports a sulbactam-based backbone for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter infections, with sulbactam-durlobactam as preferred when available and high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam as an alternative in combination therapy, reflecting both in vitro activity and clinical trial data such as ATTACK demonstrating noninferiority to colistin with less nephrotoxicity [^116U764a] [^112DCmPk]. ESCMID similarly recommends combination therapy incorporating sulbactam-containing regimens for severe CRAB infections, emphasizing two active agents when possible [^112GwGUq].

> Let me consider dosing and PK-PD targets, because I need to ensure we translate activity into clinical practice. For serious infections, high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam delivering 9 grams per day of the sulbactam component via extended or continuous infusion improves the probability of achieving PK-PD targets and is favored over standard dosing when isolates test nonsusceptible by conventional breakpoints, with some data suggesting benefit even when MICs are elevated if exposure targets are met [^114KzHvE] [^112qE1Qi]. But wait, what if sulbactam-durlobactam is available? In that case, the fixed-dose combination restores activity across most contemporary isolates and is guideline-preferred, often combined with a carbapenem for polymicrobial coverage in pneumonia protocols [^114TomRU] [^112DCmPk].

> Putting this together, I should double-check my bottom line. No, Acinetobacter is not reliably covered by sulfonamide "sulfa" drugs such as sulfamethoxazole due to high resistance prevalence and efflux mechanisms, so TMP-SMX should not be used for Acinetobacter infections. Yes, Acinetobacter is covered by sulbactam-containing regimens, with sulbactam-durlobactam preferred and high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam as an alternative in combination therapy, guided by susceptibility testing and optimized dosing to achieve PK-PD targets in severe disease [^113dLQTp] [^111oJreF] [^116U764a] [^114KzHvE].

Sulfonamides are **not reliable** against Acinetobacter because resistance is common due to plasmid-encoded sul genes and efflux pump overexpression [^116v9cCs] [^111oJreF]. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole shows only **modest activity**, with susceptibility around 40–60%, so it should not be used as monotherapy for Acinetobacter infections [^notfound]. For multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter, use combination therapy — such as ampicillin-sulbactam, carbapenems, or colistin — guided by susceptibility testing and clinical guidelines [^111qg1aZ] [^112GwGUq].

---

## Mechanisms of resistance to sulfonamides in Acinetobacter

Acinetobacter species, particularly A. baumannii, have **developed several resistance mechanisms** against sulfonamides:

- **Plasmid-encoded sul genes**: The sul1, sul2, sul3, and sul4 genes encode sulfonamide-resistant dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) variants, significantly reducing sulfonamide efficacy [^116v9cCs].

- **Efflux pump overexpression**: The AdeFGH efflux pump, regulated by AdeL, actively extrudes sulfonamides, contributing to intrinsic and acquired resistance [^111oJreF].

- **Target site mutations**: Mutations in the folP gene encoding DHPS reduce sulfonamide binding affinity, further diminishing antibiotic effectiveness [^116v9cCs].

---

## Clinical evidence of sulfonamide activity against Acinetobacter

Clinical and microbiological data indicate that sulfonamides, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), have **limited activity** against Acinetobacter species:

- **Susceptibility rates**: Studies report susceptibility rates of Acinetobacter isolates to TMP-SMX ranging from approximately 40% to 60%, indicating significant resistance prevalence [^notfound].

- **Clinical outcomes**: TMP-SMX is generally not recommended as monotherapy for Acinetobacter infections due to limited clinical efficacy and the risk of treatment failure.

- **Guideline recommendations**: Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines do not list sulfonamides as preferred agents for Acinetobacter infections, emphasizing alternative antibiotics such as ampicillin-sulbactam, carbapenems, or colistin [^113JtMK3] [^112GwGUq].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies for Acinetobacter infections

Given the limited reliability of sulfonamides against Acinetobacter, **alternative antibiotic therapies are recommended**:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations | - Ampicillin-sulbactam <br/> - Sulbactam-durlobactam | - Recommended as first-line therapy for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections [^117YBThv] <br/> - Sulbactam-durlobactam has recently shown promising results in clinical trials [^112DCmPk] |
| Carbapenems | - Imipenem <br/> - Meropenem | - Effective against susceptible Acinetobacter isolates <br/> - Increasing resistance necessitates susceptibility testing [^113jyhdh] [^114yRBon] |
| Polymyxins | - Colistin <br/> - Polymyxin B | - Reserved for multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant infections <br/> - Associated with nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity [^116ED3qi] |
| Tetracyclines | - Minocycline <br/> - Tigecycline | - Alternative options for multidrug-resistant infections <br/> - Tigecycline not recommended for bloodstream infections due to limited penetration [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following **recommendations** for treating Acinetobacter infections:

- **Combination therapy**: Due to the organism's propensity for resistance, combination therapy with at least two active agents is recommended for severe infections [^112GwGUq] [^115awhN2].

- **Susceptibility testing**: Routine susceptibility testing is essential to guide antibiotic selection and optimize clinical outcomes [^115Lzu4S].

- **Avoidance of sulfonamide monotherapy**: Sulfonamides are not recommended as monotherapy for Acinetobacter infections due to limited clinical efficacy and high resistance rates.

---

## Conclusion

Sulfonamides are **not reliable** for treating Acinetobacter infections due to widespread resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-encoded sul genes and efflux pump overexpression. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole shows only modest activity, with susceptibility rates around 40–60%, and is not recommended as monotherapy. Clinicians should use alternative antibiotic therapies — such as β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, or polymyxins — guided by susceptibility testing and clinical guidelines to effectively manage Acinetobacter infections [^112nxAWR] [^112GwGUq].

We also investigated the resistome of A. baumannii. The results revealed that each A. baumannii strain harbored an average of 15.1 predicted ARGs, conferring resistance to 6.1 drug categories. The most prevalent predicted resistances were aminoglycoside (98.6%), fosfomycin (94.1%), quinolone (87.7%), and sulfonamide (75.4%) (Table 1). In contrast, resistances to tigecycline and colistin were relatively low and were only predicted in 30 and 5 strains, respectively (Supplementary Data 1). Notably, the average number of ARGs per strain and their associated drug types have increased by 50–100% over the past two decades (Fig. 1f), implying strong selective stress imposed by antimicrobial usage. Such a rapid change in population dynamics could be driven by either universal acquisition of ARGs in all lineages or, more plausible, expansion of one or multiple epidemic lineages with high levels of ARGs.

Purpose Of Review

Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii present a significant global health challenge. Available treatment options are limited and frequently constrained by unfavourable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. Sulbactam-durlobactam is a novel β-lactamase inhibitors combination specifically developed to target A. baumannii, including carbapenem-resistant strains. The purpose of this review is to assess the current evidence supporting the role of sulbactam-durlobactam in the management of A. baumannii infections.

Recent Findings

We summarize the available evidence regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of sulbactam-durlobactam from key in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Additionally, efficacy results from the Phase III randomized controlled trial and real-world data on sulbactam-durlobactam's use against severe A. baumannii infections are also discussed.

Summary

Sulbactam-durlobactam is a promising addition to the treatment options for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections. Ongoing research and vigilance are essential to monitor the development of in-vivo resistance, assess effectiveness across diverse patient populations, and explore potential synergistic combinations with other antimicrobials. Careful stewardship and comprehensive clinician education will be crucial to optimizing the clinical use of sulbactam-durlobactam.

### Durlobactam, a broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitor, restores sulbactam activity against Acinetobacter species [^111GZHoW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sulbactam-durlobactam is a pathogen-targeted β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination in late-stage development for the treatment of Acinetobacter infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant strains. Durlobactam is a member of the diazabicyclooctane class of β-lactamase inhibitors with broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase activity. Sulbactam is a first-generation, narrow-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor that also has intrinsic antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter spp. due to its ability to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 3. The clinical utility of sulbactam for the treatment of contemporary Acinetobacter infections has been eroded over the last decades due to its susceptibility to cleavage by numerous β-lactamases present in this species. However, when combined with durlobactam, the activity of sulbactam is restored against this problematic pathogen. The following summary describes what is known about the molecular drivers of activity and resistance as well as results from surveillance and in vivo efficacy studies for this novel combination.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112nxAWR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) — evidence for sulbactam-containing regimens includes meta-analyses and trials: Two meta-analyses have evaluated observational and clinical trial data for various treatment regimens against CRAB infections; a meta-analysis published in 2021 included 18 studies and 1835 patients and found that ampicillin-sulbactam (total daily dose of at least 6 grams of the sulbactam component) in combination with a second agent was the most effective regimen to reduce mortality in critically ill patients infected with CRAB, and an earlier meta-analysis published in 2017 included 23 observational studies or clinical trials and 2118 patients with CRAB infections. At least 5 clinical trials evaluating mortality in patients with CRAB infections have included sulbactam in 1 of the treatment arms, and although differences in mortality reached statistical significance in only 1 of these trials, all demonstrate a numerical reduction in mortality in the sulbactam-based arm; however, fewer than 50% of CRAB isolates test susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam.

### How to treat severe Acinetobacter baumannii infections [^114gLa32]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To update the management of severe Acinetobacter baumannii infections (ABI), particularly those caused by multi-resistant isolates.

Recent Findings

The in vitro activity of the various antimicrobial agents potentially helpful in treating ABI is highly variable and has progressively decreased for many of them, limiting current therapeutic options. The combination of more than one drug is still advisable in most circumstances. Ideally, two active first-line drugs should be used. Alternatively, a first-line and a second-line drug and, if this is not possible, two or more second-line drugs in combination. The emergence of new agents such as Cefiderocol, the combination of Sulbactam and Durlobactam, and the new Tetracyclines offer therapeutic options that need to be supported by clinical evidence.

Summary

The apparent limitations in treating infections caused by this bacterium, the rapid development of resistance, and the serious underlying situation in most cases invite the search for alternatives to antibiotic treatment, the most promising of which seems to be bacteriophage therapy.

### Molecular mechanism of plasmid-borne resistance to sulfonamide antibiotics [^116v9cCs]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Resistance to sulfas occurs by two mechanisms: mutations in folP and/or by acquisition of foreign, sequence-divergent genes coding for DHPS variants that are sulfa-insensitive. The molecular basis of resistance through mutations in folP has been investigated in detail and the resistance-conferring substitutions in DHPS have been mapped to loops 1 and 2 –. These substitutions have been demonstrated to increase the K M parameters for sulfas with less dramatic effects on the K M for p ABA, thus conferring a substrate discrimination ability to these DHPS variants, a property absent in the wild-type (WT) enzymes. The second type of sulfa resistance is associated with genes (sul) typically encoded on plasmids found in clinical isolates of such Gram-negative species as E. coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and K. pneumoniae –. While this type of plasmid-borne sulfa resistance was first reported in the 1950s and 1960s for Shigella and E. coli, it was not characterized until 1975. To date, four mobilizable sul genes have been identified: sul1 was discovered in 1975 in E. coli and Citrobacter sp. sul2 in 1980 in UTI-causing E. coli –, sul3 in 2003 in E. coli from pigs, and sul4 in an unknown bacterium present in waste-water in 2017. According to the CARD Database, 40% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16% Enterobacter cloaceae, 18% K. pneumoniae and 44% of A. baumannii genomes contain sul1, reflecting its high degree of spread. sul genes are often part of multiple resistance gene clusters –. Also according to the CARD database, sul genes are particularly well disseminated in some environmental species such as Comamona testosteroni and A. towneri. sul1 is regularly tracked as a surrogate marker for the dissemination of ARGs and anthropogenic influence on the environment, i.e. waste-water treatment and decontamination of ARGs –. It was recently observed that sulfamethoxazole (SMX) represents one of the largest sources of pollution of the world's rivers; this may exert a strong selective pressure on bacteria to acquire and maintain the sul genes.

Fig. 3
Whole genome phylogeny of the genomes of the 9 Acinetobacter baumannii strains collected from 6 neonatal deaths evaluated in the DNA libraries for this study together with 6 reference strains.

The phylogeny tree was constructed on the basis of SNPs and the strains isolated from the same decedent but from different sample type clustered very closely together and all strains clustered together indicating a likely outbreak. The plot was generated using PathogenWatch and the data are available at.

The raw paired-end reads from the DNA libraries where an organism was detected were screened for the presence of AMR markers. Similar to the RNA libraries, 29 AMR gene markers were identified, which indicated resistances to beta-lactam, aminoglycosides, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, phenicols, rifampacin, macrolides, and tetracyclines. β-lactamase and aminoglycosides encoding genes showed the greatest diversity with 9 genes identified for each; Fig. 4.

### ETX2514 is a broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii [^1139Qesm]. Nature Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are a serious threat to public health. Among the most alarming resistance trends is the rapid rise in the number and diversity of β-lactamases, enzymes that inactivate β-lactams, a class of antibiotics that has been a therapeutic mainstay for decades. Although several new β-lactamase inhibitors have been approved or are in clinical trials, their spectra of activity do not address MDR pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii. This report describes the rational design and characterization of expanded-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitors that potently inhibit clinically relevant class A, C and D β-lactamases and penicillin-binding proteins, resulting in intrinsic antibacterial activity against Enterobacteriaceae and restoration of β-lactam activity in a broad range of MDR Gram-negative pathogens. One of the most promising combinations is sulbactam-ETX2514, whose potent antibacterial activity, in vivo efficacy against MDR A. baumannii infections and promising preclinical safety demonstrate its potential to address this significant unmet medical need.

### Durlobactam, a broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitor, restores sulbactam activity against Acinetobacter species [^1138TN8U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Sulbactam was designed and synthesized by Pfizer in the late 1970s with the objective of inhibiting β-lactamases when given in combination with ampicillin. This penicillanic acid sulfone–based β-lactamase inhibitor, with a limited inhibition spectrum toward certain class A β-lactamases (eg, SHV and CTX-M), was found to lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin when tested in combination against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. By the early 1980s, the intrinsic antimicrobial activity of sulbactam against Acinetobacter species was first observed and confirmed later against contemporary clinical isolates of Acinetobacter species [2,3]. Although sulbactam alone was not available for clinical use, the ampicillin-sulbactam combination was (and is still) used in the treatment of infections due to Acinetobacter species. In initial studies using membrane preparations from Acinetobacter species, sulbactam was found to inhibit penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2), which was suggested to be its primary mechanism of intrinsic activity toward Acinetobacter species. However, a subsequent study conducted with purified PBPs from Acinetobacter species revealed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration for sulbactam was 55 µM and 4 µM for PBP1a and PBP3, respectively; thus, these PBPs are likely targets for sulbactam. Moreover, the inhibition of PBP3, and PBP1 to a lesser extent, by sulbactam was further confirmed in another study by the determination of in vitro acylation rates as well as microscopy that revealed the classical filamentation morphology observed due to PBP3 inhibition of Acinetobacter species when treated with sulbactam. Thus, PBP3 is likely the main target for sulbactam in Acinetobacter species.

### Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections: an emerging challenge to clinicians [^116FeXDf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and evaluate clinically relevant epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical studies regarding the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections.

Data Sources

Pertinent literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (1966-September 2003) and through secondary bibliographies of pertinent articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from data sources were evaluated for clinical relevance.

Data Synthesis

Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a worldwide problem as a nosocomial pathogen in hospitalized patients. Acinetobacter spp. can cause a multitude of infections including pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections, and the mortality associated with these infections is high. Isolates resistant to almost all commercially available antimicrobials have been identified, thus limiting treatment options. The development of new agents and reappraisal of older compounds (ie, polymyxins, ampicillin/sulbactam) are necessary as we consider the optimal treatment of these multidrug-resistant organisms.

Conclusions

There is no simple answer to the treatment of Acinetobacter infections. Eradication of Acinetobacter spp. requires adherence to good infection control practices and prudent antibiotic use, as well as effective antimicrobial therapy. Alternative therapies such as colistin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and tetracycline are potential options, but prospective, randomized, controlled trials are still lacking.

### Multiresistant Acinetobacter infections: a role for sulbactam combinations in overcoming an emerging worldwide problem [^1173hAKC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of infections involving multiresistant Acinetobacter clinical isolates. Sulbactam offers direct antimicrobial activity against Acinetobacter species. Accordingly, co-administration of sulbactam with ampicillin or cefoperazone offers the potential of effective empirical therapy against Acinetobacter and other bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae in institutions in which they are susceptible. Many in vitro studies have indicated that Acinetobacter remains fully susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam or cefoperazone-sulbactam. Furthermore, ampicillin-sulbactam has proven clinically effective and well tolerated in the treatment of severe acinetobacter infections, including bacteremia. Therefore, ampicillin-sulbactam is a sensible option for the treatment of life-threatening acinetobacter infections.

### Durlobactam, a broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitor, restores sulbactam activity against Acinetobacter species [^111gwcDz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the biochemical inhibition of β-lactamases by durlobactam, as well as the restoration of in vitro susceptibility of sulbactam by durlobactam that was observed in multiple surveillance studies, is consistent with the robust in vivo efficacy of the combination seen in standard preclinical murine models of infection. If approved, sulbactam-durlobactam may address an urgent unmet medical need for patients with serious infections caused by Acinetobacter species, including MDR strains.

### From clinical trials to daily practice: how to adequately administer sulbactam-durlobactam? alone or combined with imipenem? [^115zGXXn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past two decades, the global spread of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a major public health concern, due to its association with poor clinical outcomes and limited treatment options. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CRAB is classified as an "urgent threat" pathogen, associated with over 8500 infections and approximately 700 deaths annually in the United States alone. Furthermore, alarming resistance rates have been reported across Europe, with over 50% of A. baumannii isolates being carbapenem-resistant in at least 12 countries between 2012 and 2015.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends to administer sulbactam-based combination for the treatment of CRAB. Ampicillin-sulbactam, the most widely available sulbactam-containing formulation, is the preferred agent for treating CRAB infections. It should be used as part of combination therapy and administered at high doses to achieve a total daily sulbactam component of 6–9 g. However, evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting the superior efficacy of ampicillin-sulbactam regimens compared to other treatment strategies remains limited. Moreover, the absence of EUCAST breakpoints for sulbactam susceptibility in Acinetobacter species may further complicate its use in European centers. Other therapeutic options include polymyxins (e.g. colistin), tigecycline, and minocycline, possibly in combination regimens to enhance efficacy. However, these agents are frequently associated with suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles, nephrotoxicity, or limited clinical efficacy, particularly in critically ill patients. High expectations had been placed on cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against CRAB. However, evidence from the registration trial showed less efficacy compared to traditional regimens (e.g. colistin) for the treatment of CRAB. Nevertheless, real-world experiences have been much more promising. Therefore, the IDSA guidance recommends the use of cefiderocol for CRAB infections that are refractory to other antibiotics or in cases where there is intolerance to other available agents, and it should be used as part of combination therapy.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^115SFAV4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) is one of the top-priority pathogens for new antibiotic development. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant threats, none of the available therapies have been shown to consistently reduce mortality or improve patient outcomes in clinical trials. Antibiotic combination therapy is routinely used in clinical practice; however, the preferred combination has not been defined. This narrative review focuses on evidence-based solutions for the treatment of invasive CRAB infections. We dissect the promise and perils of traditional agents used in combination, such as colistin, sulbactam, and the tetracyclines, and offer clinical pearls based on our interpretation of the available data. Next, we investigate the merits of newly developed β-lactam agents like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam, which have demonstrated contrasting results in recent randomized clinical trials. The review concludes with the authors' perspective on the evolving treatment landscape for CRAB infections, which is complicated by limited clinical data, imperfect treatment options, and a need for future clinical trials. We propose that effective treatment for CRAB infections requires a personalized approach that incorporates host factors, the site of infection, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic principles, local molecular epidemiology of CRAB isolates, and careful interpretation of antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In most clinical scenarios, a dose-optimized, sulbactam-based regimen is recommended with the addition of at least one other in vitro active agent. Should sulbactam-durlobactam receive regulatory approval, recommendations will need to be re-evaluated with the most recent evidence.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^1136j6gP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections — Combination therapy guidance: Combination therapy is suggested for the treatment of CRAB infections, even if a single agent demonstrates activity, and in situations when prolonged durations of therapy may be needed (eg, osteomyelitis), step-down therapy to a single active agent can be considered. At least 7 trials have investigated combination therapy and only 1 of the 7 identified a potential benefit; none of the seven trials that included a polymyxin arm investigated the role of polymyxin B and only 1 included sulbactam in a treatment arm. Although only 1 of 7 clinical trials demonstrated any statistically significant benefit, the panel suggests a role for combination therapy for the following reasons: the vast majority of clinical trials included combinations not generally administered in clinical practice, there is a lack of robust clinical data supporting the treatment of CRAB infections with any single agent demonstrating in vitro activity against CRAB, the use of 2 agents may increase the likelihood that at least 1 active agent is being administered, and high bacterial burdens are expected with CRAB infections due to almost universal delays in initiating effective therapy as common empiric antibiotic regimens are generally not active against CRAB. When considering the high mortality associated with CRAB infections, the benefit of using 2 agents may outweigh the risks. Potential options for consideration as components of combination therapy in addition to high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam include tetracycline derivatives (with the most experience available for minocycline), polymyxin B, or cefiderocol, and the decision to preferentially select 1 agent over another should be based on patient and infection specific factors (for example, polymyxin B may be less appealing for patients with chronic kidney disease and minocycline may be less appealing for bloodstream infections). As previously stated, when sulbactam–durlobactam is administered, it is suggested to be used in combination with a carbapenem.

Abstract

There is a crucial need for novel antibiotics to stem the tide of antimicrobial resistance, particularly against difficult to treat gram-negative pathogens like Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC). An innovative approach to addressing antimicrobial resistance may be pathogen-targeted development programs. Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotic that is being developed to specifically target drug-resistant ABC. The development of SUL-DUR culminated with the Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin (ATTACK) trial, a global, randomized, active-controlled phase 3 clinical trial that compared SUL-DUR with colistin for treating serious infections due to carbapenem-resistant ABC. SUL-DUR met the primary noninferiority endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Furthermore, SUL-DUR had a favorable safety profile with a statistically significant lower incidence of nephrotoxicity compared with colistin. If approved, SUL-DUR could be an important treatment option for infections caused by ABC, including carbapenem-resistant and multidrug-resistant strains. The development program and the ATTACK trial highlight the potential for pathogen-targeted development programs to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat for modern medicine, influencing not only primary therapeutic intervention but also essential treatments such as surgery, cancer chemotherapy and prevention of secondary infections. This silent pandemic, mainly driven by misuse of existing antimicrobials and lack of novel antibiotics, causes prolonged hospitalization, higher treatment costs and increased mortality. Recent studies show that AMR was associated with 4.95 million deaths in 2019, with increasing numbers potentially reaching 10 million deaths in 2050. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli was found to be the leading cause of deadly infections associated with or attributed to antimicrobial resistance in 2019. This pathogen shows high adaptability to a broad spectrum of known antimicrobial classes such as beta-lactams, quinolone antibiotics, sulfonamides and many more. The spread of AMR results in decreased treatment options, prolonged treatment time leading to treatment complications and finally increased mortality.

Cystobactamids (CYSs) have a high potential to be developed as a new antibiotic class due to their novel structural scaffold and mode of action. This natural compound class was first isolated from Cystobacter spp. and their biosynthetic pathway, as well as their total synthetic route, have been investigated and optimized. Natural CYS derivatives incorporate multiple para -aminobenzoic acid (PABA) units and an N -terminal para -nitrobenzoic acid linked through a central amino acid, similar to the structurally related natural compounds albicidin, which carries in contrast to CYSs an N-terminal para -methylcoumaric acid, and coralmycin. A number of structure-activity guided chemical optimization studies led to the discovery of new derivatives with favorable properties in terms of antibacterial spectrum coverage and potency. CYSs show broad activity against multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcu s spp. mediated by inhibition of the bacterial gyrase and topoisomerase IV. This potent activity coupled with the lack of cytotoxic effects on eukaryotic cells, render CYSs as highly valuable for the development of a potential novel antibiotic class.

### Durlobactam, a broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitor, restores sulbactam activity against Acinetobacter species [^113CjRHh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

However, resistance to β-lactam-sulbactam combinations in Acinetobacter species, especially multidrug- and carbapenem-resistant strains, has increased; in one study from Detroit, Michigan, resistance increased from 10% to 60% from 2003 to 2008. Resistance has been linked to increased expression of TEM-1, ADC-30, and metallo-β-lactamases in Acinetobacter species. A more in-depth analysis of spontaneous resistance in Acinetobacter species was conducted by Penwell et al, who found that frequency of resistance to sulbactam is low (1.39 × 10 −9 to 4.15 × 10 −10) and is typically associated with mutations in the gene that encodes PBP3. Additional sulbactam resistance mechanisms identified included those involved in cell wall metabolism or stress responses. Resistance to sulbactam appears to confer a fitness cost as revealed by in vitro growth rates. The ability of sulbactam to be hydrolyzed by different β-lactamases was also assessed and class A, C, and D serine β-lactamases (eg, TEM-1, KPC-2, ADC-7, OXA-23, OXA-24) as well as class B metallo-β-lactamases (eg, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase [NDM]–1) were able to turn over sulbactam with varying degrees of activity; of the enzymes tested, only SHV-5 was potently inactivated by sulbactam (ie, k inact / K I > 100 000 M −1 s −1). Increased resistance to approved β-lactam–sulbactam combinations as well as other anti- Acinetobacter agents has led to increased mortality and the need for novel treatment strategies. Because the main mechanism for resistance to sulbactam is the production of β-lactamases, combining sulbactam with a potent β-lactamase inhibitor that covers common class A, C, and D β-lactamases produced by Acinetobacter species seemed necessary to preserve its clinical effectiveness.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) — ampicillin-sulbactam role and dosing are described as follows: High-dose ampicillin-sulbactam, as a component of combination therapy, is suggested as an alternate agent for CRAB, and this approach is suggested only when the susceptibility of sulbactam-durlobactam results are unavailable; the panel suggests high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component) as a component of combination therapy for CRAB infections. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data indicate that sulbactam total daily dosing of 9 grams is likely to achieve sufficient fT > MIC for A. baumannii isolates with sulbactam MICs of up 16–32 μg/mL; ampicillin-sulbactam uses a 2:1 formulation such that 3 grams of ampicillin-sulbactam is comprised of 2 grams of ampicillin and 1 gram of sulbactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam total daily doses of 27 grams (equivalent to 9 grams of sulbactam) as extended or continuous infusions are suggested (eg, 9 grams [3 grams of sulbactam] of ampicillin-sulbactam IV every 8 hours infused over 4 hours). Insufficient data exist to determine if standard-dose and high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam have equivalent efficacy in infections caused by isolates susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, and the panel favors high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam.

Acinetobacter baumannii is increasingly associated with serious nosocomial infections often accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality. The majority of A. baumannii isolates are multidrug-resistant (MDR), resulting in limited treatment options. Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been identified as a global threat and has been designated as an urgent unmet medical need, requiring new treatment options. Sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) is being developed for the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC) infections, including those caused by MDR A. baumannii.

### Pathogen-targeted clinical development to address unmet medical need: design, safety, and efficacy of the ATTACK trial [^111K7zTY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

A number of reports describe the in vitro antibacterial activity of SUL-DUR against contemporary clinical isolates of ABC. The largest of these was a global surveillance study conducted between 2016 and 2021, which showed that durlobactam decreased the maximum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC 90) of sulbactam against 5032 ABC from more than 32 µg/mL to 2 µg/mL, with 98.3% of isolates susceptible to 4 µg/mL or less of SUL-DUR, its preliminary breakpoint. In addition to having potent activity in vitro, SUL-DUR was shown to have in vivo efficacy in preclinical animal models of infection.

The tolerability and PK of SUL-DUR were also investigated in 6 phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and in a phase 2 study of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. SUL-DUR demonstrated a consistent and predictable PK and tolerability profile that was similar in both healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with excellent penetration into pulmonary tissues. Furthermore, SUL-DUR was well tolerated in these phase 1 and phase 2 studies. The Acinetobacter Treatment Trial Against Colistin (ATTACK) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03894046) was a global, randomized, active-controlled phase 3 noninferiority trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of SUL-DUR compared with colistin in patients with serious infections from carbapenem-resistant ABC (CRAB). The design of this phase 3 trial was in accordance with the FDA guidance for industry on antibacterial therapies for patients with an unmet medical need for the treatment of serious bacterial diseases. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 28 days. There were 207 patients recruited from 95 clinical sites in 17 countries. All patients had to have an infection caused by ABC. The trial was conducted in 2 parts: part A was a randomized, comparative study that evaluated SUL-DUR versus colistin in patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or BSIs, and part B was an open-label study that included SUL-DUR for patients with infections caused by ABC strains with resistance to colistin or polymyxin B, or patients who had otherwise failed colistin or polymyxin B therapy. All patients received imipenem/cilastin background therapy in parts A and B to ensure coverage of possible polymicrobial infections. Part A was the primary safety and efficacy analysis population and part B provided additional safety and supportive efficacy data in patients with Acinetobacter infections that may have been ineligible for part A.

Sulbactam was initially developed by Pfizer as a sulfone β-lactamase inhibitor. Sulbactam was also found to be a cell wall synthesis inhibitor that blocks essential PBPs in Acinetobacter spp. and a small number of other Gram-negatives (Neisseria spp.), leading to cell death. Usually coformulated with ampicillin, sulbactam is commonly used in combination with other antibiotics against CRAB. These include: (1) polymyxin-B-meropenem-sulbactam; (2) polymyxin-B-meropenem-ampicillin-sulbactam; (3) colistin-doripenem-sulbactam; (4) colistin-sulbactam; (5) polymyxin-B-sulbactam; (6) polymyxin-B-sulbactam-meropenem; (7) polymyxin-B-ampicillin-sulbactam-meropenem; and (8) and colistin-sulbactam-doripenem. Wang et al. demonstrated that the higher the ratio of sulbactam, the more potent in vitro antimicrobial activity of imipenem-sulbactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoperazone-sulbactam combinations against A. baumannii. Furthermore, cefoperazone-sulbactam at a combination of 1:3 showed the highest in vitro activity among all sulbactam-based combinations and had superior activity to most comparator agents.

Acinetobacter species — agent selection rationale and avoidance of tigecycline: The evidence suggests that the carbapenems (including imipenem), ampicillin-sulbactam, and colistin are equally effective at treating Acinetobacter species that are determined by antimicrobial sensitivity testing to be sensitive to those agents, and the panel agreed that carbapenems and ampicillin-sulbactam are preferred due to fewer side effects, whereas colistin should be reserved for species sensitive only to colistin due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. The recommendation to use colistin to treat Acinetobacter species that are sensitive only to colistin was strong despite the low quality of evidence because, for such patients, there are no other therapeutic options, so colistin therapy may be lifesaving. In contrast, adjunctive rifampicin did not improve outcomes and was not recommended because its burdens, costs, and risks clearly exceed the benefits. The evidence synthesis indicated that the current label dose of tigecycline worsened clinical outcomes compared with several other therapies, and the panel's strong recommendation against tigecycline despite low-quality evidence is intended to emphasize the importance of avoiding potentially harmful therapies when alternatives exist.

In-vitro activity of sulbactam-durlobactam

Multiple investigations have evaluated the in-vitro efficacy of SUL-DUR against clinical isolates of the Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus (ABC) complex, particularly those exhibiting carbapenem resistance. In an extensive international study, SUL-DUR in-vitro activity was tested in 5032 ABC isolates from different specimens collected from 33 countries between 2016 and 2021 across Europe (42.1%), North America (29.9%), Asia/South Pacific (13.6%), Latin America (12.6%), and the Middle East (1.7%). Approximately 80% of the isolates analyzed were identified as A. baumannii, most derived from respiratory tract (54.3%), bloodstream (20.2%) and urinary tract infections (16.5%). When durlobactam was added to sulbactam at a fixed concentration of 4 μg/ml, the MIC 90 was reduced dramatically dropping from 64 μg/ml (sulbactam alone) to 2 μg/ml for the combination. Applying the FDA susceptibility breakpoint of ≤ 4 μg/ml, 98.3% of isolates were classified as susceptible to SUL-DUR. Moreover, the combination retained high efficacy across challenging resistance phenotypes, including carbapenem-resistant, colistin-resistant, and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains with over 96% of isolates in these subsets exhibiting MIC values within the susceptible range.

In a second large trial including 329 patients with drug-resistant A. baumannii bloodstream infections or pneumonia, patients received colistin alone or colistin plus meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a 30-minute infusion), and the 28-day mortality was 46% vs 42% in the monotherapy versus combination arms. In a randomized trial of critically ill patients given colistin alone versus colistin plus rifampicin, there was no difference in 30-day mortality with 43% mortality in both study arms; another rifampin trial in CRAB pneumonia (n = 43) found in-hospital mortality 73% versus 62%, not statistically significant, and a third study in nine patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii found no difference in 30-day mortality (20% vs 33%). A fosfomycin trial randomized 94 patients to colistin alone versus colistin with fosfomycin with 28-day mortality 57% versus 47%, although IV fosfomycin is not currently available in the United States. A sulbactam trial in 39 CRAB pneumonia patients randomized colistin monotherapy versus colistin plus high-dose sulbactam (total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component) reported clinical improvement by day five in 16% versus 70% and 28-day mortality 63% versus 50%; investigators were unblinded and patients could transition to other antibiotics after day five, limiting accurate comparison of failure or mortality.

SULBACTAM OR BUST FOR TREATMENT OF INVASIVE CRAB INFECTIONS?

A compelling case for the use of ampicillin-sulbactam can be made from the available evidence. This case hinges upon the safety profile of high-dose β-lactams and the unique activity of sulbactam against CRAB. Sulbactam targets and saturates PBP1a, PBP1b, and PBP3 in A. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. Its utility, however, is dependent upon achieving PD targets for sulbactam with the commercially available 2:1 formulation of ampicillin-sulbactam (2 g of ampicillin, 1 g of sulbactam). Like other β-lactams, the time free sulbactam concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (f T > MIC) is the driver of efficacy in murine infection models; however, drug exposures vary widely across critically ill patients. Using a target of 60% f T > MIC for patients with a creatinine clearance ranging between 90 and 120 mL/minute, sulbactam doses of 1 g every 6 hours or 2 g every 8 hours as a 4-hour prolonged infusion are needed to achieve a more than 90% probability of target attainment when MICs are less than 4 mg/L. In the more likely event that sulbactam MICs are 16 mg/L or greater, dosing regimens equivalent to 9 g/day of sulbactam are needed and have been shown to be safe in patients. This directly translates to ampicillin-sulbactam dosing regimens of 9 g every 8 hours as a prolonged 4-hour infusion or 27 g as a continuous infusion. Recently, an alternative target of 25% f T > MIC has been associated with 1-log killing in a murine neutropenic lung infection model. Using this target, sulbactam doses of 1 g every 4 hours are needed to achieve more than 90% target attainment for MICs up to 8 mg/L. These data provide support for an ampicillin-sulbactam regimen of 3 g every 4 hours when isolates test susceptible or intermediate to ampicillin-sulbactam. For isolates testing resistant (MIC ≥ 16 mg/L), however, ampicillin-sulbactam optimized regimens of 9 g every 8 hours administered as a 4-hour infusion are needed to achieve PK-PD targets. The importance of sulbactam dose optimization cannot be understated given that most clinical isolates of CRAB test non-susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam when applying Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria. When optimized doses are used, ampicillin-sulbactam eradicates CRAB in hollow-fiber infection models, and the frequency of spontaneous sulbactam resistance selection appears to be low.

### Current control and treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections [^117PZKFo]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

Institutional outbreaks caused by Acinetobacter baumannii strains that have acquired multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance constitute a growing public-health problem. Because of complex epidemiology, infection control of these outbreaks is difficult to attain. Identification of potential common sources of an outbreak, through surveillance cultures and epidemiological typing studies, can aid in the implementation of specific control measures. Adherence to a series of infection control methods including strict environmental cleaning, effective sterilisation of reusable medical equipment, attention to proper hand hygiene practices, and use of contact precautions, together with appropriate administrative guidance and support, are required for the containment of an outbreak. Effective antibiotic treatment of A baumannii infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections, is also of paramount importance. Carbapenems have long been regarded as the agents of choice, but resistance rates have risen substantially in some areas. Sulbactam has been successfully used in the treatment of serious A baumannii infections; however, the activity of this agent against carbapenem-resistant isolates is decreasing. Polymyxins show reliable antimicrobial activity against A baumannii isolates. Available clinical reports, although consisting of small-sized studies, support their effectiveness and mitigate previous concerns for toxicity. Minocycline, and particularly its derivative, tigecycline, have shown high antimicrobial activity against A baumannii, though relevant clinical evidence is still scarce. Several issues regarding the optimum therapeutic choices for multidrug-resistant A baumannii infections need to be clarified by future research.

IN VITRO ACTIVITY OF SULBACTAM-DURLOBACTAM AGAINST CONTEMPORARY ISOLATES OF THE ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII–CALCOACETICUS COMPLEX

Several reports describe the in vitro antibacterial activity of sulbactam-durlobactam and comparator antibacterial agents against contemporary clinical isolates of the Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus complex (ABC). ABC is a closely related group of bacterial species that are often hard to differentiate from one another and are comprised of several species including A. baumannii, A. calcoaceticus, A. nosocomialis, and A. pittii. The largest study to date evaluated 5032 ABC isolates collected between 2016 and 2021 from community- and hospital-associated infections in 33 countries across Asia/South Pacific (13.6%), Europe (42.1%), Latin America (12.6%), the Middle East (Israel only) (1.7%), and North America (United States only) (29.9%). Since A. baumannii is the ABC species most often associated with nosocomial outbreaks and high levels of antibacterial resistance, 80.2% of the isolates selected for this study were A. baumannii, followed by 12.7% A. pittii, 5.9% A. nosocomialis, and 1.1% A. calcoaceticus. Isolates were collected from 5 common infection sources: respiratory tract (54.3%), bloodstream (20.2%), urinary tract (16.5%), skin and soft tissue (4.5%), and intra-abdominal (4.3%). These distributions of isolates across species, geographic regions, and infection types were consistent for all 6 years of the study. Against all 5032 ABC isolates, the addition of durlobactam to sulbactam lowered the MIC 90 by 32-fold, compared to that of sulbactam alone, from 64 µg/mL to 2 µg/mL (Table 2).

The study Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia was published by Chutchawan Ungthammakhun and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Int J Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Hospital-acquired pneumonia, Ventilator-associated pneumonia and Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections. In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the trial question was: what is the effect of addition of colistin to high-dose sulbactam in patients with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia? In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the population was: 138 patients (40 female, 98 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients diagnosed with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia. The key exclusion criteria were > 1 pathogenic organism isolated from sputum or infection with colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia; previous colistin treatment lasting over 5 days; preexisting infections undergoing treatment at the time of study enrolment; co-infections affecting organs other than the lungs; pregnancy; allergy to colistin or sulbactam. In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the interventions were: n = 69 high-dose sulbactam plus colistin (sulbactam 12 g/day plus colistin for 7 days) n = 69 low-dose sulbactam plus colistin (sulbactam 9 g/day plus colistin for 7 days). In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at day 28 (47.8% vs. 59.4%; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.87). In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in microbiological cure rate at day 7 (89.4% vs. 73.2%; AD 16.2%, 95% CI 2.53 to 29.87) No significant difference in the rate of successful cessation of mechanical ventilation within 28 days (40.9% vs. 25%; HR 1.46, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.71) No significant difference in the rate of discharge from hospital within 28 days (13% vs. 10.1%; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.99). In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in AKI and diarrhea. significant difference in adverse events (31.9% vs. 50.7%). In the Colistin/sulbactam for CRAB pneumonia study, the conclusion was: in adult patients diagnosed with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia, high-dose sulbactam plus colistin was superior to low-dose sulbactam plus colistin with respect to death at day 28.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Microbiology: The sulfonamides are bacteriostatic agents and the spectrum of activity is similar for all. Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with aminobenzoic acid through competitive inhibition of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Resistant strains have altered dihydropteroate synthetase with reduced affinity for sulfonamides or produce increased quantities of aminobenzoic acid.

Topically applied sulfonamides are considered active against susceptible strains of the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus (viridans group), Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella species, and Enterobacter species.

Topically applied sulfonamides do not provide adequate coverage against Neisseria species, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A significant percentage of staphylococcal isolates are completely resistant to sulfa drugs.

### Critical analysis of antibacterial agents in clinical development [^114LBgYT]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

The antibacterial agents currently in clinical development are predominantly derivatives of well-established antibiotic classes and were selected to address the class-specific resistance mechanisms and determinants that were known at the time of their discovery. Many of these agents aim to target the antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens listed by the WHO, including Gram-negative bacteria in the critical priority category, such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Enterobacterales. Although some current compounds in the pipeline have exhibited increased susceptibility rates in surveillance studies that depend on geography, pre-existing cross-resistance both within and across antibacterial classes limits the activity of many of the new agents against the most extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative pathogens. In particular, cross-resistance to unrelated classes may occur by co-selection of resistant strains, thus leading to the rapid emergence and subsequent spread of resistance. There is a continued need for innovation and new-class antibacterial agents in order to provide effective therapeutic options against infections specifically caused by XDR and PDR Gram-negative bacteria.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to definitive antibiotic therapy (Acinetobacter species), ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering either a carbapenem or ampicillin/sulbactam, if the isolate is susceptible to these agents, as definitive antibiotic therapy in patients with HAP due to Acinetobacter species.

Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination currently in development for the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Although sulbactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor of a subset of Ambler class A enzymes, it also demonstrates intrinsic antibacterial activity against a limited number of bacterial species, including Acinetobacter, and has been used effectively in the treatment of susceptible Acinetobacter-associated infections. Increasing prevalence of β-lactamase-mediated resistance, however, has eroded the effectiveness of sulbactam in the treatment of this pathogen. Durlobactam is a rationally designed β-lactamase inhibitor within the diazabicyclooctane (DBO) class. The compound demonstrates a broad spectrum of inhibition of serine β-lactamase activity with particularly potent activity against class D enzymes, an attribute which differentiates it from other DBO inhibitors. When combined with sulbactam, durlobactam effectively restores the susceptibility of resistant isolates through β-lactamase inhibition. The present review describes the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship associated with the activity of sulbactam and durlobactam established in nonclinical infection models with MDR Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. This information aids in the determination of PK/PD targets for efficacy, which can be used to forecast efficacious dose regimens of the combination in humans.

### Task force on management and prevention of Acinetobacter baumannii infections in the ICU [^112U4Her]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acinetobacter baumannii constitutes a dreadful problem in many ICUs worldwide. The very limited therapeutic options available for these organisms are a matter of great concern. No specific guidelines exist addressing the prevention and management of A. baumannii infections in the critical care setting.

Methods

Clinical microbiologists, infectious disease specialists and intensive care physicians were invited by the Chair of the Infection Section of the ESICM to participate in a multidisciplinary expert panel. After the selection of clinically relevant questions, this document provides recommendations about the use of microbiological techniques for identification of A. baumannii in clinical laboratories, antibiotic therapy for severe infections and recommendations to control this pathogen in outbreaks and endemic situations. Evidence supporting each statement was graded according to the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Diseases (ESCMID) grading system.

Results

Empirical coverage of A. baumannii is recommended in severe infections (severe sepsis or septic shock) occurring during an A. baumannii outbreak, in an endemic setting, or in a previously colonized patient. For these cases, a polymyxin is suggested as part of the empirical treatment in cases of a high suspicion of a carbapenem-resistant (CR) A. baumannii strain. An institutional program including staff education, promotion of hand hygiene, strict contact and isolation precautions, environmental cleaning, targeted active surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship should be instituted and maintained to combat outbreaks and endemic situations.

Conclusions

Specific recommendations about prevention and management of A. baumannii infections in the ICU were elaborated by this multidisciplinary panel. The paucity of randomized controlled trials is noteworthy, so these recommendations are mainly based on observational studies and pharmacodynamics modeling.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^114fXKJS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence in support of dose-optimized ampicillin-sulbactam for the treatment of CRAB infections has been mounting over the past 2 decades. The vast majority of clinical data, however, have come from observational studies rather than rigorously controlled randomized trials. As a result, the data are highly heterogeneous and ampicillin-sulbactam dosing regimens vary significantly across studies. In an effort to elucidate important differences across studies, several meta-analyses have been undertaken comparing sulbactam-based combinations with other combinations. The most recent network meta-analysis and systematic review included 7 randomized clinical trials and 11 observational studies to evaluate endpoints of clinical improvement, clinical cure, microbiologic eradication, and all-cause mortality. The investigators found that sulbactam (≥ 6 g/day) plus another active antibiotic (either levofloxacin or tigecycline) resulted in higher rates of clinical improvement when compared with colistin alone, colistin plus a carbapenem, or colistin with another active agent (relative risk [RR] = 2.99 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–8.24], 3.12 [1.14–8.60], and 3.06 [1.13–8.29], respectively); however, no regimen was associated with significant improvements in survival. An earlier Bayesian network meta-analysis of 23 studies across 2118 patients compared 15 treatment regimens for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. The analysis showed that sulbactam (3–8 g/day) and high-dose sulbactam (≥ 9 g/day) as monotherapy resulted in the highest probability of reducing mortality when compared with other treatments; however, the combination of sulbactam plus colistin ranked as the lowest. In the same study, sulbactam was superior to colistin monotherapy for reducing all-cause mortality by Bayesian posterior probability estimates (odds ratio [OR] = .27; 95% CI:.06–.91), but high-dose sulbactam (OR = .56; 95% CI:.09–3.17) and sulbactam plus colistin (OR = 2.58; 95% CI:.71–9.88) were not. A third network meta-analysis found that colistin-based combinations were associated with lower all-cause mortality than sulbactam-based combinations. These conflicting results add to the mystery of defining the best treatment options against CRAB, particularly when comparing observational studies that do not have standardized methods or standardized dosing of colistin or sulbactam. Thus, some reliance is needed upon individual studies where standardized approaches are used. In an interim analysis of 23 patients randomized to receive colistin plus levofloxacin (n = 11) or continuous infusion ampicillin-sulbactam (24 g daily; equivalent to 8 g of sulbactam) plus levofloxacin (n = 12) for CRAB pneumonia, significantly higher rates of clinical cure (83% vs 27%; p = 0.007) and lower rates of 28-day mortality (42% vs 82%; p = 0.04) were identified among patients randomized to receive ampicillin-sulbactam. Numerically lower rates of death (17% vs 38%) were also reported among 28 patients randomized to continuous infusion ampicillin-sulbactam or colistin (both administered with inhaled colistin) for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter pneumonia.

### Can pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles Be applied to the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter? [^113moi6p]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss treatment options that can be used for treatment of Acinetobac/erinfections.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-November 2010) was conducted to identify English-language literature on pharmacotherapy of Acinetobacter and the bibliographies of pertinent articles. Programs and abstracts from infectious diseases meetings were also searched. Search terms included Acinetobacter, multidrug resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, Monte Carlo simulation, nosocomial pneumonia, carbapenems, polymyxins, sulbactam, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, tigecycline, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones.

Data Selection and Data Extraction

All articles were critically evaluated and all pertinent information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter, defined as resistance to 3 or more antimicrobial classes, has increased over the past decade. The incidence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter is also increasing, leading to an increased use of dose optimization techniques and/or alternative antimicrobials, which is driven by local susceptibility patterns. However, Acinetobacter infections that are resistant to all commercially available antibiotics have been reported. General principles are available to guide dose optimization of aminoglycosides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tigecycline for infections due to gram-negative pathogens. Unfortunately, data specific to patients with Acinetobacter infections are limited. Recent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information has shed light on colistin dosing. The dilemma with colistin is its concentration-dependent killing, which makes once-daily dosing seem like an attractive option, but its short postantibiotic effect limits a clinician's ability to extend the dosing interval. Localized delivery of antimicrobials is also an attractive option due to the ability to increase drug concentration at the infection site while minimizing systemic adverse events, but more data are needed regarding this approach.

Conclusions

Increased reliance on dosage optimization, combination therapy, and localized delivery of antimicrobials are methods to pursue positive clinical outcomes in MDR Acinetobacter infections since novel antimicrobials will not be available for several years. Well-designed clinical trials with MDR Acinetobacter are needed to define the best treatment options for these patients.

PREFERRED APPROACHES FOR TREATMENT OF INVASIVE CRAB INFECTIONS

For nearly 2 decades clinicians have relied heavily on anecdotes and observations to guide treatment selection for CRAB infections. The field is now benefiting from results of several recent randomized clinical trials (Figure 1), contemporary PK-PD studies, and the development of novel antibiotics. The general paradigm of combination therapy for all patients remains; however, we are nearing a point where effective, colistin-sparing regimens can be feasibly constructed. Equally as important, optimized dosing regimens for ampicillin-sulbactam, polymyxin B, and tigecycline have been defined, as have proposed updates to modernize susceptibility breakpoints against Acinetobacter spp. Cefiderocol may not be the paradigm-shifting agent against CRAB that many had once hoped for, but in combination, it offers a well-tolerated, in vitro active β-lactam agent that has been associated with encouraging real-world clinical use in a limited number of patients. The most promising data for patients with CRAB infections have been reported with sulbactam-durlobactam in a randomized clinical trial. Other agents demonstrating in vitro activity against CRAB are currently in preclinical development and have been reviewed previously. Taken together, the tide is slowly, but surely shifting towards improved management of CRAB infections.

In most scenarios moving forward, treatment of CRAB infections should be tailored around a sulbactam backbone, either with the potent β-lactamase inhibitor durlobactam (if it becomes FDA-approved) or in combination with 1 or more in vitro active antibiotics. Defining in vitro activity should not solely rely upon susceptibility breakpoints, but rather an advanced understanding of antimicrobial PK-PD targets and drug exposures at the site of infection. For example, minocycline may be categorized as susceptible based on the current CLSI breakpoint (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L), but is unlikely to achieve exposure targets when MICs are > 1 mg/L. Moreover, proposed clinical breakpoints for cefiderocol vary by organization and have not been established for sulbactam or tigecycline. In fact, most CRAB isolates will be categorized as non-susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, which should not deter use, but rather promote dose optimization with at least 9 g/day of sulbactam. Taking these factors into consideration, individualized treatment regimens will need to be constructed based on susceptibility testing results, the site of infection, and knowledge of the local epidemiology for CRAB.

### Acinetobacter pneumonia: improving outcomes with early identification and appropriate therapy [^1176SLqA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, Acinetobacter distinguishes itself as one of the most resistant Gram-negative bacteria responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. New solutions are needed to combat the detrimental effects of increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance. Using empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients deemed at risk for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens may protect against attributable mortality, but this temporary solution furthers the risk of antimicrobial resistance. In this article we will review relevant strategies to aid with early identification and appropriate treatment of Acinetobacter pneumonia while preserving antibiotic susceptibility.

EFFICACY OF SULBACTAM-DURLOBACTAM IN PRECLINICAL MODELS OF A. BAUMANNII INFECTION

Sulbactam-durlobactam has shown robust in vivo efficacy in multiple preclinical models of A. baumannii infection. The MDR and XDR isolates tested in these models had established drug resistance phenotypes (specifically class D β-lactamase production), with sulbactam-durlobactam MIC values ranging from 0.5 to 4 µg/mL. Treatment with sulbactam-durlobactam resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in XDR A. baumannii bacterial counts in both neutropenic mouse thigh abscess and pneumonia infection models, resulting in > 1-log reduction of bacterial burden compared to the initial inoculum and multiple logs as compared to the growth control.

### Sulfadiazine [^113AbAhc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The systemic sulfonamides are bacteriostatic agents having a similar spectrum of activity. Sulfonamides competitively inhibit bacterial synthesis of folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) from aminobenzoic acid. Resistant strains are capable of utilizing folic acid precursors or preformed folic acid.

Sulfonamides exist in the blood in 3 forms – free, conjugated (acetylated and possibly others) and protein bound. The free form is considered to be the therapeutically active one.

Sulfadiazine given orally is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After a single 2 g oral dose, a peak of 6.04 mg/100 mL is reached in 4 hours; of this, 4.65 mg/100 mL is free drug.

When a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight is given initially and followed by 50 mg/kg every 6 hours, blood levels of free sulfadiazine are about 7 mg/100mL. Protein binding is 38% to 48%. Sulfadiazine diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid; free drug reaches 32% to 65% of blood levels and total drug 40% to 60%.

Sulfadiazine is excreted largely in the urine, where concentrations are 10 to 25 times greater than serum levels. Approximately 10% of a single oral dose is excreted in the first 6 hours, 50% within 24 hours and 60% to 85% in 48 to 72 hours. Of the amount excreted in the urine, 15% to 40% is in the acetyl form.

Administer high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (total daily dose of 9 g of the sulbactam component) in combination with at least one other agent (polymyxin B, minocycline > tigecycline, or cefiderocol) as an alternative option if sulbactam/durlobactam is not available.

The Example of Sulbactam/Durlobactam

Infections caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC) constitute an area of high unmet medical need. They are associated with significant mortality rates, ranging from 38% to 76%; nosocomial pneumonia is the most common infection type. In 2020 in the United States, an estimated 7,500 cases of CR ABC infection occurred, resulting in 700 deaths. Therapies to treat CR ABC infections are limited because of multiple resistance mechanisms demonstrated by A. baumannii. In patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) caused by a CR pathogen that is sensitive only to polymyxins, treatment with intravenous polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B) is an option. However, current treatment guidelines acknowledge that no clear standard-of-care regimen exists for the treatment of CR ABC infections.

XACDURO (Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics, Inc.) is a combination of sulbactam and durlobactam that is administered intravenously. Sulbactam is an Ambler class A β-lactamase inhibitor; however, against A. baumannii, sulbactam exerts its effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, thereby inhibiting cell-wall biosynthesis. An increasing number of isolates possess > 1 β-lactamases that inactivate sulbactam. Durlobactam is a novel non–β‐lactam β‐lactamase inhibitor inactivating several serine β‐lactamases expressed by Acinetobacter that degrade sulbactam including those of Ambler classes A, C, and D. Durlobactam does not have intrinsic antibacterial activity against A. baumannii.

Approval of sulbactam/durlobactam relied primarily on a single phase 3, randomized, independent assessor–blinded, active-controlled noninferiority study in adults with HABP or VABP caused by CR ABC in which sulbactam/durlobactam was compared with colistin. A noninferiority margin of 20% was used in the clinical trial. Both treatment arms also received imipenem/cilastatin as background therapy for potential HABP/VABP pathogens other than CR ABC. The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was 28-day all-cause mortality.

### Redesigning β-lactams to combat resistance: summary and conclusions [^116GKZZs]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

The relentless emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance warrant an increased awareness of the problem and improved coordination and standardisation of surveillance systems, as well as resistance control strategies. Moreover, this underscores the urgent need for new antibiotics active against the emerging resistant pathogens. Ceftobiprole is a new beta-lactam molecule engineered for bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci that also exhibits an extended broad spectrum of activity covering the most clinically important Gram-positive (methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, penicillin-susceptible and -resistant pneumococci, other streptococci and ampicillin-susceptible enterococci) and Gram-negative (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. Haemophilus spp. and Moraxella spp.) pathogens. Results from studies with experimental infections and from clinical trials support a role for ceftobiprole in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and suggest a potential role for this drug in treating other types of serious infection caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.

### Antibiotic susceptibility signatures identify potential antimicrobial targets in the Acinetobacter baumannii cell envelope [^113h3NwL]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control each rank restriction of Acinetobacter baumannii as among the most critical targets for developing new antimicrobials –. This Gram-negative rod causes drug-resistant nosocomial diseases in the critically ill, commonly manifesting as bloodstream infections and ventillator-associated pneumonia. Resistance to an extensive range of antibiotics, including formerly last-resort agents such as carbapenems, is now widespread among A. baumannii isolates, with the emergence of strains resistant to all available antibiotics now documented. Few therapeutic options remain to control this threat.

A better understanding of what makes A. baumannii so difficult to treat is critical for improved strategies that attack the pathogen. The evolution of drug resistance in A. baumannii in large part is due to acquisition of inactivating enzymes or drug target mutations blocking antibiotic lethal action. These acquired alterations, which vary across isolates, act in concert with conserved mechanisms tightly linked to reduced drug penetration, including a low-permeability cell envelope and upregulation of efflux pumps. Insight into the intrinsic envelope-level defenses has the potential to inform ways to enhance antibiotic killing across diverse isolates.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^1159n2GT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Preliminary results from a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of sulbactam-durlobactam for the treatment of CRAB infections have been reported. Patients with CRAB infections were randomized to receive sulbactam-durlobactam plus imipenem-cilastatin or the combination of colistin plus imipenem-cilastatin. Imipenem-cilastatin was added to sulbactam-durlobactam to expand coverage beyond CRAB for concomitant gram-negative pathogens. Overall, 181 patients were randomized from 95 trial sites across 17 countries; 128 patients were included in the microbiologic intent-to-treat analysis. Among this population, all but 3 patients had pneumonia, 69% (88/128) were in the ICU at the time of randomization, and mean APACHE-II scores ranged from 16 to 17 across study arms. Sulbactam-durlobactam met the primary noninferiority endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality compared with colistin. Most notably, however, the 28-day mortality rates showed a trend towards lower mortality among patients who received sulbactam-durlobactam (19% [12/63]) compared with colistin (32% [20/62]) (95% CI: –30.0% to 3.5%). At the test-of-cure visit, clinical cure was 62% and 40% for patients who received sulbactam-durlobactam and colistin, respectively (95% CI: 2.9–40.3%). In a parallel, open-label arm for patients who had either failed colistin or were infected by colistin-resistant CRAB, another 28 patients received sulbactam-durlobactam. In this arm, 61% (17/28) had bacteremia and the overall mortality was 18% (5/28) — results in line with those from the main cohort. The study also met its primary safety objective showing a significant reduction in nephrotoxicity among patients who received at least 1 dose of sulbactam-durlobactam or colistin, reporting rates of 13% (12/91) and 38% (32/85), respectively (P = 0.0002). This study provides an exciting glimpse into the future of improving the outcomes of patients with CRAB infections should the agent ultimately be approved by the FDA. It should be noted, however, that full study results have not yet been published and the findings have not undergone peer review. Future studies are needed to determine the relative contribution, if any, of imipenem-cilastatin to the observed efficacy of sulbactam-durlobactam for the treatment of CRAB infections. To this end, alternative agents have been used successfully in combination with sulbactam-durlobactam to treat invasive CRAB infections through an expanded access program.

### Targeting Acinetobacter baumannii resistance-nodulation-division efflux pump transcriptional regulators to combat antimicrobial resistance [^111oJreF]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Regulation of AdeFGH

A LysR-type regulator, AdeL, serves as the local transcriptional controller of AdeFGH(Fig. 1). This family of regulators is the most abundant in bacteria and governs crucial pathways including amino acid biosynthesis, oxidative stress response, ion transport, and antibiotic resistance. The regulator — which can act as an activator or repressor in response to an effector — usually functions as a homotetramer, each subunit containing a well-conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain at the N-terminus connected to an effector-binding domain.

AdeFGH is normally maintained at low levels in A. baumannii, and is seemingly a minor contributor to the inherent antibiotic resistance of this microbe. Even though AdeFGH and AdeL are not found ubiquitously in Acinetobacter species, most infection-causing strains express them. Indeed, clinical A. baumannii isolates resistant to tigecycline and fluoroquinolones have been shown to overexpress AdeFGH. Under inducing conditions in the laboratory, AdeFGH has been observed to efflux of a range of antimicrobial substrates such as chloramphenicol, clindamycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and nalidixic acid.

AdeL is a repressor of adeFGH. Studies have shown that mutations in the C-terminus of AdeL created by selective pressure in vitro increased adeFGH expression up to 600-fold. Similarly, other works have suggested that mutations in the predicted ligand and DNA binding domains may activate constitutive adeFGH expression. The exact functional mechanism of these mutations is unknown as studies have yet to map the binding site of AdeL or determine its putative effectors.

AdeFGH overexpression is rarely observed during in vitro studies using basal media, even under the pressure of known substrates, leading to the idea that physiological substrates may act as AdeL effectors. For example, subinhibitory concentrations of the known substrate tigecycline have been shown to downregulate AdeFGHwhile pleural fluid and human serum albumin upregulated expression of the pump operon. But note that host physiological substrates could be involved in an as yet unknown regulatory mechanism of AdeFGH. Unlike the previously discussed RND efflux pumps, AdeFGH has been shown to be influenced by only one global regulator, SoxR, which downregulates adeFGH expression.

In addition, minocycline intravenous holds a US Food and Drug Administration indication for treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter. There is an accumulating amount of literature reporting successful use of minocycline intravenous for treatment of serious MDR Acinetobacter infections, particularly for nosocomial pneumonia. These results, coupled with the generally favorable tolerability of minocycline intravenous, support its use as a viable therapeutic option for treatment of MDR Acinetobacter infections.

In Vitro Activity of Sulbactam-durlobactam Against Phenotypically Antibiotic-Nonsusceptible Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus Complex Clinical Isolates Collected Globally From 2016 to 2021

In addition to the 6-year global surveillance study, the in vitro activity of sulbactam-durlobactam was evaluated in a surveillance of 982 A. baumannii clinical isolates collected during 2016–2018 from 22 sites distributed across mainland China. Isolates were mostly from hospital-associated infection types (89.5%) and 72.8% were from lower respiratory tract, 17.3% from intra-abdominal, 6.0% from urinary tract, 3.6% from skin and soft tissue, and 0.3% from bloodstream infections. For these isolates, susceptibility was low for levofloxacin (14%), imipenem (15.2%), and amikacin (26.2%). The MIC 50 and MIC 90 values of 1 and 2 µg/ml, respectively, for sulbactam-durlobactam, were 32-fold lower than those observed for sulbactam alone. This level of activity was consistent across Chinese sites and most infection types; however, the urinary tract isolates were more susceptible to sulbactam-durlobactam (MIC 50 and MIC 90 values of 0.5 and 1 µg/mL, respectively).

### Management of nonfermenting gram-negative infections: a critique of the guidelines [^113a7dPc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the present narrative review, we discuss the characteristics and differences between the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines in terms on their recommendations/suggestions for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections.

Recent Findings

Treatment of severe infections caused by nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria (NF-GNB) is posing both novel hopes and novel challenges to physicians worldwide, and both the IDSA and the ESCMID have recently updated/released their guidelines or guidance documents, based on different philosophies and providing recommendations for the treatment of NF-GNB infections. In order to correctly exploit recent advances in the treatment of such infections, IDSA and ESCMID approaches should be viewed as complementary and evolving, and should not preclude further revision based on accumulating evidence on the use of novel β-lactams and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Summary

A joint consideration of both philosophies should leave the door opened for the wise use of novel agents, ultimately building precious experience on their use that could favorably influence future guidelines revisions.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^111fUZiJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (CRAB) remains one of the foremost public health challenges of the 21st century. Largely regarded as a top-priority pathogen globally for new antibiotic development, CRAB are notorious for their ability to survive in hospital environments, evade host immunity, acquire new antibiotic-resistance mechanisms, and defy therapeutic countermeasures. Unlike other antibiotic-resistant pathogens, no available treatments have been shown to substantially lower mortality or significantly improve the outcome of patients with invasive CRAB infections. As a result, 28-day mortality rates among patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials investigating CRAB therapeutics exceed 45% (Figure 1). These data underscore disproportionately increased rates of death associated with CRAB infections when compared with other carbapenem-resistant pathogens. Indeed, CRAB infections are the fourth-leading cause of death attributable to antimicrobial resistance globally.

Figure 1.
A brief timeline of noteworthy CRAB clinical trials. *Full results have not yet been published. Abbreviations: CR, carbapenem-resistant; CRAB, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex; MDR, multidrug-resistant; SUL-DUR, sulbactam-durlobactam; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia; XDR, extensively drug-resistant.

Beyond its public health relevance, assessment and management of individual patients from whom CRAB is isolated remains a major challenge to clinicians for several reasons. First, differentiating critically ill patients with respiratory colonization from those with acute infections is rarely intuitive, and is particularly difficult among patients with severe immunocompromise and other high-risk conditions. Accordingly, CRAB-directed treatment is often initiated in the face of diagnostic uncertainty. Second, the majority of CRAB infections are pneumonia, and rapid molecular tests that identify CRAB from respiratory specimens are not routinely used in regions where CRAB is highly prevalent. This results in delayed treatment of CRAB pneumonia that contributes to poor outcomes. Third, CRAB pneumonia requires optimization of antimicrobial dosing to achieve pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets within the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and lung parenchyma. Unfortunately, many of the available antimicrobial agents with in vitro activity against CRAB are limited by poor penetration into the lungs and dose-dependent toxicities (Table 1). Fourth, biofilm formation associated with CRAB infections is commonly associated with resistant phenotypes and enhanced virulence, highlighting the importance of removing indwelling devices contaminated with CRAB. Finally, clinical breakpoints to determine antibiotic susceptibility against CRAB isolates have either not been established, require revision, or vary across professional organizations.

### Global antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative pathogens and clinical need [^115zFczx]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has become a serious problem in many regions of the world as it may reduce the treatment options substantially. Carbapenem-resistance is a good marker for such situations and is most prevalent in Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas but also increasingly in Enterobacteriaceae, especially Klebsiella. This review gives a rough global picture highlighting the epicentres of resistance. The medical need for novel treatment options globally is undeniable even if many countries with good stewardship and infection control conditions are not highly affected. Antibiotic pipelines are encouraging, as new drugs in development reduce the resistance rate to individual pathogens. Despite some progress, efforts to discover and develop novel drugs that are not prone to cross-resistance to existing antibiotic classes should be intensified.

### Durlobactam, a broad-spectrum serine β-lactamase inhibitor, restores sulbactam activity against Acinetobacter species [^112x3ZTk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
In Vitro Activity of Sulbactam-durlobactam and Comparator Antibacterial Agents Against Global Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus Complex Clinical Isolates Collected From 2016 to 2021

Using the preliminary sulbactam-durlobactam breakpoint of 4 µg/mL, 98.3% of the isolates were susceptible to sulbactam-durlobactam (Figure 3). Conversely, more than half of these isolates were nonsusceptible to carbapenems (51.1% and 52.1% for imipenem and meropenem, respectively). The colistin and tigecycline MIC 90 values had similar potency to sulbactam-durlobactam; however, the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents often do not correlate with efficacy due to toxicities and poor pharmacokinetic properties.

Figure 3.
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution for sulbactam-durlobactam (SUL-DUR) and sulbactam (SUL) against 5032 Acinetobacter baumannii–calcoaceticus complex global isolates collected from 2016 to 2021.

The activity of sulbactam-durlobactam was consistent across the ABC species tested, despite large variations in carbapenem susceptibility (∼38% for A. baumannii isolates and ≥ 92% for the other species tested) (Table 2). The activity of sulbactam-durlobactam was also consistent across the geographical regions, with isolates from Europe having a MIC 90 value 1 doubling dilution higher compared to the entire set (4 µg/mL vs 2 µg/mL). Across each region, the percentage of isolates with a sulbactam-durlobactam MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL was > 95%. In addition, the potency of sulbactam-durlobactam was similar for each year (2016–2021) and different infection sources. Sulbactam-durlobactam was found to be active against phenotypically different resistant subsets, including carbapenem-nonsusceptible, colistin-resistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates, each with an MIC 50 of 1 or 2 µg/mL and an MIC 90 of 4 µg/mL (Table 3). The percentage of isolates with a sulbactam-durlobactam MIC ≤ 4 µg/mL was > 96% across these different antibiotic-resistant groups.

### Sulbactam and durlobactam (Xacduro) [^112rJ2DY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

XACDURO is a co-packaged product containing sulbactam, a beta-lactam antibacterial and beta lactamase inhibitor, and durlobactam, a beta lactamase inhibitor, indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. (1.1)

Limitations of Use:

XACDURO is not indicated for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by pathogens other than susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex. (1.1, 14)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XACDURO and other antibacterial drugs, XACDURO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1.2)

1.1 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP)

XACDURO is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex.

Limitations of Use

XACDURO is not indicated for the treatment of HABP/VABP caused by pathogens other than susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex [see Clinical Studies (14)].

1.2 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XACDURO and other antibacterial drugs, XACDURO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Carbapenem-nonsusceptible Acinetobacter baumannii, 8 US metropolitan areas, 2012–2015 [^113jyhdh]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Yearly adjusted incidence rates did not change significantly during 2013–2015 in the EIP surveillance catchment area. Although not always concordant with changes in incidence rates, the percentage of Acinetobacter spp. resistant to a carbapenem from healthcare-associated infections reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network decreased slightly from 2011 to 2014; in 2014, the percentage of Acinetobacter spp. nonsusceptible to a carbapenem was 50%, compared with 58% in 2011. By contrast, before 2012, multiple US reports documented increases in resistant Acinetobacter. In a small study of clinical isolates conducted in Detroit during 2003–2008, the total number of patients with A. baumannii increased from 1.7/1,000 patient days in 2003 to 3.7/1,000 patient days in 2008; among these same patients the percentage of Acinetobacter isolates that were susceptible to imipenem decreased from 99% in 2003 to 42% in 2008. In another US study of susceptibility results from hospital clinical microbiology laboratories contributing data to the Eurofins laboratory testing network across the United States, the percentage of A. baumannii isolates that were resistant to carbapenems increased from 21% in 2003–2005 to 48% in 2009–2012. The relatively small number of cases and relatively short interval in our evaluation preclude us from identifying a clear trend in disease; additional years of surveillance data are needed to clarify these trends and the factors contributing to resistance and incidence differences across geographic regions.

Antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing performed at local laboratories demonstrated high levels of resistance to other antimicrobial drugs in addition to carbapenems. Most isolates were also nonsusceptible to cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin/sulbactam, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Most remained susceptible to at least 1 aminoglycoside and, for the subset for which a result was available, to colistin and tigecycline. The 3 drug classes to which most isolates were susceptible can be associated with substantial toxicities or treatment failure and are generally considered second-line agents for treatment. Although we did not collect data on carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii infection treatment and were unable to determine the proportion of deaths attributable to Acinetobacter infection, the limited availability of drugs to which carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates were susceptible could have contributed to the overall death rate of 41% for cases for which carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii was isolated from a sterile site.

### Acinetobacter outbreaks, 1977–2000 [^112HU2wP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

This review of Acinetobacter outbreaks summarizes factors related to the presence and recognition of organism transmission and describes the implementation of control and prevention measures directed at limiting spread. Exogenous transmission of Acinetobacter should be considered when infections are endemic and when case rates increase. Increasing or new antimicrobial resistances in a collection of isolates also suggest transmission, and transmission can be definitively confirmed when isolates are found to be indistinguishable from or related to one another by a discriminatory genotyping test. An investigation for a common source should be conducted. When a common source cannot be found and eliminated, or once an endemically transmitted organism is established, containment or prevention efforts may require aggressive interventions, complex interventions, or both. Colonization at multiple sites, the relative ease of induction of antibiotic resistance in the organism following patient exposure to multiple drugs, and long-term environmental survival provide enhanced opportunities for the transmission of Acinetobacter between and among patients. New approaches and interventional trials are needed to define effective measures for the prevention and control of Acinobacter infections.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections — combination therapy rationale: The general approach is to administer combination therapy with at least 2 agents until an appropriate clinical response is observed, and it is generally suggested that at least 1 agent be sulbactam-based; when high-dose sulbactam is used, combination therapy is suggested even though only 1 of 7 clinical trials showed improved clinical outcomes, and the only trial demonstrating benefit included high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam as the combination arm; when sulbactam-durlobactam is unavailable, an alternative is high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam with a total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component as part of combination therapy; components to consider include polymyxin B, minocycline, and tigecycline, whereas fosfomycin and rifampin are not suggested; two large trials did not show benefit for high-dose extended-infusion carbapenem therapy with colistin, and meropenem or imipenemcilastatin are not suggested as routine components except when administered with sulbactam-durlobactam; nebulized antibiotics are not suggested as adjunctive therapy for CRAB pneumonia because of lack of benefit, distribution concerns, and potential respiratory complications such as bronchoconstriction.

### Sulbactam-durlobactam: a step forward in treating carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections [^111FMKmr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The ongoing spread of antimicrobial resistance is an existential threat to modern medicine and humankind itself. In 2019, approximately 4.95 million deaths worldwide were associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Of all the bacterial pathogens responsible for human infections, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is one of the most concerning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has labeled CRAB an "urgent threat", the highest level category. The increased mortality from CRAB infections and the limited treatment options that are currently available contribute to this concern. Indeed, most CRAB isolates are either extremely drug resistant (susceptible to only polymyxins, aminoglycosides, or tigecycline) or multidrug resistant, making treatment extremely challenging. Patients infected with CRAB have at least twice the risk of dying compared with patients with carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii strains. Most CRAB infections occur in hospitalized patients, particularly those admitted to intensive care units and who often have multiple medical comorbidities. However, a number of infections do occur in the community (Asia Pacific) and long-term acute care settings.

### A macromolecular approach to eradicate multidrug resistant bacterial infections while mitigating drug resistance onset [^116ED3qi]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

"ESKAPE" pathogens, including A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, are a coterie of bacteria that exhibit a high incidence of antibiotic resistance, and are common causes of hospital-acquired infections especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Over the past few decades, the emergence of polymyxins resistance in these pathogens has become increasingly prevalent. Despite tremendous efforts, the panacea for these recalcitrant infections has not been found. With no effective and safe treatments available, multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections are quickly morphing into a global healthcare threat. Polymyxins remain the last line treatment for these MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections although they are associated with nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, and are not active against Gram-positive bacteria or fungi. There is thus a dire need to develop novel antimicrobial compounds that have a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yet at the same time, are well tolerated with low propensity for resistance development.

Values and preferences: "These recommendations place a relatively higher value on avoiding potential adverse effects due to the use of combination therapy with rifampicin and colistin, over achieving an increased microbial eradication rate, as eradication rate was not associated with improved clinical outcome". Remarks: "Selection of an appropriate antibiotic for definitive (nonempiric) therapy requires antimicrobial susceptibility testing".

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^111LafAx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps the most compelling data in support of ampicillin-sulbactam come from an open-label, prospective randomized study in 2 Greek intensive care units (ICUs). In this study, 39 patients with CRAB pneumonia were randomized to receive colistin alone or colistin plus high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (6 g every 6 hours; equivalent to 8 g of sulbactam daily). To be included in the study, patients were required to be infected with colistin and ampicillin-sulbactam susceptible CRAB; ampicillin-sulbactam susceptibility was defined as an MIC of 8 mg/L or less. Clinical response was defined as an improvement in symptoms for at least 48 hours and was assessed by the unblinded treating physician. Initial clinical response was demonstrated in 16% (3/19) and 70% (14/20) of patients receiving colistin alone and colistin plus ampicillin-sulbactam, respectively (OR = 12.4; 95% CI: 2.6–59.3; p = 0.001). The treating clinician was allowed to change therapy if it was determined to be unsuccessful after the fourth day, resulting in changes for 16 patients in the colistin-alone arm and 3 changes in the combination arm of the study. Among those who initially received colistin alone, a favorable clinical response was observed in 38% (6/16) when ampicillin-sulbactam was added. Altogether, 28-day mortality rates did not differ between patients who received colistin alone (63%) or colistin plus ampicillin-sulbactam (50%) (P = 0.52). Given the open-label design and physician-assigned outcomes in the study, caution should be exercised in extrapolating the findings. Moreover, these data highlight a broader challenge of identifying effective treatment for CRAB in the setting of critical illness and high baseline mortality rates.

### Flash optimization of drug combinations for Acinetobacter baumannii with IDentif. AI-AMR [^114VeYZV]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging threat to global public health. Specifically, Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), one of the main pathogens driving the rise of nosocomial infections, is a Gram-negative bacillus that displays intrinsic resistance mechanisms and can also develop resistance by acquiring AMR genes from other bacteria. More importantly, it is resistant to nearly 90% of standard of care (SOC) antimicrobial treatments, resulting in unsatisfactory clinical outcomes and a high infection-associated mortality rate of over 30%. Currently, there is a growing challenge to sustainably develop novel antimicrobials in this ever-expanding arms race against AMR. Therefore, a sustainable workflow that properly manages healthcare resources to ultra-rapidly design optimal drug combinations for effective treatment is needed. In this study, the IDentif. AI-AMR platform was harnessed to pinpoint effective regimens against four A. baumannii clinical isolates from a pool of nine US FDA-approved drugs. Notably, IDentif. AI-pinpointed ampicillin-sulbactam/cefiderocol and cefiderocol/polymyxin B/rifampicin combinations were able to achieve 93.89 ± 5.95% and 92.23 ± 11.89% inhibition against the bacteria, respectively, and they may diversify the reservoir of treatment options for the indication. In addition, polymyxin B in combination with rifampicin exhibited broadly applicable efficacy and strong synergy across all tested clinical isolates, representing a potential treatment strategy for A. baumannii. IDentif. AI-pinpointed combinations may potentially serve as alternative treatment strategies for A. baumannii.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^113ioctR]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Ampicillin–sulbactam — role in empiric therapy for intra-abdominal infection (IAI): Based on clinical and microbiologic data, the task force concluded that other agents were preferable to ampicillin–sulbactam for the empiric treatment of patients with IAI, noting limited efficacy studies and low susceptibility of Escherichia coli. In the most recent SMART data, only 34% of hospital-associated strains and 45% of community-acquired strains of E. coli were susceptible to this agent, and one study since 2008 found ampicillin–sulbactam inferior to ertapenem. Although ampicillin–sulbactam does have some activity against A. baumannii and may have use in pathogen-directed therapy, the majority of Acinetobacter strains isolated from patients with IAI are not susceptible.

Purpose Of Review

Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are of great concern for hospitalized patients, especially with multidrug-resistant strains. This review focuses on recent data that may help us to understand the emergence, spread, and persistence of antibiotic resistance, and summarizes the optional treatment feasible for these resistant bacteria.

Recent Findings

Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii are increasingly causing nosocomial infections; multidrug-resistant clones are spreading into new geographic areas, and susceptible strains are acquiring resistance genes. New extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases are emerging, leading to pan-resistant strains. Current studies focus on the effect of antibiotics on gene expression in P. aeruginosa biofilms and their contribution to resistance to therapy. Treatment options for multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections are limited in most cases to carbapenems. Sulbactam is a treatment option for pan-resistant A. baumannii, and or renewed use of an old drug, colistin, is being entertained for pan-resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Immunotherapy is a promising new modality being explored. Prevention of emergence of resistance through combination therapy and pharmacokinetic strategies are studied.

Summary

The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii and their genetic potential to carry and transfer diverse antibiotic resistance determinants pose a major threat in hospitals. The complex interplay of clonal spread, persistence, transfer of resistance elements, and cell-cell interaction contribute to the difficulty in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant strains. In the absence of new antibiotic agents, new modalities of treatment should be developed.

### Navigating available treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infections [^111qg1aZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Agents demonstrating the highest rates of in vitro activity in rank order, include the polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B), tetracyclines (eravacycline, minocycline, tigecycline), and β-lactams (ampicillin-sulbactam, carbapenems). Novel β-lactams like cefiderocol and sulbactam-durlobactam show potent in vitro activity across diverse isolates; however, susceptibility breakpoints vary or have not yet been established, respectively. Shortcomings for all of these agents have been reviewed elsewhere, and are summarized in Table 1.

Combination therapy is generally preferred for invasive CRAB infections. The rationale for combination therapy is dependent upon the poor efficacy and considerable toxicities and/or PK limitations for each of the individual treatment options with anticipated in vitro activity. Supporting evidence stems from in vitro synergy studies of various combinations and its theoretical benefit in suppressing the emergence of further antibiotic resistance in CRAB, although supportive data are lacking to indicate that this benefit translates in vivo. Moreover, there is a general recognition that patients with invasive CRAB infections are susceptible to poor clinical outcomes. Thus, the potential benefits of antibiotic combination therapy seemingly outweigh the risks of potentially suboptimal treatment with a single agent. Indeed, both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) treatment guidance document and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) antimicrobial-resistance treatment guidelines suggest combination therapy with at least 2 in vitro active agents (when available) for severe CRAB infections.

This narrative review will focus on evidence-based solutions for key questions surrounding the management of invasive CRAB infections. The objective is to highlight antibiotic combinations with the most comprehensive or promising data, and not combinations unlikely to improve patient outcomes, such as colistin plus fosfomycin, colistin plus rifampin, and aminoglycoside-based combinations.

### Multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections: epidemiology and management [^11141kaN]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We present recent data about epidemiology of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital setting, major resistance mechanisms, and therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains.

Recent Findings

A. baumannii has emerged as a major cause of healthcare-associated infections. It commonly presents resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems. These strains are now ussually resistant to the rest of antipseudomonal beta-lactams and sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor with bactericide activity against A. baumannii. Rifampicin has demonstrated its effectiveness in animal models but can never be used in monotherapy because of the rapid development of resistance. Colistin, an old antibiotic, has re-emerged as a valid alternative given its excellent in-vitro activity. Numerous studies have confirmed its efficacy in serious infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia and nosocomial meningitis, with an acceptable safety profile. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for multidrug resistant A. baumannii, althogh more clinical data about its efficacy especially in pulmonary infections are required. The role of combination therapy or the use or colistin in alternative routes (nebulized or intrathecally) has not been established.

Summary

The optimal treatment for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii nosocomial infections has not been established. Carbapenems are the mainstay of treatment in susceptible isolates. Colistin and tigecycline retain good in-vitro activity and in many cases represent the only therapeutic options.

### Efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin for the treatment of patients with serious infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex: a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority clinical trial (ATTACK) [^112DCmPk]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Background

An urgent need exists for antibiotics to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC). Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant strains. In a phase 3, pathogen-specific, randomised controlled trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin as background therapy, in patients with serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC.

Methods

The ATTACK trial was done at 59 clinical sites in 16 countries. Adults aged 18 years or older with ABC-confirmed hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, ventilated pneumonia, or bloodstream infections were randomised 1:1 using a block size of four to sulbactam-durlobactam (1.0 g of each drug in combination over 3 h every 6 h) or colistin (2.5 mg/kg over 30 min every 12 h) for 7–14 days. All patients received imipenem-cilastatin (1.0 g of each drug in combination over 1 h every 6 h) as background therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC (the carbapenem-resistant ABC microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population). Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than +20%. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of nephrotoxicity assessed using modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease criteria measured by creatinine level or glomerular filtration rate through day 42. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03894046.

Findings

Between Sep 5, 2019, and July 26, 2021, 181 patients were randomly assigned to sulbactam-durlobactam or colistin (176 hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or ventilated pneumonia; and five bloodstream infections); 125 patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC isolates were included in the primary efficacy analysis. 28-day all-cause mortality was 12 (19%) of 63 in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 20 (32%) of 62 in the colistin group, a difference of -13.2% (95% CI -30.0 to 3.5), which met criteria for non-inferiority. Incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly (p < 0.001) lower with sulbactam-durlobactam than colistin (12 [13%] of 91 vs 32 [38%] of 85). Serious adverse events were reported in 36 (40%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 42 (49%) of 86 patients in the colistin group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in ten (11%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 14 (16%) of 86 patients in the colistin group.

Interpretation

Our data show that sulbactam-durlobactam was non-inferior to colistin, both agents given in combination with imipenem-cilastatin, for the primary endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Sulbactam-durlobactam was well tolerated and could be an effective intervention to reduce mortality from serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC, including multidrug-resistant strains.

SULFATRIM - sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim suspension

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of A. baumannii infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering high-dose minocycline or high-dose tigecycline in combination with at least one other agent for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections. Prefer minocycline over tigecycline because of the long-standing clinical experience with minocycline and the availability of CLSI breakpoints.

Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria in drug labels – a shift to online updates To ensure that the most up-to-date STIC are available, holders of approved drug applications had until December 13, 2018, to remove the STIC information and related information from the labeling of approved systemic antibacterial and antifungal drugs and replace it with a reference to information on these new pages. FDA has published a final guidance to further explain these requirements. New antibacterial and antifungal drugs approved on or after December 13, 2017 will include a reference to information on these new pages in labeling in lieu of STIC and related information. Enabling physicians to select appropriate antibacterial or antifungal drugs is critical to individual patient care and public health.

Generally, physicians rely on antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed by clinical microbiology laboratories to help choose an appropriate treatment. STIC are the criteria used to interpret AST results. STIC identify whether bacteria or fungi are considered susceptible or resistant to a particular drug. Bacteria and fungi change over time. When this occurs, STIC need to be updated. Laboratories and AST device manufacturers need to be able to use up-to-date interpretive criteria for the reports provided to physicians to inform appropriate treatment choices. Up-to-date AST results are an important component in addressing the problem of antimicrobial resistance.

Susceptible is a category defined by a breakpoint that implies that isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration at or below or a zone diameter at or above the susceptible breakpoint are inhibited by the usually achievable concentrations of antimicrobial agent when the dosage recommended to treat the site of infection is used, resulting in likely clinical efficacy.
