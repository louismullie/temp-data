## Question

Are there any specific laboratory tests that can confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any specific laboratory tests that can confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "confirmatory" means in toxicology and whether any test directly detects ingested hydrogen peroxide. Then, I should verify authoritative sources that explicitly address the availability of such tests. Next, I will examine indirect laboratory markers and their limitations. After that, I should review imaging-based evidence of gas embolism as the de facto diagnostic signal. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned approach and state the bottom line clearly with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't overstate anything: a confirmatory test would directly identify hydrogen peroxide in blood, urine, or gastric contents, and it would be reasonably available and validated for clinical decision-making. Wait, let me verify whether any such test exists in the provided sources before drawing conclusions.

> I need to check the most authoritative statements. The CDC medical management guidance explicitly states there are no specific blood or urine tests that can show whether a person has been exposed to hydrogen peroxide, which directly addresses the question of confirmatory laboratory testing. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across concentrations and not just dilute solutions; the CDC language is general and does not suggest exceptions for higher concentrations, reinforcing that no validated clinical lab assay confirms ingestion [^b5f87a1c].

> Next, I should review whether any indirect chemical test on gastric contents has been described. The CDC does mention a colorimetric reaction using titanium chloride that can indicate peroxide in a mixture of gastric contents and ether, but wait, let me verify the clinical utility here. This is not a routine clinical laboratory test, requires specific reagents and handling, and is not validated for diagnostic confirmation in patients; it is more of a niche bench test rather than a standard-of-care laboratory assay, so I should not call it a confirmatory clinical test [^b5f87a1c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about laboratory markers of injury equaling confirmation of ingestion. I should confirm which labs are actually recommended and why. Guidelines for caustic ingestion recommend obtaining CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, lactate, and pH to assess severity and complications, but these are indirect and nonspecific for hydrogen peroxide itself; they help detect hemorrhage, perforation, ischemia, or organ injury without confirming the ingested agent, so they cannot serve as confirmatory tests for hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^a13e3ce2] [^1ea5065b].

> I will now examine the real-world diagnostic signal that clinicians rely on. Let me think about imaging: portal venous gas on abdominal CT is the most consistent and specific clinical finding after significant hydrogen peroxide ingestion, reflecting oxygen gas embolism from catalase-driven decomposition. Multiple case series and reports document this, and a systematic review shows that over 90% of embolic symptoms occur within 10 hours, which supports early CT as the diagnostic cornerstone when ingestion is suspected. But wait, I should clarify that this confirms the pathophysiologic consequence rather than the chemical identity of the ingested substance, so it is not a laboratory confirmation of hydrogen peroxide per se [^17bcee9b] [^bc16f043] [^bc16f043].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything. There are no validated, routinely available blood or urine laboratory tests that confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion. The CDC explicitly states this, and contemporary emergency medicine toxicology reviews align with that stance. Indirect labs assess injury and complications, and a nonstandard gastric chemistry test exists but is not a clinical diagnostic standard. Therefore, confirmation in practice is clinical plus imaging for gas embolism, not laboratory confirmation of the agent itself [^b5f87a1c] [^e60f8fa7] [^17bcee9b].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the sources and weighing the evidence hierarchy: there are no specific laboratory tests that can confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Diagnosis remains clinical, supported by history and imaging evidence of gas embolism when present, with standard labs used to monitor for complications rather than to identify the ingested chemical [^b5f87a1c] [^a13e3ce2] [^17bcee9b].

---

There are **no specific laboratory tests** that confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^b5f87a1c]. Routine labs (CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, lactate, pH) assess injury severity but are **not diagnostic** [^a13e3ce2]. Portal venous gas on abdominal CT is the most specific finding [^17bcee9b] and indicates significant exposure, but it is not a laboratory test. If ingestion is suspected, obtain labs to guide management and use imaging to detect complications; **do not rely on labs to confirm ingestion** [^e60f8fa7].

---

## Laboratory tests commonly performed

Although no test confirms ingestion, the following labs are commonly obtained to assess injury severity and guide management:

| **Laboratory test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Assess for bleeding, infection, or systemic inflammation [^a13e3ce2] |
| Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium) | Evaluate for electrolyte disturbances due to vomiting, diarrhea, or caustic injury [^a13e3ce2] |
| Renal function tests (urea, creatinine) | Assess renal injury from hypoperfusion or direct caustic injury [^a13e3ce2] |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) | Evaluate hepatic injury from portal venous gas embolism or direct caustic injury [^a13e3ce2] |
| Serum lactate | Assess tissue hypoperfusion or metabolic acidosis from severe injury [^a13e3ce2] |
| Arterial blood gas (ABG) | Evaluate acid-base status and respiratory compromise [^a13e3ce2] |
| Coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, INR) | Assess for coagulopathy from severe hepatic injury or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^notfound] |

---

These tests help assess systemic involvement and guide supportive care but **do not confirm ingestion** [^e60f8fa7].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is critical for detecting complications of hydrogen peroxide ingestion, particularly gas embolism. Abdominal CT is the **most sensitive modality** for detecting portal venous gas, which is a hallmark of significant hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^notfound]. Chest radiography may reveal pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pneumoperitoneum in cases of perforation [^89739d11].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend obtaining initial laboratory tests — including CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, lactate, and pH — to assess injury severity and guide management [^a13e3ce2]. They also emphasize the importance of imaging, particularly CT, to detect complications such as portal venous gas embolism [^65de0b0a].

---

## Limitations of laboratory testing

Laboratory tests cannot confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion because hydrogen peroxide is rapidly metabolized in the body, and no specific metabolites are detected in routine clinical testing [^b5f87a1c]. Additionally, laboratory abnormalities may be absent or nonspecific, particularly in mild or early presentations [^b56427dc].

---

## Summary of evidence

- **No specific laboratory test**: There is no specific laboratory test that confirms hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^b5f87a1c].
- **Routine labs**: Routine laboratory tests assess injury severity and guide management but do not confirm ingestion [^a13e3ce2].
- **Imaging**: Abdominal CT is the most sensitive modality for detecting portal venous gas embolism, a hallmark of significant hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^notfound].
- **Clinical guidelines**: Guidelines recommend obtaining routine laboratory tests and imaging to assess injury severity and detect complications [^a13e3ce2] [^65de0b0a].

---

## Clinical implications

Given the absence of a confirmatory laboratory test, diagnosis of hydrogen peroxide ingestion relies on clinical history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly if there is a history of exposure to hydrogen peroxide products. Early recognition and appropriate management, including supportive care and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for gas embolism, are essential to optimize outcomes [^83a739dc].

---

## Conclusion

There are **no specific laboratory tests** that confirm hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Routine laboratory tests assess injury severity and guide management, while imaging studies, particularly abdominal CT, detect complications such as portal venous gas embolism. Clinical diagnosis relies on history, examination, and imaging, and early recognition with appropriate management is crucial for optimal outcomes.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^b56427dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Both our patients underwent HBOT, resulting in the rapid and complete resolution of the radiological signs of portal venous gas. Patient A's neurological symptoms improved gradually, which may indicate a persistent ischaemic effect of cerebral arterial gas emboli, despite the absence of radiological signs on the initial cerebral scan.

In the case of Patient B, who initially had the presence of portal venous gas with no other symptoms, one may wonder whether HBOT was superfluous or whether it reduced the risk of secondary systemic embolism. We opted for hyperbaric oxygen for the patient due to the early onset of poisoning symptoms, the high concentration of the ingested hydrogen peroxide and the observation that Patient A, who consumed the same concentration and dose at the same time, exhibited symptoms consistent with cerebral gas embolism. The troponin-T peak, recorded 21 hours after poisoning, suggests the occurrence of a cardiac embolism as a possible cause. However, it remains unclear whether HBOT influenced cardiac function, as the timing of ECG and biomarker changes does not suggest a direct causal relationship with the therapy.

Whether the presence of portal venous gas alone after hydrogen peroxide poisoning is an indication for HBOT remains unclear. In the two cases reported here, there was a discrepancy between the laboratory results, which remained within normal ranges, and the presence of portal venous gas on imaging. This underscores the limitation of laboratory tests (eg, liver function test) in distinguishing patients who may remain asymptomatic from those who may become symptomatic and experience clinical deterioration in cases of hydrogen peroxide poisoning. Published evidence suggests that higher concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide may be associated with increased complications. Also, evidence shows that 'over 90% of embolic symptoms occurred within 10 hours of ingestion'. Based on this evidence and on the cases reported here, we suggest that for asymptomatic patients, assessed within a few hours after highly concentrated and/or high-volume hydrogen peroxide ingestion, an immediate CT scan may be useful to assess the presence of portal gas. If imaging shows portal gas in these cases, it may be reasonable to promptly transfer the patients to a facility equipped with HBOT, should the patient become symptomatic or display signs of gas embolism.

Discussion

Breath testing remains a useful, inexpensive, simple, and safe diagnostic tool in gastroenterology. Using an evidence-based approach, consensus was reached on 26 statements providing practical guidance regarding the indications, preparation, performance and interpretation of BT in clinical practice and research. Furthermore, current gaps of knowledge are identified for future research directives. As compared to previous guidelines, these consensus statements are updated based on the most recent literature and provide detailed recommendations and clarity on drug regimens prior to BT, dose of substrates, established indications, limitations and interpretation of the results based on both hydrogen and methane gases.

While unanswered questions remain and there are challenges that need further clarification, it is hoped that these consensus statements create uniformity in the use of BT and thus improve and optimize patient care.

- pH

- serum lactate

- blood alcohol

- β-hCG (in young female patients).

### Hemorrhagic gastritis and gas emboli after ingesting 3% hydrogen peroxide [^84e645f4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

It is well known that ingestion of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is usually nontoxic; this does not produce gas embolism and is only a mild irritant to the gastrointestinal tract. We report the case of a 25-year-old woman who ingested one mouthful of 3% hydrogen peroxide and presented to the Emergency Department with persistent vomiting and epigastric pain. The radiographic evaluation found portal venous gas emboli. In addition, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed 2 h after ingestion revealed diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis. She showed a decrease of hemoglobin concentration and a positive test result for occult blood in stool. She was observed for 14 days and discharged. Follow-up endoscopy showed erythematous gastritis. This case illustrates that a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide can cause portal venous gas embolism and severe gastrointestinal injuries even if only a small amount is ingested.

### Use and abuse of hydrogen breath tests [^c7a2f9c2]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Hydrogen breath tests are widely used to explore the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and carbohydrate malabsorption are disorders detected by these tests that have been proposed to be of great importance for symptoms in, for instance, irritable bowel syndrome. However, conclusions drawn from these studies are highly controversial and divergent results exist. There is also an extensive use of these tests in clinical practice with difficulties regarding interpretation of the tests and sometimes erroneous conclusions. The limitations and pitfalls of these tests will be reviewed in this article, and hopefully the occasional abuse of these tests can be turned into proper clinical and scientific use instead in the future.

OVERDOSAGE

Ingestion of 1 or 2 ounces of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% by a small child (~10 kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including nausea, or signs of alcohol intoxication. Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse, 0.12% is ingested by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop.

### Hydrogen peroxide solution ingestion caused brain death of a 3-year-old girl [^665b6ce1]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide solutions are often used in daily life as a household disinfectant and in cosmetic products and are therefore a common source of intentional poisonings, especially for children. When ingested in small amounts, it may cause severe central nervous system damage as a result of arterial emboli like our case. The benefit of hyperbaric oxygen treatment in this situation is known, but the neurologic deficits of our case did not improve with this method and finally brain death occurred. This is may be related by the timing of treatment after the event. We would like to emphasize that every clinician must be aware of the dangers of hydrogen peroxide ingestion and hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be of benefit if it is performed immediately.

### Caustic ingestion management: World Society of Emergency Surgery preliminary survey of expert opinion [^f8706885]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The diagnosis and treatment of caustic ingestion injuries has received only a modicum of attention in the literature. Furthermore, our review has identified only three randomized control trials addressing the effectiveness of steroid treatment. Accordingly, the current relevant literature consists primarily of retrospective research and case studies.

The paucity of experience with this entity at any one center is evident from the finding that 80% of our survey respondents treat fewer than 10 cases per year. Based on these findings, we believe that patients should be enrolled in well designed, prospective data bases; furthermore, in order to establish evidence based guidelines, a current management algorithm should be constructed based upon available knowledge.

Diagnosis and initial treatment

The initial approach to management should involve careful assessment of the extent of injury. Hence, it is important to document the type of ingested material, quantity ingested, and an attempt to estimate the exposure duration in the various organs.

A careful assessment of symptoms is paramount. Complaints of dyspnea, dysphagia, excessive salivation, hematemesis or hoarseness suggest severe injury. Although laboratory tests do not always correlate with severe injury, leukocytosis > 20,000 wbc/ml, elevated CRP and pH < 7.2 corroborate extent and severity of injury. Hypocalcemia may follow the ingestion of hydrogen fluoride.

Forty percent of patients suffer injury to the upper respiratory tract, and approximately 5–15% suffers significant dyspnea, stridor or laryngeal edema, dictating immediate intubation due to imminent air way compromise.

Initial chest X-ray may identify pneumoperitoneum, pleural effusion or pneumomediastinum. Such radiologic findings may also hint at the presence of perforation. Recent experience supports the accuracy of CT scan as a diagnostic tool with 75% sensitivity and 90% specificity in determining injury grade, need for surgical intervention and ability to predict complications such as stricture. The CT injury grading system of Ryu HH et al. is based on the extent of esophageal lining edema, turbidity, paraesophageal tissue and fat hernia and presence of pleural fluid or pneumomediastinum.

A recent study by Lurie Y et al. demonstrated that the specificity of CT in predicting the need for operative intervention and even eventual mortality as high as was > 90% but with sensitivity of only 30–40%. On the basis of these facts, these authors concluded that early endoscopy may not be replaced by CT.

### Delayed-onset portal venous thrombosis after ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide [^bc16f043]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Identification of portal venous gas on radiographic imaging is well documented after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, as is its resolution after hyperbaric therapy. Although hyperbaric therapy may resolve the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the presence of portal venous gas, the principle rationale for performing hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system oxygen embolization.

Case Report

We describe a patient with portal venous gas identified by computed tomography after the ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide, managed without hyperbaric therapy, who subsequently developed portal venous thrombosis. We are not aware of this complication being previously described from hydrogen peroxide ingestion. The case is complicated by the coexistence of a self-inflicted stab wound, leading to exploratory laparotomy in a patient predisposed to arterial vascular occlusion. Why Should an EmergencyPhysicianBeAware of This? Emergency physicians will encounter patients after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide who, despite not having symptoms of central nervous system emboli, have portal venous gas identified on radiographic imaging. Being aware that the principle rationale for prophylactic utilization of hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system emboli, and that in at least one case, delayed-onset portal venous thrombosis has occurred without hyperbaric therapy may help contribute to clinical decision-making.

### Cerebral air gas embolism from concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^c05e471b]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ingestion of a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause cerebral air gas embolism (CAGE). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is the standard of care in the treatment of CAGE. We report a case of CAGE after accidental ingestion of 33%hydrogen peroxide treated with HBOT resulting in reversal of both the clinical and radiologic abnormalities.

Case Report

A 48 year-old male took two sips of 33% hydrogen peroxide. A short time later, he developed hematemesis, left sided hemiplegia, confusion, and left homonymous hemianopsia. Initial laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and brain CT were normal. MRI demonstrated areas of restricted diffusion and T2 hyper intensities in multiple vascular territories consistent with ischemia due to CAGE. Eighteen hours after arrival, the patient underwent HBOT at 3 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 30 minutes and 2.5 ATA for 60 minutes with clinical improvement. Follow-up MRI at six months demonstrated resolution of the hyper intensities.

Discussion

A search of MEDLINE from 1950 to present revealed only two cases of CAGE from ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide treated with HBOT. Both cases, similar to ours, had complete resolution of symptoms. Of the seven reported cases of CAGE from hydrogen peroxide that did not undergo HBOT, only in one patient was there a report of symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Ingestion of even a small amount of concentrated hydrogen peroxide can result in cerebral air gas embolism. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be of benefit in reversing the symptoms and preventing permanent neurological impairment.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^4a5da53f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Finally, most of the cases described in the literature develop symptoms within the first hour, but the time taken to treat them varies. Early HBOT appears to reduce the risk of complications or death. Therefore, it is important to refer the patient to the nearest hyperbaric medicine centre if there is radiological or clinical evidence of gas embolism.

Learning points

There is an inter-individual variability in patients' symptomatology, despite the same concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide ingested.
Hydrogen peroxide poisoning can result in significant portal venous gas, which may remain asymptomatic or progress to symptomatic arterial gas embolism. Even in asymptomatic patients (ie, presence of portal venous gas without embolism), imaging (considered alongside the concentration and volume of hydrogen peroxide and the timing of ingestion) may help clinicians in deciding whether to initiate hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
HBOT is an effective treatment for gas in the portal system or arterial gas embolism caused by hydrogen peroxide poisoning and should be considered as soon as possible in severe cases.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^c11646c5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given the presence of venous portal gas in Patient A, Patient B also underwent a CT scan, which also revealed venous portal gas. He did not develop any neurological symptoms.

Meanwhile, the bottle with the unknown liquid was taken to the toxicology laboratory for analysis, and almost pure hydrogen peroxide was identified (ie, > 90%).

Given the presence of portal venous gas on imaging in both patients, along with clinical symptoms in Patient A indicative of a possible cerebral arterial gas embolism, both patients were promptly transferred to the nearest hyperbaric medicine centre.

### Hydrogen peroxide | ToxFAQs ™ | ATSDRwwwn.cdc.gov › TSP › toxFAQs › toxFAQsDetails… [^17cbda70]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2015). Low credibility.

Spanish: Peróxido de Hidrógeno CAS#: 7722-84-1 PDF Versionpdf icon. Hydrogen peroxide is a manufactured chemical, although small amounts of hydrogen peroxide gas may occur naturally in the air. Low exposure may occur from use at home; higher exposures may occur from industrial use. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide can cause irritation of the eyes, throat, respiratory airway, and skin. Drinking concentrated liquid can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal effects. This substance has been found in at least 18 of the 1, 585 National Priorities List sites identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. Top of Page Hydrogen peroxide can be toxic if ingested, inhaled, or by contact with the skin or eyes. Inhalation of household strength hydrogen peroxide can cause respiratory irritation. Exposure to household strength hydrogen peroxide can cause mild ocular irritation. Inhalation of vapors from.

concentrated solutions may result in severe pulmonary irritation. Ingestion of dilute solutions of hydrogen peroxide may result in vomiting, mild gastrointestinal irritation, gastric distension, and on rare occasions, gastrointestinal erosions or embolism. Ingestion of solutions of 10–20% strength produces similar symptoms, but exposed tissues may also be burned. Ingestion of even more concentrated solutions, in addition to the above, may also induce rapid loss of consciousness followed by respiratory paralysis. Eye exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide may result in pain and irritation, but severe injury is rare. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that hydrogen peroxide is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. There are no studies on the health effects of children exposed to hydrogen peroxide.

Documented cases of children being accidently exposed to hydrogen peroxide have described effects similar to those observed in adults. be stored out of the reach of children. There are no clinical tests that show that you have been exposed to hydrogen peroxide. White foam from the mouth immediately after ingestion of significant amounts may provide a clue to emergency personnel. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration sets a limit of 1 part of hydrogen peroxide in a million.

### Validation of a new method to measure hydrogen peroxide in exhaled breath condensate [^c3081a37]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Inflammatory processes in the lung can or will elicit oxidative stress. The degree of oxidative stress can be determined by measuring hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) concentration in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) but the methods to measure H(2)O(2) are all rather time consuming and only reliable and/or accurate in the hand of skilled technicians in a dedicated laboratory. We tested a new commercial device (Ecocheck), developed to offer a less time-consuming method to measure H(2)O(2). We validated this new method according the NCCLS EP10-A2 protocol. The validation shows that the imprecision in the low range is high (28.4%) and declines with higher concentrations of H(2)O(2) (up to 6.6%). The Ecocheck is "an easy to use" measuring device for routine measurements getting quick results without the need for skilled technicians to determine H(2)O(2) concentrations.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the prevention of arterial gas embolism in food grade hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^8a3f24a0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Food grade hydrogen peroxide ingestion is a relatively rare presentation to the emergency department. There are no defined guidelines at this time regarding the treatment of such exposures, and providers may not be familiar with the potential complications associated with high concentration hydrogen peroxide ingestions. In this case series, we describe four patients who consumed 35% hydrogen peroxide, presented to the emergency department, and were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Two of the four patients were critically ill requiring intubation. All four patients had evidence on CT or ultrasound of venous gas emboli and intubated patients were treated as if they had an arterial gas embolism since an exam could not be followed. After hyperbaric oxygen therapy each patient was discharged from the hospital neurologically intact with no other associated organ injuries related to vascular gas emboli. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective treatment for patients with vascular gas emboli after high concentration hydrogen peroxide ingestion. It is the treatment of choice for any impending, suspected, or diagnosed arterial gas embolism. Further research is needed to determine which patients with portal venous gas emboli should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

### A rare case of portal vein gas: accidental hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^b23f721a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a colourless and odourless liquid with oxidant characteristics used for various purposes. Whereas in lower concentrations (3%), H(2)O(2) is used as a disinfectant in home cleaning products and wound care, in higher concentrations (35%) it is used in textile and paper industry as a bleaching agent and is diluted for use in lightening hair dyes. Like other caustic substances, direct injuries may develop if H(2)O(2) is swallowed and systemic air embolisms may occur due to the resultant gaseous oxygen. This study discusses a patient who was detected with the presence of gas in the portal venous system due to H(2)O(2) intoxication and was treated conservatively.

### Rapid oxalate determination in blood and synthetic urine using a newly developed oxometer [^a21aba7a]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Blood and urine oxalate determinations have been limited to the laboratory setting because of complex sample storage and processing methods as well as the need for color spectrophotometry and ion chromatography. We hypothesized that glucometer test strips, impregnated with glucose oxidase and dyes that measure secondary hydrogen peroxide production, could be infused with oxalate oxidase and produce enhanced color changes in the presence of oxalate. By increasing the amount of sodium oxalate in fresh blood, we found that glucometer-measured oxalate increased on a linear scale. In addition, oxalate levels in synthetic urine could be measured using a visual scale, suggesting that strip dwell time or oxalate/oxalate oxidase concentrations could be manipulated to enhance optimal sensitivity. Although further testing is necessary, this simple, first-generation oxometer may eventually allow point of care testing in the home or office, empowering patients with oxalate-based medical conditions and giving healthcare providers real-time oxalate feedback.

### Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for systemic gas embolism after hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^83a739dc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly available product and its ingestion has been demonstrated to produce in vivo gas bubbles, which can embolize to devastating effect.

Objective

We report two cases of hydrogen peroxide ingestion with resultant gas embolization, one to the portal system and one cerebral embolus, which were successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), and review the literature.

Case Report

Two individuals presented to our center after unintentional ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide solutions. Symptoms were consistent with portal gas emboli (Patient A) and cerebral gas emboli (Patient B), which were demonstrated on imaging. They were successfully treated with HBO and recovered without event.

Conclusions

As demonstrated by both our experience as well as the current literature, HBO has been used to successfully treat gas emboli associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion. We recommend consideration of HBO in any cases of significant hydrogen peroxide ingestion with a clinical picture compatible with gas emboli.

### Resolution of delayed altered mental status associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion following hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^91bbc1a1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Case Report

An 82-year-old women presented with altered mental status, seizure, and apnea after an accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Ingestion of concentrated peroxide can result in gas embolism of the cerebral vasculature. After hyperbaric treatment, the patient had prompt and full neurologic recovery. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of reversal of significant altered mental status associated with hydrogen peroxide ingestion in temporal relation with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the dangers of peroxide ingestion and may wish to consider hyperbaric oxygen as a potential additional treatment for severe cases.

### Portal venous gas emboli after accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide [^fd9bc213]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide is a common household product. It is clear and odorless making it easy to confuse with water, especially when improperly stored. Concentrated formulations are also available for consumer purchase.

Objective

We report a case of hydrogen peroxide ingestion in a child and discuss the potential consequences and treatment of such an exposure.

Case Report

A 12-year-old boy accidentally ingested a sip of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. He rapidly developed hematemesis and presented to the Emergency Department. His initial work-up was unremarkable, and his symptoms resolved quickly. However, diffuse gas emboli were found within the portal system on abdominal computed tomography. The child was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and later found to have gastric irritation as well as an ulcer on endoscopy. He recovered fully from the incident.

Conclusions

### Treatment of portal venous gas embolism with hyperbaric oxygen after accidental ingestion of hydrogen peroxide: a case report and review of the literature [^97a2d71c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It is well known that hydrogen peroxide ingestion can cause gas embolism.

Objective

To report a case illustrating that the definitive, most effective treatment for gas embolism is hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Case Report

We present a case of a woman who presented to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal pain after an accidental ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Complete recovery from her symptoms occurred quickly with hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Conclusion

This is a case report of the successful use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat portal venous gas embolism caused by hydrogen peroxide ingestion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered for the treatment of symptomatic hydrogen peroxide ingestion.

### Significance of hydrogen breath tests in children with suspected carbohydrate malabsorption [^84291d20]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

As expected, higher cut-off levels (i.e. 25 ppm) decreased and lower cut-off levels (i.e. 15 ppm) increased the proportion of positive test results, especially for fructose HBT. However, with regard to the overall test performance and avoidance of borderline results, the cut-off definition at 20 ppm appears reasonable. The performance of different hydrogen breath tests at different cut-offs is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Performance of the hydrogen breath tests at different hydrogen cut-offs. Percentage of positive, negative and borderline hydrogen breath test results by three different hydrogen breath cut-offs as indicated. An increase in the production of hydrogen ≥ 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm and a two-fold increase of the individual baseline H 2 -exhalation in three consecutive breath samples was considered positive. Breath test, in which three hydrogen values were ≥ 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm but not all of those topped the baseline value by a two-fold increase or where hydrogen levels reached at least 20 (≥ 15; ≥ 25) ppm but not at three time points were considered as borderline. All other test results were classified as being negative.

We analyzed hydrogen values of tests in which the ingested carbohydrate was absorbed without colonic fermentation and where no hydrogen was produced (negative test). Likewise, breath hydrogen concentrations obtained from patients who were unable to absorb all of the ingested carbohydrate were analyzed at baseline and at different time points after ingestion of the test meal (positive test). In these patients, bacterial fermentation resulted in the appearance of breath hydrogen that was below 20 ppm for the first 45 minutes (lactose), 30 minutes (fructose), or 60 minutes (sorbitol) and reached a maximum value by 90 minutes (lactose), 75 minutes (fructose), or 120 minutes (sorbitol). The maximum hydrogen produced represents peak carbohydrate fermentation. The time course analyses of breath hydrogen concentrations during breath tests using lactose, fructose, or sorbitol are summarized in Figure 2.

Test performances at different cut-offs

A definitive positive test results with an increase in the production of hydrogen ≥ 20 ppm plus a two-fold increase of the individual baseline H 2 -exhalation in three breath samples was observed in 192 breath tests (fructose, n = 59; lactose, n = 31; sorbitol, n = 102). There were only 21 tests (5%) with a borderline result because the criteria for a positive result were only partially met. Reasons were: i) three hydrogen values ≥ 20 ppm but not all of those topped the baseline value by a two-fold increase (fructose, n = 1; lactose, n = 3; sorbitol, n = 3); or ii) hydrogen values reached ≥ 20 ppm, but not at three time points (fructose, n = 7; lactose, n = 3; sorbitol, n = 4). A baseline hydrogen value ≥ 10 ppm was noticed in 61 breath tests (fructose, n = 19; lactose, n = 26; sorbitol, n = 16) and test results were positive in 51% of these cases (fructose, n = 9; lactose, n = 9; sorbitol, n = 13). In total, 36 HBTs (8%) showed elevated baseline hydrogen levels (> 20 ppm) at 15–30 min after sugar ingestion (fructose, n = 20; lactose, n = 9, sorbitol, n = 7). In 118 patients, both fructose and sorbitol tests were performed. In 23 of these patients (20%), both tests were negative, and 39 patients (33%) had positive results in both tests. In the 56 patients (47%) with only one out of two positive tests, only 5 patients had an abnormal fructose breath test while 51 were diagnosed with sorbitol-intolerance. Testing for sorbitol may thus be meaningful, both in combination and independently.

### Hydrogen peroxide neurotoxicity in childhood: case report with unique magnetic resonance imaging features [^1f903f4e]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) intoxication is relatively rare in children. Serious irreversible neurotoxicity generally results. The case of an 11-year-old boy who inadvertently drank a concentrated (35%) H2O2 solution is described. He exhibited signs of an acute encephalopathy with cortical visual impairment. Extensive cerebrocortical diffusion restriction with apparent gyral edema was evident at 3 days following ingestion, particularly in the parieto-occipital regions bilaterally. Spontaneous neurologic improvement quickly followed, and nearly full clinical resolution was evident 1 month later. The pattern of imaging abnormalities closely resembles that of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Concentrated H2O2 neurotoxicity in children can exhibit unique patterns (a reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy) and a better than expected outcome.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^e7e85476]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

SIBO is a condition in which the small bowel is colonized by excessive numbers of aerobic and anaerobic microbes that are normally found in the large intestine. Aspiration of small bowel fluid, followed by culture and bacterial count is considered to be the current gold standard for diagnosis of SIBO. Unlike breath testing, small bowel aspiration is invasive, time-consuming and costly. In addition, small bowel aspiration has multiple shortcomings. Mid and distal segments of small bowel are beyond the reach of regular endoscopes; therefore, proximal small bowel aspirates may be falsely negative. Although aseptic techniques for small bowel aspirates have been described, contamination with oral and esophageal flora may lead to a significant number of false positive results. Quantitative PCR studies have been used to diagnose SIBO with promising results; however, such techniques are not readily available for clinical practice.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^a1bda2dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide poisoning is a rare but potentially severe poisoning that can cause digestive tract irritation and/or gas embolism when ingested. The clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic patients to severe embolic consequences or even death. There is little evidence on the treatment of such poisoning to guide physicians in caring for these patients. This paper reports on two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning after accidental ingestion. Both patients showed evidence of portal venous gas, with one patient exhibiting significant symptoms while the other did not. Both were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), with a follow-up CT scan revealing a complete resolution of the portal venous gas. This suggests that HBOT is effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with portal venous gas and should be considered as an effective treatment option in cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning.

### Timing of embolic phenomena after hydrogen peroxide exposure-a systematic review [^17bcee9b]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrogen peroxide ingestions cause significant morbidity and mortality due to oxygen gas emboli and are treatable with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Recommendations for observation are based on small case series.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review is to define the time of onset of embolic phenomena after hydrogen peroxide exposure and to describe the proportion of patients who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Methods

Cases from a systematic literature search were combined with those from a prior study that used data derived from the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. Air-gas emboli were defined as embolic phenomena (stroke, myocardial infarction, obstructive shock) potentially reversed with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Simple counts, mean, and interquartile range were used for description and comparisons.

Results

A total of 766 records were identified in the literature search. Three-hundred and eighty-three duplicate records were identified and removed. Of the 383 remaining records, 156 met inclusion criteria; 88 were excluded based on predetermined criteria yielding 68 records with 85 unique cases. Forty-one cases were extracted from the 2017 National Poison Data System study resulting in a total of 126 cases for analysis. Case descriptions: We analyzed these 126 cases and documented 213 discrete clinical events, excluding deaths. There were 108 high-concentration exposures, 10 low-concentration exposures, and 8 were unknown. Thirty-five cases were intentional ingestions but not for self-harm, and 84 were unintentional or accidental. Only 4 cases were for self-harm, and there were 23 pediatric cases. There were 99 air-gas emboli reported in 78 patients. Time to onset: The time to onset of air-gas embolic was documented in 70/78. Time to symptom onset ranged from immediate to 72h after hydrogen peroxide exposure. Over 90% of embolic symptoms occurred within 10h of ingestion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: A total of 54/126 cases received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of those 54 cases, 31 had primary portal venous gas while the remaining 23 had air-gas emboli. Of the 23 air-gas emboli cases treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, 13 made full recoveries while 10 had residual symptoms or died. Mean time from air-gas emboli symptom onset to hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the full recovery group was 9h compared to 18.2h in the partial recovery/death group. Portal venous gas: There were 63 total reported cases of portal venous gas. Forty-nine of these cases were primary portal venous gas, 13 were secondary findings in patients with air-gas emboli and one case was secondary to non-air-gas emboli symptoms. Twenty-seven of 49 patients with portal venous gas (55%) as the primary finding had gastrointestinal bleeding. Thirty of the 63 cases received hyperbaric oxygen therapy for portal venous gas without any documented air-gas emboli. Deaths: Seventeen deaths occurred in the combined cohort. Of these, 13 were associated with high-concentration exposures. All deaths with reported time to symptom onset had symptoms within 1h of exposure.

Conclusion

This review of hydrogen peroxide exposure cases suggests that clinically significant embolic phenomena occur within 10h of exposure, although delayed air-gas emboli do happen and should considered when deciding duration of observation. It remains equivocal whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is beneficial in cases of primary portal venous gas without systemic involvement.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^eb099aa4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

Two male patients in their late 70s were admitted to the local emergency department after ingesting a sip of an unknown, odourless, viscous liquid that they believed to be white wine. Within 30 min of ingestion, they experienced gastric symptoms (Patient A: nausea, followed by abdominal pain and haematemesis; Patient B: nausea and epigastric discomfort).

Admitted to the emergency department (75 min after ingestion), they were both haemodynamically stable, and the clinical examination, particularly neurological, was unremarkable. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm without other abnormalities. For Patient A, all standard biological tests, including blood count, renal function, hepatic function and electrolytes, were within normal limits. In contrast, Patient B had elevated troponin-T level without kinetic change (troponin-T, high sensitivity (normal < 14 ng/L)): 33 ng/L (2 hours after poisoning) and 33 ng/L (4 hours after poisoning). Given the absence of both anamnesis and clinical findings indicating excessive alcohol consumption and with both patients and witnesses reporting that they had only taken a single sip from that unknown bottle at that time, blood alcohol concentration was not measured.

Patient A developed somnolence 5 hours post-intoxication and showed objective confusion 6 hours after the incident (GCS 13/15). His wife reported that he began displaying unusual behaviour (difficulty to communicate with) immediately after ingestion. This prompted a cerebral and thoracoabdominopelvic CT, which showed the presence of a significant amount of gas in the venous portal system and a thickening of the oesophageal and gastric walls. There was no evidence of arterial gas embolism on imaging.

Patient B only experienced epigastric discomfort and mild nausea without further symptoms. He underwent gastroscopy, which revealed massive inflammation and erythematous-haemorrhagic mucosa throughout the entire stomach, with no damage to the oesophagus or duodenum (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Gastroscopy was performed on Patient B, revealing signs of diffuse haemorrhagic gastritis. The abdominal CT scans of Patients A and B before and after hyperbaric therapy are presented. Images A and B show portal gas embolism discovered during initial CT. Images A' and B' show radiological resolution of the embolism following a single hyperbaric therapy (26 hours after poisoning, 9 hours after hyperbaric therapy).

### Modern concepts of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^1575fd27]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the 1980s, hydrogen breath testing became popularized as a means of diagnosing SIBO. Various substrates were used in this test. In the end, the two principal substrates that remain are glucose and lactulose. The principle of hydrogen breath testing is that when an ingested carbohydrate traverses the gut and is encountered by bacteria they will ferment it, producing gases which are then absorbed detected on the breath. In the 1990s, methane was added to breath testing. However, it was unclear what the role of methane was. What was known is that human cells do not produce hydrogen or methane, suggesting that the presence of these gases on the breath test had to result from gut microbial sources.

Over the decades as breath testing became more commonly used, some have pointed back to culture as the gold standard. We now know that traditional culture was not a good "gold standard" for a number of reasons, particularly as catheters were not improved to prevent contamination. A recent study from the Mayo Clinic reported that approximately 20% of cultures from the small bowel were contaminated. This level of uncertainty cannot be a gold standard. With this in mind, modern catheters have been developed that are sterile double lumen catheters, improving the certainty that the aspirates obtained truly represent the small intestine (Table 1). In addition, capsule based technologies, while still nascent, offer hope for further alternatives to older inaccurate techniques.

More recently, breath testing has further advanced with the addition of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). In fact, H 2 S completes the three gases that can be detected on breath test and are produced by the gut microbiome. As we will discuss further later, hydrogen may be the least interesting of these gases. With our more modern understanding of microbial overgrowth, we now know that methane is associated with constipation and hydrogen sulfide, linked in early studies to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is associated with diarrhea. These have now been compared to next generation sequencing results from patients, which confirm that the levels of these gases seen on the breath test are an indicator of the degree of colonization of the gut, including the small bowel, with organisms that produce these gases (Table 1). In addition, data continue to accumulate that these three gases are in fact associated with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.

What are the possible etiologies and how do they affect the clinical presentation and the therapeutic options?

Strong acids and alkalis are responsible for most severe caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract. Identification of the nature, the physical form, and the quantity of the ingested agent as well as the accidental-voluntary ingestion pattern are the cornerstones for emergency management of corrosive injuries (Grade 2A). Contacting Poison Control Centers to evaluate systemic toxicity of the ingested agents is recommended (Grade 2B). In case of massive ingestion, both acids and alkalis may induce extensive necrosis of the gastrointestinal tract. Oxidants (bleach) usually cause mild injuries but severe damage requiring emergency resection has been occasionally reported. Ingestion of ammonia results in superficial hemorrhagic gastritis which may progress during the first 24–48 h and requires specific surveillance. The quantity of ingested corrosive agent is related to the accidental/voluntary pattern of ingestion; this is the most important prognostic factor although reliable information is usually lacking. The physical form of the ingested substance is another major determinant of the damage pattern to the gastrointestinal tract. Solids produce maximum damage to the mouth and the pharynx, while liquids transit rapidly and induce burns of the esophagus and the stomach; concomitant vapor aspiration (ammonia, formaldehyde) may cause airway burns. Caregivers should be aware that specific corrosives may also cause severe systemic effects such as hypocalcemia (phosphoric, hydrofluoric acids), hyponatremia (strong acids/alkalis), hypokalemia, and acidosis.

What are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations?

Initial laboratory evaluation of caustic injuries should include CBC, serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorine, magnesium, calcium, urea creatinine, liver tests (bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), pH and serum lactate, blood alcohol levels, and measurement of β-HCG in young women (Grade 2A). Laboratory and imaging findings have an important role in identifying patients with transmural necrosis who might benefit from emergency surgical treatment. As initial normal laboratory values do not rule out transmural necrosis, kinetics of laboratory data is useful in patient monitoring and management. Abnormal values such as severe acidosis (low pH, high blood lactate levels), deranged liver function tests, leukocytosis, elevated CRP level, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia are predictive of transmural necrosis and poor outcomes.

Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ESKATA or hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrogen peroxide has been found to exhibit positive results in in vitro tests for genotoxicity, but has not exhibited positive results in in vivo tests for genotoxicity, presumably due to the rapid metabolism of hydrogen peroxide.

The effects of hydrogen peroxide on fertility have not been evaluated. Hydrogen peroxide has been associated with effects on sperm function and elevated testicular hydrogen peroxide concentration has been implicated in male infertility, although in vivo, no effect of hydrogen peroxide on sperm function has been demonstrated.

### Severe acute haemorrhagic gastritis controlled by hydrogen peroxide [^20868dcf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with severe acute haemorrhagic gastritis due to abuse of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She was treated with instillation of 150 mL 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) every 2 h via a nasogastric tube. The copious amount of bright red blood through the nasogastric tube started to decline substantially after the first administration of H2O2 and continued to reveal clear material during the second and third instillation of H2O2. The total amount of H2O2 administered was 600 ml. No rebleeding and only a few flame-shaped intramucosal haemorrhages were observed on the following four consecutive daily endoscopic evaluations. These are promising observations which will have to be confirmed with respect to the safety and efficacy of H2O2 treatment by further controlled studies.

With the appearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the detection of infectious prions in the peripheral organs of persons with sporadic CJD, the development of decontamination methods that are compatible with medical equipment has become a major issue. Here, we show that a formulation of copper metal ions in combination with hydrogen peroxide dramatically reduces the level of prion protein (PrP)(Sc) (the scrapie isoform of PrP) present in homogenates of samples from prion-infected brains, including brain samples from humans with CJD. An animal bioassay confirmed the reduction in prion infectivity, indicating that this novel Cu²⁺-H₂O₂ formulation has great potential for prion decontamination.

### Hydrogen peroxide ingestion associated with portal venous gas and treatment with hyperbaric oxygen: a case series and review of the literature [^744fb04d]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ingestion of concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) has been associated with venous and arterial gas embolic events, hemorrhagic gastritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, and death. Although H(2)O(2) is generally considered a benign ingestion in low concentrations, case reports have described serious toxicity following high concentration exposures. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been used with success in managing patients suffering from gas embolism with and without manifestations of ischemia.

Methods

Poison center records were searched from July 1999 to January 2010 for patients with H(2)O(2) exposure and HBO treatment. Cases were reviewed for the concentration of H(2)O(2), symptoms, CT scan findings of portal gas embolism, HBO treatment, and outcome. RESULTS; Eleven cases of portal gas embolism were found. Ages ranged from 4 to 89 years. All but one ingestion was accidental in nature. In 10 cases 35% H₂O₂ was ingested and in 1 case 12% H₂O₂ was ingested. All abdominal CT scans demonstrated portal venous gas embolism in all cases. Hyperbaric treatment was successful in completely resolving all portal venous gas bubbles in nine patients (80%) and nearly resolving them in two others. Ten patients were able to be discharged home within 1 day, and one patient had a 3.5-day length of stay.

Conclusions

HBO was successful in resolving portal venous gas embolism from accidental concentrated H₂O₂ ingestions.

Limited resource settings — extended use/reuse of N95 masks for GI procedures: Recommendation 4 states, In extreme resource-constrained settings involving health care workers performing any GI procedures, regardless of COVID-19 status, the AGA suggests extended use/reuse of N95 masks over surgical masks, as part of appropriate PPE. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). The evidence notes no direct evidence on the prolonged use or reuse of N95, N99, or PAPR masks in a COVID-19 pandemic was identified, and during the H1N1 pandemic an estimated 40% or more of health care workers reported reuse of their N95 respirator but impact was not estimated. Laboratory testing indicated at least 5 consecutive donnings of PPE before fit factors drop to unsafe levels, and in decontamination studies up to 50 cycles of exposure to hydrogen peroxide did not degrade filtration media, though elastic straps were stiffer after up to 20 cycles, potentially impairing fit. The guideline underscores there is insufficient evidence to comment on the safety of reuse (up to 5 consecutive donnings) and extended use (over 8 hours) of masks and other PPE.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^733e6a6b]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) is an odourless, colourless chemical compound, slightly more viscous than water, used in many fields due to its oxidising properties. At low concentrations (3%), it is used as a cosmetic product (hair bleaching solution), surface disinfectant and medical disinfectant. In higher concentrations (25% or higher), it has industrial uses, notably paper production, textile manufacturing and in the food industry.

Hydrogen peroxide poisoning is rarebut can lead to serious or even lethal consequences. Some patients may require hospitalisation, become permanently disabled or die. The lethal risk increases considerably when intoxication occurs at concentrations of more than 10%.

We report the case of two patients who accidentally ingested highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide (approximately 100%). The patients had complications related to the presence of portal venous gas and were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), leading to a complete resolution of portal venous gas. This illustrates the variability in clinical presentation: although both patients exhibited digestive symptoms, one developed cardiac complications, while the other experienced neurological symptoms, despite ingesting the same hydrogen peroxide solution at the same time.

We present this report with adherence to CARE (Case Report) case report guidelines. We obtained signed informed consent to publish this case report from the two patients.

### Accidental concentrated hydrogen peroxide ingestion associated with portal venous gas [^145bfd4f]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A case of a 52-year old male patient who presented to the emergency department with severe nausea and vomiting following accidental ingestion of H2O2. A computed tomography (CT) abdomen performed at our institution demonstrated extensive portal venous gas throughout the liver with few gas droplets seen in the extrahepatic portal vein portion. Pneumatosis was also noted in the wall of the gastric antrum. Upper GI Endoscopy was done revealing diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis and mild duodenal bulb erosion. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen. On the second day of admission, the patient was able to eat without difficulty or pain. Accidental ingestion of high concentration H2O2 solution has been shown to cause extensive injury to surrounding tissues. The injury occurs via three main mechanisms: corrosive damage, oxygen gas formation, and lipid peroxidation. We report a case of accidental ingestion of a highly concentrated (35%) solution of H2O2 causing portal venous gas.

### AGA rapid recommendations for gastrointestinal procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic [^f6bd5678]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA rapid recommendations — reuse of N95 compared to surgical masks for health care workers during gastrointestinal procedures — report VERY LOW certainty based on anecdotal reports and experiments under laboratory conditions, with no direct evidence on the safety of mask reuse during COVID-19 and only indirect evidence from other outbreaks. Reports exist that > 40% of health care workers reused N95 during H1N1, and a mathematical model found single coughs (≈19 viruses) were much less than aerosol levels (4473 viruses on filtering facepiece respirators and 3476 viruses on surgical masks). Laboratory testing reported that 5 consecutive donnings can be performed before fit factors consistently drop to unsafe levels, and hydrogen peroxide decontamination showed exposure up to 50 cycles did not degrade filtration media, but elastic straps were stiffer after up to 20 cycles and more than 20 cycles can impair proper fit. Risk of bias is noted due to lack of a comparator with optimal PPE and multiple layers of indirectness, and a CDC recommendation during H1N1 suggested use of a cleanable face shield or surgical mask to reduce N95 respirator contamination.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^d52e613e]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

Patient A had a persistent altered mental status (GCS 13/15) with hypoactive delirium without focal neurological deficit that lasted until the next day. A follow-up cerebral CT performed 26 hours after poisoning (9 hours after the end of HBOT) showed no cerebral abnormalities.

Patient B remained asymptomatic throughout his hospital stay. As part of the protocol followed by his local care unit, serial troponin measurements showed significant kinetic changes (troponin-T, high sensitivity (normal < 14 ng/L)): 65 ng/L (18 hours after poisoning, immediately after the end of HBOT), 68 ng/L (21 hours after poisoning, 3 hours after the end of HBOT) and 61 ng/L (32 hours after poisoning, 24 hours after the end of HBOT). Additionally, routine monitoring 5 hours after the end of HBOT revealed an ECG showing < 1 mm ST-segment depression in II and aVF, which resolved within 24 hours. Based on these findings, along with prior troponin measurements, a diagnosis of type 2 non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, possibly secondary to cardiac arterial gas embolism, was made. Given that Patient A was hospitalised in another care unit following different protocols and exhibited no ECG anomalies, no troponin measurements were conducted.

Both patients underwent a follow-up abdominal CT (26 hours after poisoning, 9 hours after HBOT) which revealed no remaining gas in the portal system (see figure 3).

### Sodium nitrite [^5558e512]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer Sodium Nitrite Injection without delay.
Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions. Administration of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate should be considered adjunctive to appropriate supportive therapies. Airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, and oxygen administration should not be delayed in order to administer sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The expert advice of a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1-800-222-1222.

Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning

Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside\.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Sodium Nitrite Injection, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

### Utilizing the toxicology laboratory in the poisoned patient [^e60f8fa7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a potentially poisoned patient, there is no substitute for a thorough history and physical examination. Clues from the examination are generally more likely to be helpful than a "shotgun" laboratory approach that involves indiscriminate testing of blood or urine for multiple agents. When used appropriately, diagnostic tests may be of help in the management of the intoxicated patient. When a specific toxin or even class of toxins is suspected, requesting qualitative or quantitative levels may be appropriate. The purpose of this review is to examine the role of common diagnostic tests in the evaluation of the poisoned patient.

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^329dd42a]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Treatment

Both patients were transferred by ground ambulance to the hyperbaric medicine centre approximately 7 hours after ingestion. Both patients underwent HBOT approximately 13 hours after poisoning. Based on our internal protocols, we used a long Comex 18 table which is the equivalent of the classical US Navy Table 6 (see figure 2).

Figure 2
CT scanner of the two patients, before and after hyperbaric therapy. The abdominal CT scans of Patients A and B before and after hyperbaric therapy are presented. Images A and B show portal gas embolism discovered during initial CT. Images A' and B' show radiological resolution of the embolism following a single hyperbaric therapy (26 hours after poisoning, 9 hours after hyperbaric therapy). HBOT, hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Patient A, who was still confused at the time of HBOT, complained of otalgia and became agitated, requiring deep sedation throughout the session, with a propofol infusion (between 1 and 3 mg/kg/hour) and non-invasive ventilation. Patient B did not complain of any discomfort during the session. For both patients, the session was complicated by bilateral grade III ear barotrauma.

Both patients were put on high-dose gastric protectors (esomeprazole 80 mg intravenous bolus, then 40 mg intravenously two times per day) and hospitalised in a monitored care unit.

### Hydrogen and methane-based breath testing in gastrointestinal disorders: the North American Consensus [^b34df427]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Prokinetic drugs such as tegaserod and other laxatives such as magnesium compounds can also affect the composition of the breath gases. Faster transit time caused by promotility drugs will lead to an earlier delivery of the substrate to colon and will increase the chance of a false positive result. Again, no clear data exist, but a 4-week gap between cessation of prokinetics and breath testing has previously been recommended. However, a 4-week gap may not be practical in patients with constipation or gastroparesis; hence, we propose discontinuing laxatives and promotility agents for a week and only if tolerated by patients.

A low fasting level of breath H 2 is essential for interpreting the breath test results, as these are directly affected by consumption of fermentable complex carbohydrates. As a result, avoidance of complex carbohydrates and dairy products the evening or day before a breath test (meat and rice do not appear to affect the breath test) and overnight fasting is also recommended, although the precise duration requires to be determined in future studies.

Smoking affects breath test results by increasing exhaled H 2 and CO 2 content of the exhaled breath and should be avoided on the day of the test. Smoking also increases gastric transit time. As hyperventilation inversely affects H 2 levels, excessive physical activity should be avoided during the breath test. Conflicting results exist in the literature in regards to the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on breath test results. Stopping PPIs may not lead to more accurate measurements of exhaled breath gas levels and recurrence of reflux symptoms may not be tolerable to all patients. Currently, stopping anti-acid medications prior to breath testing is not necessary.

Indications for breath testing

Current small bowel culture techniques are not satisfactory for the assessment of SIBO.
If culture is considered for diagnosis of SIBO, based on the current evidence, we suggest the threshold of > 10 3 c.f.u./ml for the definition of SIBO.
We suggest breath testing in the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
Until a true gold standard is established, we suggest breath testing in assessing the presence of antibiotic-responsive microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.
We suggest to evaluate for excessive methane excretion on breath test in association with clinical constipation and slowing of gastrointestinal transit.
We suggest that breath testing should not be used for assessment of orocecal transit time.
We suggest breath testing for the diagnosis of carbohydrate maldigestion syndromes.
We suggest breath testing in the assessment of conditions associated with bloating.

### Laboratory-acquired brucellosis [^b239cd94]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although brucellosis is a rare disease in the United States, its potential use as a bioweapon highlights the need for accurate and rapid identification. In this investigation, brucellosis was diagnosed weeks to years after initial positive blood cultures were misidentified, and laboratory personnel were unknowingly exposed to the organism.

This investigation suggests that transmission occurred from the 76-year-old index patient to laboratory worker 1, on the basis of B. melitensis DNA found in the Gram stain material. Processing the index patient's blood culture specimen on an open laboratory bench was most likely the reason for laboratory worker 1's illness approximately 5 weeks later. The same mechanism of transmission probably occurred when laboratory worker 2 handled laboratory worker 1's blood culture specimen on the open bench for biochemical testing. In these instances, blood culture bottle media were transferred to slides and agar without much risk for aerosolization, since contents were manipulated with a syringe. Biochemical tests, however, included the catalase test, which creates bubbles as a result of exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide in positive specimens. Brucella spp. are known to be catalase positive. Neither laboratory worker could identify any other possible sources of infection, and because brucellosis is a rare disease in New York, the connection between these three patients is plausible. With the initial interpretations of these Gram stains as gram-variable, which resulted in misidentification of the organism by three different laboratories, NYSDOH initiated an effort to educate clinical laboratories in New York State about the potential difficulties in characterizing the organism and the importance of primary Gram stain interpretation. Additional investigation into the staining properties of Brucella spp. under various conditions is now in progress and may help differentiate Brucella spp. from other organisms.

### The role of age in predicting the outcome of caustic ingestion in adults: a retrospective analysis [^124c8702]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Immediate management

Blood tests, including complete blood and differential counts, and measurements of alanine transaminase, creatinine, Na +, and K + were performed in the ER. Based on the judgment of the ER physician in charge, patients were treated with a proton pump inhibitor, H 2 antagonist, or sucralfate gel. Oral intake was withheld and parenteral nutrition was provided until evidence was obtained that the condition of the patient had stabilized. Antibiotics were not administered routinely due to national healthcare insurance restrictions. If infection was suspected, empirical antimicrobial therapies (such as a first generation cephalosporin and/or gentamicin or ciprofloxacin) were administered until blood cultures were obtained. If a pulmonary or respiratory complication was suspected, a chest X-ray was performed. Aspiration pneumonia was defined as a lung infection developing after accidental inhalation of foods, liquids, or stomach contents and was diagnosed by chest X-ray; patient history served to confirm that no other form of lung disease was present.

Further management

If the patient's condition became unstable or respiratory difficulty was encountered, he/she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation. After discharge, each surviving patient was followed at the outpatient clinic for at least 1 month. If the patient had symptoms of dysphagia during follow-up, an upper GI series or EGD was performed to confirm the presence of stricture. Patients with GI or systemic complications were followed until these patients expired. Those with persistent dilatation were followed for over 7 years. The overall range of follow-up times, therefore, was 3 days to more than 7 years.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^4594b463]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — key considerations emphasize that pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red, and this flushing should not be interpreted as an allergic reaction. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas, and clinicians should be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching. Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are no longer being used and no longer available in commercial kits.

Pitfalls

Some non-ischemic conditions may have overlapping imaging features. Most notably, pneumatosis intestinalis may be found in any mechanical mucosal injury, increased mucosal permeability, infections, corticosteroid usage, organ transplantation, inflammation, certain pulmonary conditions with alveolar rupture and pneumatosis cystoides coli. Differentiation of this benign type of pneumatosis from its ominous counterpart as a sign of bowel necrosis might be challenging (Figs. 31, 32).

Establish the diagnosis of caustic agent ingestion. Identify the involved agent. Collect the product on the scene and bring it to the emergency department. If difficult product identification try to evaluate pH (< 2; > 10), but be aware that some agents cause a pH-independent corrosive injury. (Level 4–5)
Evaluate the ingestion scenario by: a) ascertain ingestion; b) determine the accidental or voluntary character; c) detect co-ingestion of alcohol and/or drugs; d) try to evaluate ingested quantity (in adults assess normal sip (30–50 ml) vs. large gulp (60–90 ml); e) assess delay from ingestion. (Level 4–5)
Identification of additional risk factors such as extreme ages (young children, elderly), pregnancy, underlying disease, and the form of the ingested agent (solid, liquid, gel, vapors-concomitant aspiration). (Level 5)
Supportive care rather than specific antidotes is the mainstay of treatment. Secure airway patency and hemodynamic stabilization. Prevent vomiting, repeat esophageal passage, and aspiration by: a) use of antiemetics (metoclopramide); b) seated 45° position during transport; c) avoid gastric lavage and induced emesis; d) avoid diluents (milk, water). (Level 5)
Avoid increasing damage by exothermic reaction: attempts at pH neutralization with either a weak alkali or acid are prohibited. (Level 5)

### Two cases of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide poisoning with portal venous gas treated using hyperbaric oxygen therapy [^cb4ffe51]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Clinical manifestations of hydrogen peroxide poisoning depend on the volume, concentration and type of exposure: ocular exposure causes irritation, blurred vision and subepithelial and conjunctival bullae at concentrations of 3%, ulcerationand even perforation of the cornea in concentrations above 10%. Chemical colitis in the case of hydrogen peroxide enemaand respiratory tract damage in the case of inhalation have been described.

The toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide poisoning are caused by three main mechanisms: direct irritation of tissues by the formation of corrosive lesions, lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes and the formation of oxygen. This latter effect is due to a reaction (2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂) mediated by an endogenous catalase, found in mucous membranes, liver, kidneys, erythrocytes and bone marrow. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide creates digestive tract irritation immediately after ingestion. Then, after absorption in the portal system, hydrogen peroxide produces an important volume of oxygen that can lead to the presence of a large amount of gas in the portal vein and potentially in the general circulation. It has been shown that 30 mL of 35% hydrogen peroxide can form up to 3.5 L of oxygen.

Most exposures occur through ingestion. This causes caustic lesions of the digestive mucosa, as well as the formation of gas bubbles responsible for pneumatosis of the digestive walls, portal venous gas, strokeand ischaemic coronary events. Most clinically significant systemic embolic phenomena occur within 10 hours but may also be delayed.

Both the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society in the USA and the European Committee for Hyperbaric Medicine have approved HBOT for gas embolism. HBOT consists of breathing 100% oxygen at a higher pressure than sea level. Due to the Boyle-Mariotte law, increased pressure results in decreased size of enclosed gas spaces, including bubbles in gas embolism situations, therefore restoring downstream blood flow. HBOT has been shown to reduce the risk of sequelae and mortality, particularly in the case of neurological or cardiac symptoms, or the presence of peripheral embolisation. Cases presenting with the presence of venous gas (eg, in portal vein) alone have also been successfully treated conservatively.

### Laboratory-acquired brucellosis [^f5dd5120]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

No evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. other than through occupational exposure, was identified for either laboratory worker. They denied traveling outside of the United States, consuming imported or domestic unpasteurized dairy products, knowing ill family or friends who may have traveled, attending events with potentially contaminated foods, or handling farm or laboratory animals. Both laboratory workers denied any accidental contamination or spills in the laboratory during the 6 months before their respective illnesses. Site visits to laboratories 1 and 2 were conducted by NYSDOH. On the open bench at laboratory 1, blood cultures were routinely subcultured onto agar. A syringe was used to directly plate contents of the blood culture media bottle onto agar. A Gram stain was then performed with additional contents from the syringe. The stain was fixed in an incubator. Subsequent biochemical tests, including a catalase test, which may generate aerosols by introducing hydrogen peroxide to the specimen, were performed on the open laboratory bench. At laboratory 2, subculturing occurred in a similar manner, but it took place in a class II biosafety cabinet. However, biochemical tests were performed on the open laboratory bench when Gram stain results indicated that spores were not present. Laboratory workers 1 and 2 wore gloves when processing specimens, and both denied having dermatitis or skin lesions on their hands.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of Sodium Thiosulfate Injection, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose, or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration greater than or equal to 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed in order to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

### Photo quiz: unusual phenotypic and lancefield group testing in blood culture isolate [^4b1bbc67]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

PHOTO QUIZ

A 55-year-old patient with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease presents with malaise and fever for approximately 1 week. On physical examination, he was found to have a painful lower extremity, and non-healing ulcer present for approximately a month. The ulcer is 3.0 cm in diameter and ulcerated with a hyperemic border. He has two dogs and a pet fish. No significant travel or vocational history is noted. Blood cultures are collected and submitted to the microbiology laboratory. Growth was detected in the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles after 16-hour incubation. A representative Gram stain of the blood cultures is pictured (Fig. 1A). Subcultured colonies were visible on the sheep blood agar (Fig. 1B: 48-hour incubation); there was no growth on MacConkey agar. Bubbles formed when the colony was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1C). Latex agglutination testing with the Lancefield group B reagent produced a weak reaction showing fine clumping (Fig. 1D). The VEREGENE System (Luminex) Gram-positive panel was negative. What is the diagnosis?

Coccidioidomycosis laboratory exposure — environmental remediation specifies that all surfaces and the outside of objects needed for continued use should be thoroughly cleaned with bleach at a 1:10 dilution or hydrogen peroxide (≥ 6%). Wetting and contact time are emphasized; ≥ 20 minutes is recommended, though disinfecting can be extended to sterilization and spore-killing if the time of exposure is extended to 6–10 hours. Personnel performing environmental remediation should wear N95 or other appropriate respirators, culture materials should be wetted with sporicide, bagged or placed in a covered bucket, autoclaved, and discarded whenever possible, and accidents in or near a biological safety cabinet should prompt negative room pressure and paraformaldehyde vapor decontamination.

### Long-term administration of N-acetylcysteine decreases hydrogen peroxide exhalation in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d7f4d6d6]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhale more hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid peroxidation products than healthy subjects. This may reflect oxidative stress in the airways that plays important role in the development and progression of COPD. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a mucolytic drug, possesses antioxidant properties as it is a precursor of reduced glutathione that together with glutathione peroxidase may decompose H2O2 and lipid peroxides. We aimed to determine the effect of NAC, 600 mg effervescent tablets (Fluimucil), once a day for 12 months, and placebo on the concentration of H2O2 and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) in expired breath condensate and serum levels of two lipid peroxidation products (TBARs, lipid peroxides) in patients with COPD. The study was performed as a double-blind, double-dummy comparison between active drug and placebo in two parallel groups. Forty-four outpatients with stable COPD (22 in the NAC group and 22 in the placebo group) completed the study. Specimens of expired breath condensate and serum were collected at the randomization visit and then every 3 months over 1 year. The concentration of TBARs and H2O2 in expired breath condensate was measured spectrofluorimetrically by the thiobarbituric acid and homovanillic acid methods, respectively. Serum levels of lipid peroxides were determined spectrophotometrically after extraction with butanol and pyridine. Initially, H2O2 exhalation did not differ between the placebo and NAC groups up to 6 months of treatment. After this the significant differences were observed. After 9 and 12 months of treatment NAC group exhaled 2.3-fold (0.17 ± 0.33 microM vs. 041 ± 0.26 microM, P < 0.04) [median 0.01 microM, quartile range (qr) = 0.22 vs. median 0.15 microM, qr = 0.43] and 2.6-fold (0.15 ± 0.23 microM vs. 0.40 ± 0.25 microN, P < 0.05) median = 0.00 microM, qr = 0.23 vs. median = 0.36 microM, qr = 0.51] less H2O2 than placebo receivers, respectively. No significant effect of NAC administration on TBARs exhalation and serum levels of TBARs and lipid peroxides were noted over the whole treatment period. Also no significant associations between exhaled H2O2 and concentrations of lipid peroxidation products were noted in both treatment groups at any time-point. These results indicate that long-term oral administration of NAC attenuates H2O2 formation in the airways of COPD subjects and prove anti-oxidant action of drug. However, further studies are necessary to estimate the clinical significance of this finding.

### Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency: diagnostic challenges and response to enzyme replacement therapy [^52bc02af]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Congenital sucrase-isomaltase (SI) deficiency is a rare genetic condition characterised by a deficiency in the brush-border SI enzyme, resulting in an inability to metabolise sucrose and starches. Six cases of congenital SI deficiency treated with Sucraid (sacrosidase, a yeast-derived enzyme that facilitates sucrose digestion) are described. Typical presenting symptoms were watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating, sometimes noticeably worse after ingestion of fruit. Diagnosis is challenging since conventional hydrogen breath testing after an oral sucrose load is impractical in young children, and many laboratories no longer look for maldigested sucrose using faecal sugar chromatography. Confirmation is by disaccharidase assay of duodenal or jejunal mucosa obtained endoscopically. All six patients showed little improvement following advice regarding dietary management, but experienced a marked reduction in symptoms with sacrosidase administration; no adverse events were reported. Sacrosidase is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with congenital SI deficiency. Gene testing and clinical trial of sacrosidase may become an alternative to endoscopic biopsies for diagnosis.

### Short-term inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by hydrogen peroxide in persistent nasopharyngeal carriers [^0d4d1547]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Patients inclusion criteria

Patients could be included if aged over 18 years, with documented SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with either continued positive swabs for more than 60 days or reappearance of positive swabs after the declared end of the disease (two consecutive negative swabs at the end of the quarantine period), last swab result: positive (less than 24 C t), without nasopharyngeal malformation or swallowing alterations, able to understand and provide written informed consent.

2.2 Patients source

Groups of family physicians and the Territorial Assistance and Prevention Service (ATS) of Milan were informed of our procedure and offered this possibility for long‐term carriers of SARS‐CoV‐2.

2.3 Procedure and laboratory test

Nasopharyngeal swabs were performed by brushing the pharynx through the oral cavity and the nasopharynx through both nasal choanae or only the open one in case of severe obstruction (i.e. septal deviation, polyps). 14, 15 The PCR commercial test used three pairs of primers designed to target RdRp, E, and N genes. The detection of these genes within 24 C t is reported as positive, above 24 C t as weak positive, and no amplification within 40 C t was considered negative. Neutralizing antibodies, directed against epitopes in the S1/S2 region of the virus, were detected through the LIAISON™ kit by DiaSorin.

2.4 Nasopharyngeal washing and swab schedule

A baseline nasopharyngeal swab was performed to check that the patient was still a carrier of SARS‐CoV‐2. Subsequently, patients were provided with Atomix® Wave™ kit for nasopharyngeal washing, filled the micropump, and cleaned both choanae once, bending forward. 16 The procedure was repeated using pure H₂O₂ 3% solution and patients were asked to wash their mouth and perform 2ʹ gargles and then spit, avoiding to swallow. Daily nasal cleaning with Atomix® Wave™ was indicated for 14 days. The patients repeated swabs at 24, 48, and 72 h, and, if still negative, at 7 and 14 days.

2.5 Ethical aspects

The procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The Luigi Sacco Hospital Ethics Committee was informed, but since no Investigational New Drug was involved, specific approval was deemed unnecessary.

Written informed consent was obtained before any procedure was performed.

Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with CYANOKIT has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with CYANOKIT, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^4d95f120]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide — microbicidal activity and effective concentrations/times: A 0.5% accelerated hydrogen peroxide demonstrated bactericidal and virucidal activity in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal activity in 5 minutes, and organisms with high cellular catalase activity required 30–60 minutes of exposure to 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for a 108 reduction in cell counts whereas organisms with lower catalase activity required only 15 minutes' exposure. For spores, a complete kill of 106 spores occurred with a 10% concentration and a 60-minute exposure time, while a 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven exposure trials. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B. atrophaeus spores and a ≥ 105 decrease when tested against 31 other pathogens in 30 minutes at 20°C. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times and caused only a 2-log10 reduction in the number of Acanthamoeba cysts in approximately 2 hours. A 7% stabilized hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20 minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal (3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution, and the 7% solution was sporicidal (> 7 log10 reduction in 6 hours).

### Acute hydrogen sulfide poisoning in a dairy farmer [^d7a9a863]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

INTRODUCTION. Hydrogen sulfide is a lipid-soluble gas produced in occupational settings and from decaying organic matter. We present a 36-year-old man who developed acute respiratory arrest from hydrogen sulfide poisoning while performing work as a dairy farmer.

Case Report

The subject entered a poorly ventilated tank containing degrading eggs and, within seconds, collapsed. Coworkers were able to extract him within minutes but he was apneic. He was intubated by emergency medical services and subsequently managed with supportive care in the intensive care unit. Upon admission, a powerful rotten egg scent was noted and a hydrogen sulfide poisoning was suspected. Serum analysis for the presence of thiosulfate confirmed the diagnosis. Nitrite therapy was not administered as the subject arrived outside of the therapeutic window of effectiveness and showed evidence of excellent oxygenation. His examinations following arrival were consistent with an anoxic brain injury which slowly improved several months after the incident with intensive neuro-rehabilitation.

Discussion

Hydrogen sulfide is a mitochondrial toxin and inhibits cytochrome-aa(3) and prevents cellular aerobic metabolism. Therapies for toxic exposures include removal from the contaminated environment, ventilation with 100% oxygen, and nitrite therapy if administered immediately after exposure. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has anecdotal support and remains controversial.

Conclusion

Hydrogen sulfide is a significant occupational health hazard. Education, personal protective equipment, and early treatment are important in improving outcomes.

### Circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^a01e7221]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

COPD is a major and increasing global health problem and is currently the third leading cause of death in the world.

COPD is defined as a preventable and treatable disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response of the airways and the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall severity in individual patients. COPD results from the interplay between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental stimuli. A well established genetic cause of COPD is α₁ antitrypsin deficiency whereas, among environmental stimuli, cigarette smoking is the main cause. Other exposures, such as outdoor air pollution, occupational exposure to dusts and fumes, exposure to second-hand smoke, and biomass smoke inhalation might increase the risk of and lead to disease in nonsmokers. Cigarette smoke in particular contains 10¹⁷ oxidant molecules per puff. Such exposure causes direct injury of airway epithelial cells leading to airway inflammation in which a variety of cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, are involved. Proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released and, if not sufficiently counterbalanced by antiproteases and antioxidant factors, will produce further damage. The term ROS indicates a large variety of free oxygen radicals such as superoxide anion (O₂⁻) and hydroxyl radical (OH⁻), but also derivatives of oxygen that do not contain unpaired electrons, such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Formation of ROS takes place constantly in every cell during normal metabolic processes. Moreover, activated phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages produce large amounts of ROS when are stimulated by encounter inhaled particles or other mediators of inflammation. When ROS are produced in excess of the antioxidant defense mechanisms, oxidative stress occurs resulting in harmful effects, including damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Although the pathogenesis of COPD remains incompletely understood, the central role of oxidative stress in this regard is well established (Fig. 1).

### An increase in healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection associated with use of a defective peracetic acid-based surface disinfectant [^2976571c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND We investigated an increase in the incidence of healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that occurred following a change from a bleach disinfectant to a peracetic acid-based disinfectant. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of the peracetic acid-based disinfectant. DESIGN Laboratory-based product evaluation. METHODS The commercial peracetic acid-based product is activated on site by mixing a small volume of concentrated hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid present in a "SmartCap" reservoir with the remaining contents of the container. We measured concentrations of peracetic acid in newly activated and in-use product and determined the stability of nonactivated and activated product. We tested the efficacy of the product against C. difficile spores using the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method. RESULTS Measured concentrations of peracetic acid (50–800 parts per million [ppm]) were significantly lower than the level stated on the product label (1,500 ppm), and similar results were obtained for containers from multiple lot numbers and from another hospital. Product with peracetic acid levels below 600 ppm had significantly reduced activity against C. difficile spores. Peracetic acid concentrations were reduced markedly after storage of either activated or nonactivated product for several weeks. The Environmental Protection Agency confirmed the finding of low disinfectant levels and ordered discontinuation of sale of the product. CONCLUSION Use of a defective peracetic acid-based surface disinfectant may have contributed to an increase in healthcare-associated CDI. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating the efficacy of liquid disinfectants in healthcare settings. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017;38:300–305.
