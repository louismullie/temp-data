## Question

Can Farxiga be used in patients with a history of CABG and heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can be used in patients with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's labeled indications and whether CABG history changes anything. Then, I should verify the pivotal heart failure trials and whether patients with prior CABG were included and benefited. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure and in patients with coronary artery disease. After that, I need to check safety considerations, especially around surgery and renal function. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with dosing and monitoring advice, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications, because I need to ensure I'm not overextending beyond evidence. Dapagliflozin is FDA-approved for heart failure to reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, and for chronic kidney disease, with benefits regardless of diabetes status, which directly supports use in heart failure patients including those with prior CABG if they meet HF criteria [^ef7e9e9c] [^ab2f73cc].

> Wait, let me verify whether prior CABG excludes patients from benefit or safety. The DAPA-HF trial enrolled patients with HFrEF and allowed prior coronary revascularization, and subgroup analyses explicitly included patients with ischemic etiology and prior MI/revascularization, showing consistent benefit of dapagliflozin on the primary composite of CV death or worsening HF without safety signals specific to ischemic etiology, which supports use after CABG in appropriate HF patients [^6bc7becf] [^e42c8e7a].

> I should confirm whether benefits extend to HFpEF, since many post-CABG patients have HF across the EF spectrum. The DELIVER trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the composite of CV death or worsening HF in HFmrEF/HFpEF, and pooled analyses show consistent benefits across EF strata, including in those with prior MI, which strengthens the case for use after CABG when HF is present regardless of EF [^539cb328] [^b0123991].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. Contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines recommend initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor in symptomatic HFrEF and in HFmrEF/HFpEF to reduce HF hospitalization and CV death, and they do not restrict use based on prior CABG; in fact, ESC chronic coronary syndromes guidance also supports SGLT2 inhibitors in CAD patients with HF, which fits the post-CABG population [^6335374c] [^86225d9c] [^9931416f].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and perioperative considerations, because CABG patients may face future surgery. Guidelines advise holding SGLT2 inhibitors for at least 3 days before scheduled surgery, including CABG, due to perioperative ketoacidosis risk; this is a temporary precaution and does not contraindicate chronic use otherwise, and I need to ensure I don't conflate pre-op holds with chronic therapy decisions [^355a6721] [^6b2ba2a8].

> I need to check renal thresholds and monitoring, since CKD is common post-CABG. Dapagliflozin is generally initiated down to eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73 m², with an expected modest eGFR dip that should not trigger automatic discontinuation; I should confirm that this applies to HF indications and that benefits persist even with lower eGFR, which is supported by labeling and consensus pathways [^1af49ada] [^9b01a5b7].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions and practical dosing, because CABG patients are often on multiple agents. Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily is the standard dose for HF, with no meaningful interactions with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, MRAs, or antiplatelets, and its benefit is additive to GDMT; I should double-check that no dose adjustment is needed with these co-therapies, which is consistent with trial designs and labeling [^6ad85e26] [^7d564301].

> But wait, what if the heart failure is new or recently decompensated after CABG? I should confirm timing. While DAPA-HF enrolled chronic, stable HFrEF and excluded recent ACS or surgery, DELIVER included patients randomized during or within 30 days of HF hospitalization and still showed benefit; thus, once hemodynamically stable, initiation is reasonable, and early benefit has been observed within weeks, which supports not delaying indicated therapy unnecessarily [^ab2f73cc] [^cf6c0d61].

> I will now examine whether diabetes status changes the calculus, because some post-CABG patients have diabetes. Benefits of dapagliflozin in HF are consistent in people with and without diabetes, so diabetes presence neither mandates nor precludes use; I should confirm that this applies across EF spectra, which is supported by DAPA-HF and DELIVER analyses [^6ad85e26] [^539cb328].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting statements I might have seen about "contraindications" post-CABG. I initially worried there might be a formal contraindication, but I should correct that: there is no guideline-listed contraindication to dapagliflozin solely due to prior CABG; the key precautions are perioperative holding and standard renal/function assessments, not avoidance of chronic therapy in appropriate HF patients [^355a6721] [^6335374c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can be used in patients with a history of CABG who have heart failure, provided they meet HF diagnostic criteria and are hemodynamically stable, with attention to renal function and perioperative planning; the evidence base and guidelines support initiation to reduce HF hospitalization and CV death across HFrEF and HFpEF phenotypes, with standard 10 mg daily dosing and routine safety monitoring [^ef7e9e9c] [^6335374c] [^86225d9c].

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is **indicated for heart failure** [^ef7e9e9c] and is appropriate for patients with a history of CABG, as it reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization regardless of diabetes status [^6ad85e26]. It is **not contraindicated after CABG** and can be used alongside standard heart failure therapies, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNIs, and MRAs [^7d564301]. Hold dapagliflozin for at least 3 days before scheduled surgery, including CABG, due to ketoacidosis risk [^355a6721] [^6b2ba2a8]. Monitor renal function and volume status, and use caution in patients with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² or those at risk of hypotension [^1af49ada] [^9b01a5b7].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dapagliflozin use in heart failure patients with prior CABG

- **DAPA-HF trial**: Dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure by 26% in HFrEF, with consistent benefits in patients with ischemic etiology, including those with prior CABG [^6ad85e26] [^6bc7becf].

- **DELIVER trial**: Dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure in HFmrEF/HFpEF, including patients with prior myocardial infarction and revascularization [^539cb328] [^b0123991].

- **Pooled analyses**: Benefits are consistent across ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies, supporting use after CABG [^e42c8e7a] [^dc68f542].

---

## Safety considerations in patients with prior CABG

- **Perioperative ketoacidosis risk**: Hold dapagliflozin ≥ 3 days before scheduled surgery, including CABG, due to euglycemic ketoacidosis risk [^355a6721] [^6b2ba2a8].

- **Renal function**: Use caution if eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; monitor renal function and volume status regularly [^1af49ada] [^9b01a5b7].

- **Hypotension**: Monitor for hypotension, especially with diuretics or ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNIs [^7d564301].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ESC 2021/2023 guidelines recommend SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, for HFrEF and HFmrEF/HFpEF to reduce cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization, **irrespective of diabetes status** [^6335374c] [^9931416f]. ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines similarly endorse SGLT2 inhibitors as foundational therapy for HFrEF, with benefits across ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies [^c8eb4eb1].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Stable heart failure patient with prior CABG | Initiate dapagliflozin 10 mg daily if eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² |
| Scheduled CABG or other major surgery | Hold dapagliflozin ≥ 3 days preoperatively |
| eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² | Use caution; monitor closely |
| Concomitant diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNIs | Monitor for hypotension and volume depletion |

---

## Conclusion and clinical stance

Dapagliflozin is **appropriate for patients with heart failure and prior CABG**, reducing cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization across EF phenotypes. It should be integrated with guideline-directed therapy, with perioperative holding and routine monitoring of renal function and volume status.

Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a history of CVD

A total of 128 MACE plus UA events were observed in the subgroup of patients with a history of CVD; 67 events in patients receiving dapagliflozin and 61 events in patients receiving control [HR 0.806; 95% CI (0.562, 1.156)] (Fig. 1). A total of 95 MACE events were observed in this subgroup; 50 in patients receiving dapagliflozin and 45 in patients receiving control [HR 0.802; 95% CI (0.527, 1.221)] (Fig. 1). The risk for MACE events with dapagliflozin compared with control in patients without a history of CVD also favoured dapagliflozin [HR 0.646; 95% (0.336, 1.241)] (Fig. 4). The pattern of beneficial or neutral point estimates for all individual types of CV events in dapagliflozin- compared with control-treated patients and a beneficial point estimate for dapagliflozin versus control for hospitalisation for heart failure, was also seen in this population (Fig. 3). This was also true for MI, where similar results were observed in the overall population and patients with a history of CVD, albeit with fewer events in the latter population.

When patients were considered according to types of CVD history (Fig. 6 a) or number of distinct CVD types experienced in their history (according to the same classes; Fig. 6 b), there was no increase in risk for MACE in patients treated with dapagliflozin compared with those treated with control.

Methods

Patient population

Data from Phase 2b studies of 12–24 weeks' duration (five studies), and all Phase 3 studies of up to 208 weeks' duration (16 studies) from the dapagliflozin clinical development programme in patients with T2DM, with the exception of an open-label Japanese study, were included (Additional file 1: Table S1). These studies compared dapagliflozin 2.5–10 mg with control (placebo or comparator treatment) as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lowering therapies, including metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. Methods for each individual study have previously been published. All clinical study protocols were approved by the relevant institutional review boards/ethics committees and all enrolled patients provided written informed consent.

Analyses of CV outcomes were performed in several populations:
In the overall population, comparison of CV outcomes according to the number of CV risk factors present in addition to T2DM. Cardiovascular risk factors included: age > 65 years, history of CVD, history of hypertension, history of dyslipidaemia, smoking history, first degree family members with a history of premature coronary heart disease, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2.
In a subpopulation with a history of CVD: Comparison of CV outcomes according to the types of previous CVD events experienced and the number of different CVD event types in a patient's history. The types of previous CVD events were defined as: coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction [MI], hospitalisation for unstable angina [UA], coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention or stable angina), cerebrovascular disease (carotid artery disease, carotid endarterectomy or stenting, stroke or transient ischaemic attack), peripheral vascular disease (amputation, peripheral vascular disease or peripheral vascular surgery) or congestive heart failure (CHF).
In a subpopulation of elderly patients aged ≥ 65 years with a history of both CVD and hypertension.
Comparison of patients with or without hypoglycaemia prior to MACE in both the overall population and the subpopulation of patients with a history of CVD.

inhibitors: from the search for new glucose‐lowering agents to success in heart failure trials

SGLT2 inhibitors were initially evaluated as glucose‐lowering drugs, but CV outcome trials unexpectedly and consistently showed that they reduced major adverse CV events and hospitalization for HF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In 2019, DAPA‐HF (Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcome in Heart Failure) was the first trial demonstrating a significant benefit of a SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with established HFrEF, regardless of diabetes history, with a 26% reduction in the risk of the composite endpoint of CV death or worsening HF (hospitalization or an urgent visit requiring intravenous therapy for HF). Each of the three components of the composite outcome occurred less frequently in the treatment group. In 2020, the EMPEROR‐Reduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and a Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial confirmed the results of DAPA‐HF in a population with slightly different eligibility criteria, recruiting patients with more severe HF than in DAPA‐HF. Particularly, inclusion criteria required patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 31%–40% to have had at least one HF hospitalization in the last 12 months or progressively higher thresholds of natriuretic peptides for increasing LVEF values. The combined risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF was 25% lower among the patients who received empagliflozin than among those on placebo. Results were primarily driven by a 31% lower risk of hospitalization for HF, whereas reduction in CV mortality did not reach statistical significance. In both trials treatment effects were not different in patients with or without diabetes. Both these trials were developed in chronic, stable patients, excluding those with current acute decompensated HF (or an hospitalization due to decompensated HF within 4 weeks prior to enrolment) and those with a recent CV event (i.e. myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or other major CV surgery, stroke or transient ischaemic attack 90 days prior to enrolment).

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to aetiology in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the DAPA-HF trial [^26f8d156]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past decades, a global transition in the aetiology of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has occurred from hypertension and rheumatic valvular disease to coronary artery disease. Thus, in many parts of the world, coronary artery disease has become the most common cause of HFrEF. A distinction between ischaemic and non‐ischaemic aetiology is important for several reasons. First, certain evidence‐based therapies may be indicated in specific aetiologies, for example bypass graft surgery for coronary artery disease. Second, HFrEF of ischaemic origin may portend a worse prognosis than HFrEF due to non‐ischaemic causes. Third, the effectiveness of certain treatments for HFrEF may be modified by aetiology, for example that of the implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and milrinone. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the effectiveness of new HFrEF treatments in both patients with ischaemic and non‐ischaemic aetiology.

In the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse‐outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA‐HF), the sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, added to conventional guideline‐recommended therapies reduced the risk of worsening HF events, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause mortality, and improved symptoms, in 4744 patients with HFrEF with and without type 2 diabetes. The proposed improved myocardial energetics with SGLT2 inhibition may suggest more benefit in patients with coronary artery disease causing myocardial ischaemia. Likewise, any haemodynamic effects to improve loading conditions might also be more beneficial in a patient with a propensity to myocardial ischaemia. Other proposed mechanisms of action, e.g. improvement in microvascular function and reduced fibrosis, may be more important in patients with coronary disease (and patients with diabetes who are more likely to have coronary disease). In this pre‐specified subgroup analysis of DAPA‐HF, we investigated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin compared with placebo according to investigator‐reported HF aetiology.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^6b2ba2a8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are described as having well-documented cardiovascular benefits in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with type 2 diabetes and in heart failure (HF); semaglutide reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase risks including urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury, and due to perioperative ketoacidosis risk canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days before scheduled surgery including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After myocardial infarction (MI), efficacy and safety have been evaluated in 2 large trials; in patients without diabetes or HF and with acute MI and impaired left ventricular systolic function, dapagliflozin did not reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization, although empagliflozin reduced HF hospitalizations in this population. No new safety concerns were identified, and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred at hospital discharge in patients with an indication.

SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists — use around acute coronary syndrome (ACS), perioperative precautions, and post–myocardial infarction (MI) trial data: The cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well documented in stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and type 2 diabetes, as well as in heart failure (HF) regardless of diabetes status. GLP-1 receptor agonists may lead to weight loss, and semaglutide has been shown to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in overweight or obese patients with stable ASCVD but has not been studied early after ACS. SGLT-2 inhibitors may increase the risk of urinary tract infection, genital mycotic infection, hypovolemia, and acute kidney injury; due to a higher risk of perioperative diabetic and euglycemic ketoacidosis, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should be stopped ≥ 3 days and ertugliflozin ≥ 4 days prior to scheduled surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Efficacy and safety have been studied in 2 large trials after MI: in patients without diabetes or HF, dapagliflozin was not shown to reduce cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization in acute MI with impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function, and empagliflozin did not significantly reduce all-cause death or first HF hospitalization in similar patients, although HF hospitalizations were reduced; no new safety concerns were identified and use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor does not need to be deferred in indicated patients at hospital discharge.

### The win ratio in cardiology trials: lessons learnt, new developments, and wise future use [^eec018f7]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Adjusting a quantitative outcome for the competing risk of death

Many HF trials have quantitative outcomes, e.g. KCCQ score, recorded at several visits, with death being an informative censoring. Simple quantitative analyses assuming deaths missing at random can mislead. To overcome this, the DELIVER trialused a win ratio analysis for a hierarchical composite of death and KCCQ-TSS at 8 months, recognizing prior death as a worse outcome. The consequent win ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 1.03–1.21; P = 0.009) demonstrated that dapagliflozin improved HF symptoms, a valuable secondary finding.

The RECHARGE trialsextend the same principle, a hierarchical composite of death and quality of life, into a longer-term evaluation of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in female and ethnic minority patients with multi-vessel or left main coronary artery disease. The hierarchy comprises (i) time to death over 3–5 years and (ii) time-averaged change from baseline in the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) version 2 questionnaire, which is measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter (with 5-point margin). The consequent win ratio captures the essence of a hierarchy of relevance to patients: (i) do I know who lived longer? and (ii) if not, who experienced the better quality of life? This bypasses many of the complexities and controversies in previous trials of PCI vs. CABG using conventional composites of death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and revascularization.

In general, for a quantitative outcome in the composite hierarchy, it is good practice to use an average value across several time points to better capture the overall effect.

### Cardiovascular benefit of empagliflozin across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk factor control in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^33f81317]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The other main finding of the current analysis is that the cardioprotective effect of empagliflozin was evident regardless of the number of risk factors controlled at baseline in both women and men. Thus, even in patients with well-controlled traditional CV risk factors, the risk for CV death, hospitalization for heart failure, CV death or hospitalization for heart failure, and 3P-MACE associated with T2D is reduced with empagliflozin. This is, moreover, consistent with previous subgroup analyses of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which found CV risk reduction regardless of prior coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, microvascular disease, the risk of CV disease or heart failure, age, sex, glycemic control, or incident hypoglycemia. Thus, CV risk reduction with empagliflozin does not seem to be affected by the presence of CV comorbidities or classic risk factors. Moreover, the CV benefit with empagliflozin was also evident irrespective of control of HbA1c, SBP, DBP, and LDL cholesterol during the trial, emphasizing that empagliflozin offers CV protection, which is additive to the benefits of controlling conventional CV risk factors.

The mechanism for this reduction in CV risk has not been clearly defined. The pharmacodynamic effect of empagliflozin is to increase glucosuria and natriuresis, achieved via inhibition of the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal tubule of the kidney. This leads to reductions in plasma volume, increases in hematocrit, and decreases in arterial stiffness and vascular resistance. An exploratory mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial suggested that changes in markers of plasma volume were the most important mediators of the reduction in CV deaths. Other hypotheses proposed to explain the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors include improved myocardial bioenergetics via a shift in fuel source from glucose to ketone bodies, inhibition of the cardiomyocyte sodium-hydrogen exchanger, and antifibrotic effects in the heart. The fact that these proposed mechanisms do not involve conventional CV risk factors might explain the consistent treatment effect of empagliflozin in our analysis. Incidentally, a recent analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that changes in classic risk factors appeared to explain only a small proportion of the CV effects observed. The recent DAPA-HF trial suggests that glucose-lowering plays little part in the amelioration of heart failure, at least, by SGLT2 inhibitors, as almost identical risk reductions for heart failure were seen in individuals with and without T2D.

### Dapagliflozin for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: will the DELIVER study deliver? [^5aeb27fd]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Similarities and differences between the DELIVER and EMPEROR-preserved trials.

Table adapted from ClinicalTrials.gov and Anker et al.

ADHF acute decompensated heart failure, AF atrial fibrillation, CABG coronary artery bypass graft, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, HHF hospitalisation for heart failure, IV intravenous, KCCQ Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, lvef left ventricular ejection fraction, MI myocardial infarction, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, NT-pro BNP N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, NYHA New York Heart Association, SBP systolic blood pressure, TIA transient ischaemic attack

The primary outcome in both studies includes the time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death or HHF, though the DELIVER trial also includes urgent heart failure visits such as to the emergency department or outpatient clinic in addition to hospitalisation. This is noteworthy, because whilst hospitalisation is a major determinant for quality of life and health expenditure outcomes, the use of extra outpatient or emergency department costs is often overlooked. As secondary outcomes, both trials will report on HHF, cardiovascular and all-cause death and quality of life outcomes using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). However, the EMPEROR-preserved trial will also report on changes in eGFR, time to chronic dialysis, renal transplant or sustained reduction of eGFR and rates of incident diabetes in those using empagliflozin whilst these secondary outcomes have not yet been pre-specified for the DELIVER trial.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to background use of cardiovascular medications… [^7d564301]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of a composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure, HHF alone, and progression of kidney disease regardless of background use of CV medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, β-blockers, diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, without any treatment interaction for key safety events. Baseline CV medication use was a prespecified subgroup of interest and collected at enrollment, including data on ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, diuretics, and MRAs. The trial had prespecified dual-primary efficacy outcomes: a composite of CV death or HHF and a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. 2, 11 The present analyses focus on CV death/HHF, as there was no effect of dapagliflozin on MACE demonstrated in the overall trial.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was defined as having a prespecified EF cut point of less than 45% with a reported history of HF. Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV death/HHF regardless of the background use of CV medications, including ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, diuretics, and MRAs. The reduction in CV death/HHF with dapagliflozin also did not differ between patients with the concurrent use of all 3 of ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, and diuretics and those with 2 or fewer of these medications. Even in patients receiving ACEI/ARBs + β-blockers + diuretics, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death/HHF and of the kidney-specific outcome by 24% and 38%, respectively. There were no significant treatment interactions by the concomitant CV medications for adverse events, including symptoms of volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia.

on MACE was only different between patients with and without diuretic use at baseline. 1 In the VERTIS CV trial, subgroup analyses of CV death/HHF outcomes by background use of CV medications were reported, although ertugliflozin.

### DIGitoxin to improve ouTcomes in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (DIGIT-HF): baseline characteristics compared to recent randomized controlled heart failure trials [^744909f7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The higher proportion of patients with a history of myocardial revascularizations (percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass grafting) in DIGIT‐HF supports the enrolment of a patient population with more pronounced disease compared to PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced. Comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors in DIGIT‐HF were comparable to PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced with a high prevalence of hypertension (~75%), obesity (~35%) and diabetes mellitus (~40%). However, the proportion of patients with diabetes was highest in the trials investigating the effects of SGLT2i in HFrEF (DAPA‐HF: 42%, EMPEROR‐Reduced: 50%). This is most likely a result of the trial protocols ensuring the enrolment of a certain percentage of patients with diabetes. Due to the pharmacokinetic profile of digitoxin, DIGIT‐HF omitted implementing stringent selection criteria for renal function parameters; only patients with concomitant severe kidney and liver disease were excluded. Therefore, patients with more impaired renal function were expected to be recruited in DIGIT‐HF compared to other HFrEF trials. However, renal function was similar in DIGIT‐HF compared to PARADIGM‐HF, DAPA‐HF, and EMPEROR‐Reduced with an average eGFR of ~65 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and ~40% of patients showing an eGFR of < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Depending on the final trial results of DIGIT‐HF and DECISION, digitoxin could be an important treatment option, especially in patients with progressive renal dysfunction or kidney failure, for whom therapy and/or dose escalation with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, ARNI, SGLT2i is problematic or no option. In these patient group, digitoxin appears to be preferable over digoxin because of its compensatory entero‐hepatic elimination, whereas digoxin may hit toxic concentrations due to its mainly renal excretion.

Of the 11 007 patients randomized in DAPA-HF and DELIVER, 2 were excluded due to missing history related to PAD. Median follow-up was 22 months (IQR 17–30 months).

Patient characteristics

A total of 809 patients (7.4%) had a history of PAD at baseline. The prevalence was 7.8% and 7.0% in patients with a LVEF ≤ 40% and > 40%, respectively. The prevalence in men was 8.6% compared with 5.0% in women and 9.3% in patients with Type 2 diabetes compared to 5.9% in those without.

Patients with PAD were more often men and White and slightly older than patients without PAD (Table 1). They were more likely to have a history of smoking, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and a prior stroke but less likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation. Patients with PAD also had lower eGFR and body mass index. Although patients with PAD had a longer duration of HF, they had a similar average LVEF and NYHA class distribution, no difference in the rate of prior HF hospitalization, and only marginal differences in KCCQ scores and NT-proBNP levels. Patients with PAD more often had HFrEF compared to patients without PAD.

Baseline characteristics according to a history of PAD

Regarding pharmacological therapy, patients with PAD were more frequently treated with a statin and antiplatelet therapy but less likely to receive an MRA, than those without PAD. They were also more likely to have a cardiac defibrillator.

### Arrhythmia and death following percutaneous revascularization in ischemic left ventricular dysfunction: prespecified analyses from the REVIVED-BCIS2 trial [^081a6b0a]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

In the preliminary report of the REVIVED-BCIS2 trial, appropriate ICD therapies tended to be less frequently observed at 2 years in patients assigned to have PCI, in the subgroup who had a device implanted at baseline or within the first 90 days. The current report extends arrhythmia follow-up of this subgroup and reveals that, when the entire duration of the trial is considered and competing mortality is accounted for, PCI is not associated with a reduction in aborted sudden death. This is consistent with the occurrence of the primary outcome in the entire trial cohort, which was not different between treatment arms. The recruited population was younger than the median age of patients newly diagnosed with heart failure in the United Kingdombut older than in other randomized trials in this field (mean ages: MADIT II [Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation 2 Trial], 64 years; MUSTT [Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial], 67 years; PROTECT-II [Prospective, Multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial of the IMPELLA RECOVER LP 2.5 System Versus Intra Aortic Balloon Pump [IABP] in Patients Undergoing Non Emergent High Risk PCI], 68 years; DAPA HF [Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure Trial], 66 years; CABG PATCH [Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patch], 63 years; DANISH [Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality], 63 years; STICH [Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure Trial], 59 years; REVIVED-BCIS 2, 70 years). –

### Validation of the WATCH-DM and TRS-HFRisk scores to predict the risk of incident hospitalization for heart failure among adults with type 2 diabetes: a multicohort analysis [^d51964ec]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Among HF risk scores developed specifically for patients with T2D, the WATCH‐DM (weight [body mass index], age, hypertension, creatinine, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes control [fasting plasma glucose {FPG}], ECG QRS duration, myocardial infarction [MI], and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) and TRS‐HF DM (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] risk score for heart failure in diabetes) risk scores have demonstrated good performance to predict short‐term risk of HF among adults with T2D.WATCH‐DM was developed to predict 5‐year incident HF risk using data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial (median follow‐up, 4.9 years) and externally validated among participants with diabetes from the Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) (median follow‐up, 4.8 years) and pooled community cohorts (up to 5 years).TRS‐HF DM was developed in the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus‐Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR‐TIMI 53) trial (median follow up, 2.1 years) and externally validated in Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events‐Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE‐TIMI 58) (median follow up, 4.2 years) and ACCORD trial cohorts to predict risk of HF hospitalization among patients with as well as without a history of HF.HF risk stratification is more relevant in patients without a history of HF, especially among those with T2D, in whom there is considerable heterogeneity in risk for developing HF and SGLT2i have emerged as important preventive therapies. In contrast, patients with established HF are at high risk for complications and warrant aggressive implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy, including SGLT2i. Both scores have demonstrated good performance in predicting HF risk among individuals without history of HF, highlighting their utility for risk stratification. However, performance of the WATCH‐DM and TRS‐HF DM scores to predict incident HF risk across cohorts with different baseline risk and among contemporary patients outside the clinical trial setting is uncertain. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of the WATCH‐DM and TRS‐HF DM risk scores for incident HF risk prediction in 3 separate cohorts: participants with higher atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden from the TECOS (Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes With Sitagliptin) and participants with lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk from the Look AHEAD (Look Action for Health in Diabetes) trial, and a real‐world cohort of patients from the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center.

Study Overview: The Emperor-Reduced and Emperor-Preserved Trials

The EMPEROR-reduced and EMPEROR-preserved trials are phase III international, multicentre, randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, placebo‐controlled trials investigating the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg daily in addition to standard medical therapy in participants with either HFrEF or HFpEF, respectively, followed up over a median of approximately 20–24 months. The EMPEROR-reduced trial commenced in March 2017 and is due to complete in July 2020, with over 3700 participants enrolled. The EMPEROR-preserved trial enrolled almost 6000 participants, starting in March 2017, and is due to finish in November 2020. The study design and key inclusion/exclusion criteria are presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1, respectively. For both trials, the primary outcome is time to first event of the combined risk for cardiovascular death or HHF. Prespecified secondary outcomes include HHF events, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, time to chronic dialysis, renal transplant or sustained reduction of eGFR, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, time to onset of diabetes and changes in clinical summary score of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^e7e84972]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite extensive progress in the field of interventional therapy, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is still high. Risk factors such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), atrial fibrillation, high coronary disease burden, low ejection fraction, and advanced age may worsen the prognosis of such patients. SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown to improve cardiorenal endpoints in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), CKD, and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that SGLT2i improved the admission rate of cardiovascular mortality and HF in patients with a long-term history of MI. However, it is not clear whether SGLT2i can improve outcomes in patients with AMI.

Considering the residual risk under current treatment strategies and the growing clinical evidence that support the use of SGLT2i, patients with a long term coronary artery disease are more likely to suffer from coexisting SGLT2i indications (such as T2DM or HF). Therefore, it is difficult to directly determine whether the benefit of SGLT2i observed in patients with T2DM or HF may also benefit those with concomitant AMI. Despite the contiguous spectrum of treatments, trials in those with AMI are needed to validate consistent treatment effects. At present, there is a large gap in evidence regarding SGLT2i in the HF risk spectrum of patients with AMI. Previous studies on the benefits of SGLT2i in patients with HF have primarily focused on HF stages A/C/D; however, fewer studies have evaluated HF stage B patients with AMI, i.e. the presence of cardiac structural changes without any clinical signs of HF. However, this population constitutes a considerable proportion of patients with HF. Unfortunately, in previous large-scale studies (EMPA-REG OUTCOME (BI 10,773 [Empagliflozin] Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients), CANVAS (CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study), CREDENCE (Computed Tomographic Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Determinants of Myocardial Ischemia), and others), these patients were completely excluded at the time of enrollment. Thus, there are several questions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of SGLT2i in patients with AMI that need to be answered via clinical studies.

In the present study, the association between dapagliflozin (DAPA), an SGLT2i, and MACE in patients with AMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was explored. In addition, the effects of DAPA on coronary artery disease-related indicators were evaluated.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to aetiology in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the DAPA-HF trial [^6bc7becf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this pre‐specified analysis of DAPA‐HF, the risk of cardiovascular death and all‐cause death was higher in patients with an ischaemic aetiology compared to those with a non‐ischaemic aetiology, whereas the risk of HF hospitalization was lower in patients with ischaemic aetiology. Furthermore, dapagliflozin, added to conventional guideline‐recommended therapies, reduced the risk of worsening HF events, cardiovascular death, and all‐cause death, and improved symptoms, to a similar extent in both patients with and without an ischaemic aetiology.

Baseline characteristics and outcomes according to aetiology

The proportion of patients with an investigator‐reported ischaemic aetiology was similar to that of four recent HFrEF trials. The present analysis of DAPA‐HF demonstrated substantial differences in the clinical profile between HFrEF patients with and without an ischaemic aetiology, most of which confirmed prior findings. In DAPA‐HF, patients with ischaemic aetiology were older, more often male and white and had a slightly higher ejection fraction and symptom burden than those with non‐ischaemic aetiology. As expected, patients with an ischaemic aetiology were also more likely to have a previous myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization, and type 2 diabetes and were more frequently treated with antiplatelet agents, statins, and implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators. An interesting observation was the high proportion of patients with non‐ischaemic aetiology who were treated with antiplatelet agents and statins. Although data on the indications for prescribing these drugs were not available, it most likely reflects that approximately 40% and 7% of patients with non‐ischaemic aetiology had type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease, respectively. However, the evidence that statins are beneficial in HF patients with or without coronary artery disease is lacking. The same is likely true of antiplatelet agents, and other antithrombotic therapies are not beneficial in HFrEF.

---

### The design and rationale for the dapagliflozin effect on cardiovascular events (DECLARE)-TIMI 58 trial [^1056050b]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by promoting glycosuria via inhibiting urinary glucose reabsorption. In addition to improving blood glucose control, treatment with dapagliflozin results in glucose-induced osmotic diuresis, weight loss, and blood pressure lowering. Previous trials of SGLT-2 inhibitors showed reductions in cardiovascular (CV) events, including CV death and hospitalization for heart failure, and ischemic events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Research Design and Methods

DECLARE-TIMI 58 (NCT01730534) is a phase 3b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the CV safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin that has completed randomization of 17,160 patients with T2DM and a history of either established ASCVD (n = 6,971) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (n = 10,189). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo. The primary safety outcome is the time to the first event of the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke (major adverse cardiovascular events; MACEs). The co-primary efficacy outcomes are the composite of CV death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke and the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure. This event-driven trial will continue until at least 1,390 subjects have a MACE outcome, thereby providing > 99% power to test for the primary outcome of safety of dapagliflozin measured by rejecting the hypothesis that the upper bound of the CI > 1.3 for the primary outcome of MACE, as well as 85% power to detect a 15% relative risk reduction in MACE and an estimated 87% power to detect a 20% reduction in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure at a 1-sided α level of .0231.

Conclusion

The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial is testing the hypotheses that dapagliflozin is safe (does not increase) and may reduce the occurrence of major CV events. DECLARE-TIMI 58 is the largest study to address this question with an SGLT-2 inhibitor in patients with T2DM and with established CV disease and without CV disease but with multiple risk factors.

### Dapagliflozin and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous myocardial infarction [^a9a1b1aa]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Because of their baseline risk, patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) may derive even greater benefit from sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitor therapy.

Methods

DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58) randomized 17160 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n = 6974) or multiple risk factors (n = 10186) to dapagliflozin versus placebo. The 2 primary end points were composite of MACE (cardiovascular death, MI, or ischemic stroke) and the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure. Those with previous MI (n = 3584) made up a prespecified subgroup of interest.

Results

In patients with previous MI (n = 3584), dapagliflozin reduced the relative risk of MACE by 16% and the absolute risk by 2.6% (15.2% versus 17.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99; P = 0.039), whereas there was no effect in patients without previous MI (7.1% versus 7.1%; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88–1.13; P = 0.97; P for interaction for relative difference = 0.11; P for interaction for absolute risk difference = 0.048), including in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but no history of MI (12.6% versus 12.8%; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81–1.19). There seemed to be a greater benefit for MACE within 2 years after the last acute event (P for interaction trend = 0.007). The relative risk reductions in cardiovascular death/hospitalization for heart failure were more similar, but the absolute risk reductions tended to be greater: 1.9% (8.6% versus 10.5%; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00; P = 0.046) and 0.6% (3.9% versus 4.5%; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00; P = 0.055) in patients with and without previous MI, respectively (P interaction for relative difference = 0.69; P interaction for absolute risk difference = 0.010).

Conclusions

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous MI are at high risk of MACE and cardiovascular death/hospitalization for heart failure. Dapagliflozin appears to robustly reduce the risk of both composite outcomes in these patients. Future studies should aim to confirm the large clinical benefits with sodium glucose transporter-2 inhibitors we observed in patients with previous MI.

Exposure Assessment

We identified new drug users using National Drug Codes from the prescription pharmacy claims from Medicare part D claims data. Exposure and comparator drug classes of interest include the following: SGLT2i (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) and GLP‐1RA (exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and albiglutide) (Table S2). To reduce misclassification of pharmacy claims data attributable to patients not adhering to medications, we required beneficiaries to refill medications from the same drug class at least once during 90 days after drug initiation. The second prescription date is the index date from which follow‐up of the cohort began.

Outcomes

We identified outcomes using prior published algorithms that have been shown to have high reported specificity (93%–98%) or positive predictive value (> 95%). The primary outcomes are as follows: (1) HHF, (2) composite end point of inpatient MI, inpatient stroke, or all‐cause mortality (MACE outcome), and (3) the composite of MACE plus HHF. Because cardiovascular deaths account for ≈70% of diabetes‐related deaths in adults aged ≥ 65 years, we used all‐cause mortality as a proxy for cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes include individual components of the MACE outcome and MACE plus invasive cardiac procedures (stents, revascularization, and bypass surgery). We assumed death as a competing event for these cardiovascular outcomes (details below).

All outcomes were identified in an inpatient setting with ICD‐9‐CM or ICD‐10‐CM diagnosis codes in primary or secondary positions (Tables S3 through S5 for codes). We identified invasive cardiac procedures using standardized coding systems: Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and CPT (Table S6). To prevent bias attributable to changes in coding practices (ICD‐9‐CM to ICD‐10‐CM transition after October 2015), we assessed trends in outcome codes over calendar time using various outcome definition algorithms following approaches outlined in literature. Date of mortality was ascertained from the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File: National Death Index segment. Over 99% of dates of death reported in the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File have been validated using death certificate data according to the Research Data Assistance Center.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to aetiology in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the DAPA-HF trial [^baebcf28]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

Of the 4744 patients randomized in DAPA‐HF, 2674 patients (56.4%) had an ischaemic aetiology, as reported by investigators, and 2070 (43.6%) had a non‐ischaemic aetiology [1687 (35.6%) with known non‐ischaemic aetiology and 383 (8.1%) with 'unknown' aetiology, assumed to be non‐ischaemic, as pre‐specified in the analysis plan]. Baseline characteristics according to aetiology are presented in Table 1. Compared with patients with non‐ischaemic aetiology, those with ischaemic aetiology were older, more often male and white, more likely to have a previous myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization, peripheral artery disease, carotid artery stenosis, angina, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, but less likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation or prior hospitalization for HF. Patients with ischaemic aetiology had a higher mean systolic blood pressure and ejection fraction, but had a lower mean heart rate and eGFR, as well as worse NYHA functional class overall. With respect to background HF therapy, patients with ischaemic aetiology were less frequently treated with digoxin and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors and more often with implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator. A detailed breakdown of aetiology is provided in online supplementary Table S1, both overall and by geographical region. An ischaemic aetiology was the single most common aetiology reported overall (56.4% of all patients) and was somewhat more common in Europe than other regions. Among the non‐ischaemic aetiologies, idiopathic was the most common overall (17.6% of all patients) and was least common in Europe, compared with other regions. Overall, 8.1% of patients had an 'unknown aetiology' and this proportion ranged from 6.0% to 11.0% across regions. Other reported aetiologies individually accounted for < 5% of cases with the exception of hypertension (5.5%).

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) components for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — Consensus statements define GDMT for HFrEF to include renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin type II receptor blocker, or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor), a beta-blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone). Among renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, randomized controlled trials support the preferential use of an angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor to reduce long-term morbidity and mortality as well as post-discharge hospitalization, and recent strong evidence from large RCTs without regard to diabetes status is likely to expand GDMT to include sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE, NCT01730534) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial conducted to determine the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg relative to placebo on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes when added to current background therapy. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established CV disease or two or more additional CV risk factors (age ≥ 55 years in men or ≥ 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current tobacco use). Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

Of 17160 randomized patients, 6974 (40.6%) had established CV disease and 10186 (59.4%) did not have established CV disease. A total of 8582 patients were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg, 8578 to placebo, and patients were followed for a median of 4.2 years.

Approximately 80% of the trial population was White, 4% Black or African American, and 13% Asian. The mean age was 64 years, and approximately 63% were male.

Mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years and 22.4% of patients had diabetes for less than 5 years. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, 23.5% of patients had microalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g) and 6.8% had macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g). Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean BMI was 32.1 kg/m2. At baseline, 10% of patients had a history of heart failure.

Conclusions

In DAPA‐HF, dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of worsening HF events and death, and improved symptoms, similarly in patients with ischaemic and non‐ischaemic aetiology. These findings provide further evidence for dapagliflozin as a new treatment option for HFrEF.

### Cardiovascular outcomes in trials of new antidiabetic drug classes: a network meta-analysis [^87daf661]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

DECLARE-TIMI 58 confirmed the benefit of reduction in HF hospitalisation with SGLT-2 inhibitors, but did not show a significantly lower rate of MACE which contrasted with the findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S15). The differences in patient characteristics and drug used across trials could be possible explanations. More than half of the T2DM patients enrolled in DECLARE-TIMI 58 did not have cardiovascular disease but only had risk factors. On the contrary, almost all the patients included in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and more than half of the patients included in CANVAS and CANVAS-R were T2DM patients with established cardiovascular disease. It was more difficult to demonstrate a reduction in MACE in patients without pre-existing cardiovascular disease in DECLARE-TIMI 58. It is possible that dapagliflozin used in this trial has less protection against MACE compared to empagliflozin and canagliflozin. Nevertheless, the reduction in HF hospitalisation with dapagliflozin was consistent across multiple subgroups regardless of history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, HF and CKD. This was also found in other studies of dapagliflozin in humans, in animals, and in vitro. These diverse pieces of evidence point to the specific protection of HF by dapagliflozin.

Outcomes according to a history of peripheral artery disease

Patients with PAD had a higher risk of all clinical outcomes, compared to individuals without PAD (Figure 1 and Table 2). After adjustment for prognostic variables, including NT-proBNP, the relative risk in patients with PAD, compared to those without, was attenuated but remained significantly higher for all clinical outcomes, except the composite of total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death where the risk was numerically but not significantly higher (Table 2). For example, the unadjusted HR for the primary outcome in patients with PAD, compared to those without, was 1.34 (95% CI 1.16–1.55), and the adjusted HR was 1.23 (1.06–1.43). The corresponding HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.46 (1.25–1.72) and 1.25 (1.06–1.47), respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction by baseline glycaemic status (DELIVER): a subgroup analysis from an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^539cb328]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are risk factors for heart failure and adverse heart failure outcomes. The Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trial showed that dapagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the primary outcome of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral dapagliflozin in these patients by their baseline glycaemia categories.

Methods

DELIVER was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done in 350 health-care centres and hospitals across 20 countries. Patients aged 40 years or older with New York Heart Association class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 40%, elevated natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide ≥ 300 pg/mL or ≥ 600 pg/mL for patients in atrial fibrillation or flutter), and evidence of structural heart disease were randomly assigned (1:1) to 10 mg dapagliflozin or placebo, administered orally, and followed up for a median of 2·3 years (IQR 1·7–2·8). The primary outcome, a composite of time from randomisation to first worsening heart failure events (defined as an unplanned hospitalisation or urgent heart failure visit requiring intravenous therapy) or cardiovascular death, in participants with type 2 diabetes (history of or identified by HbA 1c ≥ 6·5% [48 mmol/mol] at baseline) or prediabetes (HbA 1c 5·7 to < 6·5% [39 mmol/mol to < 48 mmol/mol] at baseline) was compared with those with normoglycaemia (HbA 1c < 5·7% [39 mmol/mol]). Efficacy of dapagliflozin versus placebo was assessed according to glycaemic status and based on HbA 1c as a continuous measure. The full-analysis set comprised all patients who were randomly assigned to study treatment, with patients analysed according to their randomised treatment assignment, irrespective of the treatment received (ie, intention to treat). The safety analysis set comprised patients who were randomly assigned to study treatment and who took at least one dose of investigational product, with patients analysed according to the treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03619213.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2018, and Jan 18, 2021, 6263 patients were randomly assigned to oral dapagliflozin (n = 3131) or placebo (n = 3132). Of these patients, 1175 had normoglycaemia, 1934 had prediabetes, and 3150 had type 2 diabetes and were included in the glycaemia subgroup analysis (3515 [56·2%] of 6263 patients were men and 4435 [70·9%] were White). The incidence rate of the primary outcome was 6·9 per 100 patient-years in the normoglycaemia subgroup (reference), increasing to 7·6 per 100 patient-years in the prediabetes subgroup (hazard ratio 1·09 [95% CI 0·90–1·31]) and 10·1 per 100 patient-years in the type 2 diabetes subgroup (1·46 [1·24–1·73]; p < 0·0001 for trend). Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome versus placebo in each subgroup (hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·57–1·04], log-rank p = 0·088, for patients with normoglycaemia, 0·87 [0·69–1·08], log-rank p = 0·21, for patients with prediabetes, and 0·81 [0·69–0·95], log-rank p = 0·0077, for patients with type 2 diabetes; p interaction = 0·82) and across the continuous HbA 1c range (p interaction = 0·85). Volume-related or renal serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug, hypoglycaemia, and amputations were not differentially affected by treatment in any of the glycaemia categories.

Interpretation

In patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, oral dapagliflozin improved heart failure outcomes to a similar extent in three glycaemia subgroups: normoglycaemia, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the heart failure benefits of dapagliflozin seem to be consistent across a continuous glycaemic range.

At Week 26, treatment with dapagliflozin provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c compared with placebo (Table 14). This effect was consistent across subgroups including race, ethnicity, sex, age group (≥ 10 to < 15 years of age and ≥ 15 to < 18 years of age), background antidiabetic treatment, and baseline BMI.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE, NCT01730534) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial conducted to determine the effect of dapagliflozin relative to placebo on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes when added to current background therapy. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established CV disease or two or more additional CV risk factors (age ≥ 55 years in men or ≥ 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current tobacco use). Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

Of 17160 randomized patients, 6974 (40.6%) had established CV disease and 10186 (59.4%) did not have established CV disease. A total of 8582 patients were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg, 8578 to placebo, and patients were followed for a median of 4.2 years.

Approximately 80% of the trial population was White, 4% Black or African American, and 13% Asian. The mean age was 64 years, and approximately 63% were male.

Mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years and 22.4% of patients had diabetes for less than 5 years. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, 23.5% of patients had microalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g) and 6.8% had macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g). Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean BMI was 32.1 kg/m2. At baseline, 10% of patients had a history of heart failure.

### Dapagliflozin for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: will the DELIVER study deliver? [^e757df3c]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure is an increasingly recognised diagnosis in people with diabetes and its prevalence is increasing, with an estimated 26 million people diagnosed worldwide and an estimated global economic burden of over US$108 billion. Whilst the economic impact of heart failure is substantial, the personal impact including recurrent hospitalisation and poorer quality of life outcomes compared with most chronic diseases is significant. Moreover, the projected 5-year mortality associated with heart failure is high at around 75%. People with heart failure can be broadly classified as those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) based on a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% or > 40%, respectively. Whilst approximately 50% of people with heart failure have HFpEF, its relative prevalence is increasing and it is anticipated that HFpEF prevalence will soon exceed that of HFrEF. Crucially, whilst treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, amongst others, reduces mortality in people with HFrEF, there is no known therapy which reduces mortality in people with HFpEF.

There is a strong association between heart failure and diabetes, and people with diabetes have a 2–5-fold greater lifetime risk of developing heart failure, whilst around 45% of people with heart failure have underlying diabetes. Indeed, heart failure is the most common first manifestation of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. The association with diabetes is greater with HFpEF than HFrEF, possibly a result of shared pathophysiological mechanisms including increased inflammation, aberrant angiogenesis and remodelling, impaired cardiac metabolism, altered insulin signalling and advanced glycated end-product deposition within the myocardium. Therefore, treatments which reduce or reverse these changes have a massive potential for impact in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and may improve cardiovascular outcomes in this high-risk population. Indeed, treatments which improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2D are highly sought and of topical interest with the undertaking of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) for all T2D drug therapies. Given that heart failure typically occurs in the elderly, the use of medications such as sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to improve outcomes in this population is attractive. However, there is limited experience seen in clinical trials and real-world data to evaluate this approach. Here, we discuss the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for heart failure with a focus on dapagliflozin and the ongoing DELIVER trial evaluating dapagliflozin in people with HFpEF. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Effect of canagliflozin on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with type 2 diabetes [^4b752f59]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Study participants

This prospective single-center pilot study was performed to evaluate the effects of additional treatment with canagliflozin on left ventricular function in T2DM. Between July 2017 and December 2017, 38 diabetic patients who had inadequately controlled T2DM were consecutively recruited from outpatients at Tsuruoka Kyoritsu Hospital, Yamagata, Japan. All participants were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months after beginning additional treatment with canagliflozin. During the 6 months before the start of this study and the 3 months after the start of this study, participants had not changed their use of antidiabetic drugs or any other drugs that could affect glucose metabolism such as renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers), beta blockers, diuretics, and statins. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) T2DM with HbA1c (NGSP) of ≥ 7.0%, < 10.5% and (2) experiencing no changes in antidiabetic drugs or any other drugs during the 6 months prior to the start of this study. Inclusion criteria also included (3) satisfaction of either (a) or (b) as follows: (a) age ≥ 45 and < 75 years without a history of CVD and with ≥ 2 of the following risk factors determined at the screening visit: duration of T2DM ≥ 10 years, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg (average of 3 readings at screening visit), taking at least one anti-hypertensive agent, current daily cigarette smoker (Brinkmann index ≥ 200), microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria (microalbuminuria: urinary albumin excretion from 30 to 300 mg/g Cr; macroalbuminuria: urinary albumin excretion of ≥ 300 mg/g Cr); dyslipidemia (abnormal values for ≥ 1 among high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol < 40 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 120 mg/dL, and/or triglycerides (TG) ≥ 150 mg/dL); carotid intima media thickness ≥ 1.1 mm, and plaque positive; or (b) age ≥ 35 and < 75 years with a history of ≥ 1 of the following indicating CVD: old cerebral infarction, old myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina, chronic heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention (with or without stenting), peripheral revascularization (angioplasty or surgery), symptomatic with documented hemodynamically significant carotid or peripheral vascular disease, or amputation secondary to vascular disease. Patients were excluded based on: (1) age < 35 years or ≥ 75 years; (2) taking antipsychotics; (3) arrhythmia; (4) severe renal dysfunction (serum Cr ≥ 2.5 mg/dL); (5) severe liver dysfunction (3× upper limit of normal); (6) diabetic ketosis or diabetic coma; (7) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; (8) malignancy, or (9) acute heart failure or acute myocardial infarction. All participants underwent blood tests, including those for fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, TG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct). Clinical data (duration of diabetes; body mass index [BMI]; SBP; diastolic blood pressure [DBP]; heart rate [HR]; history of CVD; insulin therapy; and use of oral anti-diabetic drugs, anti-hypertensive agents, and lipid-lowering agents) were obtained from medical records and a questionnaire.

What is now known after the DAPA-HF trial?

The DAPA-HF trial randomly assigned 4744 patients with chronic heart failure to placebo or dapagliflozin who were treated and followed for an average of 18.2 months. The trial enrolled only patients with HFrEF, and it ensured that all patients were receiving appropriate background treatments with neurohormonal antagonists. Specifically, > 90% were receiving inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and beta-blockers, and > 70% were receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Approximately half of the patients had diabetes at baseline, and > 40% did not have underlying ischemic heart disease.

In the trial, when added to currently accepted treatments for heart failure, dapagliflozin produced a 26% reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure or an urgent visit for worsening heart failure requiring intravenous therapy (P = 0.00001). In addition, dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death by 18% (P = 0.029) and all-cause mortality by 17% (P = 0.022). Importantly, the magnitude of benefit on the primary composite endpoint was similar in patients with and without diabetes and in patients with or without ischemic heart disease.

In type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin are associated with reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events including hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Two RCTs totaling 8474 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and EF ≤ 40% (DAPA‑HF and EMPEROR‑Reduced) showed significant reductions in the relative risk of all‑cause death (13%).

### European Society of Cardiology / heart failure association position paper on the role and safety of new glucose-lowering drugs in patients with heart failure [^81c43981]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Significant advances have recently occurred in the treatment of T2DM, with evidence of several new glucose-lowering medications showing either neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, some of these agents have safety characteristics with strong practical implications in HF [i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors]. Regarding safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin is not recommended in HF because of a greater risk of HF hospitalisation. There is no compelling evidence of excess HF risk with the other DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs have an overall neutral effect on HF outcomes. However, a signal of harm suggested in two small trials of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction indicates that their role remains to be defined in established HF. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) have shown a consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation regardless of baseline cardiovascular risk or history of HF. Accordingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could be recommended to prevent HF hospitalisation in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors. The recently completed trial with dapagliflozin has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and HF events in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with or without T2DM. Several ongoing trials will assess whether the results observed with dapagliflozin could be extended to other SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HF, with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence of T2DM. This position paper aims to summarise relevant clinical trial evidence concerning the role and safety of new glucose-lowering therapies in patients with HF.

### Cardiovascular protection with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: does it apply to all patients? [^4ddbbc6b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular risk in these patients should be considered as a continuum, and comprehensive treatment strategies should aim to target multiple disease risk factors. Large-scale clinical trials of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown an impact on cardiovascular outcomes, including heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death, which appears to be independent of their glucose-lowering efficacy. Reductions in major cardiovascular events appear to be greatest in patients with established CVD, particularly those with prior myocardial infarction, but are independent of heart failure or renal risk. Most large-scale trials of SGLT2 inhibitors predominantly include patients with T2D with pre-existing CVD and high cardiovascular risk at baseline, limiting their applicability to patients typically observed in clinical practice. Real-world evidence from observational studies suggests that there might also be beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality in various cohorts of lower risk patients. The most common adverse events reported in clinical and observational studies are genital infections; however, the overall risk of these events appears to be low and easily managed. Similar safety profiles have been reported for elderly and younger patients. There is still some debate regarding the safety of canagliflozin in patients at high risk of fracture and amputation. Outstanding questions include specific patterns of cardiovascular protection according to baseline risk.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to aetiology in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the DAPA-HF trial [^7248d59b]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous studies investigating outcomes according to aetiology found HFrEF of non‐ischaemic origin to be associated with better outcomes than HFrEF due to an ischaemic cause. However, in a recent analysis from the Prospective Comparison of Angiotensin Receptor Neprilysin Inhibitor With Angiotensin‐Converting‐Enzyme Inhibitor to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM‐HF), aetiology did not appear to significantly modify the risk of the primary composite outcome of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death. In keeping with PARADIGM‐HF, we found that the risk of the composite of worsening HF or cardiovascular death did not differ by aetiology in a contemporary, globally representative, and well‐treated cohort of patients with HFrEF enrolled in DAPA‐HF. There are several plausible explanations to this difference. First, our analyses were adjusted for important prognostic variables, including natriuretic peptides. Second, patients with ischaemic aetiology enrolled in DAPA‐HF (and PARADIGM‐HF) were more aggressively treated with antiplatelet agents, statins, and beta‐blockers, and more often had undergone coronary revascularization. Third, HFrEF patients with severely reduced kidney function (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) more often have HF due to ischaemic causes; as these patients are excluded from most clinical trials (including DAPA‐HF), it is possible that the risk of death and HF hospitalization in patients with ischaemic aetiology may have been underestimated. However, this apparent similarity in the composite outcome in DAPA‐HF masked a directional difference in its HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality components. Patients with an ischaemic aetiology had a greater risk of cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality, but a lower risk of HF hospitalization than those with non‐ischaemic aetiology. While the lower rate of HF hospitalization in ischaemic patients could reflect the competing risk of death, the lower hospitalization rate in ischaemic patients persisted when accounting for the competing risk of death in competing risk analyses. Although the explanations to this finding are not clear, patients with a non‐ischaemic aetiology are a heterogeneous group and it is possible that individuals with certain aetiologies may have a better or worse prognosis than the more common aetiologies.

Power calculations and statistical analysis

Key questions in designing DAPA‐HF were what rate might be anticipated for the novel primary composite endpoint and what treatment effect size is clinically relevant and realistic? The event rate was estimated based on recent trials, particularly PARADIGM‐HF. 32 A treatment effect size of 20% was chosen as clearly clinically relevant and reasonably conservative in light of the ∼30% relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization observed in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9 DAPA‐HF is powered for this treatment effect on the primary composite outcome and not the individual components of the composite, particularly cardiovascular death. Furthermore, for nearly all other plausible scenarios, using the treatment effect sizes observed in DECLARE–TIMI 58 and in the SGLT2 inhibitor trial meta‐analysis, DAPA‐HF has ≥ 80% power to detect a benefit of dapagliflozin. 7, 8, 9

Safety considerations

In view of the safety information collected in prior trials, including DECLARE–TIMI 58, adverse event reporting has been simplified (with agreement of the regulatory authorities) — only serious adverse events, adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption/dose reduction and adverse event of special interest are collected. Adverse events of interest (in light of the profile of dapagliflozin above and concerns with SGLT2 inhibitors and other diabetes drugs more generally) include volume depletion, renal dysfunction, major hypoglycaemic episodes, fractures, and diabetic ketoacidosis. There is also a regulatory requirement to document amputations as a result of observations in the canagliflozin development programme but not in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME or DECLARE–TIMI 58. 43

Current status

The first enrolment (Visit 1) took place 8 February 2017 and the first randomization (Visit 2) occurred 15 February 2017. Subsequent recruitment in DAPA‐HF was rapid, and randomization was completed 17 August 2018.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and previous myocardial infarction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^b0123991]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients with heart failure (HF) and history of myocardial infarction (MI) face a higher risk of disease progression and clinical events. Whether sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may modify clinical trajectory in such individuals remains incompletely understood.

Methods and Results

The DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials compared dapagliflozin with placebo in patients with symptomatic HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% and > 40%, respectively. In this pooled participant-level analysis, we assessed efficacy and safety outcomes by history of MI. The primary outcome in both trials was the composite of cardiovascular death or worsening HF. Of the total of 11007 patients, 3731 (34%) had a previous MI and were at higher risk of the primary outcome across the spectrum of LVEF in covariate-adjusted models (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.24). Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome to a similar extent in patients with (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.96) and without previous MI (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68–0.85; p interaction = 0.36), with consistent benefits on key secondary outcomes as well. Serious adverse events did not occur more frequently with dapagliflozin, irrespective of previous MI.

Conclusion

History of MI confers increased risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF across the LVEF spectrum, even among those with preserved ejection fraction. Dapagliflozin consistently and safely reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or worsening HF, regardless of previous MI.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — evidence summary in T2D shows that SGLT2 inhibitors have emerged as important new oral therapies for patients with T2D, and Large, randomized controlled trials in patients with T2D have demonstrated that many of these agents reduce MACE in patients with established ASCVD and/or DKD, and reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. The benefit of reducing HF hospitalizations reflected primarily prevention of symptomatic HF in T2D patients at high risk, as ~90% did not have HF at baseline. The benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in treating established HF were demonstrated in the DAPA-HF trial, in which dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF, and improved HF-related symptoms in ~4,800 patients with HFrEF.

### Lessons learned from the DAPA-HF trial concerning the mechanisms of benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure events in the context of other large-scale trials nearing completion [^77684051]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Four large-scale trials in type 2 diabetes have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors prevent the occurrence of serious heart failure events. Additionally, the DAPA-HF trial demonstrated a benefit of dapagliflozin to reduce major adverse outcomes in patients with established heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. The trial sheds light on potential mechanisms. In DAPA-HF, the benefits of dapagliflozin on heart failure were seen to a similar extent in both patients with or without diabetes, thus undermining the hypothesis that these drugs mitigate glycemia-related cardiotoxicity. The action of SGLT2 inhibitors to promote ketogenesis is also primarily a feature of the action of these drugs in patients with diabetes, raising doubts that enhanced ketogenesis contributes to the benefit on heart failure. Also, dapagliflozin does not have a meaningful effect to decrease circulating natriuretic peptides, and it did not potentiate the actions of diuretics in DAPA-HF; moreover, intensification of diuretics therapy does not reduce cardiovascular death, questioning a benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors that is mediated by an action on renal sodium excretion. Finally, although hematocrit increases with SGLT2 inhibitors might favorably affect patients with coronary artery disease, in DAPA-HF, the benefit of dapagliflozin was similar in patients with or without an ischemic cardiomyopathy; furthermore, increases in hematocrit do not favorably affect the clinical course of patients with heart failure. Therefore, the results of DAPA-HF do not support many currently-held hypotheses about the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure. Ongoing trials are likely to provide further insights.

CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF SGLT2 INHIBITORS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES BASED ON DATA FROM CVOTs

Three CVOTs involving three SGLT2 inhibitors have been published to date, the Empagliflozin and Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE–TIMI 58). These studies randomized patients with type 2 diabetes with either a prior cardiovascular event or with cardiovascular risk factors to empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin or placebo, respectively. The proportion of patients who had experienced a prior cardiovascular event differed between these studies, ranging from 100% in EMPA-REG OUTCOME through 65.6% in CANVAS and 40.6% in DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Table 1). Although designed to confirm safety, all three studies demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events, particularly heart failure, in patients randomized to active drug.

Table 1
Details of CKD patients studied in SGLT2 inhibitor trials with main cardiovascular outcomes (compared with non-CKD patient subgroups where possible)

What can we learn from these trials about clinical outcome benefits in 'high-risk' patients who have both type 2 diabetes and CKD? As with most cardiovascular trials, exclusion criteria limited enrolment of patients with more severely impaired kidney function. Patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded from EMPA-REG and CANVAS, while a creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft–Gault) of 60 mL/min was the lower cut-off for kidney function in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial. Because of these inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients with Stages 4 and 5 CKD were not recruited into these studies. However, all three CVOTs did include patients who fulfil criteria for Stage 3 CKD (on the basis of a sustained reduction in eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and Stages 1 and 2 CKD (on the basis of an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with persistent albuminuria).

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes: In EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin reduced the composite of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 14% (absolute rate 10.5% vs 12.1%; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74–0.99]; P = 0.04 for superiority) and reduced cardiovascular death by 38% (absolute rate 3.7% vs 5.9%; HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49–0.77]; P < 0.001). In CANVAS, canagliflozin reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (26.9 vs 31.5 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75–0.97]) but was associated with increased lower limb amputation (6.3 vs 3.4 participants per 1,000 person-years; HR 1.97 [95% CI 1.41–2.75]); other trials did not show a significant increase in lower-limb amputations, fractures, AKI, or hyperkalemia relative to placebo.

### Cardiovascular effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors: what we have learned from cardiovascular outcome trials and what we still need to understand [^9332b17b]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent results of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial forces a profound reflection about the cardiovascular protection conferred by SGLT-2 inhibitors. DECLARE-TIMI 58, the largest cardiovascular outcome trial in diabetes, failed to show a significant reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) conferred by dapagliflozin compared with placebo. However, a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure was reported. Whilst the lack of benefits on MACE may seem in contrast with the results of previous SGLT-2 inhibitors cardiovascular outcome trials, DECLARE clearly delineates the real cardiovascular effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, which mainly tackle heart failure. Differences in study design and population enrolled are crucial to correctly value each molecule and to translate results of clinical trials in daily clinical practise.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on heart failure and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^62b76c65]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In DECLARE-TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the composite end point of cardiovascular death/hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the impact of baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) on the clinical benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition is unknown.

Methods

In the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, baseline heart failure (HF) status was collected from all patients, and EF was collected when available. HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) was defined as EF < 45%. Outcomes of interest were the composite of cardiovascular death/HHF, its components, and all-cause mortality.

Results

Of 17160 patients, 671 (3.9%) had HFrEF, 1316 (7.7%) had HF without known reduced EF, and 15173 (88.4%) had no history of HF at baseline. Dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death/HHF more in patients with HFrEF (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45–0.86]) than in those without HFrEF (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.76–1.02]; P for interaction = 0.046), in whom the treatment effect of dapagliflozin was similar in those with HF without known reduced EF (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.66–1.17]) and those without HF (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.74–1.03]). Whereas dapagliflozin reduced HHF both in those with (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.43–0.95]) and in those without HFrEF (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62–0.92]), it reduced cardiovascular death only in patients with HFrEF (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.34–0.90]) but not in those without HFrEF (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.89–1.31]; P for interaction = 0.012). Likewise, dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.40–0.88;) but not in those without HFrEF (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.86–1.10]; P for interaction = 0.016).

Conclusions

In the first sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trial to evaluate patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus stratified by EF, we found that dapagliflozin reduced HHF in patients with and without HFrEF and reduced cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in patients with HFrEF.

Introduction

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, is approved in the USA to reduce risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and established CV disease, based on EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) trial results. Empagliflozin reduced major adverse CV event (MACE) by 14%, CV death by 38%, and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) by 35% vs placebo, each on top of standard of care (SoC). SGLT-2 inhibitors canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have also been compared with placebo, all on top of SoC, in CV outcome trials. In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) Program, canagliflozin reduced MACE by 14% and HHF by 33%. Dapagliflozin reduced HHF by 27% in the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events). This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or SoC, in US adults with T2DM and established CV disease.

Research Design and Methods

Individual patient-level discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict time-to-event for CV and renal outcomes, and specific adverse events over patients' lifetimes. Occurrence of events in EMPA-REG OUTCOME was estimated based on event-free survival curves with time-dependent covariates. An HR for canagliflozin or dapagliflozin versus empagliflozin on each clinical event was estimated from published CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and EMPA-REG OUTCOME data using indirect treatment comparison. Public sources provided US costs and utilities.

Results

The model predicted longer survival for empagliflozin versus canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and SoC mainly due to direct reduction in CV death. Empagliflozin dominated canagliflozin, yielding more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.38) at a lower cost (-US$306). Compared with dapagliflozin and SoC, empagliflozin yielded 0.50 and 0.84 incremental QALYs at US$1517 and US$27539 incremental costs, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$3054/QALY and US$32 848/QALY, respectively.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin was projected to dominate canagliflozin and be highly cost-effective compared with dapagliflozin and SoC using US healthcare costs.

### The dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in heart failure trial (DAPA-HF) in context [^e7a2090f]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The recently reported Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF) showed the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the risk of hospital admission for worsening heart failure, increased survival and improved symptoms in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although SGLT2 inhibitors had been developed as glucose-lowering treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes, approximately half the patients in DAPA-HF did not have type 2 diabetes. The benefits of dapagliflozin in DAPA-HF were of a similar magnitude in participants without diabetes to the benefits obtained in individuals with diabetes. Importantly, in both groups of patients, dapagliflozin in patients with HFrEF were observed when dapagliflozin was added to excellent background disease-modifying therapy for heart failure.

In this brief commentary, we wish to put these findings into perspective. There are two principal contextual considerations — how the patients randomized in DAPA-HF and their event rates compare with those in the prior SGLT2 inhibitor trials and, second, how the effects of dapagliflozin compare with those of other pharmacological treatments for HFrEF.

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to aetiology in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the DAPA-HF trial [^25b07cde]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

DAPA‐HF was a randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial in patients with HFrEF, evaluating the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily compared with matching placebo, in addition to standard care. The design, baseline characteristics, and primary results of the trial are published. The ethics committee of each of the 410 participating institutions in 20 countries approved the protocol, and all patients gave written informed consent. Drs. McMurray and Jhund had full access to the trial data and take responsibility for its integrity and the data analysis.

Study patients

Men and women aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HF for at least 2 months were eligible if they were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV, had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%, were optimally treated with pharmacological and device therapy for HF, and had an N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) concentration ≥ 600 pg/mL (≥ 400 pg/mL if hospitalized for HF within the previous 12 months; ≥ 900 pg/mL if atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, irrespective of history of HF hospitalization). Key exclusion criteria included symptoms of hypotension or systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or rapidly declining renal function, type 1 diabetes, and other conditions likely to prevent patient participation in the trial or greatly limit life expectancy. A complete list of exclusion criteria is provided in the design paper. After randomization, follow‐up visits were scheduled at 14 and 60 days, and then at 120, 240, 360 days and every 4 months thereafter.

Atrial fibrillation

Data about history of AF were collected on the trial case report forms (CRF). Investigators were first asked whether patients had a history of AF any time before enrolment. If investigators answered yes, they were then asked to specify the type of AF according to the following options: paroxysmal [intermittent (lasting at least 30 s), self‐terminating AF (lasting for a maximum of 1 week)], persistent (non‐self‐terminating AF with a duration of > 1 week and/or required cardioversion), and permanent (non‐self‐terminating, long‐standing AF in which cardioversion has failed or not attempted). Data on heart rhythm on the ECG at enrolment were also collected on the CRF, and investigators were asked to specify the heart rhythm from the following options: sinus rhythm, AF, atrial flutter, paced rhythm, and other (specify).

New‐onset (incident) AF was a clinical endpoint in patients without any AF at baseline (i.e. no history of AF and no AF on ECG at enrolment), and data were collected from a specific CRF. Investigators were asked to specify the date of diagnosis, symptoms (symptomatic or asymptomatic), type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent), and treatment [rate control therapy, antiarrhythmic drugs, invasive antiarrhythmic therapy (percutaneous/surgical ablation or pacemaker insertion to facilitate rhythm control), electric cardioversion, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulant therapy].

Comparison groups of interest

In the present study, we made the following comparisons based on AF status:
Patients without any AF (no history of AF and no AF on ECG) vs. any AF (a history of AF or AF on ECG at enrolment). 'Atrial fibrillation' in these analyses included AF or atrial flutter as in previous studies.,
Patients without any AF (no history of AF and no AF on ECG) vs. AF on ECG at enrolment (irrespective of history of AF).
Patients without any AF (no history of AF and no AF on ECG) vs. paroxysmal AF (history of paroxysmal AF or AF on ECG without a history of AF) vs. persistent/permanent AF (history of persistent/permanent AF).

### Primary and secondary cardiovascular and kidney prevention with canagliflozin: insights from the CANVAS program and CREDENCE trial [^408a40b1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Among those with T2D, in addition to MACE‐3P, HHF has emerged as an important clinical event that has historically been ignored by regulators as an important event in clinical trials. The present analysis reinforces the role of canagliflozin in MACE‐3P risk reduction in primary and secondary prevention subgroups. Our results showed consistent treatment effects irrespective of cardiovascular disease history. Although prevalent ASCVD is a major risk factor for the development of HF, even individuals without ASCVD are at increased risk of HF events. Because ≈60% to 65% of all individuals with T2D do not have clinical atherosclerotic disease, prevention of cardiovascular death or HHF across primary and secondary prevention populations remains an important population health issue. In addition to the CANVAS Program and CREDENCE trial, the DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events) enrolled participants with T2D with ASCVD (40.6%) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (59.4%). The DECLARE‐TIMI 58 demonstrated that dapagliflozin was neutral for the primary efficacy outcome of MACE‐3P (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.84–1.03) without statistical heterogeneity between those with and without ASCVD (P interaction = 0.25). Dapagliflozin did reduce the risk of the second primary efficacy outcome, the composite of cardiovascular death, or HHF (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73–0.95]). A subgroup analysis demonstrated reductions in the risk of cardiovascular death or HHF in both primary prevention (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71–0.98]) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.67–1.04]; P interaction = 0.99) populations. The effect of sotagliflozin in the SCORED (Cardiovascular and Renal Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Renal Impairment Who Are at Cardiovascular Risk) trial demonstrated that dual SGLT1 and 2 inhibitor (SGLT1/2i) reduced the risk of primary outcomes of death from cardiovascular causes and hospitalizations and urgent visits for HF across those with diabetes and CKD, regardless of albuminuria. Our results align with these analyses demonstrating the usefulness of SGLT2i to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or HHF across the primary and secondary prevention subgroups.

### Effect of canagliflozin on heart Failure hospitalization in diabetes according to Baseline heart Failure risk [^5ca13f4b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In the CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) program, canagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalization among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in absolute and relative treatment effects of canagliflozin on HF hospitalization according to baseline HF risk as assessed by diabetes-specific HF risk scores (WATCH-DM [Weight (body mass index), Age, hyperTension, Creatinine, HDL-C, Diabetes control (fasting plasma glucose) and QRS Duration, MI and CABG] and TRS-HF DM [TIMI Risk Score for HF in Diabetes]).

Methods

Participants in the CANVAS trial were categorized into low, medium, and high risk for HF using the WATCH-DM score (for participants without prevalent HF) and the TRS-HF DM score (for all participants). The outcome of interest was time to first HF hospitalization. The treatment effect of canagliflozin vs placebo for HF hospitalization was compared across risk strata.

Results

Among 10,137 participants with available HF data, 1,446 (14.3%) had HF at baseline. Among participants without baseline HF, WATCH-DM risk category did not modify the treatment effect of canagliflozin (vs placebo) on HF hospitalization (P interaction = 0.56). However, the absolute and relative risk reduction with canagliflozin was numerically greater in the high-risk group (cumulative incidence, canagliflozin vs placebo: 8.1% vs 12.7%; HR: 0.62 [95% CI: 0.37–0.93]; P = 0.03; number needed to treat: 22) than in the low- and intermediate-risk groups. When overall study participants were categorized according to the TRS-HF DM score, a statistically significant difference in the treatment effect of canagliflozin across risk strata was observed (P interaction = 0.04). Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalization by 39% in the high-risk group (HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.48–0.78]; P < 0.001; number needed to treat: 20) but not in the intermediate- or low-risk groups.

Conclusions

Among participants with T2DM, the WATCH-DM and TRS-HF DM can reliably identify those at high risk for HF hospitalization and most likely to benefit from canagliflozin.

### Dapagliflozin (farxiga) for preventing hospitalization for heart failure… [^e7cbec76]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety In postmarketing reports of dapagliflozin, adverse effects include hypotension, hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, urosepsis, pyelonephritis, and necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum. 1 Patients with diabetes who have or are at high risk of CVD are more likely to develop ketoacidosis. 2 Dapagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients with hypovolemia or those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m
2. Effectiveness Dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes who have or are at high risk of CVD. There were fewer hospitalizations for heart failure in patients taking dapagliflozin compared with patients taking placebo over the median 4. 2-year study period, development of end-stage renal disease, or death from a renal or cardiovascular cause compared with patients taking placebo. The primary benefit was from a reduction in renal disease progression and death from renal causes. However, because there was no difference in the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events between patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, trial investigators consider the reduction in combined renal outcome as hypothesis-generating.
2. Dapagliflozin reduces the risk of worsening HFrEF or death from a cardiovascular cause in patients with HFrEF with an ejection fraction of 40% or less. When compared with placebo in patients with NYHA class II to IV HFrEF, who also received standard medical and device treatment, dapagliflozin reduced rates of worsening HFrEF or cardiovascular-related death from 21. 2% to
16. 3% over the 18.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^6ad85e26]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study DAPA-HF was published by John J V McMurray and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the DAPA-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of dapagliflozin among patients with HFrEF? In the DAPA-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DAPA-HF study, the population was: 4744 patients (1109 female, 3635 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 40%. The key exclusion criteria were recent treatment with or unacceptable side effects associated with a SGLT 2 inhibitor, T1DM mellitus, symptoms of hypotension or a SBP < 95 mmHg. In the DAPA-HF study, the interventions were: n = 2373 dapagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg once daily, per oral use) n = 2371 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the DAPA-HF study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in worsening HF or cardiovascular death (16.3% vs. 21.2%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.85). In the DAPA-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF or death from cardiovascular causes (16.1% vs. 20.9%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.85) Significant decrease in a first worsening cardiovascular event (10% vs. 13.7%; HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.83) Significant decrease in death from any cause (11.6% vs. 13.9%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.97). In the DAPA-HF study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events including volume depletion, hypoglycemia, renal dysfunction. significant difference in serious renal adverse events (1.6% vs. 2.7%). In the DAPA-HF study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and an ejection fraction < 40%, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to worsening HF or cardiovascular death.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

Cardiovascular risk–reduction context — "Perhaps the strongest evidence that the CV effects of these agents are independent of both HbA1c and background antidiabetic agent use come from the DAPA-HF trial, in which most patients did not have T2D and were not on glucose-lowering therapies at baseline and yet still experienced an identical reduction in CV death or worsening HF (49)".

Congestive heart failure events leading to hospitalization that occurred during the PROactive trial are summarized in Table 6.

Cardiovascular Safety

In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months.

The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p = 0.10).

### Dapagliflozin in heart failure with preserved and mildly reduced ejection fraction: rationale and design of the DELIVER trial [^a13563dd]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, originally developed as glucose‐lowering agents, have been shown to reduce heart failure hospitalizations in patients with type 2 diabetes, including those without established heart failure. Moreover, in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%; HFrEF), including those with and without type 2 diabetes, both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death or heart failure events when added to standard therapy. While the mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors improve outcomes in heart failure continue to be investigated, they are postulated to include favourable effects on haemodynamics, improvement in myocardial energetics and loading conditions, favourable effects on endothelial function and inflammation, and slowing of the progression of kidney disease. These effects may collectively underlie observed early and sustained improvements in filling pressures and ventricular remodeling.

### Time to clinical benefit of dapagliflozin and significance of prior heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^cf6c0d61]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure (HF) in patients with chronic HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, clinical inertia often underlies deferred initiation of effective therapies.

Objective

To examine timing of onset of clinical benefit with dapagliflozin and magnitude as a function of proximity to prior HF hospitalization.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a secondary analysis of a completed multinational trial. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic HFrEF (n = 4744). From February 2017 to August 2018, the study enrolled patients in New York Heart Association classes II through IV and with left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less; the median (range) follow-up time was 18.2 (0–27.8) months. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the primary efficacy outcome with dapagliflozin vs placebo by time following randomization. Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin were assessed according to the timing of the most recent HF hospitalization prior to trial enrollment.

Exposures

None.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite of cardiovascular death or worsening HF.

Results

A total of 4744 patients were included (1109 women [23.4%]; mean [SD] age, 66.3 [10.9] years). The reduction in the primary outcome with dapagliflozin was rapidly apparent, with a sustained statistically significant benefit by 28 days after randomization (HR at 28 days, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.28–0.94]; P = 0.03). A total of 2251 patients (47.4%) had been previously hospitalized for HF, and 1301 (27.4%) had been hospitalized within 12 months prior to enrollment. Among patients treated with placebo, there was a stepwise gradient of risk for the primary outcome according to timing of most recent HF hospitalization, with 2-year Kaplan-Meier rates of 21.1%, 25.3%, and 33.8% (adjusted P = 0.003) for patients with a prior HF hospitalization never, more than 12 months ago, and 12 or fewer months ago, respectively. Across these subgroups, dapagliflozin reduced the relative risk of the primary outcome by 16% (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.69–1.01]), 27% (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54–0.99]), and 36% (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.51–0.80]), respectively (P = 0.07 for trend). Accordingly, patients with a more recent HF hospitalization tended to experience greater absolute risk reductions with dapagliflozin at 2 years: 2.1% (95% CI, -1.9% to 6.1%), 4.1% (95% CI, -3.6% to 11.7%), and 9.9% (95% CI, 3.3%-16.5%), respectively (P = 0.05 for trend).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with rapid reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or worsening HF, with a sustained statistically significant benefit emerging very early after randomization. Patients with a more recent HF hospitalization were at particularly high risk and experienced greater relative and absolute risk reductions with dapagliflozin.

### Timing of randomization after an acute coronary syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^fe2759ae]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The timing of enrolment following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may influence cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and potentially treatment effect in clinical trials. Understanding the timing and type of clinical events after an ACS will allow for clinicians to better tailor evidence-based treatments to optimize therapeutic effect. Using a large contemporary trial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) post-ACS, we examined the impact of timing of enrolment on subsequent CV outcomes.

Methods

EXAMINE was a randomized trial of alogliptin versus placebo in 5,380 patients with T2DM and a recent ACS from October 2009 to March 2013. The primary outcome was a composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 18 months. In this post hoc analysis, we examined the occurrence of subsequent CV events by timing of enrollment divided by tertiles of time from ACS to randomization: 8–34, 35–56, and 57–141 days.

Results

Patients randomized early (compared to the latest times) had less comorbidities at baseline including a history of heart failure (HF; 24.7% vs 33.0%), prior coronary artery bypass graft (9.6% vs 15.9%), or atrial fibrillation (5.9% vs 9.4%). Despite the reduced comorbidity burden, the risk of the primary outcome was highest in patients randomized early compared to the latest time (adjusted hazard ratio 1.47; 95% CI 1.21–1.74). Similarly, patients randomized early had an increased risk of recurrent MI (adjusted hazard ratio 1.51; 95% CI 1.17–1.96) and HF hospitalization (1.49; 95% CI 1.05–2.10).

Conclusions

In a contemporary cohort of T2DM with a recent ACS, the risk for recurrent CV events including MI and HF hospitalization is elevated early after an ACS. Given the emergence of antihyperglycemic therapies that reduce the risk of MI and HF among patients with T2DM at high CV risk, future studies evaluating the initiation of these therapies in the early period following an ACS are warranted given the large burden of potentially modifiable CV events.

### Study details | NCT05852704 | SGLT2 inhibitor trEatment… [^b378fdb8]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview The goal of this randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial is to investigate if treatment with an sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor during the unique time window before coronary artery bypass surgery, can reduce the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation and/or acute kidney injury in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. The main questions it aims to answer are:

- Does treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor during the waiting time and stable post-operative period, in patients with chronic coronary syndrome scheduled for CABG, reduce the risk of new onset atrial fibrillation compared to placebo.
- Does treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor during the waiting time and stable post-operative period, in patients with chronic coronary syndrome scheduled for CABG, reduce the risk of acute kidney injury before hospital discharge compared to placebo. Study centers: Up to 7 centers in Sweden, Denmark, and the Czech Republic.

Phase of development: III. Objectives: In a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial to compare dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily and placebo in preventing post-operative atrial fibrillation and acute kidney injury in patients with chronic coronary syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Aside from a follow-up telephone call one week after discharge to collect safety data-and an on-site visit for type 2 diabetes patients-no extra monitoring or visits are included in the trial. Patients will be followed up 30 days and 12 months through national registries. Primary endpoint: Incidence of new onset post-operative AF during hospitalization following CABG surgery.

1. All-cause mortality;
2. Stroke; 3. New onset heart failure;
4. Ventricular arrhythmia; 5. Electrical cardioversion for AF;
6. Use of amiodarone for AF; 7. Change in inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers from baseline to three days after CABG surgery;
8.

Change in HbA1c from baseline to three days after CABG surgery; 9. Length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. These include: change in cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers from baseline to three days after CABG surgery, and change in HbA1c from baseline to three days after CABG surgery. For time-to-event outcomes, the number of subjects with the event and the cumulative percentage will be reported by randomized group.

### The dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse-outcomes in heart failure (DAPA-HF) trial: baseline characteristics [^e129f8b3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aims of this study were to: (i) report the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial, (ii) compare DAPA-HF patients to participants in contemporary heart failure (HF) registries and in other recent HF trials, and (iii) compare individuals with diabetes, pre-diabetes and a normal glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in DAPA-HF.

Methods and Results

Adults with HF in New York Heart Association functional class ≥ II, a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, an elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration and receiving standard treatment were eligible for DAPA-HF, which is comparing dapagliflozin 10mg once daily to matching placebo. In patients without a history of diabetes, previously undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a confirmed HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. Among patients without known or undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes was defined as a HbA1c ≥ 5.7% The remainder of patients, with a HbA1c < 5.7%, were defined as normoglycaemic. Of the 4744 patients (mean age 66years; 23% women) randomized, 42% had known diabetes and 3% undiagnosed diabetes. Of the remainder, 67% had pre-diabetes and 33% normal HbA1c. Overall, DAPA-HF patients were generally similar to those in recent registries and in relevant trials and had high levels of background therapy: 94% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, 96% beta-blocker, and 71% mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; 26% had a defibrillator. Patients with diabetes had worse HF status, more co-morbidity, and greater renal impairment but received similar HF therapy. Patients with diabetes received non-insulin hypoglycaemic therapy alone in 49%, insulin alone in 11%, both in 14%, and none in 26%.

Conclusions

Patients randomized in DAPA-HF were similar to those in other contemporary HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) registries and trials. These patients were receiving recommended HFrEF therapy and those with diabetes were also treated with conventional glucose-lowering therapy. Consequently, DAPA-HF will test the incremental efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in HFrEF patients with and without diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^53ab88ad]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

At Week 26, treatment with FARXIGA provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c compared with placebo (Table 14). This effect was consistent across subgroups including race, ethnicity, sex, age group (≥ 10 to < 15 years of age and ≥ 15 to < 18 years of age), background antidiabetic treatment, and baseline BMI.

14.3 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events (DECLARE, NCT01730534) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial conducted to determine the effect of FARXIGA relative to placebo on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes when added to current background therapy. All patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established CV disease or two or more additional CV risk factors (age ≥ 55 years in men or ≥ 60 years in women and one or more of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current tobacco use). Concomitant antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of investigators, to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases.

Of 17160 randomized patients, 6974 (40.6%) had established CV disease and 10186 (59.4%) did not have established CV disease. A total of 8582 patients were randomized to FARXIGA 10 mg, 8578 to placebo, and patients were followed for a median of 4.2 years.

Approximately 80% of the trial population was White, 4% Black or African American, and 13% Asian. The mean age was 64 years, and approximately 63% were male.

Mean duration of diabetes was 11.9 years and 22.4% of patients had diabetes for less than 5 years. Mean eGFR was 85.2 mL/min/1.73 m2. At baseline, 23.5% of patients had microalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 to ≤ 300 mg/g) and 6.8% had macroalbuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g). Mean HbA1c was 8.3% and mean BMI was 32.1 kg/m2. At baseline, 10% of patients had a history of heart failure.

SGLT2 inhibitors and heart failure (HF) events — trial results in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) show consistent reductions in HF outcomes: in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CV death or HF hospitalization was reduced by 34% (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.79) and HF hospitalization alone had a similar effect (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.85); in CANVAS, HF hospitalization decreased by 33% (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87); in CREDENCE, HF hospitalization fell by 39% (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.80); and in DECLARE-TIMI 58, the composite CV death or HF hospitalization improved by 17% (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.95), driven by a 27% reduction in HF hospitalization (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.88). Across CV outcome trials, ~90% of patients did not have HF at baseline. In HFrEF treatment, DAPA-HF demonstrated a 26% relative reduction in CV death or worsening HF (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.85) with an independent reduction in CV death (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.98), while DEFINE-HF improved HF-related symptoms, functional status, and quality of life after 12 weeks without a significant difference in mean N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, the study's coprimary endpoint.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^9b01a5b7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renal function thresholds and early eGFR changes are detailed: clinical trials typically used lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) cutoffs of 20 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, with recent labels listing lower limits of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 for dapagliflozin and sotagliflozin and no lower bound cutoff for empagliflozin; after initiation, a drop in eGFR is expected and clinicians should not necessarily adjust or discontinue medications solely for this reason; in trials of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, participants with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 continued treatment with considerable benefits, whereas in studies of sotagliflozin the drug was discontinued if eGFR dropped below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### The pleiotropic effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: beyond the glycemic benefit [^d45346f0]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Although absolute numbers of patients with established CVD were similar across the three CVOTs, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 study of dapagliflozin included a larger proportion of patients with multiple CV risk factors without established CVD (~ 60%) and a smaller proportion of patients with established CVD than the other two SGLT-2i trials (~ 40%; vs. > 99% in EMPA-REG OUTCOME and ~ 66% in CANVAS), representing a population at an earlier stage of CVD risk. In DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin showed noninferiority to placebo in the risk of three-point MACE, with a greater risk reduction in patients with a prior MI versus those without (16% vs. 0%), and dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the composite outcome of CV death or hospitalization for HF by 17% versus placebo (Table 1), primarily resulting from a lower rate of hospitalization for HF. A subanalysis showed that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF to a greater extent in patients with a history of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than in those without HFrEF, defined as HF without known reduced EF or without history of HF (38% vs. 12%).

A meta-analysis of data from these three CVOTs indicated that SGLT-2is reduced the overall risk of three-point MACE by 11% compared with placebo (Fig. 3). This reduction in the risk of MACE was observed only in patients with atherosclerotic CVD, whereas patients with multiple CVD risk factors showed no treatment effect. In this meta-analysis, SGLT-2is reduced the overall risk of the composite outcome of CV death or hospitalization for HF by 23% and hospitalization for HF by 31% compared with placebo. The hospitalization for HF outcome was similar among patients with atherosclerotic CVD and those with multiple CVD risk factors, with ~ 30% risk reduction in both subgroups.

### Dapagliflozin and recurrent heart failure hospitalizations in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: an analysis of DAPA-HF [^c0933f84]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Among the 4744 participants randomly assigned in DAPA-HF, 548 patients experienced a total of 809 HF hospitalizations (Figure 1). Most patients hospitalized had 1 or 2 admissions during the median follow-up of 18.2 months (Q1–Q3, 14.2–21.5). The largest number of hospitalizations was 7. The number of hospitalizations was higher in the placebo group (469 admissions among 318 patients) than in the dapagliflozin group (340 admissions among 230 patients; Figure 2). There were 500 cardiovascular deaths (227 in the dapagliflozin group and 273 in the placebo group) and 105 noncardiovascular deaths (49 in the dapagliflozin group and 56 in the placebo group).

Baseline Characteristics

Compared with participants who were not hospitalized for HF, those admitted were older, more likely to be men, and White. There was no significant difference according to geographical region. Hospitalized patients had worse NYHA class, higher heart rate, higher body mass index, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, lower blood pressure, lower ejection fraction, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than those not hospitalized. Compared with patients not hospitalized, those admitted at least once were more likely to have a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. There was no difference in history of myocardial infarction or ischemic origin between people hospitalized and not hospitalized. Hospitalized patients were more likely to have longer-duration HF and a previous hospital admission for HF. Among those with previous HF hospitalization, patients who were hospitalized during the trial had a more recent hospital admission than participants who were not admitted during the trial (who had a more remote previous admission).

Hospitalized patients were more likely to have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and receive digoxin and less likely to be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor.

The differences described between patients with and without a hospitalization during follow-up were generally more marked among individuals with ≥ 2 admissions, compared with 1 admission (Table).

Through analysis of emergent keywords such as "reduced ejection fraction" and "preserved ejection fraction", we have found that the study population for dapagliflozin in treating HF is gradually expanding from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to include patients with HF and an ejection fraction over 40%. Multiple large trials, such as the EMPEROR-Reduced study and the DAPA-HF trial, have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with HFrEF, with or without diabetes. Notably, the DAPA-HF trial convincingly established the benefits of dapagliflozin specifically in this low-ejection-fraction heart failure population. In recent years, some studies have demonstrated that dapagliflozin also benefits patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), as it improves symptoms and physical function, significantly enhances cardiac function, and reduces the overall risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death in this population. In reality, however, current therapeutic approaches for HFpEF remain limited — for instance, β-blockers are not routinely recommended. For HFpEF management, we can stratify therapeutic research based on distinct phenotypic profiles such as the obese phenotype, fibrotic phenotype, and vascular phenotype.

Conclusions

DAPA‐HF will determine the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin added to conventional therapy in a broad spectrum of patients with HFrEF. A partner morbidity/mortality trial in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction has recently commenced (DELIVER: Dapagliflozin Evaluation to improve the LIVEs of patients with pReserved ejection fraction heart failure; NCT03619213). DAPA‐HF and DELIVER will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and effective treatment for patients with established and well characterised heart failure of both major phenotypes, distinct from the trials with these agents to date, which have largely examined the prevention of heart failure. Moreover, DAPA‐HF and DELIVER will include a large proportion of patients without type 2 diabetes, also differing from EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58, which included only patients with type 2 diabetes. DAPA‐HF and DELIVER are complemented by a parallel trial in chronic kidney disease (DAPA‐CKD: A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Chronic Disease; NCT03036150). Other trials with a different SGLT2 inhibitor, and a SGLT1/2 inhibitor, are also in progress (key features are summarised in Table 3).
