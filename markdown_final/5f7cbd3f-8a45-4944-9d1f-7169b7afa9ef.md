## Question

Hiperkalemia signs on ecg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ECG signs of hyperkalemia, how reliable they are, and how to act on them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic, progressive ECG pattern and whether it truly tracks with potassium severity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance of ECG for hyperkalemia and the impact of chronicity and comorbidities. Next, I will review special patterns and mimics that can mislead us. After that, I need to check guideline thresholds for when to obtain an ECG and when to treat urgently. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, safety-first approach and note emerging tools like AI-ECG while keeping their limitations in mind [^114sFyvb] [^117Qbqgx].

> Let me first confirm the canonical sequence of ECG changes. The traditional teaching is that hyperkalemia produces a predictable progression: peaked T waves, followed by P-wave flattening and PR prolongation, then QRS widening, and finally sine-wave morphology and asystole, reflecting depolarization of the resting membrane potential and reduced sodium-channel availability as potassium rises, which shortens repolarization early and slows conduction later [^112zroik] [^112AMs6e]. Wait, let me verify the directionality of the QT effect; I initially thought the QT interval uniformly prolongs, but in early hyperkalemia, repolarization accelerates and the QT may appear shortened, whereas later, with marked QRS widening, total QT may appear prolonged, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize the biphasic effect on repolarization and conduction as potassium increases [^112zroik] [^112AMs6e].

> I will now examine the diagnostic performance of ECG. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that ECG changes are reliable markers of hyperkalemia; multiple studies show poor sensitivity and high specificity, meaning a normal ECG cannot exclude hyperkalemia, but classic changes, when present, are supportive and should trigger urgent therapy [^114QL8ph] [^115FYLdt]. Let me double-check the numbers: emergency physicians had mean sensitivity around 0.19 overall and 0.29 in severe hyperkalemia, with specificity near 0.97, and a retrospective series found only 46% of hyperkalemic patients had ECG changes, reinforcing that absence of ECG findings does not reassure us [^114QL8ph] [^115FYLdt]. I should confirm that guidelines align with this caution; indeed, AAFP advises not to base urgent treatment decisions solely on ECG because of inconsistent thresholds and poor sensitivity [^116DJ3Gh].

> Next, I should review special ECG patterns and mimics that can confuse the picture. Severe hyperkalemia can transiently produce Brugada-like phenotypes in the right precordial leads, which resolve with potassium correction; this phenotype is associated with malignant arrhythmias and high mortality, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion and treat aggressively rather than attributing it to primary Brugada syndrome in the acute setting [^1173XX1o] [^115CCEyG]. But wait, what if the ST elevation looks like an acute MI; hyperkalemia can mimic anteroseptal infarction with pseudo-infarct patterns, and even transient Q waves in the right precordial leads, so I should verify with immediate potassium measurement before activating the cath lab [^114JFp3S] [^111btroj]. I should also remember that QRS axis shifts and conduction disturbances, including fascicular or bundle-branch patterns, can occur with hyperkalemia and may reverse with treatment, so comparing to baseline ECGs is essential [^115qLduU] [^111rSS5v].

> Let me consider confounders that blunt or alter ECG manifestations. Chronic kidney disease and longstanding hyperkalemia can blunt ECG sensitivity; patients may have potassium levels above 8.0 mEq/L with deceptively normal tracings, so a normal ECG in CKD does not exclude life-threatening hyperkalemia and should not delay treatment if clinical suspicion is high [^114eNVqR]. I should also confirm that concomitant acidosis, ischemia, and structural heart disease can produce overlapping ECG abnormalities, and that paced rhythms or baseline bundle-branch block do not fully mask hyperkalemic changes when carefully compared to prior tracings, which argues for serial ECGs and clinical correlation rather than reliance on a single pattern [^117Qbqgx] [^111rSS5v] [^117GB6pF].

> Now, I need to check guideline thresholds for when to obtain and act on ECGs. UKKA recommends obtaining an urgent 12-lead ECG for all hospitalized patients with serum potassium 6.0 mmol/L or higher, and ensuring continuous cardiac monitoring for those with potassium 6.5 mmol/L or higher, those with ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia, or those with 6.0–6.4 mmol/L who are clinically unstable or anticipated to rise quickly [^1151R4sV] [^1124Vteu]. Hold on, I should verify the treatment trigger; UKKA advises urgent treatment for severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L) or when ECG changes suggest severe hyperkalemia, and to give IV calcium when there are ECG signs of cardiotoxicity, preferably calcium gluconate in non-arrest settings and calcium chloride in arrest or peri-arrest scenarios [^112KvyxG] [^1141xYzu]. I should confirm that VA/DoD guidance similarly uses ECG plus potassium level to triage acuity and that outpatient potassium above 6.0 mmol/L or any new ECG changes warrant ED referral for monitored care [^115Lhcuz].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while keeping the limitations front and center. First, do not wait for ECG changes to treat suspected hyperkalemia; if the lab potassium is 6.5 mmol/L or higher, or if there are concerning ECG features, initiate urgent therapy and continuous monitoring while repeating potassium urgently, ideally with a blood gas analyzer for rapid turnaround in emergencies [^114AFj3b] [^112KvyxG]. Second, if the ECG is normal but potassium is 6.0 mmol/L or higher, I should still obtain and review a 12-lead ECG, compare to baseline, and escalate monitoring and treatment based on trajectory and clinical status, recognizing that a normal tracing does not exclude danger [^1151R4sV] [^114QL8ph]. Third, when classic hyperkalemic changes are present — peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR prolongation, QRS widening, or sine-wave morphology — I should treat immediately with membrane stabilization and intracellular shift therapies, and prepare for dialysis if potassium fails to decline or the patient deteriorates [^1141xYzu] [^112KvyxG].

> I should double-check special contexts and mimics so I do not anchor incorrectly. In patients with severe bradycardia or cardiac arrest, hyperkalemia is a reversible cause and should be considered early alongside ischemia and other Hs and Ts; conversely, wide-complex rhythms in ESRD are not always hyperkalemia and can be hypokalemia or other etiologies, so I need simultaneous electrolyte confirmation and a broad differential [^1179NdyX] [^1124GviP]. If I encounter a new Brugada-pattern ECG in an acute illness, I should prioritize aggressive hyperkalemia management and reassess the ECG after potassium correction before labeling primary Brugada syndrome, given the high arrhythmic risk during hyperkalemic Brugada phenotype [^1173XX1o] [^115CCEyG].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am not overpromising what ECG or AI can deliver. AI-ECG can detect hyperkalemia with reasonable discrimination in some settings, but performance varies by prevalence and timing relative to labs, and false positives may reflect underlying cardiac disease rather than true dyskalemia; thus, AI outputs should augment, not replace, laboratory potassium and clinical judgment in acute care [^114sFyvb] [^117Qbqgx]. In summary, the ECG signs of hyperkalemia are classically described but variably present; a normal ECG does not exclude severe hyperkalemia, so management must be driven primarily by serum potassium and clinical context, with ECG serving as a valuable, time-critical adjunct that, when abnormal, mandates immediate cardioprotective therapy and continuous monitoring [^116DJ3Gh] [^1151R4sV] [^1124Vteu].

Hyperkalemia on ECG presents with a **progressive sequence** of changes: peaked T waves (earliest sign) [^1123QwNr], PR interval prolongation, P wave flattening or loss, QRS widening, and sine-wave pattern (pre-arrest) [^111cd3TY]. These changes reflect **membrane depolarization** [^112zroik] and reduced conduction velocity, correlating with rising serum potassium and arrhythmic risk [^112AMs6e]. ECG is **insensitive** [^114QL8ph]; a normal tracing does not exclude hyperkalemia, especially in chronic or moderate cases [^115FYLdt] [^114eNVqR]. Severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L) or any ECG change warrants **urgent treatment** [^112KvyxG] [^115KhjSU] and continuous monitoring [^1124Vteu].

---

## Classic ECG findings in hyperkalemia

The **classic ECG progression** in hyperkalemia follows a predictable pattern, reflecting the underlying electrophysiological disturbances:

| **Ecg finding** | **Description** | **Physiological mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Peaked T waves | - Tall, narrow, symmetric T waves <br/> - Earliest sign of hyperkalemia | Increased repolarization rate due to elevated extracellular potassium [^112zroik] |
| PR interval prolongation | - Delayed atrioventricular conduction <br/> - Prolonged PR interval | Slowed atrioventricular conduction due to partial depolarization of atrial myocytes [^113hTA5U] |
| P wave flattening or loss | - Diminished or absent P waves <br/> - Indicates severe hyperkalemia | Atrial myocyte depolarization and conduction block [^112AMs6e] |
| QRS complex widening | - Widened QRS complexes <br/> - Indicates significant conduction delay | Slowed ventricular conduction due to depolarization of ventricular myocytes [^112AMs6e] |
| Sine wave pattern | - Sinusoidal waveform <br/> - Pre-arrest finding | Severe conduction delay and ventricular depolarization-repolarization fusion [^112AMs6e] |

---

## Less common ECG findings

In addition to the classic findings, hyperkalemia may produce **less common ECG changes**, including:

- **Bradyarrhythmias**: Sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythms, and atrioventricular blocks [^114jTwaw].
- **Tachyarrhythmias**: Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation [^112AMs6e].
- **ST segment elevation**: Mimicking acute myocardial infarction (pseudo-infarction pattern) [^114JFp3S] [^111rMedK].
- **Bundle branch blocks**: Right or left bundle branch block patterns [^113x84pY].

---

## Correlation between serum potassium levels and ECG changes

The **severity of ECG changes** correlates with serum potassium concentration, though individual variability is significant:

- **Mild hyperkalemia (5.5–6.0 mmol/L)**: Typically no significant ECG changes; peaked T waves may be present [^114WGZxW].
- **Moderate hyperkalemia (6.0–6.5 mmol/L)**: Peaked T waves, PR interval prolongation, and P wave flattening [^notfound].
- **Severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L)**: QRS widening, sine wave pattern, and life-threatening arrhythmias [^111cd3TY].

---

## Sensitivity and specificity of ECG in hyperkalemia

ECG has **limited sensitivity** for detecting hyperkalemia; sensitivity ranges from 19% to 29%, whereas specificity is high (95–97%) [^114QL8ph]. A normal ECG does not exclude hyperkalemia, particularly in chronic or moderate cases [^115FYLdt] [^114eNVqR].

---

## Clinical implications and management

ECG changes in hyperkalemia indicate **increased risk of malignant arrhythmias** and cardiac arrest [^116MgUnZ]. Immediate intervention is required when ECG changes are present:

- **Intravenous calcium**: Stabilizes cardiac membranes and reverses ECG changes [^116MgUnZ].
- **Insulin and glucose**: Promotes intracellular potassium shift [^1157ga4Q].
- **Beta-agonists**: Adjunctive therapy for intracellular potassium shift [^116qJoqH].
- **Dialysis**: Definitive therapy in severe or refractory cases [^1136HcRm].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can **confound ECG interpretation** in hyperkalemia:

- **Chronic kidney disease**: Blunts ECG sensitivity [^114eNVqR].
- **Medications**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin can mimic or mask ECG changes [^notfound].
- **Concurrent electrolyte abnormalities**: Hypocalcemia and acidosis can exacerbate ECG changes [^notfound].

---

Hyperkalemia on ECG shows a **progressive pattern** from peaked T waves to sine waves, reflecting rising potassium and arrhythmic risk [^112zroik]. Because ECG is insensitive, **normal tracings do not exclude hyperkalemia** [^114QL8ph]; severe cases or any ECG change require urgent treatment and continuous monitoring [^112KvyxG] [^1124Vteu].

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Can physicians detect hyperkalemia based on the electrocardiogram? [^114QL8ph]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although there is no consensus on how to use an electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with hyperkalemia, physicians often obtain it in the acute setting when diagnosing and treating hyperkalemia. The objective of this study is to evaluate if physicians are able to detect hyperkalemia based on the ECG.

Methods

The study was conducted at a large county hospital with a population of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who received hemodialysis (HD) solely on an emergent basis. Five hundred twenty eight ECGs from ESRD patients were evaluated. The prevalence of hyperkalemia was approximately 60% in this cohort, with at least half of them in the severe hyperkalemia range (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L).

Results

The mean sensitivity and specificity of the emergency physicians detecting hyperkalemia were 0.19 (± 0.16) and 0.97(± 0.04) respectively. The mean positive predictive value of evaluators for detecting hyperkalemia was 0.92 (± 0.13) and the mean negative predictive value was 0.46 (± 0.05). In severe hyperkalemia (K ≥ 6.5 mEq/L), the mean sensitivity improved to 0.29 (± 0.20), while specificity decreased to 0.95 (± 0.07).

Conclusion

An ECG is not a sensitive method of detecting hyperkalemia and should not be relied upon to rule it out. However, the ECG has a high specificity for detecting hyperkalemia and could be used as a rule in test.

### Retrospective review of the frequency of ECG changes in hyperkalemia [^115FYLdt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Experimentally elevated potassium causes a clear pattern of electrocardiographic changes, but, clinically, the reliability of this pattern is unclear. Case reports suggest patients with renal insufficiency may have no electrocardiographic changes despite markedly elevated serum potassium. In a prospective series, 46% of patients with hyperkalemia were noted to have electrocardiographic changes, but no clear criteria were presented.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Charts were reviewed for patients who were admitted to a community-based hospital with a diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Inclusion criteria were potassium ≥ 6 with a concurrent electrocardiogram. Data were abstracted regarding comorbid diagnoses, medications, and treatment. Potassium concentrations were documented along with other electrolytes, pH, creatinine, and biomarkers of cardiac injury. Coincident, baseline, and follow-up electrocardiograms were examined for quantitative and qualitative changes in the QRS and T waves as well as the official cardiology readings.

Results

Ninety patients met criteria; two thirds were older than 65, and 48% presented with renal failure. Common medications included beta blockers, insulin, and aspirin; 80% had potassium < 7.2. The electrocardiogram was insensitive for diagnosing hyperkalemia. Quantitative assessments of T-wave amplitude corroborated subjective assessments of T-wave peaking; however, no diagnostic threshold could be established. The probability of electrocardiographic changes increased with increasing potassium. The correlation between readers was moderate.

Conclusions

Given the poor sensitivity and specificity of electrocardiogram changes, there is no support for their use in guiding treatment of stable patients. Without identifiable electrocardiographic markers of the risk for complications, management of hyperkalemia should be guided by the clinical scenario and serial potassium measurements.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- **Definition**: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115Lhcuz]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Management of hyperkalemia — triage and EKG-based severity classification states that aggressiveness of treatment depends on the degree of elevation and the presence or absence of electrocardiogram (EKG) findings; outpatients with acute hyperkalemia who have a potassium concentration of > 6.0 mmol/L or any new EKG changes should be referred to a facility with cardiac monitoring, usually an emergency department; a KDIGO Controversies Conference suggests classifying acute hyperkalemia as Mild: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L without EKG changes, Moderate: 5.0*-5.9 mmol/L with EKG changes or 6.0–6.4 mmol/L without EKG changes, and Severe: 6.0–6.4 mmol/L with EKG changes or > 6.5 mmol/L regardless of EKG findings; the asterisk denotes "or upper limit of normal range", and they acknowledge it is not known whether EKG changes are sensitive in predicting potentially lethal arrhythmia.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### Effects of presentation and electrocardiogram on time to treatment of hyperkalemia [^114y6bmm]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the time to treatment for emergency department (ED) patients with critical hyperkalemia and to determine whether the timing of treatment was associated with clinical characteristics or electrocardiographic abnormalities.

Methods

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of ED patients with the laboratory diagnosis of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mmol/L). Patients presenting in cardiac arrest or who were referred for hyperkalemia or dialysis were excluded. Patient charts were reviewed to find whether patients received specific treatment for hyperkalemia and, if so, what clinical attributes were associated with the time to initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 175 ED visits that occurred over a 1-year time period, 168 (96%) received specific treatment for hyperkalemia. The median time from triage to initiation of treatment was 117 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 59 to 196 minutes). The 7 cases in which hyperkalemia was not treated include 4 cases in which the patient was discharged home, with a missed diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Despite initiation of specific therapy for hyperkalemia in 168 cases, 2 patients died of cardiac arrhythmias. Among the patients who received treatment, 15% had a documented systolic blood pressure (sBP) < 90 mmHg, and 30% of treated patients were admitted to intensive care units. The median potassium value was 6.5 mmol/L (IQR = 6.3 to 7.1 mmol/L). The predominant complaints were dyspnea (20%) and weakness (19%). Thirty-six percent of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were abnormal in 83% of patient visits, including 24% of ECGs with nonspecific ST abnormalities. Findings of peaked T-wave morphology (34%), first-degree atrioventricular block (17%), and interventricular conduction delay (12%) did not lead to early treatment. Vital sign abnormalities, including hypotension (sBP < 90 mmHg), were not associated with early treatment. The chief complaint of "unresponsive" was most likely to lead to early treatment; treatment delays occurred in patients not transported by ambulance, those with a chief complaint of syncope and those with a history of hypertension.

Conclusions

Recognition of patients with severe hyperkalemia is challenging, and the initiation of appropriate therapy for this disorder is frequently delayed.

### Mortality risk stratification utilizing artificial intelligence electrocardiogram for hyperkalemia in cardiac intensive care Unit patients [^114WTCzj]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we were able to demonstrate that the AI-ECG has similar risk-stratification ability consistent with our prior work, which used a more lenient definition of hyperkalemia (> 5.0 mEq/L). Notably, the use of a lower threshold for hyperkalemia has degraded the AUC of the AI-ECG algorithm in prior analyses. Interestingly, from this CICU risk-based analysis, we have identified an at-risk FP group that carries an independently increased risk for overall mortality (both in-hospital and at 1-year), albeit to a lesser extent than laboratory hyperkalemia. The defining characteristic of this FP group is not entirely clear, and further investigation is warranted to understand better what may place this population at elevated mortality risk, even with normokalemia without unprecedented demographic, comorbidity, or illness severity characteristics. We hypothesize that the AI-ECG can detect subtle myocardial electrical signs that correlate predominantly with the myocardial effects of hyperkalemia but may, in some patients, reflect underlying subclinical myocardial disease with an adverse prognosis. Such abnormalities were surprisingly common in our cohort, particularly in comparison to hyperkalemia which was less prevalent and carried a stronger unfavorable prognosis. However, based on the findings of our machine learning analysis designed to determine the relative importance for mortality prediction, the AI ECG was more important for mortality prediction than the laboratory potassium. Notably, it remains unclear whether hyperkalemia (predominantly mild in our study) directly contributed to mortality or was instead a marker for underlying disease not captured by our covariate adjustment.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^114Cqt5M]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, more specifically with respect to patients with cardiac arrest (prevention), UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain continuous cardiac monitoring in patients with severe cardiac hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) in a setting appropriate for the level of care required.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^111QJpsS]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypokalemia:

- **Definition**: Hypokalemia refers to the presence of serum potassium levels < 3.6 mmol/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potassium depletion occurs due to inadequate dietary intake, increased renal excretion (e.g., due to diuretic therapy), or increased gastrointestinal losses in the context of diarrhea.
- **Epidemiology**: Hypokalemia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in clinical practice.
- **Disease course**: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias. Typical electrocardiographic changes include flat or inverted T waves, ST-segment depression, and prominent U waves.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Severe untreated hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and malignant cardiac arrhythmias, such as VT and VF.

### Hyperkalaemia mimics pseudostemi infarct pattern [^114JFp3S]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is an electrolyte abnormality that warrants urgent intervention and has well-recognised electrocardiographic changes. Peaking T wave is the most appreciated ECG sign, but hyperkalaemia manifesting electrocardiographically as acute ischemia with ST segment elevation is a very rare condition. We present a case of acute kidney injury, complicated by severe hyperkalaemia causing ST segment elevation changes in ECG simulating acute myocardial infarction. Rapid serum potassium level in arterial blood gases blood test guide treatment in this case saved the need for unnecessary activation of the catheterisation lab and more importantly, saved the patient from malignant dysthymia in case of treatment delay. Aggressive treatment of hyperkalaemia resulted in successful reduction of serum potassium level; ECG changes returned to baseline without any evidence of pseudoinfarction pattern. The medical staff should be aware of this condition in order to administer correct therapy and prevent unnecessary interventions and the associated risk of complications.

### Sudden cardiac death in a dialysis patient: hyperkalemia reconsidered [^1124GviP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

To many physicians, hyperkalemia is the first diagnosis ascribed to any patient with end-stage renal disease and abnormal electrocardiographic morphologies or dysrhythmias.

Case Report

A 52-year-old man with end-stage renal disease presented in cardiac arrest. The patient was initially presumed to have hyperkalemia, based on the appearance of wide QRS complexes on the monitor. The diagnosis of hyperkalemia was incorrect; the patient was severely hypokalemic and suffered recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes.

Why Should An Emergency Physician Be Aware Of This

An emergency physician's differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac arrest in the patient with end-stage renal disease should not be limited to hyperkalemia and myocardial infarction. Hypokalemia should also be considered. Hypokalemia may be an under-recognized cause of sudden cardiac death in this patient population.

### Electrocardiographic risk stratification in Critically ill cardiac patients: can deep learning fulfill its promise? [^117Qbqgx]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

What could be the potential utility of the proposed ECG-DL in CICU patients? Despite the ECG-DL models' original, intended use for predicting hyperkalemia, ECG is unlikely to replace gold standard laboratory measurement of potassium levels, particularly in the CICU setting. However, given that ECG is readily accessible and quick to perform in the CICU, automated risk assessments derived from a single ECG (when used in conjunction with simultaneous potassium laboratory testing) could offer significant advantages over existing CICU risk scores (eg, APACHE II [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation] and SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment]) that are much more complex to derive and often require 24 hours of multidimensional data collection. Elevated ECG-DL predictions in those without true hyperkalemia ("false positives") may result from the incidental detection of other clinically significant, potentially life-threatening pathology with electrophysiologic manifestations that overlap with those related to hyperkalemia. For example, severe acidemia, ischemia, and new conduction abnormalities such as left bundle branch block may similarly result in QRS prolongation, PR interval delay or heart block, ST-segment deviations, and peaking of T-waves, even in the absence of overt hyperkalemia. Conversely, in patients with true hyperkalemia not flagged by the ECG-DL model, low-risk predictions may reflect an absence of significant electrophysiologic manifestations, and thereby attenuated risk, despite the elevated laboratory value. For example, dialysis patients in whom potassium levels are chronically elevated may not develop significant ECG manifestations or risk of arrhythmia until much higher levels of serum potassium than a patient with new, acute hyperkalemia. Alternatively, there could be unappreciated interactions between potassium levels and effects on the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium, perhaps in the setting of subclinical myocardial disease, as postulated by the authors, that impact outcome. Interpretation is somewhat limited in this study by the lack of information regarding the time interval between ECG performance and collection of laboratory-based potassium levels. For example, it is possible that incorrect ECG-DL predictions may reflect either rapidly corrected hyperkalemic states (eg, the postcardiac arrest or diabetic ketoacidosis patient) or acutely developed hyperkalemia (eg, the acute renal failure or precardiac arrest patient) depending on which test was performed first and the duration of delay prior to performing the second. Unfortunately, minimal assessment of these "false positive" and "false negative" patients was included in the present manuscript and saliency analysis for interpretability of the ECG-DL predictions was not performed, which highlights limitations of the black box nature of some machine learning approaches. Future study using more readily explainable models may help clarify the electrophysiologic basis for these interesting results.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^1173XX1o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study are as follows: 1. In patients with severe hyperkalemia resulting from a critical medical condition, the presence of a BrS phenotype is associated with a high prevalence of malignant arrhythmias and all‐cause mortality. 2. In surviving patients, the characteristic Brugada ECG changes are transient and disappear when the serum K + levels normalize. 3. In patients with BrS, hyperkalemia may elicit the typical BrS ECG manifestations. 4. Higher serum K + levels and male sex were independent predictors for the presence of BrPh ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia. 5. As shown by the response to adenosine infusion and computer simulations, ECG manifestations of systemic hyperkalemia are a consequence of the depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced sodium‐channel availability for action potential activation, which results in delayed and heterogeneous conduction, or block, particularly in the presence of fibrosis at the RVOT.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^1142dhFe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The main mechanism responsible for BrS phenotype relate to abnormal patterns of repolarization and/or impulse activation at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). 13, 14, 15, 16 However, whether BrPh represents transient alterations in myocardial depolarization, repolarization, or any other mechanism is yet to be elucidated. Moreover, the transient nature of BrPh casts doubt about its genetic origin or relation to structural abnormalities, or both.

The objectives of the study were several fold, including to: (1) describe the clinical and ECG characteristics and clinical outcome of patients with hyperkalemic BrPh; (2) compare the clinical characteristics of patients with hyperkalemic BrPh with those of patients with severe hyperkalemia but no BrPh ECG; (3) conduct computer simulations in a three‐dimensional model of ventricular propagation under conditions of varying hyperkalemia to analyze the implication of mutations and/or structural abnormalities in relation to the Brugada sign 17; (4) study the mechanisms underlying hyperkalemic BrPh; and (5) evaluate the proarrhythmic risk of BrPh in the presence of hyperkalemia.

### The management of acute hyperkalaemia in neonates and children [^112ML5NU]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

This review article describes the pathophysiology and common aetiologies of hyperkalaemia including pseudohyperkalaemia, renal impairment, medication, rhabdomyolysis and aldosterone deficiency. Two clinical cases are used to describe symptoms (mainly muscle weakness and arrhythmias) and illustrate different management options. An approach to management including relevant investigations and interpretation of ECG changes is described. Emergency drug treatments are outlined and the effectiveness of individual therapeutic methods in reducing the potassium concentration described. Chronic management is mentioned but is outside the scope of this article. Hyperkalaemia is a rare but potentially life threatening emergency. It is a manifestation of a disease and therefore the incidence in children is not known. Quick and effective intervention may be necessary and clinicians must be adept at managing this condition. This overview provides two clinical scenarios and summarises aetiologies, investigations and management.

Conclusion

This report adds to our understanding of the electrocardiographic features of hyperkalemic BrPh patients. In patients with severe hyperkalemia attributed to critical medical conditions, a BrPh ECG is associated with a high prevalence of malignant arrhythmias and high all‐cause mortality. BrPh ECG manifestations in patients with hyperkalemia are attributed to depolarized resting membrane potential and reduced availability of inward sodium channels. Although I to elevation contributes, it is not essential to generate the hyperkalemic Brugada phenotype.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111cd3TY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Potassium (K +) is a ubiquitous cation contained mostly within the intracellular fluid; only about 2% of total body K + is found in the extracellular fluid. In healthy humans, serum K + levels are tightly controlled within the narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, thus retaining a normal ratio between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. This homeostasis plays a critical role in maintaining cellular resting membrane potential and neuromuscular function and is essential for normal activity of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Hyperkalemia, resulting from an imbalance in K + homeostasis, is defined as a serum K + level of greater than 5.0 mEq/L and is further classified as mild, moderate, or severe. It has been reported that drug therapy and impaired renal function are the main factors predisposing to the development of hyperkalemia.

Severe hyperkalemia (K + of at least 6.5 mEq/L) is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder that has been reported to occur in 1% to 10% of all hospitalized patients, a higher percentage than that seen in outpatients. It is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, including peaked T waves, shortened QT intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reduction in the amplitude of P waves, and 'sine-wave' ventricular rhythms with wide QRS complexes. Severe hyperkalemia eventually causes fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, leading to cardiac arrest. Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; it therefore requires hospitalization, ECG monitoring, and immediate treatment.

To promptly and effectively treat severe hyperkalemia, it is important to know the risk factors, the clinical manifestations, the therapeutic approaches, and the factors that predict both mortality and improvement in this disorder. Although most of these factors are well documented, reliable predictors of clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality have not been established. We therefore designed this study to identify common factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the relationship between serum K + levels and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the association between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^116qjMaA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In patients with cardiovascular and/or renal disease, hyperkalemia is frequent, life‐threatening, and usually asymptomatic. 3, 5 The emergence of safe and effective medications that lower potassium underscores the importance of detection of hyperkalemia. 11, 12, 14, 23 The ability to remotely, unobtrusively, frequently, and noninvasively assess potassium through a single‐channel signal‐processed ECG would permit currently available wireless ECG patches, implanted monitors, and cardiac devices to infer measurements of potassium; would address a critical need; and would affect a large population. In this study of patients undergoing hemodialysis, the signal‐processed ECG was able to calculate potassium values with a mean error of 0.36 ± 0.34 mmol/L using a personalized strategy that required a seeding blood test, providing a clinically meaningful value via individualized medicine. Importantly, even without personalization and in the absence of any blood draws, clinically useful estimates of potassium were obtained, providing potassium values with a mean error of 0.5 ± 0.42 mmol/L, and could be useful for alerts and trending. These findings, using a single lead of high‐resolution ECG data, suggest that this approach may be suitable for remotely monitoring potassium in dialysis patients. This population is at high risk for hyperkalemia and sudden death, often in the 12 hours before a dialysis session, suggesting a hyperkalemic mechanism. 1

### Mortality risk stratification utilizing artificial intelligence electrocardiogram for hyperkalemia in cardiac intensive care Unit patients [^116X1oee]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Blood electrolyte disturbances are common in critically ill patients and have been associated with adverse outcomes. Within the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) population, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia have all been associated with increased short- and long-term mortality. Abnormalities in serum potassium can affect cardiac myocytes, and underlying acute cardiac disease could magnify the association between dyskalemia and adverse outcomes in CICU patients.

Hyperkalemia specifically has been associated with mortality and fatal arrhythmias in the critically ill, including CICU patients. Abnormalities on a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing remain a rapid and simple way to detect hyperkalemia. However, hyperkalemia must be severe to produce ECG abnormalities, and the sensitivity of physician ECG interpretation to diagnose hyperkalemia remains relatively low. Accordingly, we created and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced ECG algorithm to predict hyperkalemia from 2 leads of a standard 12-lead ECG in a large, heterogeneous patient cohort with chronic kidney disease. As the relationship between laboratory measured potassium and mortality in the critically ill is well defined, a knowledge gap remains if a similar mortality association exists for patients with AI-ECG predicted hyperkalemia in a CICU setting.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^1136HcRm]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

When available, ECGs corresponding to the time of severe hyperkalemia diagnosis or those nearest in time to the diagnosis were reviewed and compared with baseline ECGs. The existence of ECG findings typical of severe hyperkalemia, or an alteration in ECG findings compared with previous results, was considered a 'change in ECG findings'. The findings considered typical of severe hyperkalemia were tall T waves, shortening of QT intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reductions in the amplitude of P waves, 'sine-wave' ventricular rhythms with wide QRS complexes, and the occurrences of ventricular fibrillation and asystole. Decisions on ECG findings were based on formal readings, documented by the attending cardiologist, and adjudicated by reviewers and researchers on the basis of an extensive literature review. The period from the diagnosis of hyperkalemia to 'change in ECG findings' was also recorded.

Management of severe hyperkalemia was divided into a conservative management group and an aggressive management group; patients requiring RRT were in the aggressive management group. The choice of RRT modality was made by the attending physician after considering the clinical characteristics of each patient. The criteria for initiation of RRT in AKI included volume overload, oliguria, acidosis, refractory hyperkalemia, and uremic symptoms or documented uremia. We categorized management techniques into 'level of support I' and 'level of support II' categories. 'Level of support I' contained seven initial conservative management strategies, all given a weight of 1: drug cessation, intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate, dextrose fluid with insulin, IV or oral (PO) sodium bicarbonate, calcium polystyrene sulfonate enema, PO calcium polystyrene sulfonate, and IV or PO loop diuretics. The sum of weighted values was defined as the 'level of support I' value for each patient. 'Level of support II' contained nine initial conservative management strategies and RRT treatments: the previously named seven strategies were included with the addition of hemodialysis (weight 1) and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (weight 2). The sum of weighted values was defined as the 'level of support II' value for each patient.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^115Wamne]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is characterized by distinctive ST‐segment elevation in the right precordial leads of the ECG, and propensity for sudden cardiac death. 1, 2 According to the 2013 consensus statement on cardiac arrhythmia syndromes and the 2016 J‐Wave syndromes expert consensus conference report, BrS is diagnosed in patients with spontaneous ST‐segment elevation (≥ 2 mm) with type 1 morphology in ≥ 1 precordial leads, particularly V1 and V2, positioned on the second and third or fourth intercostal spaces. 3, 4 BrS has been considered as a primary electric cardiac disease caused by mutations in genes coding sodium, calcium, and potassium channels in ≈30% of patients. 3, 4, 5 However, other studies found no clear genetic association, and minor structural abnormalities were associated with the syndrome. 6, 7, 8 Moreover, some environmental factors can induce ECG morphologies similar or identical to BrS in the absence of genetic mutations or ion‐channel dysfunction. 6, 9 The acquired form of Brugada‐like ECG pattern, also called Brugada phenotype (BrPh), is manifested by a Brugada ECG pattern in the presence of an identifiable underlying condition and typically disappears after its resolution. 3, 4, 10, 11, 12 Multiple metabolic conditions can lead to BrPh ECG; the majority of cases are associated with serum K + abnormalities, hyperkalemia being the most frequent single cause. 10 Although classical hyperkalemia produces several well‐described ECG alterations, only a minority of patients develop BrPh. 10, 12 Nevertheless, the clinical characteristics and prognostic impact on patients developing BrPh are poorly known.

Hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia in children is defined as plasma potassium greater than 5.5 mmol/L. A retrospective study demonstrated that hyperkalemia constitutes nearly 22.4% of SEA cases in children. While plasma K > 7 mmol/L is found in severe hyperkalemia, children with moderate hyperkalemia have plasma potassium within a range of 6–7 mmol/L. Notably, normal potassium levels are higher in newborns and infants due to their lower glomerular filtration rates and partial aldosterone resistance. Pseudohyperkalemia arises from hemolysis and potassium leakage during or after capillary or venous blood collection. This phenomenon is more prevalent in small children, where the use of smaller needles and surrounding tissue squeezing during blood sample collection can contribute to its occurrence. Pseudohyperkalemia also occurs in patients with leukocytosis or blood clotting or may be a consequence of preanalytical errors including improper blood sample storage, delayed analysis, and specimen contamination. It is recommended to repeat hemolyzed hyperkalemia samples to ensure accurate results.

Hyperkalemia most commonly occurs in children with acute kidney injury or ESKD. It can be attributed to various factors including excessive potassium intake, potassium redistribution, tissue injury (mainly skeletal and cardiac muscle), and massive cell lysis (as seen in tumor lysis syndrome). Additionally, it can be caused by decreased potassium excretion due to kidney dysfunction, mineralocorticoid deficiency, aldosterone resistance (such as in renal tubular acidosis type 4), or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The various etiologies of hyperkalemia are demonstrated in Table 4. Differential diagnosis of hyperkalemia is shown in Fig. 4 using a TTGK threshold of greater or less than 6, as evidenced by Choi et al. While hyperkalemia is often asymptomatic, individuals may manifest symptoms such as weakness, muscular paralysis, and respiratory failure. Additional symptoms may be associated with the underlying disease, such as polydipsia and polyuria in diabetic ketoacidosis or failure to thrive in tubular disorders. Early ECG signs of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, progressing to flattened broad P waves, and QRS complex prolongation with increasing potassium concentrations. In severe cases, hyperkalemia may lead to heart block, asystole, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^113M47Mv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

We compared the clinical manifestations, ECG, and outcomes (malignant arrhythmias and mortality) of BrPh patients with those of severe hyperkalemic patients (K + ≥ 6.5 mmol/L) without BrS phenotype. Overall, patients with the BrPh ECG had a grave prognosis with a short‐ to mid‐term fatality rate of 51% not only related to the baseline clinical disease, but also to the clinical impact of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Moreover, although patients presenting with BrPh had a higher likelihood of developing malignant arrhythmias than non‐BrPh patients (43% versus 25%), in‐hospital mortality was similar because of the poor clinical status in both groups. Junttila et al 34 reported on a series of patients with typical Brugada‐type ECG during an acute medical event (including 5 patients with electrolyte imbalance), where 51% presented malignant arrhythmias and 38% developed sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, in that report, only a minority of patients had a confirmed BrS genetic test. In our cohort of surviving patients, the characteristic BrS ECG changes disappeared when K + levels normalized. We attempted to perform a flecainide test after serum K + levels became normal and found a BrS typical ECG that was unmasked by the hyperkalemic state. Postema et al 35 previously reported a similar case of diabetic ketoacidosis with concomitant hyperkalemia that uncovered a typical BrS.

We compared the ECG of hyperkalemic patients and found that patients showing a BrPh had a wider QRS, and frequently presented abnormal QRS axis and a greater T‐wave height compared with non‐BrPh hyperkalemic patients (Table 3). This contrasted with patients with inheritable BrS that usually have mildly widened QRS complexes, but normal QRS axes on an otherwise normal ECG. 11, 36 Thus, the presence of moderate‐to‐severe hyperkalemia, especially with a Brugada ECG pattern or atypical ST‐segment elevation on the right precordial leads without BrS, should be aggressively treated and considered a risk factor for development of life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that presence of an aVR sign and/or ST‐segment elevation on the right precordial leads pattern reflects more right ventricular conduction delay and electrical heterogeneity, increasing the risk for developing arrhythmic events. 18, 19

Data, analytical methods, and study materials will be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. The data will be made available for requests made to corresponding author by e‐mail.

Patients

From 2010 to 2016, we prospectively identified patients hospitalized at our institution who presented an ECG suggestive of BrS in the context of severe hyperkalemia (group 1). Inclusion in this series required moderate‐to‐severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium [K +] ≥ 6.5 mmol/L), hospitalization for an acute illness and type 1 or 2 Brugada ECG pattern on right precordial leads V1 to V2, which normalized after serum K + levels returned to reference values. 10 Additionally, we also considered patients with atypical ST‐segment elevation on the right precordial leads without BrS and/or aVR sign. 18, 19 Furthermore, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of all adults admitted to our center during 2013 who developed severe hyperkalemia any time during admission, with an available ECG recording at peak serum K + ≥ 6.5 mmol/L (group 2).

For all patients, we recorded demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatments, and hospital outcomes, including diagnosis at discharge and survival status. The ECGs obtained during peak serum K + were analyzed for rate, rhythm, P ‐wave voltage, PR interval duration, QRS width, QRS axis, QTc interval, maximum height of ST‐segment elevation, and T wave height. In group 1 patients, the recorded ECGs were compared before and after treatment of hyperkalemia. In group 1 patients displaying a BrPh ECG, a provocative flecainide test was performed after normalization of the electrolyte disturbances. Patients were considered to be at a low clinical probability of having BrS if they had a negative flecainide challenge test, a lack of family history of syncope or sudden death, no previous history of syncope or cardiac arrhythmia, and normal body temperature. 10 The institutional review board of our center waived the informed consent form and approved the study.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^114tXQhN]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. First, the entire study population was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe hyperkalemia; there was no control group. It is therefore impossible to compare various characteristics between our patients and those with normal K + levels. Second, there is a potentially inherent bias resulting from the fact that only attending physicians evaluated the patients and classified the diverse clinical situations. Although researchers examined and reviewed the data from the electronic medical record in an attempt to minimize bias, inevitable limitations exist. Third, this study was based upon the premise that all patients, except those with DNR status, received equally effective treatment for other conditions such as infection, volume depletion, and bleeding; we did not verify all treatments offered to all patients. Hence, the association between treatments not related to hyperkalemia and clinical outcomes was not verified. Fourth, it was difficult to identify accurately the drugs that caused severe hyperkalemia, as most patients took a number of prescribed medications concurrently. Fifth, the ECG changes described could also have resulted from severe acidosis and myocardial ischemia. For this reason, it was difficult to estimate whether ECG changes were due to severe hyperkalemia alone. Finally, the present study was retrospective in nature, using only an electronic medical record system, and thus some essential information was often unavailable and the subjective opinions and decisions of the researcher became involved in data collection and analysis. Our retrospective study also may have inherent confounders for mortality, compromising our ability to identify a causal relationship between various clinical factors and the in-hospital mortality rate. Accordingly, well-designed, multicenter, prospective, large cohort studies should be conducted to verify the implications of numerous predisposing factors involving medications, comorbidities, and concurrent medical conditions. These future studies should also evaluate the role of different treatments in reducing mortality.

Systemic Hyperkalemia Causing BrPh

Systemic hyperkalemia is most frequently found in patients with chronic and acute renal failure and/or concomitant treatments with nephrotoxic medications or K‐sparing drugs. The classical electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia were first documented in the early 1950s by the presence of peaked T waves, shortened QT interval, lengthening of the PR interval, loss of P waves, and widening of the QRS complex. 28 Moreover, Levine et al also described the presence of the "dialyzable" current of injury resembling acute myocardial infarction or pericarditis. 29 However, Littmann et al reported the first consecutive series that recognized the similarities between the classic BrS ECG manifestations and those occasionally shown in the context of severe hyperkalemia. 11 In agreement with this and other studies, 10, 11, 30 we found that BrPh was most likely present in critically ill male patients with severe decompensation of their renal function and/or malignancies, with high mortality mostly related to their underlying clinical condition. In addition, we found that compared with hyperkalemic patients without Brugada ECG, the BrPh patients presented in males with higher serum K + values (1 mmol/L higher on average). Moreover, lower pH was also strongly related to the development of BrPh. These data, together with the presence of other outcome predictors, such as younger age, lower hypertension prevalence, and lesser chronic renal disease, further confirm the importance of acute increments in K + levels, which might be underestimated in terminal renal failure patients. 31 Given that the density of the strong inward rectifying K + current, I K1, which maintains the resting membrane potential of the ventricular myocyte, is strictly controlled by [K +] o, acute increases in [K +] o, however transient, may place such patients at risk of malignant arrhythmias. 32 The findings of our multivariant analyses further support the predominant role of male sex and higher hyperkalemia levels, together with the role for the acid group presence on the reduction of channel conductance favoring the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, as shown in our simulations. 33

### Point-of-care artificial intelligence-enabled ECG for dyskalemia: a retrospective cohort analysis for accuracy and outcome prediction [^114sFyvb]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

ECGs are commonly used as point-of-care (POC) tests to measure the electrical activity of the heart. Certain electrical changes in the ECG have been associated with dyskalemia, which can be confirmed by laboratory examination. However, prompt recognition of dyskalemia-associated ECG changes prior to laboratory results is still fraught with great challenge in emergent situations. With advanced AI techniques, ECG-based DLMs using large datasets of annotated ECGs have been developed that learn useful and subtle features over what is possible with manual interpretation. In this retrospective study, longer ECG signals (10 s vs. 2.5 s) were found to achieve better diagnostic accuracy with lower MAE (0.365 vs. 0.531 mmol/L) than other recently-published retrospective studies. The early or almost simultaneous collection of ECG with bloodwork reduced the chance of Lab-K + biased by treatment, in stark contrast to other reports in which ECGs were obtained 1 to 6 h before or after blood tests. As expected, the complete 12-lead analysis performed better than any single lead. Of note, the present AUCs of 0.932–0.942 for detecting Lab-K + ≥ 5.5 mmol/L were higher than others using 2 to 4 leads (AUCs 0.853–0.901).

In our ED patients, the prevalence of hyperkalemia was approximately 2%, which is in line with other reports of hyperkalemia occurring in 2–5% of ED patients. Despite AUC greater than 0.93 for hyperkalemia detection, the positive predictive value is low (10.4–14.7%) in the setting of low prevalence of hyperkalemia. Although this seemingly high false positivity rate of AI-ECG for hyperkalemia may cause anxiety and inconvenience for clinicians and patients, pseudo-positive EKG-K + for hyperkalemia, importantly, predicts adverse outcomes due to ECG changes directly reflecting underlying cardiac and non-cardiac disorders. This finding is similar to the "previvor" patients in a recent study of AI-enabled ECG analysis for left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which showed that those individuals with apparently false-positive AI-ECG findings had a fourfold increased risk of developing ventricular dysfunction over the ensuing 5 years.

WARNINGS

Hyperkalemia

The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when potassium-conserving agents, including amiloride HCl, are administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, cyclosporine or tacrolimus. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.) Warning signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias, muscular weakness, fatigue, flaccid paralysis of the extremities, bradycardia, shock, and ECG abnormalities. Monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential because mild hyperkalemia is not usually associated with an abnormal ECG.

When abnormal, the ECG in hyperkalemia is characterized primarily by tall, peaked T waves or elevations from previous tracings. There may also be lowering of the R wave and increased depth of the S wave, widening and even disappearance of the P wave, progressive widening of the QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, and ST depression.

Treatment of hyperkalemia: If hyperkalemia occurs in patients taking amiloride HCl, the drug should be discontinued immediately. If the serum potassium level exceeds 6.5 mEq per liter, active measures should be taken to reduce it. Such measures include the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate solution or oral or parenteral glucose with a rapid-acting insulin preparation. If needed, a cation exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be given orally or by enema. Patients with persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis.

Diabetes Mellitus

In diabetic patients, hyperkalemia has been reported with the use of all potassium-conserving diuretics, including amiloride HCl, even in patients without evidence of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, amiloride HCl should be avoided, if possible, in diabetic patients and, if it is used, serum electrolytes and renal function must be monitored frequently.

Amiloride HCl should be discontinued at least 3 days before glucose tolerance testing.

Metabolic or Respiratory Acidosis

Antikaliuretic therapy should be instituted only with caution in severely ill patients in whom respiratory or metabolic acidosis may occur, such as patients with cardiopulmonary disease or poorly controlled diabetes. If amiloride HCl is given to these patients, frequent monitoring of acid-base balance is necessary. Shifts in acid-base balance alter the ratio of extracellular/intracellular potassium, and the development of acidosis may be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels.

Results

Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Patients With Hyperkalemic BrPh

During a 6‐year observation period, we identified 15 patients with severe hyperkalemia and type 1 or 2 ECG Brugada pattern or atypical repolarization signs on the right precordial leads (ST‐segment elevation on the right precordial leads pattern). 3, 4, 18 Figure 1 shows ECG data from precordial lead recordings from each patient displaying a BrPh ECG at the time of peak hyperkalemia. None of the patients had a family history of BrS, cardiac arrhythmias, or syncope. Baseline clinical characteristics, hospital admission reason, and etiology of hyperkalemia are shown in Table 1. In all cases, ECG changes were transient and disappeared after plasma serum K + levels returned to normal (Table 2).

Most patients were middle aged (56.4 ± 16 years old) men (79%), presenting a critically ill state on admission. In fact, 3 were brought to the emergency room because of out‐of‐hospital sudden cardiac arrest. The most frequent primary etiology of hyperkalemia was decompensated renal function. Six (43%) patients died during admission for different reasons (Table 1): Two patients presented postanoxic encephalopathy, 1 had recurrent cardiac arrest at the time of arrival in the emergency room, and 2 presented septic shock (patients 6 and 9). One patient died after prolonged admission because of metastatic testicular cancer. Patient 3 died 3 months after hospital discharge because of terminal hepatic disease.

### Electrocardiography is unreliable to detect potential lethal hyperkalemia in patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease [^114eNVqR]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemodialysis patients with hypercalcemia are less likely to manifest the usual electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalemia than in those with normal renal function. This study was conducted to determine whether electrocardiography (ECG) is a reliable indicator to detect severe life-threatening hyperkalemia in non-dialysis CKD patients. The study was conducted at three referral university hospitals between July 2017 and June 2018. Severe hyperkalemia was defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 8.0 mEq/L. Serum potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, and creatinine concentrations were measured and simultaneous 12-lead ECG was obtained. Patients with end-stage renal disease receiving renal replacement therapy were excluded. Also excluded were patients with the usual ECG abnormalities to hyperkalemia. Of the 438 patients screened, 10 (2.3%) aged 2–14 years with severe hyperkalemia and normal ECG findings were identified. Median serum potassium level was 8.6 mEq/L (range 8.2–9.0). All had regular sinus rhythm. P, QRS, ST segment, T morphology, PR and QT interval, and QRS duration were all normal. Hyperkalemia was associated with CKD, metabolic acidosis, and hypercalcemia in all cases. Therapy with intravenous 0.9% saline, sodium bicarbonate, glucose, insulin, calcium, and salbutamol corrected the hyperkalemia in 7 patients. The remaining three patients evinced arrhythmias requiring hemodialysis. Although rare, non-dialysis CKD patients with hypercalcemia may not manifest the usual electrographic abnormalities associated with hyperkalemia. Thus, a normal ECG finding in non-dialysis CKD patients should be interpreted with caution.

### External validation and update of the early detection rule for severe hyperkalemia among patients with symptomatic bradycardia [^111SyyqN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chon et al. suggested a high prevalence of severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L with electrocardiographic [ECG] changes) among patients with symptomatic or extreme bradycardia. Despite the urgent need to detect and treat severe hyperkalemia, serum potassium result may be available too late and is often spuriously high. Meanwhile, the traditional, descriptive ECG findings of severe hyperkalemia have shown unsatisfactory diagnostic powers. To overcome these diagnostic problems, they outlined the following quantitative rules to facilitate its early detection: Maximum precordial T wave ≥ 8.5 mV (2), atrial fibrillation/junctional bradycardia (1), heart rate (HR) ≤ 42/min (1) with (original rule)/without (ECG-only rule) diltiazem medication (2), and diabetes mellitus (1). Here we report on our external validation of these rules and the resulting updates.

Methods

This retrospective, cross-sectional study included all adults with symptomatic (HR ≤ 50/min with syncope/pre-syncope/dizziness, altered mentality, chest pain, dyspnea, general weakness, oliguria, or shock) or extreme (HR ≤ 40/min) bradycardia who visited a university emergency department from 2014 to 2019. After validating the abovementioned rules externally, we selected risk factors of severe hyperkalemia among the ECG findings and easy-to-assess clinical variables by multiple logistic regression analysis. After modelling the updated 'ECG-only' and 'ECG-plus' indices, we internally validated the better of the two by bootstrapping with 1000 iterations.

Results

Among 455 symptomatic/extreme bradycardia cases (70.3 ± 13.1 years; 213 females [46.8%]), 70 (15.4%) had severe hyperkalemia. The previous ECG-only rule showed a c-statistic of 0.765 (95% CI: 0.706–0.825), Hosmer-Lemeshow test of p < 0.001, and a calibration slope of 0.719 (95% CI: 0.401–1.04). On updating, the ECG-plus index summing junctional bradycardia/atrial fibrillation (1), maximum precordial T wave ≥ 8.0 mV (2), general weakness as the chief complaint (2), oxygen demand (1), and dialysis (2) outperformed the ECG-only index (c-statistic, 0.832; 95% CI, 0.785–0.880 vs. 0.764; 95% CI, 0.700–0.828; p = 0.011). On bootstrapping, the c-statistic was 0.832 (95% CI: 0.786–0.878). For scores ≥ 3 (positive likelihood ratio ≥ 5.0), the sensitivity and specificity were 0.514 and 0.901, respectively. For scores ≤ 1, negative likelihood ratio was ≤ 0.2.

Conclusions

Previous rules showed less satisfactory calibration but fair discrimination to detect severe hyperkalemia in patients with symptomatic or extreme bradycardia. We propose the ECG-plus index as the optimum tool to facilitate its early detection.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^115CCEyG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Several metabolic conditions can cause the Brugada ECG pattern, also called Brugada phenotype (BrPh). We aimed to define the clinical characteristics and outcome of BrPh patients and elucidate the mechanisms underlying BrPh attributed to hyperkalemia.

Methods and Results

We prospectively identified patients hospitalized with severe hyperkalemia and ECG diagnosis of BrPh and compared their clinical characteristics and outcome with patients with hyperkalemia but no BrPh ECG. Computer simulations investigated the roles of extracellular potassium increase, fibrosis at the right ventricular outflow tract, and epicardial/endocardial gradients in transient outward current. Over a 6‐year period, 15 patients presented severe hyperkalemia with BrPh ECG that was transient and disappeared after normalization of their serum potassium. Most patients were admitted because of various severe medical conditions causing hyperkalemia. Six (40%) patients presented malignant arrhythmias and 6 died during admission. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that higher serum potassium levels (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 3.1–79; P = 0.001) and male sex (odds ratio, 17; 95% CI, 1.05–286; P = 0.045) were risk factors for developing BrPh ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia. In simulations, hyperkalemia yielded BrPh by promoting delayed and heterogeneous right ventricular outflow tract activation attributed to elevation of resting potential, reduced availability of inward sodium channel conductance, and increased right ventricular outflow tract fibrosis. An elevated transient outward current gradient contributed to, but was not essential for, the BrPh phenotype.

Conclusions

In patients with severe hyperkalemia, a BrPh ECG is associated with malignant arrhythmias and all‐cause mortality secondary to resting potential depolarization, reduced sodium current availability, and fibrosis at the right ventricular outflow tract.

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^11334Z7H]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia

Like other potassium-conserving diuretic combinations, amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may cause hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mEq per liter). In patients without renal impairment or diabetes mellitus, the risk of hyperkalemia with this combination product is about 1 to 2 percent. This risk is higher in patients with renal impairment or diabetes mellitus (even without recognized diabetic nephropathy). Since hyperkalemia, if uncorrected, is potentially fatal, it is essential to monitor serum potassium levels carefully in any patient receiving amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, particularly when it is first introduced, at the time of dosage adjustments, and during any illness that could affect renal function.

The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when potassium-conserving agents, including amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, are administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, cylosporine or tacrolimus (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Warning signs or symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias, muscular weakness, fatigue, flaccid paralysis of the extremities, bradycardia, shock, and ECG abnormalities. Monitoring of the serum potassium level is essential because mild hyperkalemia is not usually associated with an abnormal ECG.

When abnormal, the ECG in hyperkalemia is characterized primarily by tall, peaked T waves or elevations from previous tracings. There may also be lowering of the R wave and increased depth of the S wave, widening and even disappearance of the P wave, progressive widening of the QRS complex, prolongation of the PR interval, and ST depression.

Treatment of Hyperkalemia

If hyperkalemia occurs in patients taking amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, the drug should be discontinued immediately. If the serum potassium level exceeds 6.5 mEq per liter, active measures should be taken to reduce it. Such measures include the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate solution or oral or parenteral glucose with a rapid-acting insulin preparation. If needed, a cation exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate may be given orally or by enema. Patients with persistent hyperkalemia may require dialysis.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^112AMs6e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

As [K +] e increases still further, conduction velocity decreases (broadening the P and QRS complexes) and the refractory period increases, promoting cardiac conduction blocks. As depolarization merges with (premature) repolarization, there may be Q–T shortening (and apparent ST segment elevation) or the classic 'sine wave' ECG.

Thus hyperkalemia may manifest as any of various ECG abnormalities: P, QRS, ST or T wave changes, resolution of conduction blocks, new conduction blocks, asystole, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. However, the sensitivity and specificity of ECG changes for hyperkalemia (and for cardiac death in hyperkalemia) are poor, and there are many case reports of normal or near-normal ECGs in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

The pro-arrhythmogenic effects of hyperkalemia may be reversed by therapy with calcium (typically administered as chloride or gluconate salts) or sodium (typically as sodium bicarbonate).

Peripheral neuropathy

The effects of hyperkalemia on myocardial excitability can be dramatic, but there is emerging evidence that hyperkalemia may also exert clinically important effects on neuronal excitability. Median nerve conduction studies in hemodialysis patients have demonstrated pre-dialysis axonal depolarization (when serum [K +] was ∼5.4 mM). Using an elegant protocol in which the nerve conduction studies were repeated after dialysis against a high-dialysate [K +] (effectively a 'potassium clamp') and again after dialysis against a low-dialysate [K +], Arnold et al. demonstrated that a normal electrophysiological profile could be restored by lowering serum [K +] but not by the clearance of other uremic toxins. They speculate that chronic hyperkalemia could contribute to the pathogenesis of uremic neuropathy and myopathy. In support of this, dietary potassium restriction improved peripheral nerve function in patients with CKD in a single-blind RCT.

### Brugada syndrome and "Brugada sign": clinical spectrum with a guide for the clinician [^1172gDNN]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with the manifest Brugada syndrome have an inordinate risk of sudden death and are candidates for implantation of a defibrillator. The Brugada type electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality (the "Brugada sign"), however, is known to be associated with a wide range of conditions, many of which may not pose such a threat. Clinicians need guidance in choosing a rational approach for the evaluation and treatment of patients with a finding of the Brugada sign.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed to identify publications on the Brugada syndrome and the Brugada-type ECG abnormality, with special emphasis on analyzing outcomes data. In addition, the ECG database of our institution was reviewed for tracings consistent with the Brugada sign, and, when possible, clinical correlations were made.

Results

Patients with the Brugada sign and a family history of sudden death or a personal history of syncope are at a high risk of sudden death and therefore should be strongly considered for implantation of a defibrillator. In patients who are hospitalized and critically ill, the Brugada sign is frequently the result of severe hyperkalemia, drug toxicity, or right ventricular injury. In most individuals with no symptoms and without a family history of sudden death, the Brugada sign is likely a normal variant.

Conclusions

Most patients with the Brugada sign can be risk-stratified with simple clinical tools. Specific testing for the Brugada syndrome should be reserved for questionable cases and for the research setting. A provisional diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm is offered as a means of assisting the clinician in the evaluation and treatment of patients with the Brugada sign.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Patiromer induces rapid and sustained potassium lowering in patients with chronic kidney disease and hyperkalemia [^111JjZ8A]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Seventeen patients had moderate hyperkalemia at baseline (mean (s.e.) = 5.84 (0.03) mEq/l); eight patients had severe hyperkalemia (mean (s.e.) = 6.14 (0.04) mEq/l). In a prespecified secondary analysis, mean changes in serum potassium over time in these two subgroups were consistent with those seen in the overall population. For patients with moderate and severe hyperkalemia, respectively, the mean (s.e.) change from baseline at 7 h was −0.17 (0.07) mEq/l (95% CI = −0.31, −0.03) and −0.29 (0.15) mEq/l (95% CI = −0.61, 0.04), respectively.

In a prespecified exploratory analysis, the proportion of patients with serum potassium values ≤ 5.5 mEq/l was 20%, 36%, and 80% at 7-, 12-, and 24- h, respectively (Figure 3). In a post hoc analysis, the median time to achieve first serum potassium ≤ 5.5 mEq/l was 12.7 h (95% CI = 11.0, 22.6; Figure 4).

Safety

Patiromer was well tolerated over 2 days of treatment, with no serious or severe adverse events reported. Seven (28%) patients experienced eight adverse events during the active treatment phase through follow-up. The most common adverse events (occurring in two patients each) were mild constipation and mild hypotension (Table 2). No deaths occurred in the study, and no adverse events led to study drug withdrawal. No hypokalemic events (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/l) or hypomagnesemia (< 1.4 mg/dl) were reported, and no clinically relevant alterations in other blood chemistry parameters were observed. Two patients (8%) experienced an increase from baseline in serum magnesium ⩾0.4 mg/dl, and no patient had a decrease of ⩾0.4 mg/dl.

No patients had electrocardiogram (ECG) changes that were consistent with hypokalemia or hyperkalemia during active treatment through follow-up. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs by criteria prespecified in the protocol.

### Detecting chronic kidney disease by electrocardiography [^113mwGyB]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

An important possible confounder in the interpretation of ECG changes in patients with CKD are abnormalities in serum potassium. Deep learning models based on ECG interpretation have been validated for the detection of hyperkalemia, and can be predictive of other electrolyte imbalances. While detailed data on electrolytes were not available in the study of Holmstrom et al. the accuracy of the model was similar in patients with and without hyperkalemia in the subgroup where potassium levels were available, which suggest that variations in potassium levels did not have a major influence on the detection of CKD by the model.

In support of the present study, another study by Kwon et al. also assessed the prediction of CKD by ECG analysis using a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks. In that study, the model was trained to detect an eGFR level of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e. stage 3B or higher). Accuracy of the model was higher in the study of Kwon et al. which might be due to the fact that data on eGFR were available for all patients or that only patients with a more pronounced decline in renal function were included, with demographic features also included in the model. This study did not, however, evaluate the detection of earlier stage CKD, such as stage 3A disease that is less severe but nevertheless still associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.

Machine learning models based on ECG analysis have also been used in the detection of various types of heart failure, as well as other chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. As in CKD, left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis are also common in patients with diabetes and might induce comparable ECG changes. As detailed data on (pre)diabetic status and blood pressure control were missing in the study by Holmstrom et al. the question remains to which extent the model in the study is specific for CKD. As the relation between ECG changes and CKD is likely mediated by subclinical cardiac injury, it may also miss patients with CKD without cardiac damage. However, although this needs to be addressed in future studies, the model may indicate those patients with CKD who are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Interestingly, in a study where a deep learning model was applied to predict hypo- or hyperkalemia from ECGs, the risk of mortality was higher in those patients where the model indicated abnormalities in serum potassium as compared to laboratory values. This is also relevant for patients with CKD, given the increased prevalence of hyperkalemia and the associated mortality risk in these patients.

### Pacemaker ECG with the littmann sign [^115nfNNo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe hyperkalemia may be concealed in the electrocardiogram (ECG). We present the case of a critically ill patient with severe bradycardia and the BRASH syndrome. In critically ill patients, double counting of the heart rate is frequently a marker of severe hyperkalemia (Littmann sign). In our case, hyperkalemic double counting only appeared in the ECG performed during percutaneous pacing. The Littmann sign helped with the early recognition of hyperkalemia and the BRASH syndrome.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^113yRofz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyper- and hypokalemia are clinically silent, common in patients with renal or cardiac disease, and are life threatening. A noninvasive, unobtrusive, blood-free method for tracking potassium would be an important clinical advance.

Methods and Results

Two groups of hemodialysis patients (development group, n = 26; validation group, n = 19) underwent high-resolution digital ECG recordings and had 2 to 3 blood tests during dialysis. Using advanced signal processing, we developed a personalized regression model for each patient to noninvasively calculate potassium values during the second and third dialysis sessions using only the processed single-channel ECG. In addition, by analyzing the entire development group's first-visit data, we created a global model for all patients that was validated against subsequent sessions in the development group and in a separate validation group. This global model sought to predict potassium, based on the T wave characteristics, with no blood tests required. For the personalized model, we successfully calculated potassium values with an absolute error of 0.36 ± 0.34 mmol/L (or 10% of the measured blood potassium). For the global model, potassium prediction was also accurate, with an absolute error of 0.44 ± 0.47 mmol/L for the training group (or 11% of the measured blood potassium) and 0.5 ± 0.42 for the validation set (or 12% of the measured blood potassium).

Conclusions

The signal-processed ECG derived from a single lead can be used to calculate potassium values with clinically meaningful resolution using a strategy that requires no blood tests. This enables a cost-effective, noninvasive, unobtrusive strategy for potassium assessment that can be used during remote monitoring.

### Mortality risk stratification utilizing artificial intelligence electrocardiogram for hyperkalemia in cardiac intensive care Unit patients [^111EctXy]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

This analysis mirrors our previous work utilizing the AI-ECG algorithm to detect LVSD. Similarly, AI-ECG prediction of LVSD was associated with in-hospital mortality and 1-year survival in CICU patients providing an additive risk-modifier alongside LVSD identified by transthoracic echocardiogram. In each of our studies, we observe increasing in-hospital mortality between TN, FP, FN, and TP groups, respectively, based on AI-ECG prediction of underlying pathology (ie, LVSD or hyperkalemia). Interestingly, FP and FN AI-ECG results for LVSD demonstrated similar 1-year survival on Kaplan-Meyer analysis, while we observed higher 1-year mortality with FN vs FP in our present AI-ECG hyperkalemia analysis. The explanation for this 1-year mortality difference is hypothetical. However, early ECG-based identification of imminent structural cardiac pathophysiology (LVSD) may carry a similar risk as the later manifestation of structural heart disease, which does not always trigger a positive AI-ECG result (ie, FN). As hyperkalemia is not a progressive, structural cardiac pathology, nor is it a consistent electrolyte abnormality in critically ill patients, the long-term AI-ECG prediction for hyperkalemia alone (FP result) may not carry the same survival characteristics as the AI-ECG for LVSD. However, it is worth considering that these FP and TP AI-ECG results reflect underlying myocardial disease, which may experience additional impact from fluctuations in blood potassium levels, even within the 'normal' range with prognostic implications. Indeed, those with AI-ECG suggestive of LVSD are substantially more likely to develop LVSD by transthoracic echocardiogram during follow-up. Perhaps a similar phenomenon occurred with the AI-ECG prediction of hyperkalemia.

5.3 Hyperkalemia

Potassium Phosphates Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium [see Contraindications (4)]. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection and do not exceed the maximum age- appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

When administering Potassium Phosphates Injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer Potassium Phosphates Injection and use an alternative source of phosphorus [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

The maximum initial or single dose of Potassium Phosphates Injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium through a peripheral venous catheter is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and use an alternative source of phosphate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The maximum initial or single dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Hyperkalemia

Potassium-containing solutions, including Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and/or characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. Cardiac conduction disorders (including complete heart block) and other cardiac arrhythmias, some fatal, can develop at any time during hyperkalemia. Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring may be necessary to aid in the detection of cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia, do not administer Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP as an intravenous push (i.e., intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access) without a quantitative infusion device.

Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those:

with conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as patients with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or atrioventricular (AV) block (especially if they receive digoxin).
who are at risk of experiencing hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergoing correction of alkalosis (conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space).
treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).
with cardiac arrhythmias.

Cardiac dysrhythmia: mechanism

An increase in [K +] e has several consequences for the myocardial action potential (AP; Figure 2). These are driven by depolarization of the resting (RP) and activation of inward rectifier potassium channels (carrying currents I K1 and I Kr).

FIGURE 2
Mechanism of cardiac arrhythmia in hyperkalemia. In normokalemia, the cell membrane of the cardiomyocyte is polarized (resting potential around −90 mV). In moderate hyperkalemia, the cell membrane becomes partially depolarized, bringing the resting potential closer to the threshold potential for AP initiation. Therefore fast sodium channels (Na v 1.5) are activated more readily, increasing excitability and conduction velocity. This manifests as T wave peaking on the ECG as a mass of ventricular cardiomyocytes undergo (synchronous) early repolarization. In severe hyperkalemia, voltage-dependent inactivation of Na v 1.5 channels and activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels (K ir) lead to reductions in conduction velocity and can render cells refractory to excitation. This manifests as broadening of ECG complexes and/or conduction blocks. This figure represents an idealized model, as there is poor correlation between ECG features and the degree of hyperkalemia.

Depolarization of the RP exerts a biphasic effect on myocardial excitability and conduction velocity. Modest increases in [K +] e (up to ∼8 mM) increase excitability and conduction velocity as the RP moves closer to the threshold potential for AP initiation [via activation of voltage-gated Na + channels (Na V 1.5)]. Further increases in [K +] e reduce conduction velocity or even prevent AP initiation (at [K +] e ∼14 mM), due to the steady-state inactivation of Na V 1.5 channels at depolarized membrane potentials. Activation of inward rectifier K + currents during repolarization (AP Phases 3 and 4) induces rapid repolarization and retards diastolic depolarization of Purkinje fibres.

The net effect is that as [K +] e rises modestly, the AP duration shortens, manifesting as peaked T-waves on an electrocardiogram (ECG), as a mass of myocardium undergoes premature synchronous repolarization. Furthermore, conduction velocity increases so that cardiac conduction blocks may resolve (hence why cardiologists request measures to increase plasma [K +] to high–normal in bradyarrhythmias). These pro-excitatory changes may induce fibrillation or tachyarrhythmias.

### Tetraparesis and failure of pacemaker capture induced by severe hyperkalemia: case report and systematic review of available literature [^1119XnnH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In severe hyperkalemia, neurologic symptoms are described more rarely than cardiac manifestations. We report a clinical case; present a systematic review of available literature on secondary hyperkalemic paralysis (SHP); and also discuss pathogenesis, clinical effects, and therapeutic options.

Case Report

A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of tetraparesis. Her serum potassium level was 11.4 mEq/L. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a pacemaker (PMK)-induced rhythm, with loss of atrial capture and wide QRS complexes. After emergency treatment to restore cell membrane potential threshold and lower serum potassium, neurologic and ECG signs completely disappeared. An acute myocardial infarction subsequently occurred, possibly linked to tachycardia induced by salbutamol therapy. We reviewed 99 articles (119 patients). Mean serum potassium was 8.8 mEq/L. In most cases, ECG showed the presence of tall T waves; loss of PMK atrial capture was documented in 5 patients. In 94 patients, flaccid paralysis was described and in 25, severe muscular weakness; in 65 patients, these findings were associated with other symptoms. Concurrent renal failure was often documented. The most frequent treatments were dialysis and infusion of insulin and glucose. Eighty-seven percent of patients had complete resolution of symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Severe hyperkalemia is always a life-threatening medical emergency, as it can precipitate fatal dysrhythmias and paralysis. SHP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic signs and symptoms of uncertain etiology, especially in a subject with kidney failure or who is taking medications that may worsen renal function. The presence of a PMK does not necessarily impede hyperkalemic cardiac toxicity.

### Real world evidence for treatment of hyperkalemia in the emergency department (REVEAL-ED): a multicenter, prospective, observational study [^114cwdHY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary emergency department (ED) standard-of-care treatment of hyperkalemia is poorly described.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the treatment patterns of hyperkalemia management in the ED.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, observational study evaluated patients aged ≥ 18 years with hyperkalemia (potassium [K +] level ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) in the ED from October 25, 2015 to March 30, 2016. K + -lowering therapies and K + were documented at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after initial ED treatment. The primary end point was change in K + over 4 h.

Results

Overall, 203 patients were enrolled at 14 U.S.-based sites. The initial median K + was 6.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 5.7–6.8) mmol/L and median time to treatment was 2.7 (IQR 1.9–3.5) h post-ED arrival. Insulin/glucose (n = 130; 64%) was frequently used to treat hyperkalemia; overall, 43 different treatment combinations were employed within the first 4 h. Within 4 h, the median K + for patients treated with medications alone decreased from 6.3 (IQR, 5.8–6.8) mmol/L to 5.3 (4.8–5.7) mmol/L, while that for patients treated with dialysis decreased from 6.2 (IQR 6.0–6.6) mmol/L to 3.8 (IQR 3.6–4.2) mmol/L. Hypoglycemia occurred in 6% of patients overall and in 17% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L. Hyperkalemia-related electrocardiogram changes were observed in 23% of all patients; 45% of patients with K + > 7.0 mmol/L had peaked T waves or widened QRS. Overall, 79% were hospitalized; 3 patients died.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia practice patterns vary considerably and, although treatment effectively lowered K +, only dialysis normalized median K + within 4 h.

ECG morphology and risk analysis in patients with discordant Lab-K + and ECG-K +

Patients with normal Lab-K + but abnormal ECG-hyperkalemia (ECG-K + ≥ 5.5 mmol/L or false-positive hyperkalemia) had lower prevalence of sinus rhythm and higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation/flutter, junctional rhythm, premature ventricular complex, supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block, left bundle branch block, and left ventricular hypertrophy, compared to those with normal Lab-K + and ECG-K + (3.6–5.4 mmol/L) (Fig. 7A). The false-positive hypokalemia group (ECG-K + ≤ 3.5 mmol/L and 3.5 < Lab-K + < 5.5 mmol/L) also had lower prevalence of sinus rhythm and higher prevalence of prolonged QT interval, premature ventricular complex, supraventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block, and left ventricular hypertrophy, compared to those with normal Lab-K + and ECG-K + (3.6–5.4 mmol/L). Figure 7B shows the protective association of sinus rhythm and detrimental association of other morphologies on adverse outcomes.

The hazard ratios and odds ratios were adjusted by hospital. Red, gray, and blue bars denote significantly positive, non-significant, and negative associations, respectively, with the corresponding outcomes.

Sensitivity analysis

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, model performances were similar before and after the COVID-19 pandemic except for severe hypokalemia detection (K + ≤ 2.5 vs. K + > 2.5) at the community hospital due to the small sample size before the pandemic began (n = 6 vs. n = 3,134). Moreover, risk curves were similar between included (ECG and lab < 1 h apart) and excluded patients (ECG and lab > 1 h apart) for all-cause mortality and ED revisits (Supplementary Fig. 9) although the risk curve was significantly less pronounced for hospitalization. This was likely due to these patients having received treatment in the ED.

Generally, mild hypokalemia is the most common potassium disorder seen clinically; however, severe complications can occur. Hyperkalemia is less common but more serious, especially if levels are rising rapidly. The etiologies and treatments for both hypo- and hyperkalemia are discussed, with special emphasis on the role medications play in the etiologies of each.

### Potassium phosphate, monobasic potassium phosphate, dibasic injection, (Potassium phosphates) [^117AtcxC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3
Hyperkalemia

Potassium phosphates injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium [see Contraindications (4)]. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of potassium phosphates injection and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

When administering potassium phosphates injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer potassium phosphates injection and use an alternative source of phosphorus [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

The maximum initial or single-dose of potassium phosphates injection in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium through a peripheral venous catheter is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^113uV6Hq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Potassium levels outside the normal range are concerning because they are usually clinically silent and occur without warning to the patient or provider in the absence of blood tests. 10 In addition, a standard 12‐lead ECG is diagnostic only after the onset of severe hyper‐ or hypokalemia. There is a critically unmet need for a noninvasive method of measuring potassium prior to clinically significant changes that may lead to arrhythmogenic death so as to initiate timely lifesaving treatment. 11 Noninvasive remote potassium monitoring would permit the administration of evidence‐based life‐saving measures and medications, including recently developed safe and effective potassium‐lowering medications. 12, 13, 14, 15

Recently, in a small cohort of dialysis patients, we demonstrated that the signal‐processed 12‐lead ECG can detect subtle T wave changes that, in turn, can be used to calculate blood potassium concentrations reliably. 16 To facilitate clinical applicability, a less cumbersome, noninvasive approach is required. To that end, the goal of this study was to refine our processing methodology to reduce detection requirements to a single channel (to enable mobility and home use) and to demonstrate a correlation between the processed ECG and potassium as well as use the ECG to prospectively calculate potassium values reliably. Potassium value extraction using a single lead would permit use in wearable, wireless ECG patches and possibly in implantable loop recorders and cardiac implantable electronic devices (pacemakers and defibrillators). To test the hypothesis that the properly processed ECG could be used to calculate serum potassium from a single lead and to do this reliably both with and without an initial "seeding" blood test to train the algorithm, we performed a prospective trial in a cohort of dialysis patients.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^112Mt8NF]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Overdosage

The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly intravenously, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result (see Contraindications and Warnings). It is important to recognize that initally hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration and characteristic electrocardiographic changes (peaking of T-waves, loss of P-wave, depression of S-T segment, and prolongation of the QT interval). Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest.

Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and potassium-sparing diuretics, as well as ACE inhibitors, beta blocking agents, NSAIDs, heparin, and cyclosporine. In cases of life-threatening hyperkalemia, treatment measures may include: (1) intravenous administration of 300 to 500 ml/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10–20 units of insulin per 1,000 ml; (2) correction of acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate; (3) use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis; (4) administration of a calcium salt to antagonize the cardiotoxic effects in patients whose electrocardiograms show appropriate characteristics, and who are not receiving digitalis glycosides; and (5) maintenance of a high urine output in suitable patients.

In treating hyperkalemia, it should be recalled that in patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, rapid lowering of serum potassium can produce digitalis toxicity.

Central Illustration
Mortality Risk-Stratification in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Utilizing an Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Electrocardiogram to Predict Hyperkalemia

CICU = cardiac intensive care unit; ECG = electrocardiogram.

Our work parallels Lin et al, who describe a similar AI-ECG to predict potassium value with outcomes implications. In their study, an AI algorithm applied to a 12-lead ECG yielded blood potassium value predictions (1.5–7.5 mmol/L) rather than a probability of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia. They demonstrated a mortality association with significantly abnormal laboratory potassium values and AI-ECG-predicted dyskalemia. Interestingly, this group identified a similar pattern of AI-ECG risk-modification with a respectively increasing HR for FP, FN, and TP AI-ECG to lab hyperkalemia/mortality relationship, implying that the serum potassium level was more strongly associated with outcomes than the AI-ECG despite their complementary prognostic information. While using an entirely separate AI-ECG model, patient population, and hyperkalemia definition, we identified a strikingly similar pattern of risk stratification. This AI-ECG to laboratory discordance, with independent prognostic value, is an interesting attribute of these algorithms, indicating their potential scalability. The finding that the AI-ECG could provide added risk stratification in patients with either high or normal laboratory potassium levels could suggest that perhaps it is the effect of abnormal potassium levels on the myocardium which is most crucial. We acknowledge that a more transparent AI system to understand better these discrepant results would be beneficial and is an area of ongoing research.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

Treatment

Approaches to managing hyperkalemia depend upon symptom severity and include dietary potassium intake restriction, dosage adjustment of MR blockers and/or RAS inhibitors, promotion of potassium excretion from the body using diuretics, use of oral potassium adsorbent agents, such as calcium/sodium polystyrene sulfonate, promotion of potassium redistribution from extracellular to intracellular spaces via intravenous administration of insulin and glucose, cell membrane stabilization via intravenous administration of calcium solution, and hemodialysis.

For patients with mild hyperkalemia (< 6.0 mEq/L) without ECG changes, a reduced potassium intake and discontinuation of potassium-elevating drugs may be sufficient to normalize potassium levels. Strategies to remove potassium from the body, such as the use of loop diuretics and oral potassium adsorbent agents, should be considered for emergent or symptomatic hyperkalemia. Administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate causes gastrointestinal excretion of potassium, but careful monitoring is necessary as the rate of excretion may be unpredictable.

These same procedures are generally also effective for severe hyperkalemia (> 6.5 mEq/L) without ECG changes. If more aggressive therapy is required, potassium can be redistributed using insulin and glucose, with a peak occurring 60 min after administration and continuing for several hours; however, these agents may be contraindicated in patients with certain comorbidities. During insulin administration, glucose is administered simultaneously to prevent hypoglycemia caused by increased uptake of glucose alongside potassium. For severe hyperkalemia (> 6.5 mEq/L), particularly in patients with cardiomyocyte damage in whom an ECG trace shows the loss of P-wave or QRS widening, treatment with intravenous calcium to antagonize the action of potassium in the heart may also be indicated. In emergency cases, hemodialysis is necessary.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111Cobfz]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe hyperkalemia, with potassium (K+) levels ≥ 6.5 mEq/L, is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalance. For prompt and effective treatment, it is important to know its risk factors, clinical manifestations, and predictors of mortality.

Methods

An observational cohort study was performed at 2 medical centers. A total of 923 consecutive Korean patients were analyzed. All were 19 years of age or older and were hospitalized with severe hyperkalemia between August 2007 and July 2010; the diagnosis of severe hyperkalemia was made either at the time of admission to the hospital or during the period of hospitalization. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis were assessed, and clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality were reviewed, using the institutions' electronic medical record systems.

Results

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was the most common underlying medical condition, and the most common precipitating factor of hyperkalemia was metabolic acidosis. Emergent admission was indicated in 68.6% of patients, 36.7% had electrocardiogram findings typical of hyperkalemia, 24.5% had multi-organ failure (MOF) at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, and 20.3% were diagnosed with severe hyperkalemia at the time of cardiac arrest. The in-hospital mortality rate was 30.7%; the rate was strongly correlated with the difference between serum K+ levels at admission and at their highest point, and with severe medical conditions such as malignancy, infection, and bleeding. Furthermore, a higher in-hospital mortality rate was significantly associated with the presence of cardiac arrest and/or MOF at the time of diagnosis, emergent admission, and intensive care unit treatment during hospitalization. More importantly, acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with normal baseline renal function was a strong predictor of mortality, compared with AKI superimposed on CKD.

Conclusions

Severe hyperkalemia occurs in various medical conditions; the precipitating factors are similarly diverse. The mortality rate is especially high in patients with severe underlying disease, coexisting medical conditions, and those with normal baseline renal function.

An increased infusion rate of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause:

Hyperkalemia

Manifestations of hyperkalemia may include:
disturbances in cardiac conduction and arrhythmias, including bradycardia, heart block, asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation.
hypotension,
muscle weakness up to and including muscular and respiratory paralysis, paresthesia of extremities,
gastrointestinal symptoms (ileus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)
The presence of any ECG findings that are suspected to be caused by hyperkalemia should be considered a medical emergency.
If hyperkalemia is present or suspected, discontinue the infusion immediately and institute close ECG, laboratory and other monitoring and, as necessary, corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Potassium chloride (K-tab) [^117JZynY]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia. However, if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if intravenous administration is too rapid, potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). It is important to recognize that hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration (6.5–8.0 mEq/L) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes (peaking of T-waves, loss P-waves, depression of S-T segments, and prolongation of the QT intervals). Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest (9–12 mEq/L).

Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following:

Elimination of foods and medications containing potassium and of any agents with potassium-sparing properties;
Intravenous administration of 300 to 500 mL/hr of 10% dextrose solution containing 10–20 units of crystalline insulin per 1,000 mL;
Correction of acidosis, if present, with intravenous sodium bicarbonate;
Use of exchange resins, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.

In treating hyperkalemia, it should be recalled that in patients who have been stabilized on digitalis, lowering the serum potassium concentration too rapidly can produce digitalis toxicity.

The extended release feature means that absorption and toxic effects may be delayed for hours. Consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug.

### Life-threatening hyperkalemia from nutritional supplements: uncommon or undiagnosed? [^116qJoqH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Potassium chloride and other potassium compounds are used by the general public as salt substitutes, muscle-building supplements, and panacea. Severe hyperkalemia from oral potassium is extremely rare if kidney function is normal because of potassium adaptation. The oral potassium dose has to be large enough to overcome the normal renal excretory mechanisms to cause severe hyperkalemia. This occurs most commonly in patients with renal impairment or those who take potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We present two unique cases of near-fatal hyperkalemia from nutritional supplements containing potassium. The first case was due to salt-substitute intake, whereas the second case was from a muscle-building supplement. Both patients suffered cardiac arrest, but were successfully resuscitated and survived. The acuity of intake and excessive quantity overwhelmed the kidneys' ability for adaptation. Potassium toxicity affects multiple organ systems and manifests in characteristic, acute cardiovascular changes with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Neuromuscular manifestations include general muscular weakness and ascending paralysis may occur, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms manifest as nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, and local mucosal necrosis that may lead to perforation. Once an urgent situation has been handled with intravenous push of a 10% calcium salt, short-term measures should be started with agents that cause a transcellular shift of potassium, namely, insulin with glucose, β2-agonist, and NaHCO(3). Patients are unaware of these potentially serious adverse effects, and there are inadequate consumer warnings. Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring potassium intake from over-the-counter supplements.

### Long-term mortality and trajectory of potassium measurements following an episode of acute severe hyperkalaemia [^113v2U48]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Concerning the EKG abnormalities and despite the limitations of the study, we can add that a previous study that included 188 episodes of severe hyperkalaemia (sK ≥ 6.5 mEq/L) using a very robust methodology for EKG abnormalities, showed that 71% of the episodes had at least one EKG abnormality suggestive of hyperkalaemia, with the two most common findings being QRS (electrocardiographic waves (Q wave, R wave and S wave)) prolongation (43%) and peaked T waves (30%). These data are similar to those shown in our study.

The management of an acute episode of hyperkalaemia is well-established. However, the evidence endorsing the frequency of monitoring and the optimal medical treatment avoiding the recurrences and the occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes remains not well defined. Recently, new approaches have been made in a summary from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes conference about the handling of acute hyperkalaemia in the emergency department, reinforcing the idea that frequent re-evaluation of serum potassium concentrations is essential in order to follow the treatment success and screen for a rebound rise of serum potassium after an episode of severe hyperkalaemia and during the follow-up.

### Mortality risk stratification utilizing artificial intelligence electrocardiogram for hyperkalemia in cardiac intensive care Unit patients [^116wVGap]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia has been associated with increased mortality in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. An artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced electrocardiogram (ECG) can predict hyperkalemia, and other AI-ECG algorithms have demonstrated mortality risk-stratification in CICU patients.

Objectives

The authors hypothesized that the AI-ECG hyperkalemia algorithm could stratify mortality risk beyond laboratory serum potassium measurement alone.

Methods

We included 11,234 unique Mayo Clinic CICU patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 with a 12-lead ECG and blood potassium (K) level obtained at admission with K ≥ 5 mEq/L defining hyperkalemia. ECGs underwent AI evaluation for the probability of hyperkalemia (probability > 0.5 defined as positive). Hospital mortality was analyzed using logistic regression, and survival to 1 year was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox analysis.

Results

In the final cohort (n = 11,234), the mean age was 69.6 ± 10.5 years, 37.8% were females, and 92.4% were White. Chronic kidney disease was present in 20.2%. The mean laboratory potassium value for the cohort was 4.2 ± 0.3 mEq/L. The AI-ECG predicted hyperkalemia in 33.9% (n = 3,810) of CICU patients and 12.9% (n = 1,451) of patients had laboratory-confirmed hyperkalemia (K ≥ 5 mEq/L). In-hospital mortality increased in false-positive, false-negative, and true-positive patients, respectively (P < 0.001), and each of these patient groups had successively lower survival out to 1 year.

Conclusions

AI-ECG-based prediction of hyperkalemia, even with a normal laboratory potassium value, was associated with higher in-hospital mortality and lower 1-year survival in CICU patients. This study demonstrated that AI-ECG probability of hyperkalemia may enable rapid individualized risk stratification in critically ill patients beyond laboratory value alone.

### Clinical characteristics and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying Brugada ECG in patients with severe hyperkalemia [^1122tWNp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Proarrhythmic Risk of BrPh Pattern Attributed to Hyperkalemia

To our knowledge, the relationship between hyperkalemia and the BrS ECG manifestations had not yet been systematically investigated. Together, the clinical results and computer simulations presented above provide mechanistic insight into the manifestation of electrolytic dysregulation causing Brugada phenotype. Even in the absence of genetic disease (eg, inheritable SCN5A mutations), delays in ventricular activation, and propagation failure at the RVOT, magnified by the presence of hyperkalemia and, possibly, low acid base state, promote the required electrophysiological changes, including APD shortening, membrane depolarization, and reduced sodium‐channel availability, which enable the manifestation of BrPh ECG, an effect that is magnified by RVOT fibrosis. Introduction of fibrotic tissue reduced the excitability of the RVOT and slowed CV, leading to a ST‐segment elevation on V1 and V2 leads, creating the substrate for inducibility of malignant arrhythmias. In agreement with previous clinical reports, computer simulations showed that programmed stimulation caused electrogram fractionation and unidirectional block to initiate stable reentry formation without the need of an extrasytole. 8 Unexcitability attributed to the high concentration of potassium and its propensity to the generation of arrhythmias agrees with recent reports. 12 These results are supported by simulations by other groups showing that activation delay and right ventricular excitation failure attributed to current‐load mismatch secondary to decrease in calcium current or increase in I to can cause BrS. 16, 17 Similar mechanisms could be responsible for other types of BrPh, with low availability of sodium channels given that it occurs during hypothermia or acidosis in ischemic regions.

### Electrocardiogram in hyperkalemia… [^111btroj]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In a patient with renal failure and shortness of breath, Q waves transiently appeared in the right precordial leads of the electrocardiogram during episodes of hyperkalemia, without a substantial change in mean electrical axis. With restoration of the plasma potassium levels to normal, R waves reappeared in these leads. It is concluded that the transient development of Q waves in the right precordial leads during hyperkalemia resulted from a hyperkalemia-induced conduction disturbance. Hyperkalemia, by affecting conduction in Purkinje fibers or ventricular muscle, or both, disturbed the normal sequence of septal and anterior wall depolarization and resulted in an ECG pattern that mimicked that of anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Clinically, hyperkalemia-induced conduction disturbances of this type must be included in the differential diagnosis of the ECG that suggests an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Arnsdorf MF.

A man in his 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease status post–renal transplant, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome status after dual-chamber pacemaker placement presented to the emergency department complaining of progressively worsening dyspnea and diarrhea of 1 week's duration. He denied any chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. Vital signs on admission were significant for hypoxia with an oxygen requirement of 4 L/min, blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and heart rate of 90 bpm. Physical examination was remarkable for an elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral pulmonary basilar crackles, and lower extremity pitting edema. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated potassium level of 9. 0 mmol/L and a creatinine level of
2. 8 mg/dL. Severe bilateral pulmonary congestion was noted on chest radiography. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at the time of admission.
