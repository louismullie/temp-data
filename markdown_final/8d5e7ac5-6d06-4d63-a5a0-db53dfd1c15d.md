## Question

tics from adhd meds in 9 year old?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage new-onset tics in a 9-year-old who is being treated with stimulant medication for ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal relationship between tic onset and stimulant initiation or dose change. Then, I should verify baseline and family history of tics and Tourette syndrome and review label guidance about monitoring. Next, I will examine the evidence on whether stimulants causally increase tics. After that, I need to distinguish the natural waxing–waning course of tics from medication effects. Then, I will outline an initial management strategy based on timing and impairment, select evidence-based treatments for comorbid ADHD and tics, and finally establish a monitoring and follow-up plan with an actionable algorithm for shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the key clinical context and timeline because misattributing causality is common. I need to know when the tics started relative to starting the stimulant or changing its dose; immediate emergence within days suggests a possible dose-related effect, whereas onset after months on a stable dose points more toward the natural emergence of a comorbid tic disorder at this age, which is a recognized pitfall in clinical practice [^116PXjXN]. I should also confirm any personal or family history of tics or Tourette syndrome and document a baseline exam, as FDA labeling advises screening for tics before initiating stimulants and ongoing monitoring for emergence or worsening during treatment [^1148JvRw] [^1166URtx]. Wait, let me verify the epidemiology signal I'm using; meta-analytic data show similar event rates for new-onset or worsening tics in stimulant versus placebo groups, which supports a cautious interpretation of temporal associations in individual cases [^111adewG].

> Next, I should review the evidence on stimulant exposure and tic risk to avoid over-calling adverse effects. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 22 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 2,385 children found no significant increase in risk of new-onset or worsening tics with psychostimulants versus placebo, regardless of stimulant type, dose, duration, or age, which strongly refutes a causal link at the population level [^111adewG]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; FDA labels for amphetamine and methylphenidate do list tics and Tourette syndrome exacerbation as potential adverse reactions and recommend monitoring, so I need to reconcile label vigilance with trial data by individualizing causality assessment case-by-case [^1148JvRw] [^1166URtx]. I should also note that earlier controlled data similarly found no elevated risk of first-onset tics during stimulant treatment, supporting continued use when ADHD benefit is meaningful and tics can be managed [^113FF2MV].

> I will now examine the natural history of tics to avoid attribution errors. Tics characteristically wax and wane over weeks to months, often intensifying with stress, fatigue, or excitement; brief observation windows risk mistaking natural waning for treatment benefit or waxing for treatment harm, so I should compare trajectories over approximately 2–3 months when judging any intervention's effect [^112GBnSd]. Wait, I should double-check that recommendation against broader guidance; this extended observation approach is widely emphasized to mitigate common pitfalls in pediatric psychopharmacology for tic disorders and aligns with best-practice evaluation of response and nonresponse patterns over time [^112GBnSd].

> Now, let me map initial management decisions to the timing and severity of tic emergence while preserving ADHD control. If tics appeared shortly after stimulant initiation or a dose increase, a prudent first step is to reduce the stimulant dose and observe whether tics diminish, as this can clarify a dose-related effect without sacrificing ADHD control prematurely [^116PXjXN]. If tics persist, are impairing, or if they emerged after a prolonged period on a stable stimulant dose, I should avoid reflexively discontinuing an effective stimulant and instead consider adding a tic-targeting intervention, particularly an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, given their dual benefit on ADHD and tics and a favorable safety profile relative to antipsychotics in many children [^116PXjXN] [^1115qntn]. Hold on, I should verify the hierarchy; behavioral therapy for tics, specifically CBIT, has high-quality evidence and should be considered early, especially when available, with medication reserved for moderate to severe impairment or when behavioral access is limited or insufficient alone [^114xv58J] [^1115qntn].

> Let me consider specific evidence-based options for comorbid ADHD and tics in a 9-year-old. Guanfacine reduced tic severity by about 31% versus 0% on placebo in a small randomized trial while also improving ADHD symptoms, supporting its role as a first-line pharmacologic adjunct or alternative when tics need treatment alongside ADHD, though I should acknowledge sample size limitations and integrate this with broader guideline summaries [^112QYJGY] [^1115qntn]. I should confirm comparative nuances; clonidine is also effective for tics but tends to be more sedating and often requires divided dosing, whereas guanfacine's postsynaptic alpha-2A selectivity may confer advantages for executive function and behavioral regulation in some youth, informing individualized selection and titration strategies [^111W8QUn]. But wait, what if nonpharmacologic options are accessible and preferred; CBIT demonstrates significant tic reduction in a large randomized trial and should be offered, either alone or combined with medications when impairment warrants multi-modality care, and combining guanfacine with methylphenidate can address both disorders without clear added safety concerns in clinical practice reports when ADHD severity necessitates stimulant continuation [^114xv58J] [^116qw8bT].

> Next, I should review monitoring, dosing, and safety to ensure a careful, stepwise approach. I need to regularly monitor for tic emergence or worsening on stimulants in line with FDA labeling, and any decision to reduce, continue, or discontinue should weigh ADHD functional gains against tic-related impairment and patient/family preferences [^1148JvRw] [^1166URtx]. Let me verify dosing discipline; "start low, go slow" is essential to minimize sedation and hypotension with alpha-2 agonists, with guanfacine typically titrated within a therapeutic window of approximately 1–4 mg in younger children and up to 7 mg in adolescents, individualized by weight, response, and tolerability, and with careful blood pressure and pulse monitoring during up-titration [^1121hADU]. I should confirm differential diagnoses because since the COVID-19 era, functional tic-like behaviors have surged in adolescents, are often complex, rapidly severe, and generally unresponsive to standard tic medications, warranting early recognition and tailored behavioral approaches distinct from primary tic disorders [^1124iJ34] [^1133XkVM] [^1164pnVv].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical decision framework with self-checks at each step. If ADHD is well controlled and tics emerged after a stable period, I should continue the stimulant and add CBIT and/or an alpha-2 agonist such as guanfacine, reassessing across several weeks to months to account for natural waxing–waning patterns and to document functional change rather than transient fluctuations [^114xv58J] [^116PXjXN] [^112GBnSd]. If ADHD is poorly controlled and tics are problematic, I should consider guanfacine monotherapy or staged augmentation, balancing impairment from both conditions and revisiting stimulant use once tics are stabilized if needed, with shared decision-making guiding trade-offs [^113SRexJ] [^1115qntn]. If tics appeared immediately after starting or increasing a stimulant, I should first reduce the stimulant dose, reassess in 2–4 weeks, and only consider discontinuation or switching if tics remain clearly dose related and impairing despite dose optimization, recognizing that at a population level stimulants do not increase tic risk versus placebo [^116PXjXN] [^111adewG]. Throughout, I need to screen for functional tic-like presentations, align treatment with impairment and patient values, and maintain a clear monitoring plan consistent with label guidance and evidence-based practice for this age group [^1148JvRw] [^1166URtx] [^1115qntn].

---

Tics can emerge or worsen in about **5–7%** [^111adewG] of children treated with stimulants; however, the risk is similar to placebo [^113FF2MV] and often reflects the natural course of tics rather than a true medication effect [^116PXjXN]. Most tics are **mild and transient** [^116p6wTm] and resolve with dose adjustment or by switching to non-stimulants [^1115qntn] (guanfacine, clonidine, atomoxetine). If tics persist or are severe, consider behavioral therapy (CBIT) [^114xv58J] or antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone). Monitor closely and adjust treatment as needed [^1166URtx].

---

## Incidence and prevalence of tics associated with ADHD medications

- **Incidence of tics with stimulants**: Meta-analysis of 22 RCTs (n = 2,385) [^111adewG] found new or worsening tics in 5.7% on stimulants vs 6.5% on placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78–1.27), indicating no significant excess risk.

- **Incidence of tics with non-stimulants**: Guanfacine and clonidine are associated with low tic risk and may reduce tics [^112QYJGY]; atomoxetine has a low risk of inducing tics.

- **Natural course of tics**: Tics commonly wax and wane [^116KjSe9], and new tics often reflect this natural course rather than a medication effect [^116PXjXN].

---

## Clinical characteristics of medication-induced tics

Medication-induced tics include **motor tics** — sudden, brief, repetitive movements such as eye blinking, facial grimacing, or shoulder shrugging [^117VXQ2M]. Vocal tics are involuntary sounds like throat clearing, grunting, or sniffing. Tics typically **emerge within weeks** of starting or increasing stimulant therapy and often **resolve with dose reduction** or discontinuation [^113FF2MV].

---

## Risk factors for developing tics with ADHD medications

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of tics or Tourette syndrome increases risk [^116p6wTm].

- **Comorbid conditions**: Anxiety, OCD, and autism spectrum disorder may increase susceptibility [^1138vcH5].

- **Medication factors**: Higher doses and rapid titration may increase risk [^1121hADU]; start low and go slow [^116PXjXN].

---

## Management strategies for medication-induced tics

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or switch to a different stimulant formulation [^1145xUKk].

- **Medication switch**: Consider non-stimulants (guanfacine, clonidine, atomoxetine) if tics persist [^112QYJGY].

- **Behavioral interventions**: CBIT is effective for reducing tic severity [^114xv58J].

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Antipsychotics (aripiprazole, risperidone) may be used for severe tics [^1115qntn] [^113SRexJ].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most medication-induced tics are **mild and transient**, resolving with dose adjustment or discontinuation. Long-term outcomes: Persistent tics may require ongoing management, but most children experience **improvement over time** [^117VXQ2M].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

**AAP guidelines** recommend combining FDA-approved medications with behavioral interventions [^111orm8m] and titrating to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects [^1145xUKk]. Monitoring should include **regular assessment for tics** [^1148JvRw], with treatment adjustments as needed.

---

Tics can occur with ADHD medications, particularly stimulants [^1166URtx], yet the risk is similar to placebo [^111adewG] and often reflects the natural course of tics [^116PXjXN]. **Most tics are mild and transient**, typically resolving with dose adjustment or by switching to non-stimulants [^112QYJGY]. Persistent or severe tics may require behavioral therapy [^114xv58J] or antipsychotics [^1115qntn].

Nine of 17 subjects who received guanfacine were blindly rated on the Clinical Global Improvement scale as either much improved or very much improved, compared with none of 17 subjects who received placebo. The mean score on the parent-rated hyperactivity index improved by 27% in the guanfacine group and 21% in the placebo group, not a significant difference. On the Continuous Performance Test, commission errors decreased by 22% and omission errors by 17% in the guanfacine group, compared with increases of 29% in commission errors and of 31% in omission errors in the placebo group. Tic severity decreased by 31% in the guanfacine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. One guanfacine subject with sedation withdrew at week 4. Guanfacine was associated with insignificant decreases in blood pressure and pulse.

### Behavior therapy for children with Tourette disorder: A randomized controlled trial [^114xv58J]. JAMA (2010). High credibility.

Tourette disorder is a chronic and typically impairing childhood-onset neurologic condition. Antipsychotic medications, the first-line treatments for moderate to severe tics, are often associated with adverse effects. Behavioral interventions, although promising, have not been evaluated in large-scale controlled trials.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy of a comprehensive behavioral intervention for reducing tic severity in children and adolescents.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial of 126 children recruited from December 2004 through May 2007 and aged 9 through 17 years, with impairing Tourette or chronic tic disorder as a primary diagnosis. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 sessions during 10 weeks of behavior therapy (n = 61) or a control treatment consisting of supportive therapy and education (n = 65). Responders received 3 monthly booster treatment sessions and were reassessed at 3 and 6 months following treatment.

- **Intervention**: Comprehensive behavioral intervention.

- **Main outcome measures**: Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (range 0–50, score > 15 indicating clinically significant tics) and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale (range 1 [very much improved] to 8 [very much worse]).

- **Results**: Behavioral intervention led to a significantly greater decrease on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (24.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 23.1–26.3] to 17.1 [95% CI, 15.1–19.1]) from baseline to endpoint compared with the control treatment (24.6 [95% CI, 23.2–26.0] to 21.1 [95% CI, 19.2–23.0]) (P < .001).

### Comprehensive systematic review summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1115qntn]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

To systematically evaluate the efficacy of treatments for tics and the risks associated with their use, this project followed the methodologies outlined in the 2011 edition of the American Academy of Neurology's guideline development process manual. We included systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on the treatment of tics that included at least 20 participants (10 participants if a crossover trial), except for neurostimulation trials, for which no minimum sample size was required. To obtain additional information on drug safety, we included cohort studies or case series that specifically evaluated adverse drug effects in individuals with tics.

There was high confidence that the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics was more likely than psychoeducation and supportive therapy to reduce tics. There was moderate confidence that haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, tiapride, clonidine, onabotulinumtoxinA injections, 5-ling granule, Ningdong granule, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus were probably more likely than placebo to reduce tics. There was low confidence that pimozide, ziprasidone, metoclopramide, guanfacine, topiramate, and tetrahydrocannabinol were possibly more likely than placebo to reduce tics. Evidence of harm associated with various treatments was also demonstrated, including weight gain, drug-induced movement disorders, elevated prolactin levels, sedation, and effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and ECGs.

There is evidence to support the efficacy of various medical and behavioral interventions for the treatment of tics.

Is it best to replace methylphenidate with guanfacine or use it as an adjunct when ADHD is present but tics require treatment as well?

As both methylphenidate and guanfacine are licensed for the treatment of ADHD, they can be helpful and effective for this condition; however, the co-occurrence of tics is unlikely to be adequately treated using methylphenidate. While treating ADHD with methylphenidate can have beneficial effects on associated symptoms that increase tics (such as frustration, impulsivity, and emotional dysregulation), there does not appear to be a direct effect on tics.

- **Clinical decision-making**: The choice between switching to guanfacine or augmenting methylphenidate with guanfacine is based on several factors:
	- The relative severity of ADHD and tic symptoms.
	- Whether methylphenidate is effectively managing the ADHD symptoms.
	- Whether methylphenidate appears to be worsening tics.

If methylphenidate is already effective in treating ADHD symptoms but tics worsen and/or require treatment, guanfacine may be added. In cases of mild to moderate ADHD symptoms with co-existing tics, or if methylphenidate is only partially effective or poorly tolerated, discontinuation of methylphenidate and switching to guanfacine may be considered. If tics improve with guanfacine alone but ADHD worsens, then methylphenidate may be restarted. In cases of mild-to-moderate ADHD with co-existing tics (where both require treatment), there is an argument to suggest that guanfacine monotherapy should be considered as the first-line medication choice rather than methylphenidate.

### Meta-analysis: Risk of tics associated with psychostimulant use in randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^111adewG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Clinical practice currently restricts the use of psychostimulant medications in children with tics or a family history of tics due to fears that tics will develop or worsen as a side effect of treatment. Our goal was to conduct a meta-analysis to examine the risk of new onset or worsening of tics as an adverse event of psychostimulants in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

We conducted a PubMed search to identify all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of psychostimulant medications in the treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We used a fixed effects meta-analysis to evaluate the risk ratio of new onset or worsening tics in children treated with psychostimulants compared to placebo. Stratified subgroup analysis and meta-regression were employed to examine the effects of stimulant type, dose, duration of treatment, recorder of side effect data, trial design, and mean age of participants on the measured risk of tics.

We identified 22 studies involving 2,385 children with ADHD for inclusion in our meta-analysis. New onset tics or worsening of tic symptoms were commonly reported in both the psychostimulant (event rate = 5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%) and placebo groups (event rate = 6.5%, 95% CI = 4.4%-9.5%). The risk of new onset or worsening of tics associated with psychostimulant treatment was similar to that observed with placebo (risk ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78–1.27, z = -0.05, p = .962). Type of psychostimulant, dose, duration of treatment, recorder, and participant age did not affect the risk.

### Advances in understanding and treatment of Tourette syndrome [^117VXQ2M]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a hereditary, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that was first clearly described in France in 1885. This disorder is characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal or phonic tics), often preceded by premonitory sensations or urges. Some individuals also have psychiatric comorbidities, notably attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Tourette syndrome occurs worldwide, in all races and ethnicities, in both sexes and in children as well as in adults. Estimates of its prevalence in children vary, with rates of up to 1% being reported, but rates of 0.3–0.8% are thought to accurately reflect the occurrence of the disorder.

Research has led to progress in many aspects of Tourette syndrome, although many questions and unmet needs remain. For example, except for rare cases, the genetic basis remains elusive. The anatomical and neuronal changes in the brain that underlie Tourette syndrome are also unclear, although the evidence increasingly implicates alterations in basal ganglia function. Treatment is often unnecessary for individuals with mild tics, but for those with moderate to severe forms of the syndrome, some drugs are available, albeit frequently ineffective. Behavioral and surgical therapies, in particular deep brain stimulation, are currently undergoing development and show promising results. This review examines the history of Tourette syndrome and describes its clinical presentation. The article also provides an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with ADHD, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the following agents in patients with stimulant use disorder with co-occurring ADHD:

- **Topiramate combined with extended-release mixed amphetamine salts**: This combination may be beneficial in managing co-occurring conditions.

- **Long-acting amphetamine formulation psychostimulants**: These formulations are recommended for sustained effect.

- **Long-acting methylphenidate formulations**: These are advised for better management of symptoms.

### Tourette's syndrome [^116p6wTm]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Tourette's syndrome is a movement disorder most commonly seen in school-age children. The incidence peaks around preadolescence, with one half of cases resolving in early adulthood. Tourette's syndrome is the most common cause of tics, which are involuntary or semivoluntary, sudden, brief, intermittent, repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics). It is often associated with psychiatric comorbidities, mainly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given its diverse presentation, Tourette's syndrome can mimic many hyperkinetic disorders, making the diagnosis challenging at times. The etiology of this syndrome is thought to be related to basal ganglia dysfunction.

Treatment can be behavioral, pharmacologic, or surgical, and is dictated by the most incapacitating symptoms. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists are the first line of pharmacologic therapy, but dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are required for multiple, complex tics. Dopamine-receptor-blocking drugs are associated with potential side effects, including sedation, weight gain, acute dystonic reactions, and tardive dyskinesia. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment can substantially improve quality of life and psychosocial functioning in affected children.

Regarding specific circumstances for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, particularly in patients with stimulant use disorder, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend addressing ADHD symptoms as part of the substance use disorder treatment for patients with co-occurring ADHD. Consider offering the following:

- **Psychostimulant medications**: Manage ADHD when the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks.

- **Non-stimulant medications**: Manage ADHD when the benefits of psychostimulant medications do not outweigh the risks.

- **Behavioral approaches**: Incorporate behavioral strategies to support treatment.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^111XtjNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications.

- **Mechanisms of action**: In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse.

Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

### National estimates and factors associated with medication treatment for childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^11424gFj]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

In this study, we identified child and family-level characteristics associated with medication treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder using nationally representative survey data.

- **Methods**: National Survey of Children's Health data from 79,264 youth aged 4 to 17 years were used. Data were weighted to adjust for the complex survey design of the National Survey of Children's Health. Gender-specific logistic regression models were generated to identify child and family-level characteristics collectively associated with medication status among youth with a reported diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

- **Results**: Nationally, 7.8% of youth aged 4 to 17 years had a reported attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and 4.3% had both a disorder diagnosis and were currently taking medication for the disorder. Medication treatment among youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was associated with white race, younger age, English spoken in the home, health care coverage, a health care contact within the last year, and reported psychological difficulties. Gender-specific logistic regression models revealed that, together, younger age, higher income, health care coverage, having psychological difficulties, and a health care contact in the past year were associated with medication use among boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Among girls with the disorder, younger age, psychological difficulties, and fair-to-poor paternal mental health status were associated with a health care contact within the past year.

### Mental health in the United States. Prevalence of diagnosis and medication treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder — United States, 2003 [^1126m4tj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), previously known as attention deficit disorder, is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that often results in substantial functional impairment. Prevalence estimates of ADHD in school-aged children have ranged from 2% to 18% in community samples. Although stimulant medications are an effective first-line treatment for ADHD, concern persists regarding the possible side effects and long-term health outcomes associated with stimulant consumption. Estimating the number of children who have had ADHD diagnosed and are currently taking medication for the disorder is an important step toward understanding the overall burden of ADHD in the United States.

Previously, population-based estimates of medication treatment for ADHD were not available or were limited by their lack of generalizability. To estimate rates of parent-reported ADHD diagnosis and medication treatment for ADHD, the CDC analyzed data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, in 2003, approximately 4.4 million children aged 4–17 years were reported to have a history of ADHD diagnosis; of these, 2.5 million (56%) were reported to be taking medication for the disorder. Because both substantial health risks and benefits might be associated with medication treatment for ADHD, further study of this population of children with ADHD is needed.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^112GBnSd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Tics**: Assessing the effectiveness of drug treatments requires allowing sufficient time. The natural course of tics is a waxing (increasing) and waning (decreasing) pattern over weeks or months. Over hours and days, tics can also worsen due to factors such as anxiety, anger, excitement, or tiredness. Tics commonly wax during stressful periods, such as the start of a new school year or during exams. A common pitfall is to prematurely assume treatment is effective when simply observing a natural waning phase, or conversely, that a drug treatment is ineffective when observing a natural waxing phase. To avoid these pitfalls, it is important to evaluate treatment effects over a sufficiently long period, usually 2–3 months, to compare peaks (waxing phases) and troughs (waning phases) before and after treatment initiation.

- **Is the tic diagnosis correct?** Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented rise in functional tics, particularly in teenage girls. Functional tics can be difficult to differentiate from a primary tic disorder and can also co-occur with primary tics. However, as functional tics are not responsive to standard tic medications, a common pitfall when failing to observe a tic treatment response at standard doses is to continue dose escalation, thus causing increasing adverse effects. Another common diagnostic pitfall is related to motor mannerisms and stereotypies which occur in autism and can mimic complex motor tics but are not responsive to tic treatments.

### The phenomenology of tics in adults: Data from the Calgary and Paris adult tic disorders registry [^116APk1q]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are commonly associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, and anxiety disorders. Screening for these disorders is essential in clinical practice, as the presence and severity of comorbidities strongly influence health-related quality of life. Adults with tic disorders exhibit high rates of coexisting psychiatric disorders, including OCD, depression, anxiety disorders, and, less often, ADHD.

We have developed an Adult Tic Registry based in Calgary, Canada, and Paris, France, to prospectively study tic disorders in adults. The aim of this study is to assess the phenomenology of tics in adults with primary tic disorders by describing the types and distribution of tics and their severity and investigating how these features are influenced by sex. We also present data on the prevalence of comorbid psychiatric conditions and psychotropic medication use and how these vary by sex.

### The presence of comorbidity in Tourette syndrome increases the need for pharmacological treatment [^1158gKuJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is often accompanied by other syndromes, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Its treatment is primarily symptomatic. In the absence of European guidelines for pharmacological treatment in Tourette syndrome, this study aims to provide better insight into common practices in Scandinavia. Additionally, it explores the influence of comorbidities and the severity of tics on pharmacological treatment.

The study examined the frequency, type, and reasons for pharmacological treatment in a Danish clinical cohort of 314 children with Tourette syndrome. A total of 60.5% of the children had received pharmacological treatment at some point. Treatment was primarily initiated due to tics or ADHD. When ADHD or obsessive-compulsive disorder were present, a higher number of children received pharmacological treatment, and a wider variety of medications were tried. Children who received pharmacological treatment exhibited more severe tics compared to those who did not receive medication.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Tourette's syndrome, specifically concerning deep brain stimulation, the AAN 2019 guidelines recommend confirming that multiple classes of medication — such as antipsychotics, dopamine depleters, and α-2 agonists — and behavioral therapy have been administered, or are contraindicated, before prescribing deep brain stimulation for tics.

Between 2019 and 2022, there was a marked rise in adolescents and young adults seeking urgent help for functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs). Given the global scale of this phenomenon, we aimed to pool cases from different institutions in an international registry to better characterize this spectrum and facilitate future longitudinal observation.

- **Methods**: An international collaborative group from 10 tertiary referral centres for tic disorders collected retrospective data on FTLB patients who sought specialists' attention between the last quarter of 2019 and June 2022. An audit procedure was utilized for data collection, which comprised demographics, course of presentation and duration, precipitating and predisposing factors, phenomenology, comorbidities, and pharmacological treatment outcomes.

- **Results**: During the study period, data on 294 patients with FTLBs were collected. Of these, 97% were adolescents and young adults, with 87% being female. FTLBs were found to have a peak of severity within one month in 70% of patients, with spontaneous remissions occurring in 20%. There was a very high frequency of complex movements (85%) and vocalizations (81%). Less than one-fifth of patients had a pre-existing primary tic disorder, 66% had comorbid anxiety disorders, 28% had comorbid depressive disorders, 24% had autism spectrum disorder, and 23% had attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Almost 60% explicitly reported exposure to tic-related social media content. The vast majority of pharmacologically treated patients did not report benefit from tic-suppressing medications.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the need for further research into the causes and effective treatments of FTLBs to better support the affected adolescents and young adults.

### Pediatric ADHD medication exposures reported to US poison control centers [^1134hE1D]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: To describe the characteristics and trends of exposures to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications among individuals aged 0 to 19 years reported to US poison control centers.

- **Methods**: National Poison Data System data from 2000 through 2014 were retrospectively analyzed to examine pediatric ADHD medication exposures.

- **Results**: From 2000 through 2014, there were 156,365 exposures reported to US poison control centers related to ADHD medications. The overall rate of reported exposures increased by 71.2% from 2000 to 2011, followed by a 6.2% decrease from 2011 to 2014. Three-fourths (76.0%) of exposures involved children ≤ 12 years old. Methylphenidate and amphetamine medications accounted for 46.2% and 44.5% of exposures, respectively. The most common reason for exposure was therapeutic error (41.6%). Intentional medication exposures — including suspected suicide and medication abuse and/or misuse — were reported most often among adolescents (13–19 years old), accounting for 50.2% of exposures in this age group. Overall, the majority of exposed individuals (60.4%) did not receive health care facility treatment; however, 6.2% were admitted to a hospital for medical treatment, and there were 3 deaths. The increasing number and rate of reported ADHD medication exposures during the study period is consistent with increasing trends in ADHD diagnosis and medication prescribing. Exposures associated with suspected suicide or medication abuse and/or misuse among adolescents are of particular concern.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part II [^114gHQkz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we previously published a paper reporting the most common questions we have been asked in recent editions of the course, alongside evidence-based and/or expert-informed answers. Based on our experience during the course, we have selected what we deem the most common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology. This paper focuses on autism and intellectual disability, eating disorders, neuropsychiatric correlates of epilepsy, and psychosis.

We have grouped the pitfalls by the disorder to which they refer, in alphabetical order. Pitfalls related to the treatment of other disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder) are addressed in a separate paper (Part I).

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^114ztx9P]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children, inattentive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children. The primary purpose of this tool is to identify children who exhibit a significant number of inattentive behaviors, which are disruptive and inappropriate for their developmental level, for at least six months.

- **Inattention-related behaviors**: The diagnostic criteria consist of nine inattention-related behaviors:
	- Failing to give close attention to details
	- Having trouble holding attention on tasks
	- Not listening when spoken to directly
	- Not following through on instructions
	- Having trouble organizing tasks
	- Avoiding tasks that require mental effort
	- Losing things necessary for tasks
	- Being easily distracted
	- Being forgetful in daily activities

Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score. The presence of symptoms for at least six months, to the extent that it is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level, is a crucial component of the diagnostic criteria and significantly contributes to the overall score.

- **Scoring system**: The diagnosis of ADHD, inattentive subtype, is confirmed if the total score is equal to or greater than 106. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, inattentive subtype, are not met. This scoring system allows clinicians to quantify the severity of inattentive behaviors and make a more objective assessment.

### Medication-taking experiences in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review [^111qKreG]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition for which pharmacotherapy is considered an effective treatment, guidelines on the treatment of ADHD have been challenging to implement. Considering the views of patients and caregivers involved in medication-taking could help shed light on these challenges.

- **Objective**: This review combines the findings of individual studies of medication-taking experiences in ADHD in order to guide clinicians to effectively share decisions about treatment.

- **Methods**: Five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and CINAHL) were systematically searched for relevant published research articles. Articles were assessed for quality using a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist, and synthesis was performed using meta-ethnography.

- **Results**: Thirty-one articles were included in the final synthesis, comprising studies of caregivers, pediatric patients, and adult patients across seven countries. Findings were categorized into five different constructs, including coming to terms with ADHD, anticipated concerns about medication, experiences of the effects of medication, external influences, and the development of self-management. The synthesis demonstrates that decisions surrounding medication-taking for ADHD evolve as the child patient enters adulthood and moves towards autonomy and self-management. In all parts of this journey, decisions are shaped by a series of 'trade-offs', where potential benefits and harms of medication are weighed up.

- **Conclusions**: This review offers comprehensive insight into medication-taking experiences in ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115Xj9pb]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, specifically concerning pharmacotherapy, the AAP 2019 guidelines suggest offering methylphenidate to pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not yield significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the patient's functioning. It is important to weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are unavailable.

### Pediatric psychopharmacology: Too much or too little [^114hYe4F]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

This paper provides a selective overview of the past, present, and future of pediatric psychopharmacology. The acceptance of medication use in child psychiatry was based on the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials documenting the efficacy of drug treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, enuresis, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychoses. This period of success was followed by a series of challenges, including a growing awareness of the long-term adverse effects of medications and the inadequacy of long-term drug surveillance. There is great concern today that children are being overtreated with medication, especially in the United States. Further advances in pediatric psychopharmacology may come from the examination of large medical data sets, including both pharmacological and psychiatric information, which could lead to drug repurposing, as well as from preclinical translational studies such as those using human induced pluripotent stem cells.

### FocalinXR [^1166URtx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette's syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Before initiating Focalin XR, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette's syndrome. Regularly monitor Focalin-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.

### Amphetamine-induced chorea in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder [^1136rTtb]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently treated with stimulants in both children and adults. While tics are occasional complications of stimulant therapy, chorea is reported rarely. We describe an adult ADHD patient who developed chorea upon dose escalation of mixed amphetamine salts, which resolved on discontinuation of the drug.

### Pediatric prevention: Tic disorders [^116KjSe9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether the development of tics can be prevented. Contextual variables can impact tic expression; therefore, shifting attention to behaviors that reduce tics is an important part of decreasing tic severity. Several medications are effective in reducing tic severity, but side effects restrict their use. Behavioral treatment is the gold standard psychotherapy intervention for tic disorders, with Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics being the most well-supported nonpharmacological treatment. Although children may be unable to prevent the development of tics, they can still use several strategies to reduce tic severity and impairment.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112vXh6A]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

For stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of extended-release formulations when initiating psychostimulant medications. It is advised to maintain a level of monitoring that aligns with the risk profile of the medication and patient. This monitoring may include pill counts, drug testing, increased clinical contact, and more frequent checks with prescription drug monitoring programs (Clinical consensus, strong recommendation).

### Emerging treatments for Tourette's disorder [^117WntXD]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Tourette's disorder is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. Many children with Tourette's disorder improve throughout adolescence; however, some adults with the disorder continue to experience severe symptoms and significant disability. This article examines the evidence base for treatments for Tourette's disorder, highlighting emerging therapies such as deep brain stimulation, habit reversal therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

### Tic disorders: From pathophysiology to treatment [^1121hA21]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are stereotypic behaviors, more frequent than once believed, and therefore likely to be encountered by primary care physicians. Tics usually begin in childhood and are the clinical hallmark of Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics. TS is a relatively common neurobehavioral disorder with a spectrum of manifestations that wax and wane during its natural course.

The pathophysiology of tics, at the molecular and cellular level, is still unknown, whereas structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and the dopaminergic neuronal system. Moreover, TS has a strong genetic background.

The management of TS is often complicated by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other behavioral disorders. The correct diagnosis is a fundamental step for proper management of these disorders, and a multimodal treatment is usually indicated. This approach includes educational and supportive interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments when tics are at their worst.

### Update on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and tic disorders: A review of the current literature [^1138vcH5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Tic disorders impact quality of life, particularly when co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The combined impact significantly affects psychosocial functioning and adds complexity to treatment approaches. A review of the literature supports evidence of a unique relationship between comorbid ADHD and tic disorders, emphasizing the intricate phenotype and impairment associated with these co-occurring conditions. The complexity of these symptoms requires careful diagnosis and appropriate treatment, determined by the level of impairment, and can include pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, or a combination of therapies.

To achieve the greatest benefits in improving quality of life and eliminating further comorbidity, an ideal treatment plan would include a comprehensive evaluation and a hierarchical treatment approach. This approach would involve education of the child, family, and teachers, careful medication management, and cognitive and behavioral training.

### Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication consumption in 64 countries and regions from 2015 to 2019: A longitudinal study [^116sHECT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

The timely recognition and appropriate treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are essential to enhance the long-term outcomes of individuals with ADHD. This study aimed to evaluate the multinational trends and patterns of ADHD medication consumption.

In this longitudinal trend study, we used pharmaceutical sales data of ADHD medication from the IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System between 2015 and 2019, covering 64 countries across the world. Consumption rates of ADHD medication were expressed as defined daily dose per 1000 child and adolescent inhabitants (aged 5–19) per day (DDD/TID). Linear mixed models were employed to estimate the multinational, regional, and income-level trend changes.

The results revealed that multinational ADHD medication consumption increased by +9.72% (95% confidence interval, +6.25%, +13.31%) per year, from 1.19 DDD/TID in 2015 to 1.43 DDD/TID in 2019 across the 64 countries, with marked differences between geographical locations. When stratified by countries' income levels, increases in ADHD medication consumption were observed in high-income countries, but not in middle-income countries. In 2019, the pooled consumption rates of ADHD medication were 6.39 DDD/TID (95% CI, 4.63, 8.84) in high-income countries, 0.37 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.23, 0.58) in upper-middle-income countries, and 0.02 DDD/TID (95% CI, 0.01, 0.05) in lower-middle-income countries.

ADHD prevalence estimates and rates of ADHD medication consumption in most middle-income countries are lower than in high-income countries.

### Botulinum toxin for the treatment of motor tics in children: A case series [^113ondrA]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, are characterized by brief, repetitive, and patterned movements or vocalizations. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) has emerged as a therapeutic option for motor tics, particularly when oral medications are insufficient or poorly tolerated. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of botulinum neurotoxin injections in 50 pediatric patients (aged 7–18 years) with motor tic disorders treated at a tertiary pediatric movement disorders clinic between May 2019 and January 2024. Botulinum neurotoxin injections were tailored to individual symptomatology. Overall, 64% of patients reported improvement in tic severity, 36% noted no change, and 6% worsened. Response did not differ significantly by tic complexity, phenomenology (clonic vs. dystonic), or presence of a premonitory urge. Comorbidities such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and intellectual disability were not predictive of outcomes. These findings support botulinum neurotoxin as a safe and potentially effective treatment for pediatric motor tics, including complex and malignant presentations.

### Getting to long-term effectiveness and safety of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications [^111hE6w8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication use has dramatically increased in youth worldwide. Recent prevalence data in some European countries show expanded use, with one country now matching US usage. However, substantial geographic differences by country remain regarding the extent to which children receive ADHD medications. These geographic differences raise research questions about which country's prevalence data represents appropriate medication use. We urgently need country-level studies to contribute to our understanding of an appropriate prevalence of ADHD medication use.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, hand-searched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' generalisability: exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity, response…

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes: adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial.

### Common practical questions and answers at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111W8QUn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

When clonidine is used in higher doses, is it best to go beyond the treatment window or consider a switch to guanfacine? If switching, should one reduce and withdraw clonidine before initiating guanfacine, or can a cross-taper be implemented?

Recommended clonidine therapeutic doses are approximately 3–5 mcg/kg/day. It is uncommon to use doses beyond 300 mcg daily due to the sedating and hypotensive effects of clonidine. However, some young people may tolerate the cardiac effects of clonidine well and find that the sedation also benefits sleep and comorbidities. Therefore, in these cases, higher doses may be beneficial, with regular monitoring of blood pressure and pulse. Clonidine can be divided into two or three doses, and children who are sensitive to guanfacine side effects often find that a BD or TDS regime of clonidine suits them better than the once-daily dosing of guanfacine.

Clonidine is ten times more potent than guanfacine at alpha-2 presynaptic receptors, while guanfacine appears to be more potent at postsynaptic receptors. This difference translates into increased prefrontal activity, impulse control regulation, and improved behavior regulation. Therefore, in cases where behavioral modification is desired due to comorbidities, guanfacine seems to have a better effect.

Guanfacine weight dosing guidelines suggest 0.05–0.08 mg/kg/day, with a rough equivalence of guanfacine 1 mg to clonidine 100 mcg. If it is clinically acceptable from a tic perspective, reducing and withdrawing clonidine first before initiating guanfacine can be considered.

### Distinguishing and managing acute-onset complex tic-like behaviors in adolescence [^1133XkVM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Consistent with international reports, this group of Tourette syndrome (TS) experts has noticed a recent increase in adolescents presenting with tic-like symptoms that show a markedly atypical onset and course. These sudden-onset motor movements and vocalizations are often associated with significant impairment and disability, resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for some affected youths.

### Tics and functional tic-like movements: Can we tell them apart [^1164pnVv]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Within the broad spectrum of movement disorders, tics and functional tic-like movements belong to a particular clinical category. Both types of movements are within the range of normal movement kinematics and muscle synergies but appear repetitive and without appropriate context embedment. Historically, many attempts have been made to separate the two types of movements. However, because of their phenomenological overlap, clinical distinction may be prone to error, and misdiagnoses may often occur. Most importantly, the two types of movement may coexist.

We review the available literature on these motor phenomena and demonstrate some of the difficulties in distinguishing tics from functional tic-like movements on clinical grounds. We also highlight similarities and differences in pathophysiologic characteristics, documenting the significance of action monitoring, attentional allocation, and behavioral reinforcement in both types of movements, as well as in their risk factors.

- **Behavioral treatments**: We discuss the overlap of treatments for tics and functional tic-like movements and emphasize implications of diagnostic mislabeling. These implications include the necessity to tailor behavioral treatment approaches to individual phenomenological profiles and guide decision-making for severe patients requiring invasive interventions, such as deep brain stimulation.

A deeper insight from clinicians into the persisting challenges in classifying and differentiating these motor phenomena could accelerate the development of reliable clinical and physiological markers.

### Deep brain stimulation alleviates tics in Tourette syndrome via striatal dopamine transmission [^113auGdq]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the chronic presence of both motor and vocal tics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 350,000–450,000 people are affected by this syndrome in the United States alone. While primarily a disease of childhood that improves with age, a subset (approximately 5%) of patients are refractory to conventional therapy and continue to suffer severe disability into adulthood. This can lead to a multi-faceted decrease in quality of life, and in children, can interfere with scholastic performance and social development.

Addressing Tourette syndrome requires an improved understanding of its underlying pathoneurophysiology. It has been hypothesized that striatal dysregulation mediates tic behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, post-mortem studies of the brains of patients with Tourette syndrome have revealed a reduction of striatal GABAergic and cholinergic interneurons. These neurons are important for regulating afferent dopamine neurons responsible for high dopaminergic tone in the striatum and for gating efferent medium spiny neuronal activity that regulate movement in the direct and indirect pathways of the basal ganglia. Based on neuroimaging studies in patients, it has been postulated that high dopaminergic tone mediates tic generation. Here, we have instead hypothesized that decreased striatal dopamine transmission may account for the susceptibility to anomalous tic behavior, and increased transmission is therapeutic.

### Advancing the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology [^113EPur4]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Medications are an important component of the multimodal management strategy for many mental health conditions in children and adolescents. Clinical psychopharmacology for children and adolescents is generally considered to have begun in 1937, when Charles Bradley reported the serendipitous discovery of the beneficial effects of benzedrine, a stimulant, on symptoms that would now be considered under the diagnostic category of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Since then, clinical child and adolescent psychopharmacology has evolved from an art into an evidence-based discipline, driven by the conduct and publication of numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. This body of research has significantly contributed to our understanding of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety/tolerability of medications used to treat mental health conditions in children and young people. However, uncertainties and unmet needs remain in the field.

Seven studies published in the BMJ Mental Health topic collection "Advances in Clinical Psychopharmacology in Children and Young People" help strengthen the evidence base for child and adolescent psychopharmacology. Collectively, these articles provide evidence that informs key steps in the psychopharmacological management of children and adolescents with mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions.

- **Psychopharmacological decision-making**: First, a study by Lyhmann et al. explored a key question that arises after the diagnostic process: Should the patient be treated with a medication? The study had a specific focus on ADHD comorbidity. The authors applied a comprehensive approach to tackle this question.

### Association of cortical disinhibition with tic, ADHD, and OCD severity in Tourette syndrome [^113Zj8Ks]. Movement Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperkinetic disorders may involve excess excitatory output from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. Case-control, neurophysiological studies in individuals with Tourette Syndrome (TS), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) support this model. To compare the strength of association between motor cortex inhibition and tic, ADHD, and OCD severity in TS, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure motor cortex inhibition in 36 children and adults with TS. Symptom severity was assessed with standard clinical rating scales and compared with neurophysiological measures using correlational and multivariate regression analyses.

Severity of ADHD symptoms and motor tics were significantly and independently associated with short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) (r² = 0.50; F[2,27] = 13.7; P < 0.001), particularly in subjects not taking neuroleptics (r² = 0.68; F[2,17] = 17.8; P < 0.0001). The correlation of cortical disinhibition was greater with ADHD symptoms severity (r = 0.53; P = 0.003) than with tic severity (r = 0.42; P = 0.02), suggesting that in TS, the association between SICI and ADHD symptoms may be more consistent or direct than the association between SICI and tics.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115M3WeJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology has been conducted for over 20 years and remains a highly attended event, drawing approximately 140 delegates annually from the United Kingdom and internationally. As faculty members of the recent sessions, we have identified the most frequently asked questions during the course and provided evidence-based and/or expert-informed responses.

The compilation includes 27 questions and answers concerning a range of topics such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depressive disorders, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, epilepsy (in differential diagnosis or comorbid with mental health conditions), obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, and tics/Tourette syndrome in children and young people.

This article aims to support prescribers in their daily clinical practice. We anticipate that future high-level evidence will further enrich the responses to these and other questions in child and adolescent psychopharmacology.

### Managing the risks of ADHD treatments [^114sALti]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacotherapy of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a well-established and effective treatment modality. However, ADHD medications are not without side effects. Understanding the prevalence of adverse events and effective management of risks associated with stimulants and other medications used to treat ADHD is central to broad applicability and effective treatment. This review discusses the literature on the prevalence of adverse events and management strategies employed. We searched online MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles using several keywords relating to adverse events associated with ADHD medication management. We discuss the relevant data on the significance and prevalence of side effects and adverse events, highlight recent updates in the field, and suggest approaches to clinical management.

### Impact of tic disorders on ADHD outcome across the life cycle: Findings from a large group of adults with and without ADHD [^113wb1wX]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The impact of tic disorders on the outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains a subject of high scientific and clinical interest. To evaluate the impact of comorbid ADHD and tic disorders from a lifespan perspective, the authors systematically examined data from adults with and without ADHD.

The authors comprehensively evaluated 312 consecutively referred adults with ADHD and 252 comparison subjects without ADHD. Tic disorders were characterized along with a wide range of neuropsychiatric correlates, including other comorbid disorders as well as indexes of function in the domains of school, cognition, and interpersonal functioning.

A significantly greater proportion of adults with ADHD (12%) than those without ADHD (4%) had tic disorders. Tic disorders followed a mostly remitting course and had little impact on functional capacities. In addition, tic disorders were not associated with stimulant use.

These findings in adults with ADHD confirm and extend previous findings in young subjects with ADHD, documenting that although individuals with ADHD are at greater risk for tic disorders, the presence of tic disorders has a limited impact on ADHD outcome.

### Is persistent motor or vocal tic disorder a milder form of Tourette syndrome [^1176vBJv]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, all data are retrospective and thus may be subject to recall bias. Second, the study samples differed in mean age, presence of comorbid OCD, and ascertainment. Furthermore, the rates of psychotic disorders were very low in individual samples, and disruptive behavior disorders were assessed primarily in children, all of which could potentially confound the results. We addressed these potential confounds to the best of our ability by controlling for these factors in our analyses, and we see evidence that mean age at ascertainment and comorbid ADHD and/or OCD contribute to some, but not all, of the observed differences between studies. We do not have data on the severity or impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders or on treatment outcomes. Additional prospectively designed studies that eliminate these potential sources of bias would be useful to replicate and extend this work.

### Overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in young children [^114M3dJx]. Health Psychology Research (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder:

- **Definition**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by pervasive and impairing symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity according to the DSM-V.

- **Pathophysiology**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is caused by biological factors (genetics, brain structure, and their influence on neuropsychology) and environmental factors (pregnancy or birth complications, exposure to environmental toxins, chaotic parenting, and diet).

- **Disease course**: The interplay of environmental and genetic factors, along with dysfunction in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, results in attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. This disorder is associated with clinical manifestations of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, leading to poor motor coordination, impaired academic functioning, unintentional physical injury, sleep disturbances, and poor quality of life.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is not associated with an increased risk of natural-cause mortality.

### The ASAM/AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^115JpF7E]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, particularly in patients with ADHD, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend arranging for a parent, health professional, such as a trained school nurse, or other trusted adult to directly observe the administration of the medication. This is especially important if using a short-acting formulation in adolescent and young adult patients with stimulant use disorder and ADHD. Counseling families on the importance of safely storing and restricting access to controlled medications is also advised.

### Common practical questions - and answers - at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^116qw8bT]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

In cases of moderate-to-severe ADHD with tics, ADHD symptoms are likely to require treatment with psychostimulants, which are the first-line treatment choice for ADHD. Therefore, in situations where tics are also present, augmenting methylphenidate with guanfacine to address the symptoms of both conditions seems preferable. Using guanfacine in this respect may also benefit ADHD symptoms, as shown by research. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate, and combined treatment showed no differences in safety or tolerability.

Appreciating that when prescribing for children and young people it is best to use as few medications as possible at the lowest dose to achieve the desired clinical goals, when there is clear impairment from both disorders, it may be beneficial to combine treatments. Therefore, especially when ADHD symptoms are more severe and impairing, a combination of methylphenidate and guanfacine is worth considering.

The addition of guanfacine can potentially benefit sleep difficulties and night-time settling, reducing the need for alternatives such as melatonin, which may be beneficial to consider.

- **Considering antipsychotics over clonidine/guanfacine**: In a recent prescribing survey among 59 expert clinicians who were members of the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome, the most commonly used medications for tics in children and adolescents, in descending order, were aripiprazole, clonidine, tiapride (not available in the United Kingdom).

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^1166pWuR]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). High credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this specific subtype of ADHD. The target patient population includes children who exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

- **Specific behaviors**: The primary components of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors include fidgeting or squirming, leaving the seat when expected to remain seated, running or climbing inappropriately, inability to engage in quiet leisure activities, excessive talking, blurting out answers prematurely, difficulty waiting turns, and interrupting or intruding on others. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score, which is used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

- **Course of the disease**: In addition to these behaviors, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria also consider the course of the disease. The presence of these symptoms for at least six months, to a degree that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly contributes to the overall score.

These criteria are used to determine whether a child meets the diagnostic criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD.

### First-onset tics in patients with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder: impact of stimulants [^113FF2MV]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

First-onset tics during stimulant treatment of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are clinically relevant and remain a matter of scientific debate. Because there are limited clinical trials analyzing the risk of first-onset tics in stimulant-treated ADHD, a comprehensive evaluation is required for evidence-based clinical recommendations. An analysis of studies with high methodological quality, such as double-blind placebo-controlled trials, on first-onset tics during stimulant treatment of ADHD revealed that there seems to be no elevated risk of first-onset tics in children undergoing this treatment.

Although a close temporal relationship might be seen in a few patients, the role of treatment duration, dose of stimulant, genetic vulnerability, and developmental aspects need to be further explored to clarify possible pathophysiological mechanisms of tic emergence under stimulant treatment. The results of high-quality studies, in addition to specialized studies with methodological limitations, suggest that stimulants are the criterion standard for the safe and successful treatment of ADHD.

### Prevalence of tics among 6- to 12-year-old schoolchildren in the Itagui Municipality, Colombia, in 2010 [^1111N84W]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Tics are the most frequent movement disorder in children and are most prevalent during the school-age years. Most tics are transitory; however, certain tics can be chronic, causing negative repercussions at school, within the family, and socially. In some cases, tics are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and other conditions that require diagnosis and prompt treatment.

In South America, there are no indexed studies determining the prevalence of tics in school-age children. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of tics in schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years. From 16,000 students aged 6 to 12 years who were enrolled in first to fifth grade, a sample of 346 school-aged children was chosen via a multistage sampling process. This process randomized the educational systems in terms of proportional size and the stratification between public and private schools and was adjusted for the design effect.

The students were screened, and those who were positive for tics underwent clinical evaluations and semistructured interviews by the researchers to determine the prevalence of the disease. The parents and teachers of 323 students returned our surveys (93.3%). One hundred thirty-eight students (42.7%) were considered positive for tics based on parents' and teachers' reports. The clinical evaluation established a 17.97% prevalence of tics (58 students), and 25 students (43.2%) also met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Of the students with tics, 27.6% presented with transitory tics, and 72.4% presented with chronic tics.

### Type of medication therapy for ADHD and stimulant misuse during adolescence: a cross-sectional multi-cohort national study [^116oYFcT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Together, this evidence suggests the possibility of elevated cocaine or methamphetamine use among adolescents engaged in PSM, with only limited evidence of longer-term risks for illicit stimulant use among those receiving stimulant pharmacotherapy for ADHD. As noted above, ADHD symptomatology may serve as the risk factor rather than prescription stimulant administration. Indeed, Quinn et al. found that the likelihood of having a SUD diagnosis-related event requiring emergency department treatment was lower in adolescents and adults currently prescribed stimulant or atomoxetine (a non-stimulant) medication for ADHD versus time periods when the same individuals were not receiving ADHD pharmacotherapy, using healthcare claims data.

Potential relationships between non-stimulant pharmacotherapy and PSM, cocaine, and/or methamphetamine use have largely been unexamined. Quinn et al. aggregated prescription stimulant and atomoxetine treatment, so non-stimulant-specific associations could not be examined. Preclinical evidence suggests that atomoxetine administration in adolescent rats may lead to later decreased impulsive responding. Since impulsivity is a risk factor for other substance use, reduced impulsivity may lessen the likelihood of PSM and illicit stimulant use among those with ADHD.

Furthermore, relationships between a history of both stimulant and non-stimulant pharmacotherapy and PSM or illicit stimulant use are unexamined. A history of treatment with both medication classes may signal comorbid psychopathology, poor treatment response, and/or more severe ADHD, all of which could influence outcomes.

### Moderators and predictors of response to behavior therapy for tics in Tourette syndrome [^114q2Pxa]. Neurology (2017). High credibility.

To examine moderators and predictors of response to behavior therapy for tics in children and adults with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders, data from two 10-week, multisite studies (one in children and one in adults; total n = 248) comparing comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) to psychoeducation and supportive therapy (PST) were combined for moderator analyses. Participants (177 male, 71 female) had a mean age of 21.5 ± 13.9 years (range 9–69).

Demographic and clinical characteristics, baseline tic-suppressing medication, and co-occurring psychiatric disorders were tested as potential moderators for CBIT vs. PST or predictors of outcome regardless of treatment assignment. The main outcome measures were the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic score and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score assessed by masked evaluators.

The presence of tic medication significantly moderated response to CBIT vs. PST (p = 0.01). Participants showed tic reduction after CBIT regardless of tic medication status, but only participants receiving tic medication showed reduction of tics after PST. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders, age, sex, family functioning, tic characteristics, and treatment expectancy did not moderate response. Across both treatments, greater tic severity (p = 0.005) and positive participant expectancy (p = 0.01) predicted greater tic improvement. Anxiety disorders (p = 0.042) and premonitory urge severity (p = 0.005) predicted lower tic reduction.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: Challenges and opportunities [^1125Yco4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Safe and effective medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is available and recommended as a first-line treatment for the core symptoms of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness. Despite impaired functioning during adolescence, many discontinue medication treatment. For children, healthcare decisions are usually made by the parent, whereas older youth make their own decisions. Beliefs and attitudes may vary widely; some families understand that ADHD is a neurobiological condition and accept that medication is indicated. For others, such treatment is unacceptable.

Converging evidence describes negative perceptions of the burden associated with medication use, as well as concerns about potential short- and long-term adverse effects. Indeed, experiences of adverse effects are a frequent explanation for discontinuation among youth. Ways to improve shared decision-making among practitioners, parents, and youth, as well as to monitor effectiveness, safety, and new onset of complications, are likely to optimize outcomes.

### Treatment use among children with Tourette syndrome living in the United States, 2014 [^1116FiG7]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS) can be complicated by changes over time in tic expression, severity, and co-occurring disorders. Using the 2014 National Survey of the Diagnosis and Treatment of ADHD and Tourette Syndrome, this study provides descriptive estimates of the use of behavioral interventions and medication among children living with TS.

Parent-reported data on 115 children aged 5–17 years who were ever diagnosed with TS were analyzed to provide descriptive, unweighted results. Overall, 77.4% of children had either current or past use of any TS treatment; 59.1% had ever used behavioral interventions, and 56.1% had ever taken TS medication. Children with "moderate" or "severe" TS, as opposed to "mild" TS, those with one or more co-occurring disorders, and those with tics that interfered with functioning were significantly more likely to have used one or more TS treatments.

Side effects were reported for 84.4% of children who took TS medication. Most parents of children with TS (87.2%) were satisfied with the management of their child's TS. However, parents of children with "moderate" or "severe" TS were significantly more dissatisfied compared to parents of children with "mild" TS. Findings from this study could be used to inform efforts to support children living with TS and their families.

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term [^1157U9bf]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent mental health services, in the United States as well as in many other countries. Medication, including stimulant and nonstimulant options, is an important element of the multimodal approach to ADHD management. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment. A recent study including data from more than 150 million individuals in 13 countries showed an increase in the prevalence of ADHD medication use over the past 15 years in all countries, albeit with large variations across countries. One of the aspects that remain controversial in relation to stimulants pertains to their long-term effectiveness.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^11651sSZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

As faculty of the British Association for Psychopharmacology course on child and adolescent psychopharmacology, we present here what we deem are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them in child and adolescent psychopharmacology. In this paper, we specifically addressed common pitfalls in the pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and related disorders, and tic disorder. Pitfalls in the treatment of other disorders are addressed in a separate paper (part II).

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (For) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as ADHD medications — methylphenidate, amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine — it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. As a consequence, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies, which provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy but do not address long-term effectiveness.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will typically be required for several years. They therefore introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy through randomized withdrawal designs, which demonstrate continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several of these studies have been completed and published, all demonstrating continued efficacy as expected. The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness and that adverse effects and safety be assessed for up to 2 years. The studies completed so far support continued effectiveness and, although highlighting the presence of common, expected adverse effects, have not identified any new, unforeseen issues.

### α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants for preschool-age children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [^112sHprY]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed in approximately 2.4% of preschool-age children. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line medication treatment. However, up to 25% of preschool-age children with ADHD are treated with α2-adrenergic agonist medications, despite minimal evidence about their efficacy or adverse effects in this age range.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects associated with α2-adrenergic agonists and stimulant medication for initial ADHD medication treatment in preschool-age children.

Design, setting, and participants: This was a retrospective electronic health record review. Data were obtained from health records of children seen at seven outpatient developmental-behavioral pediatric practices in the Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics Research Network in the US. Data were abstracted for 497 consecutive children who were younger than 72 months old when treatment with an α2-adrenergic agonist or stimulant medication was initiated by a developmental-behavioral pediatrician for ADHD, and these children were treated between January 1, 2013, and July 1, 2017. Follow-up was completed on February 27, 2019.

Exposures were α2-adrenergic agonist vs. stimulant medication as initial ADHD medication treatment.

Main outcomes and measures included reported improvement in ADHD symptoms and adverse effects.

Results: Data were abstracted from electronic health records of 497 preschool-age children with ADHD receiving α2-adrenergic agonists or stimulants. The median child age was 62 months at ADHD medication initiation.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114G2y2v]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 1.4–3.0%. It is more common in boys than girls. Comorbidity with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorders is substantial. ADHD is highly heritable and multifactorial; multiple genes and non-inherited factors contribute to the disorder. Prenatal and perinatal factors have been implicated as risks, but definite causes remain unknown. Most guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment, beginning with non-drug interventions and then moving to pharmacological treatment in those most severely affected. Randomised controlled trials show short-term benefits of stimulant medication and atomoxetine. Meta-analyses of blinded trials of non-drug treatments have not yet proven the efficacy of such interventions. Longitudinal studies of ADHD show a heightened risk of multiple mental health and social difficulties, as well as premature mortality in adult life.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^1121hADU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

When initiating medication, adverse effects often occur before therapeutic benefits are observed, leading to potential premature discontinuation. This can be avoided by employing the strategy of "starting low and going slow". For example, the initial syncope caused by postural hypotension can be related to the initiation of clonidine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, and guanfacine, which stimulates postsynaptic alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors. Sedation is a potential adverse effect related to all medications for tics. These adverse effects are often encountered if the initial dose is too high. However, with careful low-dose initiation and slow titration, these adverse effects are much less likely to occur.

- **Dosing**: Doses of 25 mcg of clonidine, 1 mg of guanfacine, and 0.5–1 mg of aripiprazole once daily are suggested as appropriate initial doses, with titrations using a weekly, fortnightly, or even monthly approach according to the response. However, the initial dose and the titration speed could differ according to body weight, age, and other characteristics of the patient.

- **Failing to achieve an adequate therapeutic dose**: When a medication has been initiated, it is important to titrate to recommended therapeutic doses. For clonidine, this corresponds to an average daily dose of 3–5 mcg/kg; for aripiprazole, around 5–10 mg daily; and for guanfacine, between 1 and 4 mg in young children and up to 7 mg in older adolescents, according to weight. Often, young people are sub-optimally medicated to reduce potential side effects.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: Part I [^116PXjXN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Misidentifying new-onset tics as an adverse effect of stimulant medication for ADHD is a common issue. Tic disorders occur in around 20% of young people with ADHD. However, the onset of tics, typically around 7–8 years of age, is later than the emergence of ADHD symptoms. Therefore, a common pitfall when observing new-onset tics in children receiving stimulants for ADHD is to erroneously assume that the tics are a stimulant adverse effect, leading to medication being stopped, swapped, or reduced, when in fact it is an emerging comorbid tic disorder. If tics emerge very soon after starting stimulant medication, a dose reduction is warranted to observe if tics reduce. However, if tics emerge following a stable period of ADHD treatment, and tics also require treatment, then augmentation with clonidine or guanfacine should be considered.

- **Augmenting medication with behavioral therapy**: It is a common pitfall to assume that medication should only be tried after using psychological approaches such as behavioral therapy. Whilst acknowledging that in reality these resources are scarce, when available, it is not always beneficial to consider medication only after first attempting psychological therapies. Often, barriers to successfully implementing these therapies can relate to the age or intellectual ability of the young person, comorbidities such as ADHD and autism, family and environmental factors, and severity or impairment of the tics. For more severe tics, medication may reduce tic intensity and frequency, making behavioral techniques easier to implement. Notably, there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.
