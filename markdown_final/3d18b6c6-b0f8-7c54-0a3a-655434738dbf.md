## Question

A 56-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. She has a history of recent knee surgery. On examination, her blood pressure is 128/78 mmHg, heart rate is 104 bpm, respiratory rate is 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. She is alert and oriented. There are no signs of shock or hypotension. The emergency physician suspects pulmonary embolism (PE).

According to current guidelines, how should this patient's risk be stratified, and what should guide the next steps in her diagnostic workup?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to risk-stratify and work up suspected pulmonary embolism in a 56-year-old woman with recent knee surgery, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea, who is hemodynamically stable. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stability and whether this is high-risk PE. Then, I should verify pretest probability using a validated tool. Next, I will consider PERC in low-probability patients and D-dimer strategy in non–high-probability patients. After that, I need to choose imaging based on pretest probability and contraindications. Finally, once PE is confirmed, I should risk-stratify for prognosis and disposition using sPESI/PESI, biomarkers, and RV imaging, and decide on anticoagulation and monitoring needs [^c18e402d] [^c908c51d].

> Let me first confirm hemodynamic status because that dictates everything. She is normotensive with a systolic BP of 128 mmHg, heart rate 104, RR 22, and SpO2 94% on room air, with no shock or hypotension, so this is not high-risk PE and I should not jump to thrombolysis or ECMO; instead, I will proceed with a standard diagnostic algorithm for suspected non–high-risk PE [^c18e402d] [^0bf11370].

> Wait, let me verify pretest probability before ordering any tests. I should use a validated clinical prediction rule such as Wells or revised Geneva; given recent surgery and pleuritic chest pain, her Wells score is likely intermediate, but I should calculate it explicitly to avoid misclassification and to guide whether D-dimer or direct imaging is appropriate [^c908c51d] [^5f943aa8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about D-dimer in everyone. If her pretest probability is low and she meets all PERC criteria, I can safely exclude PE without further testing; however, with recent surgery and a heart rate over 100, she does not meet all PERC negatives, so I should not apply PERC to exclude PE here and should instead use D-dimer if her pretest probability is low or intermediate [^fd3993ca] [^3a8287f7].

> I need to check the D-dimer strategy next. For low or intermediate pretest probability, a high-sensitivity D-dimer is appropriate; in patients over 50, I should use age-adjusted thresholds (age × 10 μg/L) to improve specificity while maintaining sensitivity, and a negative result rules out PE without imaging; if D-dimer is positive, I should proceed to imaging [^e8c06816] [^8b20e475] [^95d3ff58].

> Let me consider imaging choices carefully. If pretest probability is high, I should go straight to CTPA without D-dimer because a negative D-dimer would not obviate the need for imaging; if pretest probability is low or intermediate and D-dimer is positive, CTPA is preferred; if CTPA is contraindicated, a V/Q scan is reasonable, acknowledging higher indeterminate rates; if the patient is too unstable for transport, bedside echocardiography can support the diagnosis by showing RV strain, but it is not diagnostic for PE itself [^c908c51d] [^832f9761] [^30c37570] [^d4c4403a].

> But wait, what if leg symptoms are present? I should double-check for DVT because a proximal DVT on compression ultrasonography confirms VTE and can obviate the need for chest imaging; in this case, there is no mention of leg symptoms, so I will proceed with chest imaging if indicated by pretest probability and D-dimer results [^723d405e] [^b3a317c5].

> Next, I should review what to do once PE is confirmed. I will now examine prognostic risk stratification using sPESI or PESI, cardiac biomarkers (troponin, BNP), and assessment of RV dysfunction by echocardiography or CTPA; patients without RV dysfunction and with negative biomarkers are low risk and may be candidates for outpatient therapy, whereas those with RV dysfunction or elevated biomarkers are intermediate risk and generally require hospitalization and close monitoring for deterioration [^0bf11370] [^dcd83800] [^e1d8e08c].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition thresholds. Even if sPESI is low, the presence of RV dysfunction or elevated troponin shifts risk upward and supports admission; conversely, in truly low-risk patients with good support and reliable follow-up, early discharge with DOAC therapy can be safe, but I need to ensure there are no exclusion criteria such as hypoxemia, bleeding risk, or social barriers before choosing outpatient care [^dcd83800] [^f8fbaa16].

> I need to ensure anticoagulation is addressed promptly. In patients with intermediate or high clinical probability of PE, guidelines support initiating anticoagulation while the diagnostic workup is in progress, provided there is no excessive bleeding risk; once PE is confirmed, direct oral anticoagulants are preferred for most patients, with LMWH reserved for special populations such as cancer or severe renal impairment [^4a413e5c] [^55d5040f].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to avoid gaps. First, confirm stability and exclude high-risk PE; second, calculate pretest probability with Wells or Geneva; third, if low probability, apply PERC and if all negative, stop; if not all PERC negative or if intermediate probability, obtain high-sensitivity D-dimer with age-adjustment if over 50; fourth, if D-dimer is positive or pretest probability is high, obtain CTPA or V/Q if CTPA is contraindicated; fifth, if PE is confirmed, risk-stratify with sPESI/PESI, troponin/BNP, and RV imaging to decide on disposition and monitoring intensity [^c18e402d] [^c908c51d] [^0bf11370].

---

This patient is **hemodynamically stable** [^c18e402d] with suspected PE, so she is not high risk. Risk stratification should follow the **ESC 2019 framework** [^0bf11370]: assess for hemodynamic instability first, then use clinical scores (sPESI/PESI) [^9a8df5c1], biomarkers (troponin, BNP/NT-proBNP) [^e1d8e08c], and imaging (echocardiography or CTPA) [^d4c4403a] to distinguish low- from intermediate-risk PE. Given her recent surgery and symptoms, pretest probability is intermediate; obtain a **high-sensitivity D-dimer** [^e8c06816] with age-adjusted cutoff (age × 10 μg/L) [^8b20e475] to reduce unnecessary imaging. If D-dimer is positive or clinical probability is high, proceed to CTPA [^832f9761]; if PE is confirmed, assess RV function and biomarkers to guide disposition and monitoring [^dcd83800]. Start anticoagulation while diagnostic workup is in progress if clinical probability is intermediate or high [^4a413e5c].

---

## Risk stratification framework

The **ESC 2019 guidelines** [^c18e402d] recommend a stepwise approach: first, identify high-risk PE by hemodynamic instability (shock, hypotension, or cardiac arrest) [^0bf11370]; then, for stable patients, use clinical scores, biomarkers, and imaging to classify low- versus intermediate-risk PE [^dcd83800].

| **Risk category** | **Definition** | **Clinical features** | **Management implications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| High-risk | Hemodynamic instability | - Shock <br/> - Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg or drop > 40 mmHg) <br/> - Cardiac arrest | Immediate reperfusion (thrombolysis or embolectomy) [^bfdb205e] |
| Intermediate-risk | Hemodynamically stable with RV dysfunction or biomarker elevation | - RV dysfunction on echo/CTPA <br/> - Elevated troponin or BNP/NT-proBNP | Hospitalization and close monitoring [^dcd83800] |
| Low-risk | Hemodynamically stable without RV dysfunction or biomarker elevation | - Normal RV function <br/> - Normal biomarkers | Outpatient management or early discharge [^f8fbaa16] |

---

This patient is **hemodynamically stable**, so she is not high risk; next, assess for intermediate risk using clinical scores, biomarkers, and imaging [^0bf11370].

---

## Clinical probability assessment

Use a **validated clinical prediction rule** (Wells or revised Geneva) [^6cc7f548] to estimate pretest probability [^bb2a0bb8]. Given recent surgery, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia, her Wells score is likely intermediate (e.g. 2–6 points) [^5f943aa8], though I should confirm the exact score at the bedside.

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Step 1: D-dimer testing

- **Indication**: For low or intermediate pretest probability [^e8c06816].
- **Test**: High-sensitivity D-dimer with age-adjusted cutoff (age × 10 μg/L) in patients > 50 years [^8b20e475].
- **Interpretation**: Negative result rules out PE; positive result warrants imaging [^de0be47b].

---

### Step 2: Imaging

If D-dimer is positive or clinical probability is high, proceed to **CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** [^832f9761], the gold standard for PE diagnosis [^a09ac913]. Reserve V/Q scan for contraindications to CTPA (contrast allergy, pregnancy, severe renal impairment) [^30c37570].

---

### Step 3: Risk stratification after confirmation

If PE is confirmed, **assess RV function and biomarkers** to distinguish low- from intermediate-risk PE:

- **RV dysfunction**: Echocardiography or CTPA [^d4c4403a].
- **Biomarkers**: Troponin and BNP/NT-proBNP [^e1d8e08c].
- **Clinical scores**: sPESI or PESI for 30-day mortality risk [^9a8df5c1].

---

## Application to this patient

- **Hemodynamic status**: Stable (not high risk) [^c18e402d].
- **Clinical probability**: Intermediate (recent surgery, pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia) [^5f943aa8].
- **Next step**: High-sensitivity D-dimer with age-adjusted cutoff [^e8c06816] [^8b20e475].
- **If D-dimer is positive**: Proceed to CTPA [^832f9761].
- **If PE is confirmed**: Assess RV function and biomarkers to classify as low or intermediate risk and guide disposition [^dcd83800].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Risk stratification**: Use ESC 2019 framework (hemodynamic stability → clinical scores → biomarkers → RV imaging) [^0bf11370].
- **Initial test**: High-sensitivity D-dimer with age-adjusted cutoff for low/intermediate probability [^e8c06816] [^8b20e475].
- **Imaging**: CTPA if D-dimer is positive or clinical probability is high [^832f9761].
- **Anticoagulation**: Start while diagnostic workup is in progress if clinical probability is intermediate or high [^4a413e5c].
- **Disposition**: Base on RV function and biomarkers; intermediate-risk patients require hospitalization and monitoring [^dcd83800].

---

This patient is **hemodynamically stable** with intermediate pretest probability; use D-dimer with age-adjusted cutoff to safely reduce imaging, and if PE is confirmed, assess RV function and biomarkers to guide risk stratification and management [^c18e402d].

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^665607fd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Effective risk stratification in pulmonary embolism: evaluating current tools and identifying research gaps [^b812fbf4]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, most international guidelines advocate for risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) as a framework to guide treatment decisions. Key prognostic factors for patients with PE include clinical presentation, comorbidities, (imaging) biomarkers and haemodynamic status. The most widely used risk stratification algorithm, outlined in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines, classifies patients with PE into high-risk (massive), (high or low) intermediate-risk (submassive) and low-risk (nonmassive) categories. It is well established that the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality, increases with each escalating risk level. However, substantial variation remains among leading international guidelines regarding risk stratification and corresponding treatment recommendations. This inconsistency stems from a lack of grade/level 1A evidence (i.e. strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence) to guide treatment decisions for certain PE risk profiles. In the coming years, ongoing randomised trials comparing novel reperfusion strategies with the current standard of care may reshape risk stratification. If successful, the selection criteria for these studies could lay the foundation for improved risk categories. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing risk stratification algorithms and their associated treatment recommendations, identify knowledge gaps and outline future research priorities.

### Pulmonary embolism workup in five steps [^05c966e9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A workup for pulmonary embolism (PE) is complex, with multiple clinical decision rules to remember. A proper diagnostic workup can safely rule out PE without the use of computed tomography, which is both expensive and exposes patients to radiation and intravenous contrast. However, once PE has been diagnosed, it is important to risk stratify patients according to severity to both treat and disposition them correctly. PQRsTU is a simple, easy-to-remember mnemonic for the workup of PE that considers five phases: PERC phase (PE rule-out criteria), Quantify gestalt phase (to determine proper use of D-dimer or direct to imaging), Risk stratification phase (once PE has been diagnosed), Treatment phase, and Unit or floor (patient disposition). This structured method for evaluating PE will help clinicians develop a systematic, evidence-based approach to this complex and potentially lethal disease.

### Pulmonary embolism severity assessment and prognostication [^8d58e4c5]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

For patients who have acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE), risk of short-term death and adverse outcomes should drive the initial treatment decisions. Practice guidelines recommend that patients who have a high-risk of PE-related death and adverse outcomes, determined by the presence of haemodynamic instability (i.e., shock or hypotension), should receive systemically administered thrombolytic therapy. Intermediate-high risk patients might benefit from close observation, and some should undergo escalation of therapy beyond standard anticoagulation, particularly if haemodynamic deterioration occurs. Low-risk for adverse outcomes should lead to early hospital discharge or full treatment at home. Validated prognostic tools (i.e., clinical prognostic scoring systems, imaging studies, and cardiac laboratory biomarkers) assist with risk classification of patients who have acute symptomatic PE.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^73ddd2a6]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Current diagnostic algorithms, combining clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although at costs of high numbers of CT-examinations. In view of cost- and time-saving as well as safety issues, several attempts have recently been undertaken to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Especially the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the potential for non-invasive exclusion of PE. Once the diagnosis of PE is established, immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin-K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients with use of clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers or imaging tests, aids physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcome, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients, who require closer monitoring and for whom recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy. This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^bf128097]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A New Conceptual Model for Risk Stratification

On the basis of these limitations, clinicians and researchers need a novel approach to more effectively assess prognosis and implement precision treatment, because the risks and benefits of treatment options and patient monitoring will vary on the basis of individual patient characteristics. Development of a future risk classification schema that provides individual patient risk assessment and has a link to available therapeutic options and treatment settings will overcome the aforementioned shortcomings (Figure 1). We define this as therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management.

Figure 1.
(A) Proposed approach for generating the therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute pulmonary embolism (PE) management schema. (B) Limited prognosis-guided risk classification versus proposed therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management schemas. CDT = catheter-directed therapies; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; RV = right ventricle; SBP = systolic blood pressure; sPESI = simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index. Thresholds for the therapeutic-guided risk classification used to illustrate the concept, but not proposed for implementation.

Clinicians will use the proposed new approach to risk classification, in conjunction with patient preferences, to determine the appropriate level of care and to prioritize available treatment options. Safety issues, including the risk of bleeding and other procedure-related complications, are also important determinants of the use and choice of therapies. Although all these factors are crucial in decision making for the use and choice of advanced therapies, we do not directly include them in PE-related risk of adverse events.

Therefore, the proposed new model needs to address the following key issues to improve the approach to caring for patients with acute PE:
- For patients with acute PE, which outcomes should prognostic tools assess?

Prognostic tools should predict short-term all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, hemodynamic collapse, recurrent PE, and major bleeding.

### Risk factors for the assessment of patients with pulmonary embolism [^d58ad3f4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs frequently among cancer patients, with a spectrum ranging from small, clinically insignificant thrombi to life-threatening massive PE. It is fatal in as many as 14% of cancer patients, primarily by producing right ventricular heart failure and cardiogenic shock. PE diagnosis is difficult because the signs and symptoms imitate other commonly occurring diseases. Clinicians must be able to integrate a wide array of diagnostic imaging tools and laboratory tests to ensure rapid assessment and diagnosis. Risk stratification with the use of cardiac biomarkers and imaging tests to evaluate right ventricular function will identify treatment options. Hemodynamically stable patients can be treated effectively with anticoagulation alone, whereas those with right ventricular dysfunction require an aggressive strategy with thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, or a catheter-based intervention. When anticoagulation is contraindicated, a vena caval filter may be deployed. PE treatment must be customized to the individual and consider the existing thrombus burden, presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease and right side heart dysfunction, and cancer status of the patient. Clinicians should focus on providing adequate thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients to avoid PE treatment.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^3db75f8e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — risk stratification and D-dimer–guided evaluation is described as combining pretest probability with decision tools and selective imaging; patients without elevated risk should not be tested, clinician gestalt accuracy is similar to structured tools but tools standardize care, most tools use D-dimer for lower-risk patients to avoid unnecessary computed tomography (CT) when normal, and D-dimer remains appropriate as an initial step for inpatients; both Wells and Geneva tools have been externally validated; highly sensitive D-dimer assays are assumed, whereas older latex or erythrocyte agglutination assays only rule out PE in low pretest probability.

### The PERT concept: a step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^7c853cd8]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

### The natural course of hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism: clinical outcome and risk factors in a large prospective cohort study [^f49a9b75]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease with risks of recurrent venous thrombotic events (venous thromboembolism [VTE]) and major bleeding from anticoagulant therapy. Identifying risk factors for recurrent VTE, bleeding, and mortality may guide clinical decision making.

Objective

To evaluate the incidence of recurrent VTE, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality in patients with PE, and to identify risk factors and the time course of these events.

Design

We evaluated consecutive patients with PE derived from a prospective management study, who were followed for 3 months, treated with anticoagulants, and underwent objective diagnostic testing for suspected recurrent VTE or bleeding.

Results

Of 673 patients with complete follow-up, 20 patients (3.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 4.6%) had recurrent VTE. Eleven of 14 patients with recurrent PE had a fatal PE (79%; 95% CI, 49 to 95%), occurring mostly in the first week after diagnosis of initial PE. In 23 patients (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.2 to 5.1%), a hemorrhagic complication occurred, 10 of which were major bleeds (1.5%; 95% CI, 0.7 to 2.7%), and 2 were fatal (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.04 to 1.1%). During the 3-month follow-up, 55 patients died (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.2 to 10.5%). Risk factors for recurrent VTE were immobilization for > 3 days and being an inpatient; having COPD or malignancies were risk factors for bleeding. Higher age, immobilization, malignancy, and being an inpatient were risk factors for mortality.

Conclusions

Recurrent VTE occurred in a small percentage of patients treated for an acute PE, and the majority of recurrent PEs were fatal. Immobilization, hospitalization, age, COPD, and malignancies were risk factors for recurrent VTE, bleeding, and mortality. Close monitoring may be indicated in these patients, precluding them from out-of-hospital start of treatment.

Risk stratification

Risk stratification is performed using clinical scores, laboratory values and imaging. The pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC) help in cases with a low pre-test probability ≤ 15% while the revised Geneva Score objectifies the risk for PE and helps justify imaging studies. The simplified pulmonary embolism severity index (sPESI) predicts 30-day mortality in PE patients. In practice, the revised Geneva Score is most helpful as it is designed to avoid or potentially trigger CT imaging for confirmative diagnosis and definitive risk stratification. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines categorize PE into low, intermediate-low and intermediate-high as well as high estimated acute mortality risk from right heart failure (Table 1). According to this classification, defining clinical features of at least intermediate-risk PE include a heart rate greater than 110/min, a systolic blood pressure under 100 mmHg, or an oxygen saturation below 90%. The intermediate-high-risk group additionally exhibits elevated cardiac biomarkers and signs of right ventricular dysfunction in echocardiography or CT angiography. Intermediate-low-risk patients meet at most one of these criteria. High-risk patients are characterized by hemodynamic instability, often requiring circulatory support. Treating elevated-risk PE is challenging because patients may decompensate suddenly after prolonged periods of stability.

### Short-term prognosis of pulmonary embolism [^0f11b44b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Risk stratification tools that accurately quantify the prognosis of patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) may be useful in guiding medical decision making. Prospective studies demonstrated that clinical factors, echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac biomarkers (troponins, brain natriuretic peptides) are independent predictors of short-term mortality in patients with PE. The presence of systemic hypotension or shock carries the highest risk of death, and thrombolysis is usually indicated. Among hemodynamically stable patients, clinical prognostic models, echocardiography, and biomarkers accurately identify low-risk patients with PE who are potential candidates for less costly outpatient care. However, the practical use of these prognostic measures is currently limited by the lack of studies demonstrating a positive impact on patient care. The benefit of risk stratification strategies based on clinical prognostic models, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers should be demonstrated in prospective studies before their implementation as decision aid to guide initial treatment can be recommended.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 1: epidemiology and diagnosis [^10bd3a93]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a frequently occurring, acute, and potentially fatal condition. Numerous risk factors for PE, both inherited and acquired, have been identified. Adequate diagnosis is mandatory to prevent PE-related morbidity and mortality on the one hand, and unnecessary treatment on the other. Only around 1 in 5 individuals with suspected PE will have the diagnosis confirmed, therefore, the diagnostic work-up for PE should comprise safe, efficient, and noninvasive methods. The first step in the approach to diagnosis of patients with suspected PE is to determine the clinical probability and to perform a D-dimer test. PE can be excluded in patients with a 'low', 'intermediate' or 'unlikely' clinical probability and a normal D-dimer test. Additional imaging is required for those with a 'high' or 'likely' clinical probability or a positive D-dimer test. CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, followed by additional testing is the next step when test results are nondiagnostic. Although various diagnostic strategies have been introduced and validated, selected patients may require a tailored approach.

Acute pulmonary embolism — talking points for clinicians to use with patients during PE evaluation: Imaging has risks. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria exclude PE in patients with low pretest probability. D-dimer testing excludes PE in patients at low pretest probability who do not meet the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria or patients at intermediate pretest probability. Alternative diagnostic strategies exist for patients who cannot have CT.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is the revision of a 2003 clinical policy on the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).(1) A writing subcommittee reviewed the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help clinicians answer the following critical questions: (1) Do objective criteria provide improved risk stratification over gestalt clinical assessment in the evaluation of patients with possible PE? (2) What is the utility of the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (3)What is the role of quantitative D-dimer testing in the exclusion of PE? (4) What is the role of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram of the chest as the sole diagnostic test in the exclusion of PE? (5) What is the role of venous imaging in the evaluation of patients with suspected PE? (6) What are the indications for thrombolytic therapy in patients with PE? Evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

Identification of low‐risk, hemodynamically stable patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism

The majority of patients diagnosed with acute PE (~95%) are hemodynamically stable at presentation and are considered non‐high‐risk 10, 34, 35. Further prognostic assessment of these patients is recommended to determine those who may require close clinical monitoring versus those with a low mortality risk, thereby guiding the subsequent treatment strategy. Both the 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and 2016 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines suggest that selected low‐risk patients may be suitable for early discharge/home treatment 10, 11. As a point of note, the ESC PE guidelines are scheduled for an update to be released in the second half of 2019.

Several prognostic risk scores, using baseline clinical parameters, can identify patients at low risk of adverse outcomes during the first one to three months of treatment; these include the GENEVA prognostic score, the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), and the simplified PESI (sPESI) (Table 1) 12, 13, 36. More recently, prognostic scores have been developed to predict the risk of early complications (≤ 2 weeks) and facilitate outpatient treatment of PE (Table 1) 37, 38, 39; however, these require further validation. Alternatively, clinical exclusion criteria, such as the Hestia criteria (Table 2), identify patients unsuitable for outpatient treatment 40. Although not designed as a risk stratification tool per se, several analyses have shown patients meeting the Hestia criteria are at low risk of adverse outcomes in the first month post PE diagnosis 41, 42, 43.

### JTH in clinic: management of low-risk pulmonary embolism [^f8fbaa16]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cardiovascular disease diagnosis in emergency departments that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the first steps after diagnosing PE is to risk stratify for adverse outcomes using risk scores such as PE Severity Index and European Society of Cardiology risk scheme. While intermediate- and high-risk PE patients should be admitted to the hospital, there is increasing evidence to support early discharge and home-based anticoagulation therapy for low-risk patients. The Hestia criteria encompass many of the clinicians' considerations for who may be suitable for early discharge, considering both medical and social factors. Additionally, professional guidelines have provided algorithms on determining which low-risk patients may be suitable. Despite this, low-risk acute PE patients are still often admitted for inpatient treatment. In this review, we present a case-based approach on how to risk stratify and evaluate patients who may be good candidates for early discharge and home therapy.

### Risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism [^969365c8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 5% of pulmonary embolism (PE) cases present with persistent hypotension, obstructive shock, or cardiac arrest. Given the high short-term mortality, management of high-risk PE cases focuses on immediate reperfusion therapies. Risk stratification of normotensive PE is important to identify patients with an elevated risk of hemodynamic collapse or an elevated risk of major bleeding. Risk stratification for short-term hemodynamic collapse includes assessment of physiological parameters, right heart dysfunction, and identification of comorbidities. Validated tools such as European Society of Cardiology guidelines and Bova score can identify normotensive patients with PE and an elevated risk of subsequent hemodynamic collapse. At present, we lack high-quality evidence to recommend one treatment over another (systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapy, or anticoagulation with close monitoring) for patients at elevated risk of hemodynamic collapse. Newer, less well-validated scores such as BACS and PE-CH may help identify patients at a high risk of major bleeding following systemic thrombolysis. The PE-SARD score may identify those at risk of major anticoagulant-associated bleeding. Patients at low risk of short-term adverse outcomes can be considered for outpatient management. The simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score or Hestia criteria are safe decision aids when combined with physician global assessment of the need for hospitalization following the diagnosis of PE.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^ea4da482]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^55d5040f]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^ac7a071a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A certain estimated rate of PE-related serious complications shortly after PE could lead to a recommendation of systemic thrombolytic therapy, assuming that it is the most effective and immediately available treatment and that the estimated risk of bleeding was outweighed by the benefit. The threshold of estimated short-term PE-related serious complication risk to provide catheter-directed therapies might be lower because the percutaneous treatment might have a lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis. A critical review and interpretation of available literature and ongoing RCTs will help reach a consensus for these thresholds.

We propose an approach for producing practical, useful, and consensus risk classification for clinicians and researchers. We will bring together a consensus group that will include representatives of major scientific societies leading the world in promoting and supporting clinical and scientific PE research. We will ensure patient partner participation during the process. To obtain consensus regarding important issues/questions that include but are not limited to those highlighted above, we plan to use a modified Delphi method. At an initial face-to-face meeting, we will discuss a proposed methodology for producing therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. Through an iterative process, we will develop and rank a list of key issues and questions related to the acute PE therapy. We will use virtual meetings to conduct sequential rounds of addressing the key questions with open discussion of results (Figure 1). We will track the results of major completed and ongoing randomized trials in the field and produce a consensus document regarding therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. The participants will then produce a manuscript and submit it to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. We also plan on prospectively validating the therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management schema in well-designed and adequately powered prospective RCTs.

In conclusion, the approach to risk classification of patients with acute PE needs further study, and we propose a therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management. We will produce an expert-guided consensus document that will address many but not all of the shortcomings of the current acute PE risk classification schema and better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning. The proposed therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management will then undergo further assessment, refinement, and revision over time.

### Risk stratification of normotensive patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism [^d4697906]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend strong consideration of thrombolysis in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) that present with arterial hypotension or shock because of the high risk of death in this setting. For haemodynamically stable patients with PE, the categorization of risk for subgroups may assist with decision-making regarding PE therapy. Clinical models [e.g. Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI)] may accurately identify those at low risk of overall death in the first 3 months after the diagnosis of PE, and such patients might benefit from an abbreviated hospital stay or outpatient therapy. Though some evidence suggests that a subset of high-risk normotensive patients with PE may have a reasonable risk to benefit ratio for thrombolytic therapy, single markers of right ventricular dysfunction (e.g. echocardiography, spiral computed tomography, or brain natriuretic peptide testing) and myocardial injury (e.g. cardiac troponin T or I testing) have an insufficient positive predictive value for PE-specific mortality to drive decision-making toward such therapy. Recommendations for outpatient treatment or thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE necessitate further development of prognostic models and conduct of clinical trials that assess various treatment strategies.

Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Comparative diagnostic accuracy of pre-test clinical probability scores for the risk stratification of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^4961e092]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-test clinical probability scores (pCPS) guide the diagnostic workup of patients with a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE) to improve patient outcomes without overburdening healthcare resources. It has been established that increased imaging doesn't predict improved patient outcomes. Additionally, many studies have reported that large proportions (> 50%) of patients with suspected PE are subjected to unwarranted imaging, which could have been prevented with the proper use of pCPS. Despite this, pCPS remain significantly underutilized.

One barrier to the implementation of pCPS in practice is the confusion caused by the range of available scores with different cut-offs, all equally recommended in the latest practice guidelines. This is largely due to most studies solely concentrating on comparing the performance of pCPS in sensitively ruling out PE, with major scores demonstrating similar performance. However, pCPS performance in ruling out PE, i.e. minimizing the number of patients with PE assigned to the low-probability category, while crucial, does not paint a complete picture of their performance in clinical practice. As pCPS are not designed for final diagnosis but to guide patients toward appropriate diagnostic tests (DTs). Consequently, the ability of each pCPS to assign imaging only to the patients who truly need it, while correctly differentiating between those with high and low probabilities of PE, is equally crucial for the effective management of patients with a clinical suspicion of PE. However, this aspect remains largely underexplored.

In the present review, we outline a framework for a holistic comparison of pCPS and subsequently use this framework to compare the overall effectiveness of available pCPS in risk stratifying the general population of patients suspected of PE.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — low pretest probability evaluation uses the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) and D-dimer testing. In patients believed to be at low risk for PE, the PERC criteria should be applied. In those who meet all 8 PERC criteria, the risk for PE is lower than the risks of testing; do not order a plasma d-dimer test. Those who do not meet all of the criteria should be further stratified by using a plasma d-dimer test. A normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; do not order imaging studies. An elevated plasma D-dimer level should lead to imaging studies. The PERC items are Age < 50, Initial heart rate < 100 beats/min, Initial oxygen saturation > 94% on room air, No unilateral leg swelling, No hemoptysis, No surgery or trauma within 4 wk, No history of venous thromboembolism, and No estrogen use; the table notes that pretest probability with score of 0 is < 1%.

### Cardiothoracic CT: one-stop-shop procedure? Impact on the management of acute pulmonary embolism [^353aef6d]. Insights Into Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

We propose two different risk stratification models in hemodynamically stable PE patients based on Becattini's proposed clinical management strategy and the revised Becattini prevalence scheme (Fig. 4). In Becattini's management proposal based on risk stratification, markers of dysfunction (ultrasound, MDCT, BNP levels) should be assessed first in hemodynamically stable patients with proven PE. If normal, the patient can be admitted to a medical ward. If at least one marker of dysfunction is abnormal, markers of cardiac injury should be assessed (troponin, H-FABPs). Only patients in whom these markers are also abnormal should be admitted to the ICU.

The first proposed model (Fig. 5a) closely resembles Becattini's strategy. The main difference is the inclusion of other risk factors such as bleeding risk, and treatment with thrombolysis and outpatient treatment in the algorithm. Outpatient treatment can be a good option if both RVD and signs of myocardial injury are absent. In the second model (Fig. 5b), the cardiac biomarkers troponin, BNP and/or FABP are taken into consideration before assessing the presence of RVD by either CT or echocardiography. In this model, outpatient treatment can only be considered if the cardiac biomarkers reveal no abnormalities. If these biomarkers are abnormal, two options are left: admission to the medical ward when signs of RVD are absent or admission to the ICU in combination with thrombolysis if RVD is present. As CT is the first imaging method of choice in the diagnosis of acute PE and currently considered the gold standard for PE, assessment of RV function on CT is a practical first step and should be evaluated in every patient with PE at CT. Cardiac echocardiography in general has a lower availability and has no proven additional value once CT has been performed. Laboratory testing including cardiac biomarkers should be obtained in every patient with suspected PE or acute cardiac disease. We think that this combination of CT and blood tests is the easiest strategy, most time-efficient, and probably most cost-effective. However, like the risk strategies proposed by other authors, these strategies need further prospective validation before they can be implemented in clinical practice.

Introduction

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), developed with the European Respiratory Society, provide recommendations on the optimal management of acute PE, including diagnostic algorithms, risk stratification, initial and extended treatment, and follow-up strategy. Some important aspects of the treatment and overall care of patients after acute PE were mentioned, but their detailed discussion was beyond the scope of the guideline document. These issues relate to: management of bleeding risk, screening for cancer, screening for thrombophilia, treatment of PE in women, dealing with sports and travel, detection and management of the post-PE syndrome (PPES), and screening for and management of risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease. This position paper highlights these key aspects of patient counselling, summarizes best available evidence and provides guidance for clinical practice. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE that is intended to be complementary to the formal guideline. The rationale for the conclusions presented is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix. This review will not deal with PE and COVID-19, for which the reader is referred to the dedicated European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus document.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 2: treatment [^48d535a8]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) varies widely, ranging from only limited symptoms to severe cardiogenic shock. Treatment of PE comprises initial therapy — with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin — and long-term treatment, most commonly with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). Methods of risk stratification, to determine whether a patient will benefit from thrombolysis, are currently under investigation. However, at present, insufficient evidence exists that hemodynamically stable patients who demonstrate echocardiographic right ventricular strain (submassive PE) benefit from thrombolysis. By contrast, thrombolysis is a widely accepted treatment strategy for patients with hemodynamic shock (massive PE). The duration of VKA treatment is commonly 3–12 months and depends on the type of PE and on the balance between the risks of recurrent PE, major bleeding, and the patient's preference. In patients with a malignancy, treatment with LMWH during the first 6 months after diagnosis of PE is recommended. Several new oral anticoagulants, such as factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors, are now being investigated. For prevention of recurrent PE in situations where anticoagulation is contraindicated, a temporary inferior vena cava filter might be useful. Some patients with PE can be safely treated at home, but few outcome studies in this setting have been published.

### Comparison of 4 acute pulmonary embolism mortality risk scores in patients evaluated by pulmonary embolism response teams [^9a8df5c1]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) experience few, if any, complications. However, an estimated 5% to 15% of patients with acute PE are at high risk of death or hemodynamic collapse. Multiple risk assessment models have been developed to identify patients at risk for these complications. These commonly used risk scores are widely recommended in various treatment guidelines and expert recommendations.

Some risk scores are primarily used to identify low-risk patients for whom outpatient treatment may be appropriate. Others aim to identify patients for whom the risk of death and hemodynamic deterioration is sufficiently high to consider the use of thrombolytic or other advanced therapies. Common examples include the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), the simplified PESI (sPESI), and Bova scores. The PESI and sPESI have demonstrated the ability to discriminate between high and low risk for 30-day all-cause mortality. However, they were derived from retrospective cohorts and may not be ideal for guiding clinical decision-making at the time of PE diagnosis. A fourth system, outlined in the 2014 and 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, recommends using PESI or the sPESI but also adds biomarker and radiological markers to the risk stratification scheme.

It is unknown how similarly each of these risk tools will stratify an individual patient's risk. In addition, inconsistent ability to estimate shorter-term outcomes (eg, 7- and 30-day mortality) limits the utility of many of these risk scores. Our objective was to explore the short-term outcomes among patients with acute PE and to compare the ability of different risk scores to discriminate among low- and high-risk patients.

Acute pulmonary embolism — alternative initial testing when appropriate: Several alternative approaches to the work-up of PE may also be beneficial, including using lower-extremity venous ultrasonography before CT; in hemodynamically stable patients with lower-extremity symptoms, identifying deep venous thrombosis can eliminate the need to perform CT, and this approach has particular utility in pregnant patients in the first trimester with suspected PE, in whom the risks and benefits of CT should be weighed even more carefully. Although CT exposes these patients to less radiation than V/Q imaging does, it may have teratogenic effects, making the use of lower-extremity ultrasonography in patients with lower-extremity symptoms a valid strategy.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — high pretest probability: For patients with high pretest probability of PE according to either clinician gestalt or a clinical prediction tool, imaging studies should be performed. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method of diagnosis when it is available and there is no contraindication to radiographic contrast dye. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) lung scanning should be used when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. Of note, a D-dimer assay should not be obtained in patients with a high pretest probability of PE because a negative value will not obviate the need for imaging.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^10fa1445]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PE management is challenging in many ways starting with, at times, deceptive clinical presentations. Thus, a decompensating patient may seem compensated but present with a life-threatening RV dysfunction. The same high-risk patient with PE may be treated completely differently depending on concomitant factors such as age, context and local resources. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary approach should be attempted, for example, a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT), to best manage patients with acute, severe disease. This shift of approach should to be adjusted according to the usefulness and timing of the intervention; in particular, PE management needs to be tailored to pathophysiology.

Acute cor pulmonale due to PE has a very specific pathophysiology, where patient characteristics and haemodynamic features interact, and may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding following thrombolysis. Future challenges to decrease the bleeding risk and improve clinical outcomes include better bleeding risk stratification, tailored heparin and thrombolysis dosage, improved treatment monitoring, adjunctive catheter-based therapies and implementing multidisciplinary PERTs.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^1965f008]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While the optimal management of patients in the intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism group remains to be defined, a combination of clinical variables, biomarkers and imaging studies may assist in identifying those patients that are most likely to benefit from a closely monitored setting. At present there are a large number of treatment options ranging from various thrombolysis dosages, catheter-directed therapies, surgical therapies, and peripherally inserted devices that can aid in augmenting cardiac output. Developing a superior method to determine who in the intermediate risk group would benefit remains paramount to investigating and further defining treatment for this group. While it is clear that there is benefit in aggressive treatment in the patient who needs it, if patients are not at true risk for decompensation then aggressive treatment only comes with more risk. It is perhaps not the treatment of pulmonary embolism that needs defining but rather better individualized hemodynamic monitoring and prediction of decompensation that hold the key. Until a better characterization of this population can be made we assert that the best treatment intervention may be the implementation of PERTs so that an educated discourse can be made on a case by case basis.

### Pulmonary embolism response teams: changing the paradigm in the care for acute pulmonary embolism [^cce38121]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as a multidisciplinary, multispecialty team of experts in the care of highly complex symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with a centralized unique activation process, providing rapid multimodality assessment and risk stratification, formulating the best individualized diagnostic and therapeutic approach, streamlining the care in challenging clinical case scenarios (e.g., intermediate-high risk and high-risk PE), and facilitating the implementation of the recommended therapeutic strategies on time. PERTs are currently changing how complex acute PE cases are approached. The structure, organization, and function of a given PERT may vary from hospital to hospital, depending on local expertise, specific resources, and infrastructure for a given academic hospital center. Current emerging data demonstrate the value of PERTs in improving time to PE diagnosis; shorter time to initiation of anticoagulation reducing hospital length of stay; increasing use of advanced therapies without an increase in bleeding; and in some reports, decreasing mortality. Importantly, PERTs are positively impacting outcomes by changing the paradigm of care for acute PE through global adoption by the health-care community.

### Clot-in-transit and pulmonary embolism: an urgent call for awareness and action [^ccb39170]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) have a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, from incidental findings to sudden cardiac death. Management and treatment recommendations in currently available guidelines vary according to patient risk and haemodynamic profile. A clot-in-transit (CiT) in the right heart chambers may be occasionally identified and is, therefore, an under-recognised but challenging condition, often preceding an abrupt clinical deterioration, and associated with increased mortality. Data on the detection of a CiT are sparse but consistent in attributing negative prognostic relevance, and therefore the presence of CiT should be systematically investigated and recorded in the setting of PE. In this review, the challenges related to the identification of a CiT are highlighted. Here, we propose an algorithm where the role of the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) is reinforced. The PERT should convene once the CiT is suspected, to define the timeline for the diagnostic steps and subsequent management on a case-by-case basis. A patient with PE and CiT requires close bedside monitoring and rapid escalation therapy in case of clinical deterioration. Beyond anticoagulation alone, more aggressive strategies can be considered, including systemic thrombolysis, surgical pulmonary embolectomy and the currently emerging catheter-directed therapies.

### Diagnostic accuracy of adropin as a preliminary test to exclude acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective study [^cc5bb3b8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the ESC 2019 pulmonary embolism guideline, it is recommended to use validated criteria for the diagnosis of PE in haemodynamically stable patients. Stable patients were triaged again for CTPA imaging preference based on clinical risk and D-dimer level. The guideline states that D-dimer measurement is recommended in ED patients with low or moderate clinical probability to reduce the need for unnecessary imaging and radiation and states that it rules out pulmonary embolism in 30% of outpatients. However, it is added that D-dimer should not be measured in the high clinical probability group, emphasizing that false negative results are reported in pulmonary embolism patients. In our study, D-dimer levels with standard cut-off values were measured, and clinical risk classification was performed in all suspected patients with stable haemodynamics. We also think that applying triage according to clinical probability and D-dimer results instead of direct CTPA in patients with suspected low- and intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism may reduce unnecessary imaging.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^cf66e98e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Why is it important to revisit the initial presentation with acute PE?

A review of presenting symptoms and imaging to confirm the diagnosis is important, as occasionally patients will be misdiagnosed with acute PE, or scans may be non-diagnostic. A long history of symptoms prior to diagnosis could indicate the patient has pre-existing CTEPH. An assessment of the early mortality risk as high, intermediate-high, intermediate-low or low risk (based on haemodynamic instability, clinical parameters of PE severity using the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) or simplified PESI, RV dysfunction on echocardiogram or CTPA and troponin levels)is important, as patients with more severe acute PE are at greater risk of developing CTEPH. Risk factors for PE are important for determining the likelihood of CTEPH: a meta-analysis demonstrated an OR of 4.1 for the development of CTEPH in patients with no major transient risk factors compared with those with them. In a recent study from the ASPIRE Registry (Assessing the Spectrum of Pulmonary hypertension Identified at a REferral Centre), only 3 of 376 (0.8%) patients seen 3–6 months post PE with a major transient risk factor, compared with 33 of 1139 patients (2.8%) with no major transient risk factors, went on to develop CTEPH.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH

Diagnostic algorithms have been developed to risk stratify patients based on pretest probability (PTP) of PE. These are designed to identify patients with PE while avoiding unnecessary exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast associated with CT‐pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The PE rule‐out criteria (PERC) effectively rule out PE in patients with low PTP (< 15%) with no formal testing. For patients who need testing, the Wells criteria, Geneva score or the gestalt of an experienced clinician can be used to stratify patients into low‐, medium‐ or high‐PTP categories. Most guidelines recommend D‐dimer testing for low‐ and intermediate‐risk patients (PTP < 30%)and CTPA for high‐PTP; however, there is emerging evidence that D‐dimer‐only diagnostic algorithms may also be safe in high‐PTP patients. The cut‐off for D‐dimer positivity is typically 500 μg/L, though the specificity using this cut‐off is low (about 45%). Using an age‐adjusted D‐dimer cut‐offor a PTP‐adjusted cut‐off, such as the YEARS criteria, improves specificity and can safely rule out PE in approximately 14% more patients. For patients requiring imaging, most guidelines recommend CTPA. Ventilation‐perfusion (V/Q) scanning can be considered for patients who cannot undergo CTPA. However, access to V/Q scanning is limited and V/Q scans are more likely to yield indeterminate results compared to CTPA (42% vs. 7%). For patients who are too unstable for imaging or otherwise unable to undergo CTPA, echocardiography demonstrating right ventricular (RV) dysfunction can increase the clinical suspicion of PE. A positive venous ultrasound can also establish a diagnosis of VTE when pulmonary imaging cannot be performed.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^d2c89ed3]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism response teams

The complexity of managing patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism calls for a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making as care may have to be individualized on a case-by-case basis. While echocardiography, biomarkers, and risk-stratification strategies help in decision making, it often becomes challenging to predict outcome in patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. Institutions have developed pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) to assist in treatment strategies and the possible need for advanced therapies such as fibrinolysis versus catheter-based treatment versus surgical embolectomy on a case-by-case basis. While the composition of each team varies among institutions, they most often include some variation of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and intensivists. It remains to be known whether PERTs improve outcomes, but they offer the best opportunity for a multidisciplinary approach to managing pulmonary embolism. The 2019 ESC guideline recommends forming an interdisciplinary team, such as a PERT, if resources are available. Given the lack of hemodynamic predictors of these patients, we believe that PERTs represent the best method to weigh risk and benefit for each treatment option in patients not only with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism but also other pulmonary embolism conundrums.

### Management of high-risk pulmonary embolism in the emergency department: a narrative review [^4792fcef]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is a complex, life-threatening condition, and emergency clinicians must be ready to resuscitate and rapidly pursue primary reperfusion therapy. The first-line reperfusion therapy for patients with high-risk PE is systemic thrombolytics (ST). Despite consensus guidelines, only a fraction of eligible patients receive ST for high-risk PE.

Objective

This review provides emergency clinicians with a comprehensive overview of the current evidence regarding the management of high-risk PE with an emphasis on ST and other reperfusion therapies to address the gap between practice and guideline recommendations.

Discussion

High-risk PE is defined as PE that causes hemodynamic instability. The high mortality rate and dynamic pathophysiology of high-risk PE make it challenging to manage. Initial stabilization of the decompensating patient includes vasopressor administration and supplemental oxygen or high-flow nasal cannula. Primary reperfusion therapy should be pursued for those with high-risk PE, and consensus guidelines recommend the use of ST for high-risk PE based on studies demonstrating benefit. Other options for reperfusion include surgical embolectomy and catheter directed interventions.

Conclusions

Emergency clinicians must possess an understanding of high-risk PE including the clinical assessment, pathophysiology, management of hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure, and primary reperfusion therapies.

4.2 ∣ Guideline recommendations

ESC guidelines recommend assessment of RV by imaging methods or laboratory biomarkers even in the presence of low PESI or negative sPESI, as these factors may assist in the prognostication of patients. In this group of hemodynamically stable patients, further risk stratification to distinguish between low- and intermediate-risk PE can help clinicians decide between early home discharge and hospitalization. ESC guidelines consider any patient with hemodynamically stable acute PE with elevated troponin level or RV dysfunction in the intermediate-risk group and recommend close monitoring for hemodynamic worsening of the RV. These patients are recommended hospitalization, as meta-analysis has shown increased mortality (OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.39–12.58) for all-cause death if RV dysfunction was noted. However, the absolute rate of early all-cause death ranges 1.8% to 3.8%, which is lower than is typically seen in patients with intermediate-risk PE. Presence of both RV dysfunction and positive troponin confers increased risk of early hemodynamic instability.

Given the presence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin level in our patient, she is at modestly increased risk of PE-related complications. Therefore, it is reasonable to admit her for observation based on ESC guidelines to observe for hemodynamic worsening despite her PESI score being low-risk. At the same time, if she has a supportive home environment, reliable access to anticoagulation, and rapid follow-up, it would be reasonable to also consider home discharge in this case as well. In hemodynamically stable patients, it is reasonable to consider checking troponin levels and imaging for the RV. The Bova score takes into account these parameters and can be used in further risk stratification for hemodynamically stable patients.

Overall, most patients with low-risk PESI, sPESI, and/or Hestia scores are likely good candidates for outpatient management (Figure 4). However, in select cases, hospitalization to monitor for any clinical worsening is reasonable. Primarily, these include patients with significant RV enlargement or dysfunction seen on imaging and biomarkers.

Background

In part 1 of this two-part review, we discussed which risk factors, historical features, and physical findings increase risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) in symptomatic emergency department (ED) patients.

Objectives

Use published evidence to describe criteria that a reasonable and prudent clinician can use to initiate and guide the process of excluding and diagnosing PE.

Discussion

The careful and diligent emergency physician can use clinical criteria to safely obviate a formal evaluation of PE, including the use of gestalt reasoning and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC rule, Table 2, part 1). We present published clinical and radiographic features of patients with PE who eluded diagnosis in the ED. D-dimer can be used to exclude PE in many patients, and employing age-based adjustments to the threshold to define an abnormal value can further reduce patient exposure to pulmonary vascular imaging. Moreover, we discuss benefits, limitations, and potential harms of computed tomographic pulmonary vascular imaging relevant to patients and the practice of emergency care. We present algorithms to guide exclusion and diagnosis of PE in patients with suspected PE, including those who are pregnant.

Conclusions

Reasonable and prudent emergency clinicians can exclude PE in symptomatic ED patients on clinical grounds alone in many patients, and many more can have PE ruled out by use of the D-dimer.

### Fibrinolytic therapy in pulmonary embolism: an evidence-based treatment algorithm [^e0b9e473]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with pulmonary embolism (PE) have a wide spectrum of clinical severity. Although some patients may present with frank hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest, others may present with an asymptomatic PE that is discovered incidentally during workup of another condition. Fibrinolytic therapy is an option in the treatment of patients with PE due to its ability to rapidly dissolve thromboemboli clots. However, the use of fibrinolytics in the treatment of PE is a controversial topic that has left many practicing physicians confused on how to best treat these patients. A rational approach to deciding whether fibrinolytic therapy is indicated is based on an assessment of the benefit that each particular patient will derive from fibrinolytic therapy weighed against that patients risk for major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. There is a clear benefit/risk ratio for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with PE who present with cardiac arrest and in those who are hemodynamically unstable from a massive PE. With proper risk assessment, select patients with stable hemodynamics and right ventricular dysfunction may also benefit from fibrinolytic therapy. There is no benefit to fibrinolytic treatment in patients with stable hemodynamics and normal right ventricular function. This article sets out to review the literature on fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with PE and will propose an evidence based treatment algorithm.

Acute pulmonary embolism stability and outpatient management — most patients are stable at presentation and low-risk cohorts have low adverse event rates with traditional anticoagulation. "More than 95% of patients who ultimately receive a diagnosis of acute PE are 'hemodynamically stable' at presentation with an associated mortality of 1% to 15%". "More recently, NOACs (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) have been approved for the treatment of both DVT and PE after studies demonstrated that this regimen was noninferior to traditional treatment with heparin and a VKA". "Two randomized controlled trials were identified that assessed outcomes of low-risk patients admitted to the hospital and treated with traditional anticoagulation for 90 days". "In these 2 studies, the incidence of recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage, and all-cause mortality was approximately 1%, 2%, and 2%, respectively". Accordingly, "an outpatient treatment strategy for newly diagnosed PE can be deemed safe and effective if the subsequent incidence of important adverse outcomes does not exceed those experienced by patients receiving traditional hospitalization followed by outpatient care".

American College of Physicians best practice advice — evaluation of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered. Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available.

DISPOSITION

Some patients, such as those with haemodynamic instability, require inpatient treatment. Patients with RV dysfunction, which is associated with short‐term mortality, or high bleeding risk usually also require admission to monitor for haemodynamic decompensation. However, some low‐risk patients may be treated as outpatients. To assign the appropriate disposition, clinicians may use validated scores that categorize PE patients according to the risk of 30‐day death, like the PE Severity Index (PESI) and simplified PESI (sPESI), or according to their need for admission, like the Hestia criteria. Despite the availability of these tools, and contrary to most guidelines, two‐thirds of patients with low‐risk PE are still admitted.

Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis — hemodynamically stable, nonpregnant patients: If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnancy) due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds, and there are limited data on the utility of D-dimer for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who present with suspected recurrent PE. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions and suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing, and if prior imaging is available, comparison of the previous and current imaging is warranted to determine whether the findings are new and represent recurrent PE. Scores were used to assess clinical probability of recurrent PE, but the Wells and Geneva scores have not been specifically validated for patients with suspected recurrent PE.

### Personalized strategies for high-risk acute pulmonary embolism: addressing the "catastrophic" subgroup. author's reply [^1c726423]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Concerning the definition of treatment groups, we agree that patients initially stabilized with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) pose an important challenge in our analysis. Treatment switches and combined strategies, which may occur both in non-randomized and randomized studies in high-risk settings, make the estimation of the independent effects of individual treatments very challenging. We decided to not assign patients to the VA-ECMO treatment group if they were bridged to advanced recanalization because there is no reason to expect VA-ECMO to be an effective treatment option beyond hemodynamic stabilization. Since VA-ECMO is very unlikely to reduce the blood clot itself, we do not think that this choice introduces classification bias. However, we acknowledge that it may introduce immortal time bias. Table S4 in the supplement shows that the comparisons between the treatment groups are largely unchanged when we exclude the VA-ECMO group. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S2, subsequent treatments were initiated at a median of 1 h after the initiation of VA-ECMO, indicating a very low risk of immortal time bias in this subgroup. In line with this, excluding four patients who received VA-ECMO and died in the first 5 h did not modify our results in an unpublished sensitivity analysis. Estimating the effect of combined treatment strategies, including initial stabilization with VA-ECMO, would be highly desirable, but it would not only require a much larger sample size than the 991 patients included in our analysis, but also advanced modeling to account for the exact timing in treatment trajectories. Overall, our results suggest that high-risk PE patients, including those initially stabilized with VA-ECMO, benefit from timely recanalization.

Although secondary analyses from ongoing randomized controlled trials (CATCH-PE II NCT06672081; PERSEVERE: NCT06588634; TORPEDO NL: NCT06833827) may offer new insights, prospective data on recanalization strategies for high-risk PE patients requiring VA-ECMO support will likely remain limited. Therefore, high-quality non-randomized analyses remain a crucial source of evidence to guide the management of patients experiencing cardiac arrest, pre-hospital hemodynamic instability, and other factors associated with a poor prognosis.

For a patient who has undergone CT imaging and has an incidental finding of chronic thromboembolism (webs and/or attenuated vessels), what should I do?

Strictly, CTEPD cannot be diagnosed until after 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. If there is an incidental finding of chronic, organised, fibrotic clot and the patient presents with breathlessness, we would recommend therapeutic anticoagulation with reassessment after 3 months. The decision with respect to long-term anticoagulation should be made on an individual basisand consider the risk of PE recurrence, the previous history of PE (if any) and the burden of organised clot seen on CTPA against the risk of potential bleed.

Patients who remain symptomatic at 3 months require further assessment. The first step would usually be an echocardiogram. If there is an intermediate or high probability of PH, then referral to a PH centre is recommended. If there is a low probability of PH, a CPET looking for an abnormal pulmonary vascular response patternshould be considered, or, if unfit to perform CPET, the authors suggest echocardiogram surveillance after a year. NT-proBNP can also help to stratify likelihood of having significant PH. Where patients have a low echocardiographic probability of PH and breathlessness is likely due to other factors, it may not be necessary to perform any further assessment. In cases where the probability of PH is unclear, a follow-up echocardiogram after an interval may be helpful.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

Management of bleeding risk

From the start of anticoagulant treatment, patients with acute PE are at increased bleeding risk. Therefore, management of bleeding risk is relevant throughout the course of treatment, beginning with ruling out absolute contraindications to anticoagulant treatment at diagnosis, identifying the optimal anticoagulant strategy, and avoiding unnecessary interventions. Alternative treatment strategies in PE patients who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation include (repeated) platelet transfusions to deal with 'critical' thrombocytopenia aiming to keep the platelet count above 30–50 × 10⁹/L, or the use of a retrievable vena cava filter in selected cases. Appropriate action should be taken to ensure drug adherence and optimal dosing, while avoiding relevant drug-drug interactions. Risk factors for bleeding need to be screened for and — when modifiable — reversed before patients are discharged. The most relevant potentially modifiable risk factors are: renal insufficiency, liver disease, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, hypertension, and use of antiplatelet or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After the first 3–6 months, estimation of the risk of bleeding over the long term becomes relevant for patients at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), for whom indefinite treatment is considered. This bleeding risk can be estimated by either implicit judgement, weighing individual risk factors, or by risk prediction schemes. The currently available evidence supports the application of the American College of Chest Physicians bleeding risk tool or VTE-BLEED to identify patients at lowest risk of bleeding complications, in whom long-term anticoagulant treatment is likely safe. There is however no evidence supporting the avoidance of long-term anticoagulation in patients with a high estimated bleeding risk based on either of these risk stratification tools. Instead, such knowledge should be discussed with the patient and incorporated into a shared decision-making process regarding continuation or discontinuation of anticoagulation. Moreover, we propose a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for patients at higher risk of bleeding, in whom it is decided to continue treatment. Of note, according to the ESC PE guideline, a reduced dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended anticoagulation after the first 6 months should generally be considered.

### Refining pulmonary embolism management: balancing innovation with accuracy [^bd58c1df]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, the findings presented here are particularly apropos for patients with PE who are found to be at intermediate risk. This group presents the greatest clinical challenge, existing in a gray zone between low-risk individuals who can be safely discharged and high-risk patients requiring immediate intensive intervention. Current risk stratification methods rely primarily on clinical scoring systems, such as the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, and imaging findings, such as RV dilation on computed tomography pulmonary angiography. However, these traditional markers often lack the granularity needed to determine which intermediate-risk patients might benefit from escalated care, such as ICU admission or advanced therapies like systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed interventions.

This is where advanced echocardiographic parameters, such as RV strain, could play a pivotal role. Unlike basic RV dilation assessments, which only offer a structural snapshot of RV dysfunction, strain imaging provides insights into myocardial mechanics and enables the identification of subclinical RV impairment before overt failure develops. In addition, RVOT VTI serves as a surrogate marker for cardiac index, aiding in the assessment and prediction of hemodynamic compromise.

Incorporating these parameters into clinical practice could significantly enhance triage decisions. Based on the data presented by Ruiz-Bailén and colleagues, an intermediate-risk patient with preserved RV strain and normal RVOT VTI might be safely managed with anticoagulation on a medical floor, whereas a patient with impaired strain and reduced RVOT VTI may warrant ICU monitoring and consideration for more aggressive intervention. Refining risk stratification and PE management in this manner could reduce unnecessary ICU admissions, while ensuring timely escalation of care for high-risk patients.

Despite their promise, several barriers hinder the widespread adoption of advanced echocardiographic parameters in PE risk stratification. First, formal echocardiography requires specialized training and equipment, which may not be readily available in all institutions, particularly in remote hospitals where POCUS is more heavily relied on. Second, clear echocardiographic thresholds for RV strain and RVOT VTI must be established to guide clinical decision making. Finally, integrating these parameters into existing PERT protocols would require interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring that emergency, critical care, and floor teams can interpret and act on these findings effectively.

### Thrombolytic therapy for acute pulmonary embolism: a critical appraisal [^3f6533c2]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a prevalent condition that may account for > 300,000 deaths annually in the United States alone. Although thrombolytics have been studied as a treatment for acute PE since the 1960s, to date there have been only 11 randomized controlled trials comparing thrombolytic therapy to conventional anticoagulation, and the numbers of patients included in these trials has been small. Many studies confirm that thrombolytic therapy leads to rapid improvement in hemodynamic aberrations associated with PE, and this approach to massive PE with cardiogenic shock is a guideline-based practice. It is widely accepted that acute PE without associated right ventricular (RV) dysfunction or hemodynamic instability can be readily managed with standard anticoagulation. The appropriate therapy for submassive PE (PE associated with RV dysfunction but preserved systemic arterial BP) remains an area of contention, and definitive data proving mortality benefit in this setting are lacking. Further efforts at risk stratification may better determine who is in need of aggressive therapy. This article reviews historical aspects of and current evidence for thrombolytic therapy in acute PE with specific attention to bleeding risk, and data regarding hemodynamic parameters and mortality. We also discuss risk stratification techniques and propose a clinical algorithm for the incorporation of thrombolytic therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of a cardiac source of embolism [^d4c4403a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — role of echocardiography focuses on risk stratification and characteristic findings in hemodynamically significant PE. Echocardiography is not a diagnostic modality of choice for the diagnosis of PE per se but is used for patient risk stratification; both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provide noninvasive assessment of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) size, systolic function, regional wall motion, valvular abnormalities, and right-heart pressures, and thrombi in transit are rare to see with a serpentine thrombus traversing the right-heart chambers. The typical echocardiographic pattern of hemodynamically significant PE shows RV strain, interventricular septum bulging into the left ventricle, and dilated proximal pulmonary arteries; distinction of high-risk from low-risk patients should be rapidly performed so management can be tailored.

### Oxygen saturation or respiratory rate to improve risk stratification in hemodynamically stable patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^665bb672]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials In acute pulmonary embolism (PE), risk stratification is essential to drive clinical management. Improving the 2014-ESC risk stratification strategy is crucial in hemodynamically stable patients. Oxygen saturation and respiratory rate improve risk stratification in hemodynamically stable PE. Simple and routine tests improve risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE. SUMMARY: Background In patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), risk stratification for short-term death is recommended to drive clinical management. A risk stratification strategy combining the simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI), echocardiography and troponin was proposed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2014. The identification of hemodynamically stable patients at increased risk of death by this strategy needs improvement. Objective To assess whether further stratification by serial cut-off values of oxygen saturation or respiratory rate improves the accuracy of the ESC risk stratification strategy in hemodynamically stable PE patients. Methods Prospective cohorts of hemodynamically stable patients with PE were merged in a collaborative database. The accuracy of risk stratification for 30-day mortality by the original and a modified 2014 ESC strategy was assessed. Results Overall, 255 patients (27%) were categorized as low, 510 (54%) as intermediate-low and 181 (19%) as intermediate-high risk according to the original 2014 ESC strategy. Thirty-day mortality was 1.2% in low, 10% in intermediate-low and 11% in intermediate-high-risk patients. By adding oxygen saturation in air of < 88%, the discriminatory power of the 2014 ESC model improved for 30-day mortality (c-statistics, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.77 vs. 0.63, 95% CI, 0.56–0.69) and for PE-related death (c-statistics, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69–0.81 vs. 0.63, 95% CI 0.56–0.69). Conclusions Simple and routine tests, such as oxygen saturation or respiratory rate, could be added to the 2014 ESC strategy for risk stratification to identify hemodynamically stable PE patients at increased risk of death who are potentially candidates for more aggressive treatment.

4.1 ∣ RISK STRATIFICATION WITH EMERGING RISK FACTORS

Risk stratification using PESI scoring places our patient in the low-risk category (class II — 84 points for age, history of cancer, and heart rate of ≥ 110 beats/min). While PESI does include 11 clinical factors to predict 30-day mortality, it does not capture features such as RV strain or positive cardiac biomarkers. The Bova score was derived to evaluate and risk stratify normotensive patients and included just 4 clinical features — systolic blood pressure, elevated cardiac troponin, RV dysfunction based on certain imaging criteria, and heart rate. Calculating the Bova score for our patient places her at intermediate risk (Bova stage II — 3 points for RV dysfunction and elevated troponin level), which predicts 6.8% 30-day PE-related mortality, significantly higher than her PESI risk estimation of 1.7% to 3.5% 30-day mortality.

Elevated cardiac troponins are seen in up to 60% of all acute PE patients and have been demonstrated to have increased risk of all-cause mortality even in hemodynamically stable patients. While not particularly sensitive if used in isolation, combining troponin with the clinical scenario and diagnosis of acute PE does improve its diagnostic utility. Similarly, echocardiographic findings may be useful for guidance of risk assessment and triaging for hemodynamically stable patients (Figure 3). Features such as hypokinesis of RV free wall compared with RV apex (McConnell's sign) may suggest a higher risk of PE-related complications. Other features such as RV pressure overload, noted a systolic septal flattening (D-sign), and RV systolic dysfunction noted as reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion may suggest RV systolic dysfunction. Increased RV dilation suggesting volume/pressure overload can present as RV/LV diameter ≥ 1.0, evaluated by both CT and echocardiogram. Discovery of intra-cardiac thrombus in transit may also be observed, though this is rare.

### Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside without diagnostic imaging: management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department by using a simple clinical model and D-dimer [^f9877674]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism" for pulmonary embolism.

The Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism is a clinical prediction rule that stratifies patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) into different risk categories. It is used in the emergency department or outpatient setting to determine the likelihood of PE in patients presenting with symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained cough.

The Wells' Criteria includes factors such as clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an alternative diagnosis less likely than a PE, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization or surgery in the previous four weeks, previous history of DVT or PE, hemoptysis, and malignancy.

The score helps clinicians decide whether to proceed with further diagnostic testing, such as D-dimer testing or computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients are classified as having a low, moderate, or high probability of PE based on their total score.

The Wells' Criteria should not be used in patients with a clear alternative diagnosis, or in patients who have been on full anticoagulation for more than 48 hours. It is also not applicable in pregnant patients or in patients under the age of 18.

The Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism calculator assesses the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism based on seven input factors, each contributing a specific score, which when summed, categorizes the risk level. These factors are: clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis, previous history of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis, heart rate over 100 beats per minute, immobilization for 3 or more days or recent surgery within the past 4 weeks, if pulmonary embolism is as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis, hemoptysis, and cancer or recent end of cancer treatment.

The inputs are boolean (yes/no) values for each criterion which correspond to predetermined scores:

| **Factor** | **Score** |
|-|-|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis | 3 |
| Previous, objectively diagnosed pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis | 1.5 |
| Heart rate > 100 | 1.5 |
| Immobilization ≥ 3 days or surgery in the previous 4 weeks | 1.5 |
| Pulmonary embolism as likely as or more likely than an alternative diagnosis | 3 |
| Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) | 1 |
| Cancer/palliative care/stopped treatment of cancer within 6 months | 1 | To calculate the total score, assess each input factor: if the input is true (yes), add its corresponding score to the total; if false (no), add zero. The sum of these scores determines the risk interpretation:

- A total score of 2 or less implies a low risk of pulmonary embolism with a probability of 1.3%.
- A score between 2.5 and 6 suggests a moderate risk with a probability of 16.2%.
- A score greater than 6 indicates a high risk with a probability of 40.6%.

The outputs of this calculator include both the numerical score and its interpretation, providing an analysis of the risk level for pulmonary embolism based on the users' inputs. The systematic consideration of clinically relevant symptoms and history enhances the accuracy of predicting pulmonary embolism risk.
