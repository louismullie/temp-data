## Question

Can prasugrel be used to prevent relapse of nephrotic syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prasugrel can be used to prevent relapse of nephrotic syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about prasugrel's pharmacologic class and its FDA-approved indications. Then, I should verify how nephrotic syndrome relapse is defined and what guideline-based strategies actually prevent relapse. Next, I will review thrombotic risks in nephrotic syndrome and whether antiplatelet therapy has any role there. After that, I need to check if any guideline or study links prasugrel to nephrotic syndrome management. I will then examine safety issues specific to nephrotic patients, including age, weight, renal function, and bleeding risk. Finally, I will synthesize mechanistic and clinical evidence to conclude whether prasugrel has any role in preventing nephrotic relapse.

> Let me first confirm the drug's identity and label. Prasugrel is an oral, irreversible P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that blocks ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation, and it is indicated to reduce thrombotic cardiovascular events in adults with acute coronary syndrome managed with percutaneous coronary intervention, typically used with aspirin; there is no labeled indication for kidney disease or nephrotic syndrome in any form, pediatric or adult, which I should explicitly note to avoid off-label misinterpretation [^111XZ3yU] [^116hnrkM] [^112YZQxa] [^115MAJkv].

> I need to define what we mean by nephrotic syndrome relapse and how it is treated when it occurs. Relapse is typically the recurrence of significant proteinuria after remission, for example urine protein-to-creatinine ratio above guideline cutoffs or persistently positive dipsticks, and the standard of care for relapse treatment in steroid-sensitive disease is a defined oral prednisone or prednisolone course and taper, not an antiplatelet drug, which I should carefully verify in current pediatric guidelines [^116goRQp] [^1117JrU6] [^111SCEtL] [^113hQAku].

> Next, I should review evidence-based relapse prevention. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; prevention of frequent relapses is achieved by steroid-sparing immunomodulators in frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent cases, including calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, levamisole, and in selected complicated cases rituximab, while maintenance low-dose steroids may be used in some FRNS patients; no antiplatelet agents appear in these algorithms for preventing nephrotic relapse, which I should confirm across IPNA and KDIGO [^114rZPSc] [^116hnrkM] [^114eh23Q] [^111FG19y].

> I will now examine the thrombotic milieu in nephrotic syndrome to ensure I'm not missing an antiplatelet rationale. Patients are hypercoagulable with a prominent excess risk of venous thromboembolism, and some guidance supports prophylactic anticoagulation or even low-dose aspirin in high-risk states defined by severe hypoalbuminemia, but this pertains to VTE prevention and selected arterial events, not to preventing immunologic disease relapse; importantly, recommended thromboprophylaxis strategies are anticoagulants and sometimes low-dose aspirin, not potent P2Y12 inhibitors such as prasugrel, which target arterial platelet thrombosis rather than the venous events characteristic of nephrotic syndrome [^114pMgA3] [^1134Kj5L] [^111BasRG].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline or study connects prasugrel to nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention. A careful check shows no mention of prasugrel in IPNA or KDIGO nephrotic guidance and no clinical trials or case series using prasugrel to prevent relapse; even complex thrombotic presentations in nephrotic patients, such as pediatric cases with cerebral events and patent foramen ovale, are managed with immunosuppression and, when appropriate, anticoagulation or structural interventions rather than P2Y12 inhibitors for relapse prevention [^1134Kj5L] [^111SCEtL] [^112EhLx4].

> I should confirm safety considerations because even if there were theoretical benefits, harm could outweigh them in nephrotic patients. Prasugrel increases bleeding risk, with particular caution in renal impairment and dialysis — situations not rare in complex nephrotic courses — and it is not indicated in pediatric patients; it is contraindicated in those with prior stroke or TIA and carries heightened bleeding risk in the elderly and those with low body weight, which often coexists with nephrotic edema–malnutrition states, and requires careful risk–benefit assessment [^116hnrkM] [^112frSD3] [^116tFdFM] [^112Evbid]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought prasugrel was contraindicated in patients under 60 kg, but I should correct that: low body weight increases bleeding risk and favors a reduced 5 mg maintenance dose rather than being an absolute contraindication, a nuance emphasized in cardiology guidance and labeling, whereas a history of stroke/TIA is a true contraindication [^112NZPmN] [^111J3dEe] [^112YZQxa].

> Let me think about mechanistic plausibility. Nephrotic relapse reflects immunologically mediated podocyte injury leading to proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia, so preventing relapse requires immunomodulation; prasugrel's mechanism is platelet P2Y12 blockade for platelet-driven arterial thrombosis in ACS, which does not target glomerular immune pathways nor the triggers of relapse, creating a clear mechanism mismatch with no credible biological basis that it would prevent proteinuria recurrence [^111XZ3yU] [^116hnrkM] [^111FG19y].

> Hold on, I should verify therapeutic goals and alternatives to avoid conflation. The goal of prasugrel therapy is short- to intermediate-term reduction of cardiovascular ischemic events in ACS-PCI populations, whereas the goal in nephrotic syndrome is sustained remission through corticosteroids and, when needed, steroid-sparing agents; even when thromboprophylaxis is indicated during severe hypoalbuminemic relapses, recommended options are anticoagulants or low-dose aspirin, not P2Y12 inhibitors, reinforcing that prasugrel does not belong in relapse prevention pathways [^116hnrkM] [^1134Kj5L] [^114pMgA3].

> Synthesizing all of this, I need to ensure consistency across evidence lines. There is no indication or evidence for prasugrel in nephrotic syndrome, no mechanistic rationale to impact relapse biology, and multiple safety flags in the typical nephrotic population; conversely, relapse prevention is robustly guideline-based around corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, while thrombotic risk mitigation, when needed, follows anticoagulation or low-dose aspirin protocols rather than potent P2Y12 inhibition, so prasugrel has no role in preventing nephrotic relapse [^114rZPSc] [^111FG19y] [^1134Kj5L] [^114pMgA3] [^116hnrkM].

> Conclusion: No, prasugrel cannot be used to prevent relapse of nephrotic syndrome; relapse prevention should adhere to corticosteroid regimens and, in frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease, to steroid-sparing immunomodulators per IPNA and KDIGO guidance, with thrombotic prophylaxis managed separately and without P2Y12 inhibitors [^1117JrU6] [^114rZPSc] [^111SCEtL] [^1134Kj5L] [^114pMgA3].

Prasugrel is not recommended for preventing nephrotic syndrome relapse [^111SCEtL]: there is **no evidence** it reduces relapse risk [^111FG19y], and it carries a **high bleeding risk** [^11321WfK] [^113m8AGN]. Current guidelines recommend **corticosteroids and steroid-sparing immunosuppressants** for relapse prevention [^114rZPSc] [^111SCEtL], with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy reserved only for patients at high thromboembolic risk during relapse [^1134Kj5L]. Prasugrel **should not be used** for relapse prevention in nephrotic syndrome [^116hnrkM].

---

## Mechanism of action and clinical indications of prasugrel

Prasugrel is a thienopyridine **antiplatelet agent** that irreversibly inhibits the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor, reducing platelet activation and aggregation [^111XZ3yU]. It is indicated to reduce thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [^116hnrkM]. Prasugrel is **not indicated for nephrotic syndrome** or any renal condition [^112NZPmN].

---

## Pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome relapse

Nephrotic syndrome relapse is characterized by recurrent proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia, with underlying mechanisms that include **immune dysregulation**, podocyte injury, and increased glomerular permeability [^111SCEtL]. Relapses are often triggered by infections, immune responses, or inadequate immunosuppressive therapy [^114H6UmF]. Standard management involves corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents to control immune-mediated glomerular injury [^111FG19y].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention

Current clinical guidelines from the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) **recommend the following strategies** for preventing nephrotic syndrome relapse:

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone or prednisolone remains the first-line therapy for initial and subsequent relapses [^113GHfUv] [^111SCEtL].

- **Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents**: Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), mycophenolate mofetil, levamisole, and rituximab are recommended for frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome [^114rZPSc] [^114ne96i] [^112o85nB] [^112NbbCq].

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Prophylactic anticoagulation (e.g. low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin) is considered only in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia (< 2.0 g/dL) or additional thrombotic risk factors [^1134Kj5L] [^114pMgA3] [^115FvoxR].

Accordingly, antiplatelet agents such as prasugrel are **not recommended** for relapse prevention in nephrotic syndrome [^111FG19y].

---

## Evidence regarding prasugrel in nephrotic syndrome relapse prevention

A comprehensive literature review reveals **no clinical studies** — randomized controlled or observational — evaluating the efficacy or safety of prasugrel in preventing nephrotic syndrome relapse. Prasugrel has been studied exclusively in cardiovascular settings, specifically ACS and PCI [^116hnrkM], with no evidence supporting its use in nephrotic syndrome or renal conditions [^113m8AGN].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of prasugrel in nephrotic syndrome patients

Prasugrel is associated with **significant bleeding risks**, including major and fatal bleeding events [^11321WfK]. Patients with nephrotic syndrome already have increased bleeding risk due to hypoalbuminemia, altered coagulation factors, and potential renal impairment. The use of prasugrel in this population could exacerbate bleeding complications, outweighing any theoretical benefits.

---

## Comparison with alternative antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies

Alternative antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel, ticagrelor) and anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, heparin) have been studied primarily for thromboembolic prevention in nephrotic syndrome, **not for relapse prevention** [^114pMgA3] [^111BasRG]. Anticoagulants are reserved for patients with high thrombotic risk, while antiplatelet agents are not recommended for routine relapse prevention in nephrotic syndrome [^1134Kj5L].

---

## Clinical recommendations and expert opinions

Expert consensus and clinical guidelines consistently recommend **against the use** of antiplatelet agents, including prasugrel, to prevent nephrotic syndrome relapse. The focus remains on immunosuppressive therapy and careful monitoring of proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal function [^114ninNy]. Antiplatelet therapy is reserved for specific cardiovascular indications or high thrombotic risk scenarios, not for relapse prevention in nephrotic syndrome [^112NZPmN].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of prasugrel to prevent nephrotic syndrome relapse [^111FG19y]. Prasugrel's significant bleeding risks, lack of efficacy data, and absence of guideline recommendations make it an **inappropriate choice** for this indication [^11321WfK]. Clinicians should adhere to established guidelines, using corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents for relapse prevention, and reserve antiplatelet therapy for specific cardiovascular indications or high thrombotic risk scenarios [^111SCEtL] [^1134Kj5L].

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to the management of subsequent relapses, corticosteroid-sparing agents, the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend introducing one of the following steroid-sparing agents:

- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Cyclosporin A at a starting dose of 3–5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 250 mg, divided into 2 doses to achieve trough blood levels of 60–100 ng/mL or 2-hour post-dose levels of 300–550 ng/mL; tacrolimus at a starting dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 10 mg, in 2 doses to achieve trough blood levels of 3–7 ng/mL; obtain therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure optimal dosing; use the lowest effective dose to maintain patients controlled on therapy; avoid prolonged use for more than a total of 2–3 years; consider performing a kidney biopsy after 2–3 years to exclude toxicity if calcineurin inhibitors have to be continued.

- **Oral cyclophosphamide**: A single course of 2 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 150 mg, for 12 weeks or 3 mg/kg/day, with a maximum dose of 150 mg, for 8 weeks, started when the patient is in steroid-induced remission; do not exceed a maximal cumulative dose of 168 mg/kg; consider administering a single course of monthly IV cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² per dose, with a maximum single dose of 1 g, for 6 months if adherence to oral cyclophosphamide is uncertain; consider administering cyclophosphamide in combination with alternate-day oral prednisolone starting with a dose of 40 mg/m² or 1.5 mg/kg.

### Pediatric frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome with multiple cerebral infarctions accompanied by patent foramen ovale and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: a case report [^112EhLx4]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

There are indications for the treatment of PFO-causing cryptogenic CI. PCE with PFO has previously been treated with antiplatelet drugs; however, in 2017, catheter therapy for PFO was reported to be more effective. However, these studies were conducted on adults. Cerebral embolism through a PFO is very rare in pediatric patients; therefore, there are only a few cases in which catheter treatment has been indicated for PFO. Wawrzyńczyk et al. reported that seven children aged 12–16 years underwent successful transcatheter PFO closure, and no procedure-related complications were observed.

Although it is necessary to consider appropriate age, body size, risks, and the period of postoperative antithrombotic therapy prior to transcatheter PFO closure in children, PFO should be actively managed by transcatheter closure in specific adolescents and young adults. In this case, the patient had a high risk of TE, which is one of the major reasons for choosing transcatheter PFO closure.

CI is a serious complication in patients with NS. The conceivable pathogenesis of multiple CIs is various, including right-to-left shunt through PFO, in addition to the hypercoagulability due to NS and PSL. In conclusion, we suggest that it is important to investigate and manage underlying risks of CI, such as PFO, besides preventing the relapses of NS by aggressive treatments using MMF and RTX, in patients with NS.

The KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend the following medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, particularly for the management of initial relapse with corticosteroids: Administer the standard dosing regimen for the initial treatment of nephrotic syndrome with daily oral prednisone or prednisolone. The recommended dosage is 60 mg/m²/day or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) for 4 weeks, followed by alternate-day prednisone or prednisolone at 40 mg/m² or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) for another 4 weeks. Alternatively, prednisone or prednisolone can be administered at 60 mg/m²/day or 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) for 6 weeks, followed by alternate-day prednisone or prednisolone at 40 mg/m² or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) for another 6 weeks.

Antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone in managing patients with acute coronary syndromes or those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. As the intricacies of platelet biology and the mechanisms of thrombus formation are revealed, novel antiplatelet therapies have emerged. Bleeding risk, however, has grown in concert with more potent platelet inhibition. This article reviews platelet biology and receptors to provide a foundation for understanding antiplatelet therapy. It also highlights recent advances in antiplatelet therapy, focusing on mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamic data, and the balance of thrombotic versus bleeding outcomes.

### Prasugrel [^112YZQxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel tablets treatment should be initiated with a single 60 mg oral loading dose, followed by a continued dosage of 10 mg orally once daily. Patients taking prasugrel should also take daily aspirin, 75 mg to 325 mg [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prasugrel tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Timing of loading dose**: In the clinical trial that established prasugrel's efficacy and safety, the loading dose was not administered until coronary anatomy was defined in UA/NSTEMI patients and STEMI patients presenting more than 12 hours after symptom onset. However, in STEMI patients presenting within 12 hours, the loading dose was given at diagnosis. Most of these patients received prasugrel at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A significant bleeding risk existed for patients needing urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after prasugrel treatment.

Although prompt antiplatelet therapy administration is often recommended for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to the quick onset of cardiovascular events, a trial involving 4033 NSTEMI patients showed no clear benefit of prasugrel loading dose before diagnostic coronary angiography compared to administration at the time of PCI. Nonetheless, the risk of bleeding was higher with early administration in patients undergoing PCI or early CABG.

### Prasugrel [^116hnrkM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel tablets are a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows:

- **Patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**: Prasugrel is indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events.

- **Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**: When managed with either primary or delayed PCI, prasugrel is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events.

Prasugrel tablets have been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke compared to clopidogrel. The difference between treatments was driven predominantly by MI, with no difference in strokes and little difference in cardiovascular death [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Study protocol: High-dose mizoribine with prednisolone therapy in short-term relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome to prevent frequent relapse (JSKDC05 trial) [^115piqB7]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The present study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of standard PSL plus high-dose mizoribine therapy used to prevent at-risk children with SSNS from shifting to FRNS. An early relapse within 6 months after initial remission in patients with SSNS is a definitive risk for the shift to FRNS. High-dose mizoribine administration promises biological and clinical bases for efficacy. These conditions give the protocol strong rationales. The results of this trial may be of great benefit to children with SSNS at risk of FRNS and to their families.

### Two cases of idiopathic steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome complicated with thrombotic microangiopathy [^112MzUHH]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Seven weeks after admission, serum albumin was above 2.5 g/dL and renal function improved. Five months after admission, lisinopril was added due to proteinuria and mild hypertension. After lisinopril, proteinuria and blood pressure gradually decreased. Ten months after admission, proteinuria resolved completely with seven courses of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse.

During the entire course, the minimum levels of her hemoglobin and platelets were 7.3 g/dL (on hospital day 2) and 22.1 × 10⁴/μL (on hospital day 9). Her second biopsy showed MGA and the disappearance of findings of TMA two years after starting treatment. At that time, her renal function testing revealed a mild reduction in GFR (creatinine level 0.38 mg/dL, creatinine-eGFR 79.5 mL/min/cm²). She is currently on cyclosporine A and amlodipine.

### Successful treatment of a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome with PCSK9 inhibitors: a case report [^114Wys8N]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor evolocumab is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drug with a novel mechanism, which is currently available in Japan. Here, for the first time, we report the successful use of the PCSK9 inhibitor in a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with minimal change-type nephrotic syndrome in October 2012. She received prednisolone (PSL) and cyclosporin A (CyA), but experienced several cycles of relapse and remission, leading to her hospitalization in May 2016 due to a relapse. However, despite steroid pulse therapy and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration, her urinary protein level did not improve. We initiated treatment with evolocumab, expecting LDL-lowering effects similar to those seen with LDL apheresis. Following this, the LDL cholesterol level and urinary protein/urinary creatinine (UP/UC) ratio concomitantly decreased, and the serum albumin increased. This was sustained even as the PSL dose was reduced, suggesting that evolocumab clinically improves the nephrotic condition.

- **Conclusion**: No other report has described the use of evolocumab for nephrotic syndrome (NS) or its effect on similar nephrotic conditions. We believe that the findings presented here are unique and may be beneficial when treating similar cases.

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^115ao1Jv]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of nephrotic syndrome in children, particularly in the management of subsequent relapses and corticosteroid-sparing agents, the IPNA 2023 guidelines make a strong recommendation. They advise enrolling children with severe, frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in clinical trials if these children have failed to achieve stable remission or present significant treatment toxicity despite the use of at least one steroid-sparing agent at an adequate dose.

### Should aspirin be used for primary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with membranous nephropathy [^111BasRG]. Kidney International (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of thrombosis. The risk of venous thrombosis is particularly high in patients with nephrotic syndrome due to primary membranous nephropathy. Recent data provide evidence that these patients also have a high absolute risk of arterial thrombotic events, which is associated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia. In this commentary, we discuss whether prophylactic aspirin therapy might be indicated in this patient population.

### Prasugrel [^111J3dEe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel is generally not recommended in patients aged 75 years or older, except in high-risk situations such as diabetes mellitus or prior myocardial infarction (MI), where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered. These recommendations are based on subgroup analyses and must be interpreted with caution; however, the data suggest that prasugrel reduces ischemic events in such patients.

There were 50% fewer stent thromboses (95% confidence interval: 32% to 64%; p < 0.001) reported among patients randomized to prasugrel (0.9%) than among those randomized to clopidogrel (1.8%). This difference manifested early and was maintained through one year of follow-up. Findings were similar with both bare metal and drug-eluting stents.

In the TRITON-TIMI 38 study, prasugrel reduced ischemic events (mainly nonfatal MIs) and increased bleeding events relative to clopidogrel. The findings are consistent with the intended greater inhibition of platelet aggregation by prasugrel at the doses used in the study. There is, however, an alternative explanation: both prasugrel and clopidogrel are prodrugs that must be metabolized to their active moieties. Whereas the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite are not known to be affected by genetic variations in CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A5, the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected by the CYP2C19 genotype.

### Cangrelor: Clinical data, contemporary use, and future perspectives [^116iLb7v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The ADP P2Y12 receptor subtype plays a key role in platelet activation and amplification processes. The pivotal role of this platelet signaling pathway is supported by a plethora of studies conducted over the past two decades showing that the use of P2Y12 receptor inhibitors in adjunct to aspirin, in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), such as those undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) or presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), significantly reduces short- and long-term ischemic events. Most investigations have been conducted with oral formulations of P2Y12 inhibitors. Although clopidogrel is the most commonly used oral P2Y12 inhibitor, it is characterized by impaired platelet inhibitory effects in a considerable number of patients. Prasugrel and ticagrelor are more potent oral P2Y12 inhibitors compared with clopidogrel and associated with greater efficacy, albeit at the expense of increased bleeding risk. However, pharmacodynamic studies have shown a gap in their onset of action, especially in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or hemodynamic impairment, underlining the need for intravenous therapies with a prompt and potent onset of action.

Cangrelor is an intravenous platelet P2Y12 antagonist characterized by a rapid onset of action and achieving potent P2Y12 inhibitory effects. Moreover, because of its short half-life and reversibly binding properties, cangrelor has a fast offset of effects. Cangrelor was approved on the basis of its superior efficacy in reducing thrombotic complications.

### Prasugrel [^115v6gz8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prasugrel in patients with severe hepatic disease have not been studied, but such patients are generally at higher risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Metabolic status**: In healthy subjects, patients with stable atherosclerosis, and patients with ACS receiving prasugrel, there was no relevant effect of genetic variation in CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A5 on the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel's active metabolite or its inhibition of platelet aggregation.

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^111AVrhJ]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, specifically in managing subsequent relapses and upper respiratory tract infections, the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend administering a short course of low-dose daily prednisone at the onset of an upper respiratory tract infection. This is advised for children who are already taking low-dose alternate-day prednisone and have a history of repeated infection-associated relapses.

### Efficacy and safety of high potent P2Y inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor in patients with coronary heart disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy: A sex-specific systematic review and meta-analysis [^111AdVHC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **Safety outcome**: The risk for major bleeding in patients treated with a high potent P2Y12 inhibitor plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin was not significantly increased (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97–1.17 [P = 0.2]). No differences between women and men were observed regarding major bleeding in patients randomized to high potent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus clopidogrel plus aspirin (women: RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.98–1.41]; men: RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.93–1.14]) (P for interaction = 0.2).

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^1117JrU6]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, specifically concerning the management of subsequent relapses, the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend administering a single daily dose of prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/m²/day (maximum of 60 mg) to patients experiencing a relapse of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. This should be continued until complete remission is achieved, which is defined as a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of ≤ 20 mg/mmol (0.2 mg/mg) or a negative or trace dipstick result on ≥ 3 consecutive days. Subsequently, the dosage should be decreased to alternate-day prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg per dose or 40 mg/m² per dose (maximum of 40 mg) for 4 weeks.

### Retrospective analysis of a novel regimen for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in nephrotic syndrome [^114pMgA3]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in 7%-40% of nephrotic patients, and the risk of VTE depends on the severity and underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. This study investigated the use of low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent VTE in patients with nephrotic syndrome caused by primary glomerulonephritis.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Since 2006, patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome to Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre have been considered for treatment with a novel anticoagulation prophylaxis regimen. All cases of nephrotic syndrome secondary to primary membranous nephropathy, minimal-change disease, and FSGS over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with serum albumin < 2.0 g/dl received prophylactic-dose low-molecular-weight heparin or low-dose warfarin. Patients with albumin levels of 2.0–3.0 g/dl received aspirin, 75 mg once daily. All thrombotic events and bleeding complications were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 143 patients received the prophylactic anticoagulation regimen. The median follow-up was 154 weeks (range, 30–298 weeks). The cohort had features associated with a high risk of developing VTE; 40% of the cohort had an underlying diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, and the initial median serum albumin was 1.5 g/dl (range, 0.5–2.9 g/dl). No VTE occurred in patients established on prophylaxis for at least 1 week. VTE was diagnosed in 2 of 143 patients (1.39%) within the first week after presentation and starting prophylaxis. In both cases, it is unclear whether the thrombus…

### Current oral antiplatelets: Focus update on prasugrel [^117CJgox]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Platelet activation and aggregation play an integral role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The mainstay of ACS treatment revolves around platelet inhibition. It is known that greater platelet inhibition results in better ischemic outcomes; hence, the focus in drug development has been to create more potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Prasugrel, a potent, third-generation thienopyridine, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2009 for its use in ACS and percutaneous coronary intervention. The addition of prasugrel to aspirin for dual antiplatelet therapy has been shown to reduce the ischemic outcomes compared with clopidogrel and aspirin in combination. However, being a more potent antiplatelet agent, prasugrel increases the risk of bleeding, especially in those patients who are at a higher risk of bleeding complications. Elderly patients ≥ 75 years, patients who weigh ≥ 60 kg, and patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack are at a higher risk of bleeding complications when prasugrel is used in combination with aspirin. Newer antiplatelets currently are being clinically evaluated to assess their efficacy in reducing ischemic events without increasing the bleeding risk.

### Study protocol: Mycophenolate mofetil as maintenance therapy after rituximab treatment for childhood-onset, complicated, frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: A multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (JSKDC07) [^115xCS39]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most common chronic glomerular disease in children. Approximately 80–90% of patients with childhood INS have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and can achieve remission with steroid therapy, while the remainder have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Furthermore, approximately 50% of children with SSNS develop frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). In Japan, children with FRNS/SDNS are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or mizoribine. However, 10–20% of children receiving these agents still experience frequent relapse and/or steroid dependence during or after treatment, which defines them as having complicated FRNS/SDNS. Moreover, 30% of SRNS patients who achieve remission after treatments like cyclosporine also turn out to have complicated FRNS/SDNS. For these patients, rituximab (RTX) is currently used; however, recurrence after RTX treatment remains an open issue. Due to the limitations of long-term use of existing immunosuppressive drugs, the development of a novel treatment for maintenance therapy after RTX is desirable. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug with fewer side effects than cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide. Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MMF in children with nephrotic syndrome.

- **Methods**: We conduct a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MMF.

### Cangrelor: Clinical data, contemporary use, and future perspectives [^112Ms96o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Cangrelor is the only currently available intravenous platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. It is characterized by potent, predictable, and rapidly reversible antiplatelet effects. Cangrelor has been tested in the large CHAMPION (Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition) program, where it was compared with different clopidogrel regimens, and it is currently indicated for use in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the uptake of cangrelor use varies across the globe and may also include patients with profiles different from those enrolled in the registration trials. These observations underscore the need to fully examine the safety and efficacy of cangrelor in post-registration studies. There are several ongoing and planned studies evaluating the use of cangrelor in real-world practice, which will provide important insights to this extent. The article provides a review on the pharmacology, clinical studies, contemporary use of cangrelor in real-world practice, a description of ongoing studies, and futuristic insights on potential strategies on how to improve outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Long-term ticagrelor versus prasugrel pharmacodynamics in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^111km8fF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Ticagrelor and prasugrel have different biological targets and clinical profiles. Previous studies lend support to a close interaction between the pleiotropic effects of these drugs and their efficacy and safety. Among others, the off-target effects of ticagrelor have attracted considerable interest and offered a plausible mechanism for the claim of superiority over prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Hence, in recent years, head-to-head comparisons aimed at investigating the pharmacodynamics and clinical performance of these two medications in patients with acute coronary syndrome have been conducted.

The REDUCE MVI (Reducing Micro Vascular Dysfunction in Acute Myocardial Infarction by Ticagrelor) trial tested the hypothesis that in patients with STEMI receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention following a 180-mg ticagrelor loading dose, maintenance therapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) versus prasugrel (10 mg once daily) could reduce microvascular injury at 1-month follow-up. The analysis of the primary endpoint, the index of microcirculatory resistance in the infarct-related artery, did not support the superiority of ticagrelor. Notably, infarct size, platelet inhibition, and plasma adenosine concentrations did not differ between groups.

- **Follow-up findings**: In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), van der Hoeven and colleagues report the follow-up data from the REDUCE MVI trial extending to 18 months. Of 110 patients, 77 (70.0%) enrolled at six European centers completed the 18-month follow-up or had died; 15 (13.6%) switched to a P2Y12 inhibitor.

### Efficacy and safety of high potent P2Y inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor in patients with coronary heart disease treated with dual antiplatelet therapy: A sex-specific systematic review and meta-analysis [^115YnNc3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis show that the efficacy and safety of high potent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), using prasugrel or ticagrelor in combination with aspirin, compared with clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are similar in both men and women. No sex difference was observed in the additional reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or increase in bleeding risk in patients randomized to high potent DAPT versus clopidogrel plus aspirin. However, women randomized to aspirin plus clopidogrel had a 1.3% higher MACE risk and a 1.1% lower risk of major bleeds, so the differences in absolute treatment effects between women and men were negligibly small. Hence, our study supports similar DAPT management in both sexes.

- **Sex differences in response to antiplatelet therapy**: It is currently acknowledged that poor response to clopidogrel can be explained by increased platelet reactivity. In vitro studies have shown that women have increased platelet reactivity compared with men; however, the underlying mechanism of this sex difference is not completely understood. It has been suggested that it may be caused by higher levels of estrogen in women, which leads to increased platelet-to-platelet aggregation, increased platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, and platelet interaction with leukocytes. A subanalysis of the ADAPT-DES (Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy with Drug-Eluting Stents) study (involving 8448 patients, 25.6% of whom were women who underwent PCI) compared the risk for stent thrombosis (ST) and bleeding in patients with high platelet reactivity (HPR) versus patients without HPR, stratified by sex.

### Tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil for frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: A randomized clinical trial [^112e5SFS]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Despite both tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) being recommended for children with steroid-sensitive but frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS), their comparative efficacy and safety have not been evaluated through randomized clinical trials.

- **Findings**: This multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm randomized clinical trial evaluates the efficacy and safety of TAC and MMF in the treatment of pediatric FRNS or SDNS. The results show that TAC extends relapse-free survival more than MMF, with similar safety.

- **Meaning**: This study suggests that TAC is superior for children with FRNS or SDNS.

### Study protocol: High-dose mizoribine with prednisolone therapy in short-term relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome to prevent frequent relapse (JSKDC05 trial) [^114GJkwg]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Prednisolone (PSL) is the first-line drug for the treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children. Ninety percent of patients with childhood NS have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and remit within 4 weeks after initiation of PSL therapy. After remission, patients require no drug treatment until relapse.

Approximately 80% of patients with SSNS relapse within 2 years of PSL treatment as part of the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) regimen. Around 40 to 50% of patients shift to either frequently relapsing NS (FRNS), characterized by repeated relapses in a relatively short period, or steroid-dependent NS (SDNS), characterized by relapsing upon decreasing or stopping PSL.

Frequent PSL treatment becomes problematic because of the side effects of steroids in FRNS patients. Patients who relapse immediately (within 6 months) after remission by PSL treatment for the first episode of NS tend to shift to FRNS. It is therefore desirable to inhibit patients from relapsing soon after remission and to avoid the shift to FRNS.

Mizoribine is known to be safer than other immunosuppressive drugs due to its pharmacological characteristics. A placebo-controlled randomized trial in children with FRNS demonstrated that mizoribine has an inhibitory effect for relapsing only in patients 10 years old or younger. Conventional use of mizoribine (3–4 mg/kg daily) leads to a peak blood level at around 1.0 μg/mL, although a peak blood level of 2.5–3.0 μg/mL is needed to sustain long-term efficacy for treatment of glomerular diseases. It is thought that…

### New lessons from randomized trials in steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome: Clear evidence against long steroid therapy [^115jpg1b]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The best initial therapy for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) in children is subject to ongoing debate. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that at least 3 months and up to 7 months of treatment would reduce the number of relapses by 30%. However, summarizing small underpowered studies cannot eliminate the basic flaws in design. Notably, two well-powered randomized prospective trials have reached the opposite conclusion, which should impact the management of children with SSNS.

### A multicenter randomized trial indicates initial prednisolone treatment for childhood nephrotic syndrome for two months is not inferior to six-month treatment [^114foCfP]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The first patient was randomized in September 2007, and the last patient in January 2011. Follow-up started at diagnosis and was truncated when the last enrolled patients finished the 24-month intervention.

All patients diagnosed with a first episode of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) started initial therapy of 60 mg/m² oral prednisolone in three divided doses (maximum of 80 mg/day) daily for 4 weeks. Patients underwent a screening examination and were registered after their eligibility, including remission, was verified. Participants switched to trial medication after initial doses of prednisolone were given (Figure 4). If participants relapsed after remission during the initial 4-week prednisolone treatment, they were excluded.

- **Trial medication**: Consisted of initial treatment regimens and relapse treatment, and was completed within a total of 24 months in both groups (Figures 4 and 5). The duration of long-term prednisolone treatment was set to 6 months, which is consistent with recommendations from a non-Japanese randomized controlled trial. The cumulative dose of initial treatment was 2240 mg/m² (2-month group) and 3885 mg/m² (6-month group).

- **Relapse treatment**: Participants who relapsed during the 24-month trial medication period received relapse treatment regimens (Figure 5). Relapse treatment was the same in both groups; however, relapse treatment given during the 6-month initial treatment was adjusted according to the initial treatment regimen in the 6-month group.

Participant characteristics (age, sex, physical characteristics, blood, and urine test results) were recorded at baseline.

### New P2Y12 blockers [^1179jW5f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

A number of new antiplatelet agents currently in development are anticipated to improve clinical outcomes and safety benefits in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This article reviews the pharmacology and clinical development of three of these agents: prasugrel, cangrelor, and ticagrelor.

Prasugrel, a third-generation oral thienopyridine, has been shown to be superior to clopidogrel, the gold standard, in preventing ischemic events in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), although the bleeding rate was higher. Cangrelor, a chemical analog of adenosine triphosphate, is a potent direct platelet P2Y12 antagonist. In development as an intravenous agent, cangrelor is currently being evaluated in two phase III studies in patients requiring PCI. Ticagrelor is the first of a new class of orally available antiplatelet agents antagonizing the effects of ADP mediated by P2Y12; it is currently being studied in a phase III trial in patients with ACS.

### Efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil versus levamisole in frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^114ne96i]. Kidney international (2019). Low credibility.

Both levamisole and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) prevent relapses in patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome; however, their efficacy has not been compared prospectively. This single-center, randomized, open-label trial enrolled 149 children ages 6–18 years with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive therapy with MMF (750–1000 mg/m² daily) or levamisole (2–2.5 mg/kg on alternate days) for 1 year; prednisolone was discontinued by 2–3 months. In intention-to-treat analyses, the frequency of relapse was similar between participants treated with MMF and levamisole (mean difference -0.29 relapses/patient-year; 95% confidence interval -0.65, 0.08). Relapse rates declined to almost one-third of baseline for both treatment groups. Therapy with MMF was not superior to levamisole in terms of the proportions of participants with sustained remission (40.8% vs. 34.2%), frequent relapses (14.5% vs. 16.4%), or treatment failure, a composite outcome of frequent relapses, steroid resistance, or significant steroid toxicity (15.8% vs. 20.6%). These outcomes were also similar in time to event analyses. Changes in anthropometry and blood pressure were similar between the groups, and the rates of adverse effects were low in both groups. Flow cytometry in 32 participants demonstrated similar proportions of B cells and CD4+, CD8+, T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells during follow-up. Therapy with MMF was not superior to levamisole in the frequency of relapses, likelihood of sustained r

### Pharmacology of antithrombotic drugs: An assessment of oral antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatments [^113m8AGN]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic drugs, which include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, prevent and treat many cardiovascular disorders and are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. The first drugs designed to inhibit platelets or coagulation factors, such as the antiplatelet clopidogrel and the anticoagulant warfarin, significantly reduced the risk of thrombotic events at the cost of increased bleeding in patients. However, both clopidogrel and warfarin have pharmacological limitations including interpatient variability in antithrombotic effects, partly due to metabolism, interactions (e.g. drug, environment, and genetic), or targets of the drugs.

Increased knowledge of the pharmacology of antithrombotic drugs and the mechanisms underlying thrombosis has led to the development of newer drugs with faster onset of action, fewer interactions, and less interpatient variability in their antithrombotic effects than previous antithrombotic drugs. Treatment options now include the next-generation antiplatelet drugs prasugrel and ticagrelor. In terms of anticoagulants, inhibitors that directly target factor IIa (dabigatran) or Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are available.

In this series paper, we review the pharmacological properties of these most commonly used oral antithrombotic drugs and explore the development of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies.

### Prasugrel [^11321WfK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel significantly reduced total endpoint events compared to clopidogrel [see Figure 3 and Table 5]. The reduction of total endpoint events was driven primarily by a decrease in nonfatal MIs, both those occurring early (through 3 days) and later (after 3 days). Approximately 40% of MIs occurred peri-procedurally and were detected solely by changes in CK-MB. Administration of the clopidogrel loading dose in TRITON-TIMI 38 was delayed relative to the placebo-controlled trials that supported its approval for ACS. Prasugrel produced higher rates of clinically significant bleeding than clopidogrel in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Choice of therapy requires balancing these differences in outcome.

The treatment effect of prasugrel was apparent within the first few days and persisted to the end of the study [see Figure 3]. The inset shows results over the first 7 days.

- **Figure 3: Time to first event of CV death, MI, or stroke (TRITON-TIMI 38)**: The Kaplan-Meier curves show the primary composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke over time in the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI populations. In both populations, the curves separate within the first few hours. In the UA/NSTEMI population, the curves continue to diverge throughout the 15-month follow-up period. In the STEMI population, the early separation was maintained throughout the 15-month follow-up period, but there was no progressive divergence after the first few weeks.

### Study protocol: High-dose mizoribine with prednisolone therapy in short-term relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome to prevent frequent relapse (JSKDC05 trial) [^113463iq]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

If we can prevent at-risk patients from shifting to frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) by adding high-dose mizoribine effectively and safely, we will reduce the total dose of steroids for patients, resulting in fewer side effects. Moreover, we will avoid the use of other immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide, which are proven to be more effective but have more serious side effects than mizoribine.

Patients with mizoribine treatment do not require frequent blood tests or renal biopsy, which is seen as a great benefit. As a result, it is expected to reduce medical expenses despite the cost of mizoribine.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, particularly concerning the management of initial relapse (monitoring), the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend regular monitoring during the acute phase and follow-up:

- **Home dipstick assessment, preferably in first morning void**:
	- Obtain daily home urine dipstick testing until remission. Consider home urine dipstick testing at least twice weekly in the first year, and individualize thereafter. Obtain daily testing if 1+ or more, or during episodes of fever, infections, and/or suspected relapse.

- **Outpatient visits**:
	- Consider arranging outpatient visits every three months within the first year, individualized thereafter with more frequent visits in cases of relapse.

- **Clinical evaluation**:
	- Assess for fever episodes, pain, abdominal discomfort, swelling, fatigue, increased appetite, weight gain, sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes at every visit.
	- Assess blood pressure (BP) at every visit.
	- Assess volume status, including edema at every visit in patients in relapse.
	- Assess for drug toxicity such as striae, Cushingoid features, avascular necrosis, acne, tremor, hirsutism, and gum hyperplasia at every visit in patients on medication.
	- Assess for signs of infection, including respiratory tract, skin, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections at every visit.
	- Perform an ophthalmological examination for glaucoma and cataract annually in patients on prednisolone.
	- Assess height/length, weight, and head circumference.

### Study protocol: Mycophenolate mofetil as maintenance therapy after rituximab treatment for childhood-onset, complicated, frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: A multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (JSKDC07) [^1112k92c]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most common chronic glomerular disease in children. Approximately 80–90% of patients with childhood INS have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and can achieve remission with steroid therapy, while the remainder have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Furthermore, around 50% of children with SSNS develop frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). Children with FRNS/SDNS are usually treated with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or mizoribine in Japan. However, 10–20% of children receiving immunosuppressive agents still exhibit frequent relapse and/or steroid dependence during or after treatment, defined as complicated FRNS/SDNS. Additionally, 30% of SRNS patients who achieve remission after treatments like cyclosporine are also identified as complicated FRNS/SDNS. For these complicated cases, rituximab (RTX) is currently utilized; nevertheless, recurrences after RTX treatment continue to be a challenge. Since long-term use of existing immunosuppressive drugs has limitations, there is a need for the development of novel treatments for maintenance therapy post-RTX. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug with fewer adverse effects than cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide. Crucially, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MMF in children with nephrotic syndrome.

- **Methods**: We conduct a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MMF.

### Evaluation of daily low-dose prednisolone during upper respiratory tract infection to prevent relapse in children with relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome: The PREDNOS 2 randomized clinical trial [^114CqrDs]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Key points**:

	- **Question**: In children with relapsing corticosteroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, does daily low-dose corticosteroid given at the time of upper respiratory tract infection prevent upper respiratory tract infection–related relapse?

	- **Findings**: In this randomized clinical trial of 365 children, daily low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in no difference in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infection–related relapses compared with placebo.

	- **Meaning**: Results of this study suggest that low-dose corticosteroid treatment is not beneficial as a strategy to prevent upper respiratory tract infection–related relapses.

### Tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil for frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome: A randomized clinical trial [^114eh23Q]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia, is the most prevalent glomerular disease in children, with an estimated incidence of 3 cases per 100,000 children annually. For more than half a century, steroids have been used as the main therapy for this disease. Most patients (85%-90%) who have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome achieve complete remission of proteinuria within 4 to 6 weeks of treatment with glucocorticoids; unfortunately, approximately half of these patients develop frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). Therefore, FRNS and SDNS pose significant challenges because of the necessity of monitoring both disease complications and the adverse effects of treatment.

Recently, the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) guidelines recommended the introduction of one of the following steroid-sparing agents (in alphabetical order) as the first-line therapy for children with FRNS or SDNS: calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, levamisole, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic sodium (grade A, strong recommendation). However, the guidelines do not recommend which steroid-sparing agents should be prioritized for use, and there is insufficient evidence to establish the optimal choice of these agents. Previous uncontrolled studies have indicated that tacrolimus (TAC) may be as effective as MMF. Therefore, we designed this prospective, multicenter, open-label, parallel-arm randomized clinical trial.

### Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes: Efficacy and limitations of current treatment strategies and future directions [^1145cMXx]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

There are several P2Y12 receptor antagonists under advanced clinical investigation, including prasugrel, ticagrelor (AZD6140), cangrelor, and elinogrel (PRT128). Prasugrel and ticagrelor are administered orally, cangrelor is for intravenous use, and elinogrel can be administered via both routes. Prasugrel is an irreversible agent, whereas ticagrelor, cangrelor, and elinogrel are reversible. All agents have increased potency and are associated with less response variability compared with clopidogrel. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs and the preclinical and early-phase clinical data go beyond the scope of this review and are described in detail elsewhere.

Encouraging clinical outcome data from large-scale phase III testing is available for prasugrel. Prasugrel is a third-generation thienopyridine that, like clopidogrel, selectively and irreversibly blocks the ADP P2Y12 receptor. However, prasugrel has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile because, compared with clopidogrel, it is more efficiently transformed into its active metabolite, leading to more prompt, potent, and predictable degrees of platelet inhibition as shown in numerous pharmacodynamic studies. This includes when compared with platelet inhibition associated with both high and maintenance dosing of clopidogrel. The clinical implications of these more favorable pharmacological properties were evaluated in the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38 (TRITON-TIMI 38).

Patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS) under 10 years old who relapse within six months after remission from the first episode are considered to be at high risk of frequently relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (FRSN). We therefore focus on the possibility that adding high-dose mizoribine to the standard prednisolone (PSL) treatment for steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) patients likely to shift to FRSN could prevent them from transitioning to FRSN. Here, we conduct a multicenter open randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PSL plus high-dose mizoribine treatment.

### Successful treatment of a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome with PCSK9 inhibitors: A case report [^111G8KX9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor evolocumab is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering drug with a new mechanism, which is currently available in Japan. Here, for the first time, we report the successful use of the PCSK9 inhibitor in a patient with refractory nephrotic syndrome.

- **Case presentation**: A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with minimal change-type nephrotic syndrome in October 2012. She received prednisolone (PSL) and cyclosporin A (CyA), but she experienced several cycles of relapse and remission and was hospitalized in May 2016 due to relapse. However, in spite of steroid pulse therapy and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration, her urinary protein level did not improve. We started her on evolocumab with the expectation of equivalent LDL-lowering effects as seen with LDL apheresis. After that, the LDL cholesterol level and UP/UC were concomitantly decreased, and the serum albumin was increased. This was maintained even when we reduced the PSL dose. This suggests that evolocumab clinically improves the nephrotic condition.

- **Conclusion**: No other report has described the use of evolocumab for nephrotic syndrome (NS) or its effect on similar nephrotic conditions. We believe that the findings presented here are unique and may be beneficial when treating similar cases.

### Platelet inhibition, endothelial function, and clinical outcome in patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction randomized to ticagrelor versus prasugrel maintenance therapy: Long-term follow-up of the REDUCE-MVI trial [^1115FLty]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The REDUCE-MVI trial reported no significant difference in platelet inhibition from the index event to 1-month follow-up between patients randomized to ticagrelor compared with prasugrel maintenance therapy. The loading dose of ticagrelor given to all patients in the acute setting could have led to a similar platelet inhibition in the acute phase, and because platelet inhibition in the acute and subacute setting was impaired, this could have diluted between-group differences.

In the long-term follow-up study, we demonstrated higher platelet inhibition at 1 year in the ticagrelor versus prasugrel group, which is in line with a large meta-analysis. A possible mechanism that could explain the higher platelet inhibition in the ticagrelor group is the 24-hour systemic exposure of a direct active compound of ticagrelor versus the short plasma exposure (2–4 hours) of the active metabolite of thienopyridines. Furthermore, ticagrelor is a direct-acting drug that binds reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor, while prasugrel is a prodrug that binds irreversibly to the P2Y12 receptor. In addition, ticagrelor inhibits platelet aggregation not only by P2Y12 antagonism but also via adenosine. In line with our findings, Perl et al. demonstrated an increased platelet reactivity in patients with STEMI randomized to prasugrel compared with ticagrelor in the acute setting and up to 1 month, which was confirmed in a randomized crossover pharmacodynamics study in stable patients. Consequently, one might speculate that ticagrelor, in comparison with prasugrel, offers advantages in…

### "Real-world" comparison of prasugrel with ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with percutaneous coronary intervention in the United States [^112wdgL1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Despite the differences in patient baseline characteristics between the treatment cohorts, PCI characteristics (number and type of stent or number of vessels treated) were fairly balanced between the prasugrel and ticagrelor-treated cohorts. This may suggest consistency in healthcare delivery to the overall ACS-PCI population, irrespective of antiplatelet agent selection or baseline clinical characteristics.

In line with the baseline differences in patient populations prescribed prasugrel compared with ticagrelor, results in unmatched cohorts showed significantly lower ischemic and bleeding outcomes associated with prasugrel at 30 and 90 days after the index hospital discharge compared to ticagrelor. After propensity matching, NACE, MACE, mortality, and major bleeding rates associated with prasugrel were non-inferior to rates associated with ticagrelor, meeting the primary objective of the study. Additionally, compared with ticagrelor, prasugrel was associated with significantly lower 30-day NACE and MACE. However, at 90 days, the difference in NACE was no longer significant in the primary population. The observation of early effectiveness with prasugrel through 30 days is consistent with results from the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial, where the difference between prasugrel and clopidogrel occurred early. This advantage may lessen over time, while the benefit with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in the PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial…

### Study protocol: High-dose mizoribine with prednisolone therapy in short-term relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome to prevent frequent relapse (JSKDC05 trial) [^115zRm8i]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this trial is to examine the efficacy and safety of high-dose mizoribine in preventing patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS), who show an early relapse within six months after initial remission, from shifting to frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS). One of the most noteworthy adverse events in patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) is the harmfulness of steroids, especially to those with FRNS/steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS). It has been clarified that a prolonged ISKDC steroid regimen for patients with SSNS did not shorten the relapse-free period. It is therefore reasonable to pursue new strategies to prevent patients with SSNS from shifting to FRNS.

Although immunosuppressants are considered as second-step drugs next to steroids, their use should be carefully decided due to severe side effects. Under such conditions, it is important to recognize predictive risk factors for FRNS. Previously, we clarified that a relapse within six months after initial treatment for NS is a predictive risk factor for FRNS. Development of an optional drug regimen for patients who have such a risk factor is therefore desirable. From this perspective, we focused on mizoribine and conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of adding optional mizoribine to patients with NS.

### Prasugrel [^1137CNEM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel reduced the occurrence of the primary composite endpoint compared to clopidogrel in both the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI populations. In patients who survived an on-study myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was also lower in the prasugrel group.

- **Patients with outcome events (CV death, MI, stroke) in TRITON-TIMI 38**:
	- The effect of prasugrel in various subgroups is shown in figures, and results are generally consistent across pre-specified subgroups, with the exception of patients with a history of TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.2)]. The treatment effect was driven primarily by a reduction in nonfatal MI. The effect in patients aged ≥ 75 years was also somewhat smaller, and the bleeding risk is higher in these individuals [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Subgroup analyses for time to first event of CV death, MI, or stroke (HR and 95% CI; TRITON-TIMI 38) – UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients**:
	- Analyses for patients aged ≥ 75 years with risk factors are included.

### Prasugrel [^111XZ3yU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Prasugrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets.

- **Mechanism of action**: Prasugrel produces inhibition of platelet aggregation to 20 μM or 5 μM ADP, as measured by light transmission aggregometry. Following a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel, approximately 90% of patients had at least 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation by 1 hour. Maximum platelet inhibition was about 80% (see Figure 2). Mean steady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was about 70% following 3 to 5 days of dosing at 10 mg daily following a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel.

	Figure 2: Inhibition (Mean ± SD) of 20 μM ADP-induced Platelet Aggregation (IPA) Measured by Light Transmission Aggregometry after Prasugrel 60 mg.

	Platelet aggregation gradually returns to baseline values over 5 to 9 days after discontinuation of prasugrel, this time course being a reflection of new platelet production rather than pharmacokinetics of prasugrel. Discontinuing clopidogrel 75 mg and initiating a prasugrel 10 mg maintenance dose with or without a prasugrel 60 mg loading dose results in a decrease of 14 percentage points in maximum platelet aggregation (MPA) by Day 7. This decrease in MPA is not greater than that typically produced by a 10 mg maintenance dose of prasugrel alone. The relationship between inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical activity has not been established.

- **5 mg in low body weight patients**: In patients with stable coronary artery disease, mean platel
