## Question

Causes of metabolic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of metabolic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and classification framework. Then, I should verify the high anion gap causes and their diagnostic approach. Next, I will examine non–anion gap causes and how to distinguish them. After that, I need to consider special populations and mixed disorders. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic algorithm and highlight key caveats and controversies, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental definition and classification, because everything else hinges on getting this right. Metabolic acidosis is a primary decrease in serum bicarbonate with a compensatory decrease in PaCO₂, and the first branch point in etiologic thinking is the anion gap, which separates high anion gap from non–anion gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis; I should double-check that this remains the standard approach across contemporary reviews and guidelines, and yes, it is consistently endorsed in nephrology primers and emergency medicine frameworks [^1117qBur] [^1164Bq47] [^115VvaKe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I anchor them. The three canonical mechanisms are increased acid production, decreased acid excretion, and loss of base (bicarbonate), and these map cleanly onto high anion gap, renal failure or RTA, and gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses, respectively; I should confirm that this triad is consistently used in authoritative reviews, which it is, including in emergency medicine and nephrology sources [^114wBZVk] [^1117qBur] [^115VvaKe].

> Next, I should review high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and I need to ensure I capture the most common and the most dangerous causes. Lactic acidosis is the most frequent in critical illness and arises from overproduction or underutilization of lactate, with type A linked to hypoxia/ischemia and type B to mitochondrial dysfunction or impaired clearance; ketoacidosis spans diabetic, alcoholic, and starvation forms; renal failure contributes via retained organic acids; and toxins such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and salicylates remain high-yield in the right context; I should confirm that these are the pillars of HAGMA teaching and that the anion gap remains a screening tool rather than a diagnostic test, which it is [^116kvqZe] [^111itEwi] [^115qd9am] [^1164Bq47] [^111Prjk7].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic adjuncts for HAGMA, because missing a toxic alcohol is costly. The osmolal gap helps detect unmeasured osmoles like methanol or ethylene glycol, and a gap-gap analysis (delta bicarbonate vs delta anion gap) can uncover mixed disorders; I should confirm that these are recommended in systematic approaches, and yes, they are standard in emergency medicine and nephrology curricula [^113XiPyq] [^117RHBSM] [^111QBddX].

> I will now examine non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, and I need to ensure I separate renal from gastrointestinal etiologies. Renal causes include distal RTA (impaired hydrogen secretion, often hypokalemic and stone-forming), proximal RTA (impaired bicarbonate reabsorption, often hypokalemic), and chronic kidney disease with reduced net acid excretion; gastrointestinal causes include diarrhea, ileostomy, and ureteral diversions that lose bicarbonate; I should confirm that these are the canonical buckets and that urine studies (pH, ammonium surrogates) help distinguish them, which they do [^114mKoyB] [^113qrZvM] [^114PbRS8] [^111Prjk7].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a medication that mimics RTA physiology. I should double-check drug-induced non–anion gap acidosis, particularly carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like topiramate and zonisamide, which cause renal bicarbonate wasting; FDA labeling documents consistently describe hyperchloremic, non–anion gap metabolic acidosis with these agents, and clinicians should maintain vigilance for additive effects in patients with CKD or diarrhea [^117RHBSM] [^115vKWcS] [^1159T4KR].

> Let me consider special populations and mixed disorders, because these often trip up clinicians. In CKD, metabolic acidosis becomes more prevalent as eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and is associated with bone disease, muscle catabolism, and possibly progression; guidelines suggest treating when bicarbonate is below about 18 mmol/L, though high-quality RCT evidence is limited, so I should be cautious and monitor for sodium load and blood pressure effects; in pediatrics, acidosis impairs growth and alkali therapy can improve linear growth; in the ICU, mixed high and non–anion gap acidoses are common, and unmeasured anions may contribute substantially to the gap; I should confirm these points against KDIGO and critical care literature, which support them [^116SEoax] [^112n9THX] [^114U6hS1] [^113uTM3c] [^112uVzdG].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic algorithm and make sure I don't skip steps. Start with history, exam, and basic labs including electrolytes, bicarbonate, and an ABG to confirm metabolic acidosis and assess compensation; calculate the anion gap and, if elevated, pursue HAGMA causes (lactate, ketones, renal function, toxins, osmolal gap, gap-gap); if non–anion gap, assess renal acidification with urine pH and, when needed, urine anion gap or other ammonium surrogates to distinguish RTA from gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss; I should confirm that this stepwise approach is consistent with contemporary reviews, which it is [^113XiPyq] [^113qrZvM] [^114PbRS8].

> Hold on, I should verify key caveats so I don't overstate certainty. The anion gap has limitations: it can be confounded by albumin, paraproteins, and lab artifacts, and a normal gap does not exclude significant acidosis; conversely, a markedly low or negative gap should prompt me to check for analytical errors or unusual anions; also, not all metabolic acidoses are equal in prognostic impact, and lactate-associated acidosis carries high mortality largely as a disease severity marker rather than a direct causal effect, so I need to treat the underlying cause rather than chase pH normalization alone [^111MVjpb] [^111FjRKB] [^113uTM3c].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent and clinically actionable. Metabolic acidosis arises from increased acid production, decreased acid excretion, or base loss, and the anion gap efficiently partitions etiologies into high anion gap (think lactate, ketoacids, renal failure, toxins) versus non–anion gap (think RTA, CKD, gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses), with drug effects like topiramate/zonisamide as important iatrogenic contributors; a disciplined, stepwise approach anchored in history, basic labs, and targeted urine studies resolves most cases, while recognizing mixed disorders and special populations prevents misclassification and guides timely, cause-directed therapy [^1117qBur] [^113XiPyq] [^115VvaKe].

---

Metabolic acidosis arises from **three mechanisms**: increased acid production (e.g. lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure), loss of bicarbonate (e.g. diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis), or impaired renal acid excretion (e.g. chronic kidney disease, distal renal tubular acidosis) [^1117qBur] [^115VvaKe]. The **anion gap** distinguishes high anion gap causes (lactate, ketones, toxins, renal failure) from non–anion gap causes (gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss, renal tubular acidosis, acetazolamide, topiramate) [^115oS1GG] [^113XiPyq]. Accurate diagnosis relies on history, electrolytes, blood gas, and urine studies, and management focuses on treating the underlying cause while correcting acid-base disturbances as indicated [^113XiPyq] [^114xe442].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Metabolic acidosis results from **three principal mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Increased acid production | Overproduction of endogenous acids overwhelms buffering capacity | - Lactic acidosis <br/> - Ketoacidosis (DKA, AKA, starvation) <br/> - Renal failure (uremic acids) [^1117qBur] [^111itEwi] [^115qd9am] |
| Loss of bicarbonate | Gastrointestinal or renal bicarbonate losses reduce buffering capacity | - Diarrhea <br/> - Renal tubular acidosis <br/> - Acetazolamide <br/> - Topiramate [^115UYjsu] [^114mKoyB] [^117RHBSM] |
| Impaired renal acid excretion | Kidney fails to excrete hydrogen ions or regenerate bicarbonate | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Distal renal tubular acidosis [^116SEoax] [^114mKoyB] |

---

## Classification by anion gap

The **anion gap** (AG) is central to classifying metabolic acidosis:

- **High anion gap (HAG) metabolic acidosis**: Accumulation of unmeasured anions (lactate, ketones, sulfates, phosphates, organic acids) [^115oS1GG].
- **Non–anion gap (NAG) metabolic acidosis**: Bicarbonate loss with chloride retention, yielding hyperchloremic acidosis [^113qrZvM].

---

## High anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA)

Common causes include:

- **Lactic acidosis**: Type A (hypoxic) from tissue hypoperfusion; Type B (non-hypoxic) from mitochondrial dysfunction, sepsis, malignancy, or drugs [^116kvqZe] [^114RPu15].
- **Ketoacidosis**: Diabetic (DKA), alcoholic (AKA), starvation [^111itEwi] [^115qd9am].
- **Renal failure**: Accumulation of organic acids (uremic acids) [^1164Bq47].
- **Toxins**: Methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates, acetaminophen, propylene glycol, toluene, metformin (rare) [^1164Bq47] [^111QBddX] [^1152sZf6].

---

## Non–anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA)

Common causes include:

- **Gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss**: Diarrhea, ileostomy, ureterosigmoidostomy, pancreatic fistula [^115UYjsu] [^114PbRS8].
- **Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)**: Distal (type 1), proximal (type 2), hyperkalemic (type 4) [^114mKoyB].
- **Medications**: Acetazolamide, topiramate, zonisamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibition) [^117RHBSM] [^115vKWcS].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Reduced net acid excretion, often mild to moderate [^1128dyGX].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History and examination**: Identify symptoms, exposures, comorbidities, and medication use [^114xe442].
- **Laboratory tests**: Electrolytes, bicarbonate, lactate, renal function, glucose, ketones, osmolal gap, urine pH, urine anion gap [^113XiPyq] [^113qrZvM].
- **Anion gap calculation**: AG = [Na⁺] − ([Cl⁻] + [HCO₃⁻]); normal 8–12 mEq/L [^115oS1GG].
- **Osmolal gap**: Elevated in toxic alcohols, DKA, AKA, renal failure [^111QBddX].
- **Urine studies**: pH, anion gap, ammonium to assess renal acidification [^113qrZvM].

---

## Clinical consequences

Metabolic acidosis has **significant clinical effects**:

- **Cardiovascular**: Reduced cardiac output, vasodilation, hypotension, arrhythmias [^1117qBur].
- **Respiratory**: Compensatory hyperventilation (Kussmaul respirations) [^1117qBur].
- **Neurological**: Confusion, lethargy, coma [^1117qBur].
- **Musculoskeletal**: Muscle catabolism, bone demineralization [^1117qBur].
- **Metabolic**: Insulin resistance, impaired growth [^1113Jr1J] [^114U6hS1].

---

## Management principles

Management centers on **treating the underlying cause** and correcting acid-base disturbances:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Sepsis control, insulin for DKA, fluids for dehydration, antidotes for toxins, stop offending drugs [^111itEwi] [^115qd9am] [^117RHBSM].
- **Bicarbonate therapy**: Controversial; consider for severe acidemia (pH < 7.1–7.2) or specific indications (e.g. hyperkalemia, some toxin ingestions) [^115qNaVZ] [^11494PBZ].
- **Dialysis**: For severe acidosis with renal failure, toxin removal, or refractory cases [^1117b1Qf] [^11494PBZ].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent reassessment of acid-base status, electrolytes, and clinical response [^notfound].

---

Metabolic acidosis arises from increased acid production, bicarbonate loss, or impaired renal acid excretion, and is classified by the anion gap. Accurate diagnosis and management require a structured approach, with therapy focused on the underlying cause and careful correction of acid-base disturbances.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115kCUEP]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis occurs in a number of diseases and even certain normal activities such as heavy exercise. It arises from increased endogenous acid production, exogenous acid (or acid-precursor) administration, base losses, and depression of renal acid secretion. Although the magnitude of acidosis is important, the ultimate pathophysiological impact of any metabolic acidosis is defined by the rate of change and the specific cause of the acidosis. This review discusses whole body, organ, and cellular effects of metabolic acidosis, its diagnosis by pathophysiologic categories, and treatment. The diagnosis is made by a synthesis of the clinical history, physical examination, other hematological values, serum and urinary chemistries, and arterial blood gases and electrolytes. Calculation of the anion and osmolal gaps can be effectively used to further narrow the diagnostic possibilities. Supportive care and therapy directed at the cause of the metabolic acidosis are the mainstays of treatment, since most acidotic states will spontaneously correct once the initiating cause is removed or reversed. Theoretical and clinical evidence are discussed for alkalinizing agents, whose use remains controversial except in the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with hyperkalemia and certain drug or toxin ingestions.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1152N3eJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

### Differential diagnosis of metabolic acidosis [^114wBZVk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^115vbAsB]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Accumulating evidence identifies acidosis not only as a consequence of, but as a contributor to, kidney disease progression. Several mechanistic pathways have been identified in this regard. The dietary acid load, even in the absence of overt acidosis, may have deleterious effects. Several small trials now suggest that the treatment of acidosis with oral alkali can slow the progression of kidney disease.

### Metabolic acidosis and the role of unmeasured anions in critical illness and injury [^112uVzdG]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are frequently present in critically ill patients. Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased mortality, but it is unclear whether as a marker of the severity of the disease process or as a direct effector. The understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base derangements has evolved over time, and several theories and models for precise quantification and interpretation have been postulated during the last century. Unmeasured anions are the footprints of dissociated fixed acids and may be responsible for a significant component of metabolic acidosis. Their nature, origin, and prognostic value are incompletely understood. This review provides a historical overview of how the understanding of the metabolic component of acid-base disorders has evolved over time and describes the theoretical models and their corresponding tools applicable to clinical practice, with an emphasis on the role of unmeasured anions in general and several specific settings.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

### The continuum of acid stress [^113t7fRM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acid-related injury from chronic metabolic acidosis is recognized through growing evidence of its deleterious effects, including kidney and other organ injury. Progressive acid accumulation precedes the signature manifestation of chronic metabolic acidosis, decreased plasma bicarbonate concentration. Acid accumulation that is not enough to manifest as metabolic acidosis, known as eubicarbonatemic acidosis, also appears to cause kidney injury, with exacerbated progression of CKD. Chronic engagement of mechanisms to mitigate the acid challenge from Western-type diets also appears to cause kidney injury. Rather than considering chronic metabolic acidosis as the only acid-related condition requiring intervention to reduce kidney injury, this review supports consideration of acid-related injury as a continuum. This "acid stress" continuum has chronic metabolic acidosis at its most extreme end, and high-acid-producing diets at its less extreme, yet detrimental, end.

### Approach to metabolic acidosis in the emergency department [^116KTcQ8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders should be considered a process with the goal being to treat the patient and the underlying condition, not the numbers. A good understanding of the normal acid-base regulation in the body, as well as the most common derangements can prepare the emergency physician for this very common disorder that presents on every shift.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^112JNrCa]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is a common phenomenon in the Western world. We have provided several ways for clinicians to test for metabolic acidosis and strategies to neutralise a high dietary acid load. A greater emphasis on low-grade metabolic acidosis should be provided during medical school so that clinicians are more aware of this condition and how to treat it.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO₃⁻ concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na⁺] − ([HCO₃⁻] + [Cl⁻]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Unmeasured anions in metabolic acidosis: unravelling the mystery [^116uJP48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, metabolic acidosis is a common observation and, in clinical practice, the cause of this derangement is often multi-factorial. Various measures are often employed to try and characterise the aetiology of metabolic acidosis, the most popular of which is the anion gap. The purpose of the anion gap can be perceived as a means by which the physician is alerted to the presence of unmeasured anions in plasma that contribute to the observed acidosis. In many cases, the causative ion may be easily identified, such as lactate, but often the causative ion(s) remain unidentified, even after exclusion of the 'classic' causes. We describe here the various attempts in the literature that have been made to address this observation and highlight recent studies that reveal potential sources of such hitherto unmeasured anions.

### Metabolic acid-base disorders [^114xe442]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acid-base disturbances are frequently encountered in the emergency department, and many of these patients are critically ill. In the evaluation of patients with these maladies, it is important for the emergency clinician to determine the cause, which can usually be elicited from a thorough history and physical examination. There are several mnemonics that can be used to form an appropriate list of potential causes. Most of the time, the management of these patients requires no specific treatment of the acid-base status but, rather, requires treatment of the underlying disorder that is causing the acid-base disturbance.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112n9THX]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 — Metabolic acidosis management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 1. classification and pathophysiology [^115RbJd4]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidaemia (pH < 7.35 not primarily related to hypoventilation) is common amongst the critically ill and it is essential that clinicians caring for such patients have an understanding of the common causes. The exclusive elimination routes of volatile (carbon dioxide), organic (lactic and ketone) and inorganic (phosphate and sulphate) acids mean compensation for a defect in any one is limited and requires separate provision during critical illness. We discuss the models available to diagnose metabolic acidosis including CO₂/HCO₃⁻ and physical chemistry-derived (Stewart or Fencl-Stewart) approaches, but we propose that the base excess and anion gap, corrected for hypoalbuminaemia and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia, remain most appropriate for clinical usage. Finally we provide some tips for interpreting respiratory responses to metabolic acidosis and how to reach a working diagnosis, the consequences of which are considered in Part 2 of this review.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^11494PBZ]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have reviewed the recent clinical data on epidemiology and management of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is common in the ICU, and even moderate metabolic acidosis carries higher mortality than severe sepsis. Sodium bicarbonate or RRT is used occasionally to normalize acid–base imbalance due to metabolic acidosis in the ICU; however, high-quality evidence is still limited. Patients with severe metabolic acidosis and stage 2 or 3 AKI might be a possible target population for sodium bicarbonate administration. Further clinical trials are required to provide more robust information in a clinically relevant patient population.

### Metabolic acidosis and subclinical metabolic acidosis in CKD [^116qSfvZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is not uncommon in CKD and is linked with bone demineralization, muscle catabolism, and higher risks of CKD progression and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines recommend maintaining serum total CO₂ at ≥ 22 mEq/L to help prevent these complications. Although a definitive trial testing whether correcting metabolic acidosis improves clinical outcomes has not been conducted, results from small, single-center studies support this notion. Furthermore, biologic plausibility supports the notion that a subset of patients with CKD have acid-mediated organ injury despite having a normal serum total CO₂ and might benefit from oral alkali before overt acidosis develops. Identifying these individuals with subclinical metabolic acidosis is challenging, but recent results suggest that urinary acid excretion measurements may be helpful. The dose of alkali to provide in this setting is unknown as well. The review discusses these topics and the prevalence and risk factors of metabolic acidosis, mechanisms of acid-mediated organ injury, results from interventional studies, and potential harms of alkali therapy in CKD.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^1158pCfH]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with CKD develop metabolic acidosis due to reduced kidney mass and defects in renal acid excretion. Chronic metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD and appears to contribute to the progression of kidney disease. High dietary acid intake has also been demonstrated to worsen kidney function by induction of metabolic acidosis and/or subclinical acid retention. The factors that have been implicated in this effect of acidosis on CKD progression include ammonia-induced activation of the alternative complement system, as well as increased endothelin and aldosterone production. Existing evidence from clinical trials suggests that alkali therapy could retard the progression of CKD. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be a reasonable alternative to alkali therapy for patients with mild metabolic acidosis and without hyperkalemia. However, definitive evidence is lacking for optimal evidence-based practice guidelines. Ongoing trials will hopefully facilitate more evidence-based treatment of metabolic acidosis in the future.

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of chronic disease: a 21st century public health crisis [^114vEL3o]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining metabolic acidosis

Acidemia, or too much acid in the blood, only occurs when the body's buffering capacity can no longer maintain a normal pH level. A normal blood pH is considered to be 7.35–7.45. However, even at a normal blood pH metabolic acidosis can occur. In fact, once the blood pH falls below 7.4, there is usually acid retention in the body and low-grade metabolic acidosis. However, the blood pH does not drop below the normal range until metabolic acidosis has become severe. Once this occurs it is usually referred to as 'metabolic acidosis' by the clinician. However, this is actually acidemia (or too much acid in the blood). Thus, someone with a low blood pH has likely had low-grade metabolic acidosis for years or more likely decades.

Low-grade metabolic acidosis is something that many people in the Western world have. Low-grade means there are no apparent or noticeable harms but the body is retaining acid, depleting bicarbonate stores and damage is occurring in numerous tissues in the body. Typically, with low-grade metabolic acidosis, the blood pH drops slightly, as does the bicarbonate levels, but they will still be in the 'normal' range. Thus, if blood pH and/or bicarbonate levels are at the lower end of normal this is highly suggestive that someone has metabolic acidosis.

With low-grade metabolic acidosis, the total blood buffering capacity is reduced and thus a greater reliance on muscle, bone and connective tissue will be required for the elimination of additional acid. The harms of low-grade metabolic acidosis increase with age and decreasing kidney function as the kidneys ability to excrete acid goes down. The increase in the acid load in the body worsens kidney function over the long run. For example, chronic metabolic acidosis leads to nephron hypertrophy in the kidneys of animals. This is likely due to the toxic effects that ammonia has on the kidneys. Metabolic acidosis can also lead to an increased loss of sodium and potassium in the urine, as well as an increased loss of water increasing the risk of dehydration. In addition, metabolic acidosis can cause magnesium and calcium loss out the urine.

### Acid-base imbalance in pulmonary edema… [^116M7BXH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Respiratory acidosis resulting from carbon dioxide retention which complicates obstructive lung disease has been extensively investigated during the past two decades. Its therapy now commands a wide range of techniques and apparatus which have become standard equipment in most hospitals. Metabolic acidosis caused by lactate accumulation in the blood during hypoxia is well recognized. 1 Less well appreciated are the recently described respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis which complicate pulmonary edema. In 1965 Anthonisen and Smith2 reported on four patients with acute pulmonary edemia in whom both respiratory and metabolic acidosis were sufficiently severe to require treatment. They suggested that respiratory acidosis was caused by carbon dioxide retention due to airway obstruction or collapse by edema fluid, and that concomitant metabolic acidosis was due to lactate accumulation secondary to hypoxia in poorly perfused tissue.

A later report by Agostoni3 noted both metabolic and respiratory acidosis — the former predominating — in. Acid-Base Imbalance in Pulmonary Edema. JAMA. 1971;

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a chronic condition that many people in the Western world have but do not realise it. It occurs when there is retention of acid in the body, which leads to a depletion in the bicarbonate stores of the body. The term metabolic acidosis is typically used when referring to low blood pH or acidemia due to a metabolic abnormality. However, this is inappropriate as most cases of metabolic acidosis do not have acidemia. In fact, a low blood pH is typically one of the last surrogate markers to become abnormal in those with low-grade metabolic acidosis. This is because the body maintains a normal blood pH at the expense of bicarbonate reserves. Metabolic acidosis primarily occurs inside the cell and in the fluid that surrounds our tissues (interstitial fluid). When checking for metabolic acidosis the clinician should look at fasting serum bicarbonate, urinary pH (with a measurement at least 4 hours separated from the last ingested meal) and 24-hour urinary citrate levels. While there is not a universally accepted way to diagnose low-grade metabolic acidosis, this paper will help to give the clinician insights into checking for this condition in their patients.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^115h2Xfw]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is one of the four cardinal acid-base disorders and perhaps the least well understood by students. Taking a mechanistic approach to etiologies and management can be very helpful in such cases. Particularly, one should focus on the factors that generate the alkalosis (source of fluid loss and composition, less commonly alkali administration) and the factors (extracellular fluid volume status, hormonal systems) that maintain the abnormality.

KDIGO 2024 — Evidence base for treating metabolic acidosis in CKD: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. A 2021 systematic review identified 15 trials with ≥ 3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m² and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no study medication; of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 were published since 2012, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important modifying effect on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

### Posttransplant metabolic acidosis: a neglected factor in renal transplantation? [^1161jeHF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The occurrence and pathogenesis of metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation is reviewed. Posttransplant acidosis is shown to be a key mechanism for major metabolic complications in mineral and muscle metabolism, and for anemia, discussed in the context of both acidosis and renal transplantation.

Recent Findings

Continuous improvement in kidney transplant survival has shifted attention to long-term outcomes, specifically to disorders linked to cardiovascular disease, physical capacity and quality of life. Metabolic acidosis is gaining growing acceptance as a clinical entity and has occasionally come into focus in the context of renal transplantation. The possible link to metabolic disturbances resulting in impairment of musculoskeletal disorders and physical limitations, however, has not been considered specifically.

Summary

Available evidence suggests a high prevalence of (compensated) metabolic acidosis after renal transplantation, presenting as low serum bicarbonate and impaired renal acid excretion. This condition is associated with relevant disorders in mineral metabolism and muscle function. Current knowledge about the effects of acidosis on renal electrolyte handling, mineral metabolism and protein synthesis suggests that acid/base derangements contribute to the muscle and bone pathology, as well as anemia, encountered after kidney transplantation. Consequently, posttransplant acidosis may be a relevant factor in the causal pathway of impaired physical capacity observed in this patient group.

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis.

### Ileal neobladder: an important cause of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis [^112pmYb7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis for a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is probably less well known than the differential diagnosis for an anion gap metabolic acidosis. One etiology of a non-anion gap acidosis is the consequence of ileal neobladder urinary diversion for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Case Report

We present a case of a patient with an ileal neobladder with a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by a urinary tract infection and ureteroenterostomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Part of the ileal neobladder surgery includes ureteroenterostomy and predisposes patients to several clinically significant metabolic derangements, including a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These patients have an increased chronic acid load, bicarbonate deficit, and hypokalemia, which should be appreciated when resuscitating these patients.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic acidosis arises from a fundamental disturbance of acid–base balance and is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Optimal cell, tissue and organ function requires the maintenance of hydrogen ion (H⁺) concentration within a physiologic range, which for serum is 35–45 nM (pH 7.46–7.35). The dynamic process leading to a net gain of H⁺ in body fluids is called acidosis. When acidosis is due to a gain of 'fixed acid' H⁺ (as opposed to the gain of 'volatile' H⁺ because of accumulation of carbon dioxide gas, causing respiratory acidosis) and this H⁺ gain decreases the metabolic component of the acid–base equilibrium, bicarbonate (HCO₃), it is called metabolic acidosis. If the amount or rate of added H⁺ exceeds normal excretory capacity or if H⁺ excretory capacity is reduced as in CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), metabolic acidosis becomes chronic. Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is approximately 15–19% in CKD stage 3–5 patients, with metabolic acidosis affecting approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH₄⁺ concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO₃⁻ excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

Chronic kidney disease metabolic acidosis — trial evidence and certainty: The Work Group has not provided a graded recommendation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scale RCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justified because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-benefit adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations.

Of the 15 trials (2445 participants, median follow-up 12 months), 1 new trial has been published since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a low number of outcomes, and meta-analyses restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not confirm any important kidney effect of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54–1.22).

### Metabolic acidosis of CKD: diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment [^1128dyGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is noted in the majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 20% to 25% of normal, although as many as 20% of individuals can have acid-base parameters close to or within the normal range. Acidosis generally is mild to moderate in degree, with plasma bicarbonate concentrations ranging from 12 to 22 mEq/L (mmol/L), and it is rare to see values less than 12 mEq/L (mmol/L) in the absence of an increased acid load. Degree of acidosis approximately correlates with severity of renal failure and usually is more severe at a lower GFR. The metabolic acidosis can be of the high-anion-gap variety, although anion gap can be normal or only moderately increased even with stage 4 to 5 CKD. Several adverse consequences have been associated with metabolic acidosis, including muscle wasting, bone disease, impaired growth, abnormalities in growth hormone and thyroid hormone secretion, impaired insulin sensitivity, progression of renal failure, and exacerbation of beta 2 -microglobulin accumulation. Administration of base aimed at normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentration might be associated with certain complications, such as volume overload, exacerbation of hypertension, and facilitation of vascular calcifications. Whether normalization of plasma bicarbonate concentrations in all patients is desirable therefore requires additional study. In the present review, we describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of metabolic acidosis, discuss potential adverse effects, and address benefits and complications of therapy.

### Metabolic acidosis… [^112VXs2f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fuller Albright and his associates1, 2 believed that metabolic acidosis was the initiating disturbance in the development of bone disease in both renal tubular acidosis and chronic azotemic renal failure. In their view, the impairment in renal acid excretion common to these two conditions caused obligatory losses of calcium in the urine, an initial fall in serum calcium concentration, and thus stimulation of parathyroid hormone secretion. The two conditions differed in that the phosphaturic action of parathyroid hormone caused the serum phosphorus level to fall below normal levels in renal tubular acidosis, while the serum phosphorus concentration remained above normal if the glomerular filtration rate was significantly reduced. Thus, they attributed the osteomalacia of renal tubular acidosis to impaired mineral deposition in osteoid because of a lower than normal product of calcium with phosphorus in the serum.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^116HnEKA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is lactic acidosis harmful for cardiovascular function?

Regulation of the intracellular and extracellular pH of cardiac or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is essential for the maintenance of a stable hemodynamic status. As alluded to above, regardless of the mechanism involved, lactate generation in shock states leads to a drop in intracellular and extracellular pH and most often to hemodynamic failure. Whether this severe lactic acidosis is a causal contributor to multiple organ failure or simply a biomarker of the patient's critical state remains an ongoing debate. In this situation, severe lactic acidosis in experimental studies always causes negative effects on cardiovascular function while its correction negates its protective effects. Again, no human study has so far clearly replicated these same experimental findings.

In the following sections, the hemodynamic consequences of lactic acidosis at both the cellular and functional level are described. However, a cautious interpretation must be made of the available data. In fact, a large portion of the published experimental data used non-organic acid to induce metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the number of relevant and published studies centered on the effects of acidosis induced by an accumulation of extracellular lactate reducing SID and lowering extracellular pH by proton generation is somewhat limited. By hypothetical reasoning, it is usually accepted that the effects of lactic acidosis may overlap with those of metabolic acidosis. Nevertheless, in the following sections, the manner in which acidosis is induced will be specified for each included reference; that is, the hypoxic lactic acidosis model (LAM) or non-organic acidosis model (NOAM). It is likely that some of the hemodynamic effects reported in hypoxic LAMs are also induced in part by hypoxia. However, the latter remains the most widely used model to induce an endogenous and homogenous shock-associated lactic acidosis. In addition, when acidosis is induced via NOAM, the cited text will systematically carry the mention that the study involved metabolic acidosis including lactic acidosis.

### The relationship between anti-seizures medications and metabolic acidosis in craniotomy operations: is topiramate or zonisamide the cause of metabolic acidosis? [^1124GNka]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Metabolic acidosis, whether acute or chronic, can have significant clinical consequences. It has been linked to impaired brain metabolism and cerebral blood flow, which may be of particular concern in neurosurgical patients. Possible side effects of acute metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, delirium, and joint-muscle pain. Severe acute metabolic acidosis can lead to respiratory failure, reduced cardiac output, hypotension, arrhythmias, increased seizure activity, and coma.

Intraoperative and postoperative metabolic acidosis can be caused by topiramate and zonisamide. To stabilize intraoperative hemodynamics, it is important to inquire about the ASMs used in the preoperative evaluation in terms of mortality and morbidity. Prior to intracranial surgery, it is important to evaluate the interchangeability of these drugs with the guidance of an epileptologist and implement a treatment plan. It is also important to consider postoperative intensive care follow-up for patients using zonisamide and topiramate ASMs. It is evident that larger multicentre studies are required to gain further insight into this subject.

### Bicarbonate therapy in severe metabolic acidosis [^115qNaVZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of bicarbonate administration to patients with severe metabolic acidosis remains controversial. Chronic bicarbonate replacement is obviously indicated for patients who continue to lose bicarbonate in the ambulatory setting, particularly patients with renal tubular acidosis syndromes or diarrhea. In patients with acute lactic acidosis and ketoacidosis, lactate and ketone bodies can be converted back to bicarbonate if the clinical situation improves. For these patients, therapy must be individualized. In general, bicarbonate should be given at an arterial blood pH of ≤ 7.0. The amount given should be what is calculated to bring the pH up to 7.2. The urge to give bicarbonate to a patient with severe acidemia is apt to be all but irresistible. Intervention should be restrained, however, unless the clinical situation clearly suggests benefit. Here we discuss the pros and cons of bicarbonate therapy for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114U6hS1]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in children — metabolic acidosis prevalence, effects, and guidance are summarized as: In the CKiD and 4C studies, 38%–60% of children had a serum bicarbonate of < 22 mmol/l, and low bicarbonate was associated with increased risk of disease progression; for younger children, the normal range for sodium bicarbonate is as low as 17 mmol/l. In children, metabolic acidosis is also likely to cause growth retardation, and observational CKiD data revealed that prepubertal children with acidosis who were treated with alkali had improved growth. The KDOQI guideline on bone metabolism for children with CKD recommends the prevention of acidosis in children to optimize growth, and there have not been any trials examining the effect of bicarbonate supplementation on CKD progression in children.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H⁺ transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO₂ can be considered.

KDIGO AKI — potassium and metabolic acidosis considerations explain that when therapeutic measures that promote the intracellular shift of potassium are exhausted, an excess of potassium can only be eliminated with RRT, and using intermittent dialysis after such measures reduces extracorporeal potassium removal with a more pronounced post‑treatment rebound. For acidosis, metabolic acidosis associated with AKI can usually be corrected with bicarbonate and should rarely require urgent dialysis if not accompanied by volume overload or uremia; because pH and bicarbonate values to initiate dialysis are not supported by evidence, no standard criteria for initiating dialysis for acidosis exist, while some poisonings can contribute to acid‑base problems and RRT may facilitate removal of the offending drug.

### Topiramate [^117RHBSM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### Lactic acidosis update for critical care clinicians [^113kkZht]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a broad-anion gap metabolic acidosis caused by lactic acid overproduction or underutilization. The quantitative dimensions of these two mechanisms commonly differ by 1 order of magnitude. Overproduction of lactic acid, also termed type A lactic acidosis, occurs when the body must regenerate ATP without oxygen (tissue hypoxia). Circulatory, pulmonary, or hemoglobin transfer disorders are commonly responsible. Overproduction of lactate also occurs with cyanide poisoning or certain malignancies. Underutilization involves removal of lactic acid by oxidation or conversion to glucose. Liver disease, inhibition of gluconeogenesis, pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine) deficiency, and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation are the most common causes. The kidneys also contribute to lactate removal. Concerns have been raised regarding the role of metformin in the production of lactic acidosis, on the basis of individual case reports. The risk appears to be considerably less than with phenformin and involves patients with underlying severe renal and cardiac dysfunction. Drugs used to treat lactic acidosis can aggravate the condition. NaHCO₃ increases lactate production. Treatment of type A lactic acidosis is particularly unsatisfactory. NaHCO₃ is of little value. Carbicarb is a mixture of Na₂CO₃ and NaHCO₃ that buffers similarly to NaHCO₃ but without net generation of CO₂. The results from animal studies are promising; however, clinical trials are sparse. Dichloroacetate stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase and improves laboratory values, but unfortunately not survival rates, among patients with lactic acidosis. Hemofiltration has been advocated for the treatment of lactic acidosis, on the basis of anecdotal experiences. However, kinetic studies of lactate removal do not suggest that removal can counteract lactate production in any meaningful way. The ideal treatment is to stop acid production by treating the underlying disorder.

### Alcoholic ketoacidosis: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^115qd9am]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is defined by metabolic acidosis and ketosis in a patient with alcohol use. This is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED) and requires targeted therapies.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of AKA for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

AKA is frequently evaluated and managed in the ED. The underlying pathophysiology is related to poor glycogen stores and elevated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and hydrogen. This results in metabolic acidosis with elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. Patients with AKA most commonly present with a history of alcohol use (acute or chronic), poor oral intake, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ketoacidosis on laboratory assessment. Patients are generally dehydrated, and serum glucose can be low, normal, or mildly elevated. An anion gap metabolic acidosis with ketosis and electrolyte abnormalities are usually present on laboratory evaluation. Management includes fluid resuscitation, glucose and vitamin supplementation, electrolyte repletion, and evaluation for other conditions.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician knowledge of the evaluation and management of AKA is essential in caring for these patients.

### Zonisamide [^115vKWcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Consideration of alternative causes of lactic acidosis: thiamine deficiency in malignancy [^112nzUo8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common metabolic acidosis characterized by increased serum lactate and is usually associated with a decreased blood pH. Lactic acidosis has many different causes but has been differentiated into type A, hypoxic causes, and type B, non-hypoxic causes. Tissue hypoxia, type A, is the most common cause, usually secondary to processes such as sepsis and multi-organ failure. Type A must be differentiated from type B in the correct clinical setting as treatments are vastly different. Type B causes may include drug side-effects, toxins, enzymatic defects, inherited or acquired, any of which may lead to overproduction or underutilization of lactate. However, as most clinicians are more familiar, and likely more initially concerned with hypoxic etiologies, evaluation is directed toward finding the source of hypoperfusion or hypoxia, and thus generally leading to a delay in discovering a type B cause (or mixed type A and type B). Here we describe a case of lactic acidosis in the setting of thiamine deficiency thought to be secondary to advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the clinician to consider other causes of lactic acidosis when evaluating a patient.

### Zonisamide (Zonegran) [^111Qa3rG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with ZONEGRAN, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### Renal tubular acidosis: core curriculum 2025 [^114mKoyB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidoses (RTAs) are a subset of non-anion gap metabolic acidoses that result from complex disturbances in renal acid excretion. Net acid excretion is primarily accomplished through the reclamation of sodium bicarbonate and the buffering of secreted protons with ammonia or dibasic phosphate, all of which require a series of highly complex and coordinated processes along the renal tubule. Flaws in any of these components lead to the development of metabolic acidosis and/or a failure to compensate fully for other systemic acidoses. Identification and diagnosis of RTA can be challenging, and the consequences of untreated RTA can be life-threatening. The use of serum and urinary indices can help elucidate the kidney's capacity to respond to acidemia, characterize these disturbances further, and guide treatment.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO₃⁻] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### Renal tubular acidosis [^111jr1sU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal tubular acidosis should be suspected in poorly thriving young children with hyperchloremic and hypokalemic normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, with/without syndromic features. Further workup is needed to determine the type of renal tubular acidosis and the presumed etiopathogenesis, which informs treatment choices and prognosis. The risk of nephrolithiasis and calcinosis is linked to the presence (proximal renal tubular acidosis, negligible stone risk) or absence (distal renal tubular acidosis, high stone risk) of urine citrate excretion. New formulations of slow-release alkali and potassium combination supplements are being tested that are expected to simplify treatment and lead to sustained acidosis correction.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113qwkTi]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An inconsistent relationship has been reported between acid–base abnormalities, their treatment, and outcomes in critically ill patients. Some studies have suggested an independent association between low pH or standard base excess (SBE) and mortality, whereas others have not.

We have recently shown that hemodynamically stable rats with sepsis become hypotensive after infusion of dilute HCl. Similarly we have found decreased survival time in rats with elevated serum chloride levels that were exposed to lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide, as well as different cytokine responses to acidosis induced by lactate or HCl in cell cultures. We therefore propose that the etiologic anion of metabolic acidosis (lactate, chloride, or others) may be a more important determinant of outcome than the pH itself.

Although lactic acidosis has attracted considerable study in critically ill patients, metabolic acidosis can result from a variety of conditions. Although the existing literature does not suggest a strong relationship between the type of acidosis and outcome, traditional methods of classifying and analyzing acid–base abnormalities have significant limitations, especially in critically ill patients. In particular, studies have usually failed to identify the effects that causative anions (for example lactate, chloride, or all others) have on their resulting pH and SBE. Data may be reported as 'non-lactate metabolic acidosis' or 'anion gap metabolic acidosis' without identifying a predominant source. By using a physical–chemical approach to quantify unmeasured anions accurately, coupled with multivariable logistic regression, we believe that a more rigorous characterization of acid–base disorders and their clinical significance can be achieved. Our objective was to determine the effect of different etiologies of metabolic acidosis on hospital mortality and length of stay in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. The hypothesis was that the various etiologies of metabolic acidosis have unique mortality and morbidity rates associated with them.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: subgroup analysis from a randomized, controlled trial [^114pVP3d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can accelerate CKD progression, bone demineralization and muscle protein catabolism;
patients with diabetes are prone to metabolic acidosis and functional limitations; and
few interventions for patients with diabetes and CKD have successfully improved quality of life or physical functioning.

What this study adds?

Veverimer effectively treated metabolic acidosis in patients with diabetes and CKD; and
veverimer significantly improved how patients with diabetes and CKD felt and functioned.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

This study shows that treatment of metabolic acidosis is among the very few clinical interventions other than kidney replacement therapy that improves how patients with CKD feel and function. As a result, clinicians might more aggressively look for and treat metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, a complication that is highly under-treated presently; and
improved physical function from treating metabolic acidosis holds promise to allow patients with CKD to better perform activities of daily living and increase their employability, a recognition that might encourage policy makers to incentivize treatment of metabolic acidosis.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Primary distal renal tubular acidosis: toward an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis [^112LKo1s]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The term classic, type 1 renal tubular acidosis or primary distal renal tubular acidosis is used to designate patients with impaired ability to excrete acid normally in the urine as a result of tubular transport defects involving type A intercalated cells in the collecting duct. The clinical phenotype is largely characterized by the complications of chronic metabolic acidosis (MA): stunted growth, bone abnormalities, and nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis that develop as the consequence of hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. All these manifestations are preventable with early and sustained correction of MA with alkali therapy. The optimal target for plasma bicarbonate should be as close as possible to the range considered normal by current standards (between 23 and 28 mEq/L.). Most of the benefits of alkali therapy are tangible early in the course of the disease in childhood, but life-long treatment is required to prevent the vast array of complications attributable to chronic MA.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^111m1uBD]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a process caused by an increase in weak acids or a decrease in strong ion difference (SID). Serum proteins, albumin, and inorganic phosphate are considered as weak acids. Strong ions, such as Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and Cl⁻, exist at a fully ionized status in body fluids. SID is the presence of an excess of strong cations over strong anions, and the normal value in plasma is 42 mEq/l. The method to quantify metabolic acidosis using SID and weak acids was introduced by Stewart in the 1980s and still creates debate in its clinical application. Plasma base excess is widely used to identify a metabolic component of acidosis in clinical practice. The base excess approach was shown to be equivalent to Stewart's SID approach in quantifying acid–base status in critically ill patients.

Metabolic acidosis is classified into acute and chronic. Although it is not clearly defined, acute metabolic acidosis occurs within a few days. Chronic acidosis is a condition that lasts for weeks or even years. In this chapter, we focus on acute metabolic acidosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and provide an update from recently published clinical studies.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

### Renal tubular acidosis in the neonate [^113s7jPo]. NeoReviews (2024). Medium credibility.

See Bonus NeoBriefs videos and downloadable teaching slides Metabolic acidosis can manifest in the neonatal period and cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonates. Preterm infants are at an even higher risk of developing metabolic acidosis. If the acidosis results from a dysfunction of acid-base homeostasis by the renal system, the disorder is known as renal tubular acidosis (RTA). In this review, we will describe renal development and normal acid-base homeostasis by the renal system. We will also discuss the pathophysiology of the different types of RTA, laboratory findings to aid in diagnosis, and treatment considerations. Understanding RTA will help neonatal clinicians recognize and diagnose an infant affected by RTA and initiate treatment in a timely manner.

### Assessing acid-base disorders [^113pxn1N]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Effective management of acid-base disorders depends on accurate diagnosis. Three distinct approaches are currently used in assessing acid-base disorders: the physiological approach, the base-excess approach, and the physicochemical approach. There are considerable differences among the three approaches. In this review, we first describe the conceptual framework of each approach, and comment on its attributes and drawbacks. We then highlight the application of each approach to patient care. We conclude with a brief synthesis and our recommendations for choosing an approach.

### Topiramate spinkle (Topiramate) [^113sE6HW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

This study thus raises the question about what is hoped to be achieved when initially investigating possible DKA in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia and then to determine whether this has resulted in a significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse, namely, if there is a metabolic acidosis present, whether ketonemia is its major (or only) source and then to determine if hyperglycemia also exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists, although acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation and, as previously pointed out, some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases. In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~ 17%) with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18mmol/L were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8) or ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9) or both (n = 5).

### Low-grade metabolic acidosis as a driver of insulin resistance [^1113Jr1J]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

However, one such study has already been performed. Indeed, when using the hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamp technique (the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance), experimentally inducing metabolic acidosis has been proven to induce glucose intolerance. Indeed, metabolic acidosis caused a significant decrease in tissue insulin sensitivity by 32% and tissue sensitivity to exogenous insulin by 15%. Fasting insulin levels also increased, despite normal glucose concentrations, indicating insulin resistance. These harms occurred when blood pH decreased from 7.42 to 7.37, which is still considered a normal blood pH (7.35–7.45). However, serum bicarbonate decreased from 24 to 19 mEq/L (below the normal range of bicarbonate, 23–29 mEq/L, indicating low-grade metabolic acidosis). To summarise, human studies have confirmed that inducing low-grade metabolic acidosis induces insulin resistance using the gold-standard glucose clamp techniques and that correcting this metabolic acidosis improves insulin sensitivity.

Summary of the effects of acidosis on insulin resistance

Experimentally inducing metabolic acidosis in humans impairs glucose metabolism and cellular insulin sensitivity.
Correcting metabolic acidosis in humans improves insulin sensitivity.
Metabolic acidosis reduces the binding of insulin to receptors on adipocytes and induces insulin resistance in muscle.
Metabolic acidosis increases the production of cortisol, which reduces insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and fat cells.
Mild metabolic acidosis reduces the binding of insulin to its receptor and downstream intracellular insulin signalling in myoblasts and adipocytes.
A low pH decreases the expression of the insulin sensitiser adiponectin, which is a hormone that improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.
Leptin secretion is downregulated in adipocytes exposed to a low pH medium, whereas sodium bicarbonate administration to people with renal-induced acidosis increases serum leptin levels.

### Acid-base disturbances in gastrointestinal disease [^115UYjsu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Disruption of normal gastrointestinal function as a result of infection, hereditary or acquired diseases, or complications of surgical procedures uncovers its important role in acid-base homeostasis. Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis may occur, depending on the nature and volume of the unregulated losses that occur. Investigation into the specific pathophysiology of gastrointestinal disorders has provided important new insights into the normal physiology of ion transport along the gut and has also provided new avenues for treatment. This review provides a brief overview of normal ion transport along the gut and then discusses the pathophysiology and treatment of the metabolic acid-base disorders that occur when normal gut function is disrupted.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^111kSWbh]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Imbalances of the acid-base state and particularly metabolic acidosis are common problems in critically ill patients. To further investigate the underlying causes, analysis of the acid-base state and determination of plasma and urine electrolytes are crucial. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided in conditions with either high serum anion gap (SAG) or normal SAG according to the classic model of metabolic acid-base disorders. The SAG is the difference in the measured cations (Na⁺, K⁺) and anions (Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻) in serum.

High SAG is typical for the occurrence of unmeasured anions (for example ketones, lactate, metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, phosphate) where HCO₃⁻ is consumed via its action as a buffer. High SAG metabolic acidosis is seen in ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, intoxication and acute renal failure.

Metabolic acidosis with normal SAG - hyperchloremic acidosis - is characterized by the replacement of bicarbonate with chloride caused by extrarenal or renal bicarbonate disposal or a dysfunction in renal H⁺ secretion. Hyperchloremic acidosis is typically seen in bicarbonate wasting due to diarrhea, urine-gut diversions, intestinal or pancreatic fistulae, surgical drains or renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

The analysis of the urine osmolal gap (UOG) is necessary to further differentiate these conditions. The UOG represents the difference of the directly measured urine osmolality to an estimate of the urine osmolality derived from the urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea nitrogen, and glucose concentrations.

A UOG - as an approximate measure of unmeasured urine ammonium salts - of less than 150 mosmol/kg in combination with a preserved renal function is characteristic for altered urine acidification typical for RTA, while a UOG of more than 150 mosmol/kg suggests extrarenal bicarbonate loss.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^115gPdzD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol.l −1 with a PaCO₂ ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### Respiratory alkalosis [^115XQaNN]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory alkalosis is an extremely common and complicated problem affecting virtually every organ system in the body. This article reviews the various facets of this interesting problem. Respiratory alkalosis produces multiple metabolic abnormalities, from changes in potassium, phosphate, and calcium, to the development of a mild lactic acidosis. Renal handling of the above ions is also affected. The etiologies may be related to pulmonary or extrapulmonary disorders. Hyperventilation syndrome is a common etiology of respiratory alkalosis in the emergency department setting and is a diagnosis by exclusion. There are many cardiac effects of respiratory alkalosis, such as tachycardia, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and ischemic and nonischemic chest pain. In the lungs, vasodilation occurs, and in the gastrointestinal system there are changes in perfusion, motility, and electrolyte handling. Therapeutically, respiratory alkalosis is used for treatment of elevated intracranial pressure. Correction of a respiratory alkalosis is best performed by correcting the underlying etiology.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114qBo4m]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Not all metabolic acidoses are the same. In our cohort study, each type of metabolic acidosis had a different mortality associated with it. There was increased mortality associated with lactate and unidentified anions (SIG). Metabolic acidosis (both lactic and non-lactic) seems to be associated with high mortality and increased length of stay in hospital and in the ICU. Like that of lactate, monitoring of SIG seems warranted and this can be simplified by the use of an anion gap normalized to the patient's albumin and phosphate concentrations.

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Metabolic alkalosis [^114PTywk]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary pathophysiologic event characterized by the gain of bicarbonate or the loss of nonvolatile acid from extracellular fluid. The kidney preserves normal acid-base balance by two mechanisms: bicarbonate reclamation, mainly in the proximal tubule, and bicarbonate generation, predominantly in the distal nephron. Bicarbonate reclamation is mediated mainly by a Na⁺-H⁺ antiporter and to a smaller extent by the H⁺-ATPase (adenosine triphosphate-ase). The principal factors affecting HCO₃⁻ reabsorption include effective arterial blood volume, glomerular filtration rate, chloride, and potassium. Bicarbonate regeneration is primarily affected by distal Na⁺ delivery and reabsorption, aldosterone, arterial pH, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. To generate metabolic alkalosis, either a gain of base or a loss of acid must occur. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal tract or via the kidney. Excess base may be gained by oral or parenteral HCO₃⁻ administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate administration. Factors that help maintain metabolic alkalosis include decreased glomerular filtration rate, volume contraction, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and aldosterone excess. Clinical states associated with metabolic alkalosis are vomiting, mineralocorticoid excess, the adrenogenital syndrome, licorice ingestion, diuretic administration, and Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes. The effects of metabolic alkalosis on the body are variable and include effects on the central nervous system, myocardium, skeletal muscle, and liver. Treatment of this disorder is simple, once the pathophysiology of the cause is delineated. Therapy consists of reversing the contributory factors that are promoting the alkalosis and, in severe cases, administration of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, acid infusion, and low bicarbonate dialysis.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Renal tubular acidosis: a new look at an old problem [^112W5wUZ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Although the definition of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is simple, understanding the physiologic basis underlying the various types of this clinical entity is much more difficult. The pathophysiology of this disorder is reviewed using the normal acid-base functions of the involved segments of the nephron as a guide to understanding. Clinical and laboratory features of the subtypes of RTA are addressed, and diagnosis and treatment discussed. New developments in the knowledge and understanding of the associated growth disturbances, mineral metabolism, and molecular biology of RTA are also reviewed to provide the most current view of this relatively common pediatric entity.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^1152sZf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1151jCXe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### Metformin-induced lactic acidosis: no one left behind [^114JtgXm]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Metformin is a safe drug when correctly used in properly selected patients. In real life, however, associated lactic acidosis has been repeatedly, although rarely, reported. The term metformin-induced lactic acidosis refers to cases that cannot be explained by any major risk factor other than drug accumulation, usually due to renal failure. Treatment consists of vital function support and drug removal, mainly achieved by renal replacement therapy. Despite dramatic clinical presentation, the prognosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis is usually surprisingly good.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114qeCd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.
