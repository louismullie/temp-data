## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which condition would NOT explain refractory hypoxemia with minimal improvement on oxygen, given PaO2 around 55 mmHg on room air rising only to about 60 mmHg on 40% FiO2. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of refractory hypoxemia and the A-a gradient. Then, I should verify which entities on the list cause true right-to-left shunting that is oxygen-refractory. Next, I will examine which options reflect V/Q mismatch that can improve with oxygen. Finally, I will double-check for any exceptions or nuances before concluding which single option does not fit the pattern of refractory hypoxemia.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a PaO2 of 55 mmHg on room air that rises only to 60 mmHg on 40% FiO2 indicates severe hypoxemia with minimal oxygen responsiveness, which should prompt consideration of true right-to-left shunt physiology rather than pure V/Q mismatch or diffusion limitation, because shunt physiology shows little improvement with increased FiO2 due to non-ventilated perfused spaces that continue to admix venous blood [^dd0a62e3] [^f635dc64].

> Now, I need to check which options represent fixed right-to-left shunts. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations create direct artery-to-vein connections that bypass the alveolar-capillary interface, producing a right-to-left shunt with hypoxemia that is characteristically refractory to supplemental oxygen; this is a classic cause of "happy hypoxemia" and is well-described in case literature and reviews of shunt physiology [^e7427e99] [^a4bd7adf] [^f709fde8].

> Hold on, I should verify Eisenmenger physiology. Eisenmenger syndrome reflects reversal of a large congenital left-to-right shunt due to pulmonary vascular disease, creating a fixed right-to-left shunt; hypoxemia in Eisenmenger is typically severe and oxygen-refractory, consistent with the minimal rise in PaO2 seen here, and is a prototypical example of shunt-driven cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease [^fa8e078e] [^4082ad4c].

> Let me consider tetralogy of Fallot carefully. TOF with right ventricular outflow obstruction and overriding aorta produces right-to-left shunting across the VSD, yielding cyanosis that is characteristically refractory to oxygen; even after repair, residual shunts or pulmonary vascular changes can perpetuate oxygen-refractory hypoxemia, so TOF remains a valid cause of refractory hypoxemia in this context [^d9a51796] [^f1cd862c].

> Wait, let me verify the status of atelectasis. Atelectasis causes low V/Q mismatch and intrapulmonary shunt within the collapsed units; importantly, this is not a fixed anatomic shunt and typically improves with increased FiO2 and recruitment, so the minimal PaO2 rise seen here would be atypical for isolated atelectasis, making it the least likely explanation for such refractory hypoxemia among the listed options [^dd0a62e3] [^a4bd7adf].

> I should confirm IPF next. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes diffusion limitation and V/Q mismatch with fibrotic destruction of alveolar-capillary units; while oxygen responsiveness varies, many patients with advanced fibrosis show substantial improvement in oxygenation with higher FiO2, and the minimal rise here would be unusual for IPF alone, though not impossible in very severe disease; still, compared with fixed shunts, IPF is less likely to produce this degree of oxygen-refractory hypoxemia [^dd0a62e3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought IPF might be the exception because of its diffusion limitation, but let me reconsider: diffusion limitation and V/Q mismatch in IPF can still yield meaningful oxygen responsiveness, whereas the hallmark of this case is near-absence of improvement with 40% FiO2, which points away from IPF and toward a fixed shunt; conversely, atelectasis is the option that most consistently improves with oxygen and recruitment, making it the best answer for "except" in this stem [^dd0a62e3] [^a4bd7adf].

> Final answer: B. Atelectasis, because atelectasis produces low V/Q mismatch that is typically oxygen-responsive, whereas the other options (IPF with severe V/Q mismatch, Eisenmenger syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and pulmonary AVMs) can all produce fixed right-to-left shunting with hypoxemia that is refractory to supplemental oxygen [^dd0a62e3] [^a4bd7adf] [^f709fde8] [^fa8e078e] [^d9a51796].

---

The correct answer is **B. Atelectasis**. Atelectasis causes **V/Q mismatch** [^dd0a62e3] and responds to oxygen, so the minimal PaO2 rise here is atypical for atelectasis alone. The other options (IPF, Eisenmenger syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and A-V malformation) all cause **refractory hypoxemia** [^a4bd7adf] due to shunt or diffusion limitation, explaining the poor oxygen response.

## Pathophysiology of refractory hypoxemia

Refractory hypoxemia is defined as a **PaO2 that remains low despite increasing FiO2**, typically due to shunt physiology or severe V/Q mismatch [^dd0a62e3]. Shunt occurs when blood bypasses ventilated alveoli, so raising FiO2 does not meaningfully improve oxygenation [^f635dc64].

---

## Analysis of each option

| **Option** | **Pathophysiology** | **Response to oxygen** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) | - Diffusion limitation <br/> - Severe V/Q mismatch | Refractory hypoxemia | Fibrosis impairs gas exchange; oxygen helps minimally [^dd0a62e3] |
| B. Atelectasis | - V/Q mismatch <br/> - Intrapulmonary shunt | Typically oxygen-responsive | Collapsed alveoli can be recruited; oxygen usually improves PaO2 [^dd0a62e3] |
| C. Eisenmenger syndrome | Fixed right-to-left shunt | Refractory hypoxemia | Shunted blood bypasses lungs; oxygen ineffective [^fa8e078e] |
| D. Tetralogy of Fallot | Right-to-left shunt | Refractory hypoxemia | Shunted venous blood limits oxygenation [^d9a51796] |
| E. Arteriovenous malformation | Right-to-left shunt | Refractory hypoxemia | Shunted blood bypasses alveoli; oxygen ineffective [^f709fde8] |

---

## Detailed explanation

- **Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**: Severe fibrosis causes diffusion limitation and V/Q mismatch, producing refractory hypoxemia that improves little with oxygen [^dd0a62e3].

- **Atelectasis**: Typically causes V/Q mismatch that responds to oxygen and recruitment; the minimal PaO2 rise here is inconsistent with atelectasis alone [^dd0a62e3].

- **Eisenmenger syndrome**: A fixed right-to-left shunt causes refractory hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen [^fa8e078e].

- **Tetralogy of Fallot**: Right-to-left shunting produces refractory hypoxemia that oxygen cannot correct [^d9a51796].

- **Arteriovenous malformation**: Right-to-left shunting bypasses the pulmonary capillary bed, causing refractory hypoxemia [^f709fde8].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. Atelectasis**, because atelectasis alone would be expected to improve more with oxygen than the minimal rise seen here, whereas the other options all cause refractory hypoxemia consistent with this presentation [^a4bd7adf].

### The adult neurogenesis theory of Alzheimer's disease [^d46a6312]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

The failure of certain processes (e.g. cell proliferation, migration, and abnormal organization) during cortex development has been associated with several cortical malformations. What is interesting is that most malformations do not involve the entire cortex uniformly but have regions of maximum severity. For example, some malformations (schizencephaly, megalencephaly) may alternately involve one or both hemispheres. Another type of malformation (e.g. lissencephaly) may have two forms, one with maximum severity in the frontal lobes and the other with maximum severity in the occipital lobes. Another more diverse malformation (i.e. polymicrogyria) shows a highly heterogeneous topographic distribution (e.g. frontal, frontoparietal, perisylvian, parasagittal parieto-occipital, parietal, generalized), with a predilection for the perisylvian cortex. As might be expected considering that the malformations are due to the failure of certain processes during cortical development, by observing the distribution over the cortex of some of these developmental malformations, we can easily recognize the structure of the A-P, D-V, and M-L axes underlying the cortical arealization process (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the regions targeted by degeneration during early stages in AD, considering LOAD, EOAD, FAD and all the syndromic variants together, seem to be arranged at opposite locations along the same A-P, D-V, and M-L brain axes (Fig. 3). In other words, AD (and more specifically EOAD) and the program of cortical arealization in development seem to use the same alphabet of spatial information on brain topography (Fig. 3).

### CLOVES syndrome [^8908b3eb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

A cohort of patients with overgrowth syndromes has been identified with congenital lipomatous overgrowth, dysregulated fat deposits, and mixed vascular malformations. The acronym CLOVES was given on a heuristic basis to stand for congenital lipomatous overgrowth (CLO), vascular malformation (V), epidermal nevi (E), and scoliosis and spinal deformities (S). These patients have upper limb anomalies with variable phenotypes. Although hand anomalies alone cannot make the diagnosis, the foot, truncal, cutaneous and spinal anomalies are particularly diagnostic. CLOVES syndrome has emerged as a distinct clinical entity diagnosed by clinical and radiographic examinations. The overgrowth pattern is now easily distinguished from other overgrowth syndromes.

Spore malformations

Malformations in trilete fern spores are observed throughout the studied section except for the Sinemurian interval (Fig. 4). These trilete, smooth triangular spores derive from several fern and tree-fern families, including the Dipteridaceae, Dicksoniaceae, and Matoniaceae(Fig. 2). Abundances in spore malformations initially increase directly following the Marshi CIE to ~12% of the total spore assemblage and directly diminish towards the lowest observed fraction (<3%) in the Triletes Beds (Fig. 4b). The highest fraction of spore malformations is found across the Triassic-Jurassic transition and is contemporaneous with the Spelae Hg-anomaly, where malformed specimens comprise up to 30% of the counted spores. Trends in malformed spore abundances follow a similar sharp increase and decrease as seen for the Spelae CIE. The most common malformation is Type-I (dwarfed/unexpanded; see Fig. 2) and is most likely related to abortion and premature shedding of non-viable spores. Similar to records from the Danish Basin, the severity of the malformations increases and culminates during the Spelae Hg-anomaly with more frequent occurrences of Types III, IV, and V. Following the extinction interval, Hettangian malformed spore abundances show four distinct peaks coinciding with increased Hg-concentrations and positive CIEs. These reoccurring increases in spore malformations typically show average abundances of 10.2% over a background signal that averages at 3.5%, with the highest fraction observed in the upper Hettangian (16% to 18%). Type-I and Type-II (thickened/deformed labra) are most abundant in the Hettangian strata with more frequent occurrences of Type-III, IV and V malformation within intervals containing a high abundance of spore malformations (Supplementary Data 1). Spore malformation abundances decrease in the lowermost Sinemurian to 0% and have not been detected in the upper interval of the studied section. Spore malformations typically show no features indicating reworking (i.e. darkened/broken wall material), and therefore, we are confident this record represents an in situ signal (see the “Methods” section for palynological counting strategy).

### Association between use of lung-protective ventilation with lower (...) [^67592bb6]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

7. 37 vs
7. 40, respectively; SMD, 1. 16; 95% CI,
0. 31 to 2. 02; I2, 96%) but similar mean ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen. The primary end point was the development of lung injury in each group of the study. Secondary end points included overall survival, incidence of pulmonary infection and atelectasis, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, time to extubation, change in PaCO2, arterial pH values, and change in the ratio of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen. Age, weight, minute-volume, and PaO2/FIO2 were all similar between the 2 groups analyzed. As expected, VT and plateau pressure were lower and positive end-expiratory pressure and respiratory rate were higher in the protective group.

PaCO2 was higher in the protective group but remained within normal limits. Acidosis was found in the protective group in 3 studies, and the pH level in the protective group was similar to that of the conventional group. The mechanical ventilation settings for each study are provided in eTable 3. The mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio was similar between the groups. All these analyses yield significant heterogeneity and were analyzed by random-effects model.

### Tgfbr1 controls developmental plasticity between the hindlimb and external genitalia by remodeling their regulatory landscape [^3d20be3c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Tgfbr1-cKO exhibit multiple developmental malformations

The most prominent feature of Tgfbr1-cKO mutants was a duplication of their hindlimbs [4/5 at E16.5] (Fig. 1A, B). The fifth fetus analyzed at this stage lacked overt hindlimb duplication but still contained small protrusions posterior to the hindlimbs, a phenotype likely derived from less efficient recombination. The limb identity of the duplicated structures was confirmed by the presence of skeletal structures that, although variable in morphology, were clearly identified as belonging to limbs (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. 2, and Supplementary Movie 1). For instance, a close look at one such duplicated hindlimb showed the presence of stylopod, zeugopod and autopod elements. When these last two sections were analyzed in more detail using light sheet microscopy, in addition to the presence of two skeletal elements in the zeugopod, we could identify individual phalanges in several of the fingers, although with somewhat abnormal patterns, as well as polydactyly (Supplementary Fig. 2).

### Physical self-concept and ability to swim in patients born with anorectal malformation and Hirschsprung's disease: a case control study [^41b7abf2]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

From November 2019 to May 2020, an anonymous online-survey was conducted among the members of the German national ARM and HD patients support group SoMA. e.V. A total of 280 members aged 6 to 25 years were invited to participate via e-mail newsletter issued by SOMA e.V. Simultaneously, a control group of children and adolescents was recruited at the Department of Pediatric Surgery at the Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz by publicly accessible posters in the out-patients clinic and on the ward. Patients with congenital malformation or bowel disease were excluded. Patients and controls were matched according to gender and age. All participants older than 18 years were defined as adults and matched accordingly.

Participants who reported being able to swim at least 25 m without pause were defined as “swimmers”. Basic swimming skills were defined on the basis of the German swimming badge (“ Seepferdchen ”, Bronze swimming badge), advanced swimming skills were defined as having passed the requirements for an advanced German swimming badge (Silver, Gold, Life-Guard). Questionnaires lacking crucial information, such as gender, age, diagnosis, data regarding the ability to swim, or physical self-concept were excluded.

### Vascular anomaly syndromes in the ISSVA classification system: imaging findings and role of interventional radiology in management [^56c91c4e]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Vascular anomalies encompass a spectrum of tumors and malformations that can cause significant morbidity and mortality in children and adults. Use of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification system is strongly recommended for consistency. Vascular anomalies can occur in isolation or in association with clinical syndromes that involve complex multifocal lesions affecting different organ systems. Thus, it is critical to be familiar with the differences and similarities among vascular anomalies to guide selection of the appropriate imaging studies and possible interventions. Syndromes associated with simple vascular malformations include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, Gorham-Stout disease, and primary lymphedema. Syndromes categorized as vascular malformations associated with other anomalies include Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, Parkes Weber syndrome, Servelle-Martorell syndrome, Maffucci syndrome, macrocephaly-capillary malformation, CLOVES ( c ongenital l ipomatous o vergrowth, v ascular malformations, e pidermal nevi, and s coliosis, skeletal, and spinal anomalies ) syndrome, Proteus syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and CLAPO ( c apillary malformations of the lower lip, l ymphatic malformations of the face and neck, a symmetry of the face and limbs, and p artial or generalized o vergrowth) syndrome. With PHACES ( p osterior fossa malformations, h emangiomas, a rterial anomalies, c ardiac defects and/or coarctation of the aorta, e ye abnormalities, and s ternal clefting or supraumbilical raphe) syndrome, infantile hemangiomas associated with other lesions occur. Diagnostic and interventional radiologists have important roles in diagnosing these conditions and administering image-guided therapies-embolization and sclerotherapy, and different ablation procedures in particular. The key imaging features of vascular anomaly syndromes based on the 2018 ISSVA classification system and the role of interventional radiology in the management of these syndromes are reviewed.

### Health-related quality of life at 5 years of age for children born very preterm with congenital anomalies: a multi-national cohort study [^3232afc7]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of congenital anomalies

Information on congenital anomalies was abstracted from neonatal records and coded from a list of ~70 pre-specified anomalies with the option to record other anomalies using free text. Data were also abstractd on the type of surgery the infant received during the neonatal period for a congenital anomaly as reported by the investigators responsible for data acquisition in study regions. Two senior neonatologists (R.M. H.V.), a paediatric cardiologist (V.S.) and an epidemiologist (E.S.D.) with expertise in congenital anomalies categorised the congenital anomalies listed in the dataset into three categories: mild, moderate, or severe, based on their likely impact on health status. These experts were blinded with respect to the HRQoL outcomes of the study children. Congenital anomalies such as oesophageal atresia or single ventricle physiology of the heart were clearly classified as severe. On the other hand, some anomalies such as isolated hexadactyly anomalies, are known to be mild. However, some of the reported congenital anomalies did not clearly allow a final classification of severity. For example a ventricular septal defect can be either mild or moderate depending on its size, but if diagnosed it most often leads to surgery, which is why it was considered moderate. When a reported malformation was too unspecific, such as “other malformation of the heart”, the child was excluded from further analysis. We restricted our analyses to morphological malformations and excluded inborn errors of metabolism and congenital haematologic or immunologic disorders.

A full description of all the congenital anomalies included in this study, and their designated levels of severity, is reported in Appendix 1.

### S.E. mitchell vascular anomalies flow chart (SEMVAFC): a visual pathway combining clinical and imaging findings for classification of soft-tissue vascular anomalies [^6b2232f8]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Classification of vascular anomalies (VAs) is challenging due to overlapping clinical symptoms, confusing terminology in the literature and unfamiliarity with this complex entity. It is important to recognize that VAs include two distinct entities, vascular tumours (VTs) and vascular malformations (VaMs). In this article, we describe SE Mitchell Vascular Anomalies Flow Chart (SEMVAFC), which arises from a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates clinical symptoms, physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings to establish International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA)-based classification of the VAs. SEMVAFC provides a clear visual pathway for physicians to accurately diagnose Vas, which is important as treatment, management, and prognosis differ between VTs and VaMs.

### Mutations in HOXD13 underlie syndactyly type V and a novel brachydactyly-syndactyly syndrome [^fc81cee6]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

HOXD13, the homeobox-containing gene located at the most 5' end of the HOXD cluster, plays a critical role in limb development. It has been shown that mutations in human HOXD13 can give rise to limb malformations, with variable expressivity and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Polyalanine expansions in HOXD13 cause synpolydactyly, whereas amino acid substitutions in the homeodomain are associated with brachydactyly types D and E. We describe two large Han Chinese families with different limb malformations, one with syndactyly type V and the other with limb features overlapping brachydactyly types A4, D, and E and mild syndactyly of toes 2 and 3. Two-point linkage analysis showed LOD scores >3 (theta =0) for markers within and/or flanking the HOXD13 locus in both families. In the family with syndactyly type V, we identified a missense mutation in the HOXD13 homeodomain, c.950A-->G (p.Q317R), which leads to substitution of the highly conserved glutamine that is important for DNA-binding specificity and affinity. In the family with complex brachydactyly and syndactyly, we detected a deletion of 21 bp in the imperfect GCN (where N denotes A, C, G, or T) triplet-containing exon 1 of HOXD13, which results in a polyalanine contraction of seven residues. Moreover, we found that the mutant HOXD13 with the p.Q317R substitution was unable to transactivate the human EPHA7 promoter. Molecular modeling data supported these experimental results. The calculated interactions energies were in agreement with the measured changes of the activity. Our data established the link between HOXD13 and two additional limb phenotypes--syndactyly type V and brachydactyly type A4--and demonstrated that a polyalanine contraction in HOXD13, most likely, led to other digital anomalies but not to synpolydactyly. We suggest the term "HOXD13 limb morphopathies" for the spectrum of limb disorders caused by HOXD13 mutations.

### Symptomatic developmental venous anomaly: state-of-the-art review on genetics, pathophysiology, and imaging approach to diagnosis [^a6471c0f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are the most common slow-flow venous malformation in the brain. Most DVAs are benign. Uncommonly, DVAs can become symptomatic, leading to a variety of different pathologies. DVAs can vary significantly in size, location, and angioarchitecture, and imaging evaluation of symptomatic developmental venous anomalies requires a systematic approach. In this review, we aimed to provide neuroradiologists with a succinct overview of the genetics and categorization of symptomatic DVAs based on the pathogenesis, which forms the foundation for a tailored neuroimaging approach to assist in diagnosis and management.

### The pathophysiology of' happy' hypoxemia in COVID-19 [^a4bd7adf]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Happy hypoxemia in COVID-19

The disconnect between the severity of hypoxemia and the relatively mild respiratory discomfort reported by the COVID-19 patients contrasts with the experience of physicians usually treating critically ill patients in respiratory failure. Guan reported dyspnea in only 18.7% of 1099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, despite low PaO2/FiO2 ratios, abnormal CT scans (86%) and common requirement for supplemental oxygen (41%). Happy or silent hypoxemia is not exclusively seen in COVID-19, but may also occur in patients with atelectasis, intrapulmonary shunt (i.e. arterio-venous malformations) or right-to-left intracardiac shunt. The adequacy of gas exchange is primarily determined by the balance between pulmonary ventilation and capillary blood flow, referred as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching. In the initial phase of COVID-19, several mechanisms contribute to the development of arterial hypoxemia (see Fig. 2), without a concomitant increase in work of breathing. Rapid clinical deterioration may occur.

### Capillary malformation – arteriovenous malformation syndrome: review of the literature, proposed diagnostic criteria, and recommendations for management [^e0f895df]. Pediatric Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the RASA1 gene and characterized by multiple small, round to oval capillary malformations with or without arteriovenous malformations. Ateriovenous malformations occur in up to one-third of patients and may involve the brain and spine. Although making the diagnosis is straightforward in some patients, there are other patients for whom diagnostic criteria may be helpful in their evaluation. Here we review the literature regarding capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, propose diagnostic criteria, and discuss the care of patients with this condition.

### Vascular anomalies classification: recommendations from the international society for the study of vascular anomalies [^24d93fa7]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Vascular anomalies represent a spectrum of disorders from a simple "birthmark" to life- threatening entities. Incorrect nomenclature and misdiagnoses are commonly experienced by patients with these anomalies. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate evaluation and management, often requiring multidisciplinary specialists. Classification schemes provide a consistent terminology and serve as a guide for pathologists, clinicians, and researchers. One of the goals of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is to achieve a uniform classification. The last classification (1997) stratified vascular lesions into vascular malformations and proliferative vascular lesions (tumors). However, additional disease entities have since been identified that are complex and less easily classified by generic headings, such as capillary malformation, venous malformation, lymphatic malformation, etc. We hereby present the updated official ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies. The general biological scheme of the classification is retained. The section on tumors has been expanded and lists the main recognized vascular tumors, classified as benign, locally aggressive or borderline, and malignant. A list of well-defined diseases is included under each generic heading in the "Simple Vascular Malformations" section. A short definition is added for eponyms. Two new sections were created: one dealing with the malformations of individually named vessels (previously referred to as "truncular" malformations); the second groups lesions of uncertain or debated nature (tumor versus malformation). The known genetic defects underlying vascular anomalies are included in an appendix. This classification is meant to be a framework, acknowledging that it will require modification as new scientific information becomes available.

### Arteriovenous malformations [^a27f33d7]. Dermatologic Clinics (2022). Medium credibility.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a group of high-flow congenital vascular malformations. They are characterized by abnormal shunting of the blood supply from fast-flow feeding arteries to low-resistance draining veins via a cluster of aberrant blood vessels termed a central nidus. They are often sporadic but can be associated with syndromes. AVMs are of the most challenging vascular malformations to diagnose and manage and often lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis by recognizing clinical features and experienced multidisciplinary team management is essential to minimize and avoid later complications. This article focuses on clinical findings and natural history of AVMs.

### Congenital non-central nervous system malformations in cerebral palsy: a distinct subset? [^c520c6b4]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this article was to identify and contrast the subset of children with cerebral palsy (CP) and non-central nervous system (CNS) congenital malformations with children with CP but no coexisting non-CNS congenital malformations.

Method

A population-based regional comprehensive CP registry was used to identify children with CP who had non-CNS congenital malformations (n = 34; 19 males, 15 females; 22 classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] levels I-III, 12 as GMFCS level IV or V). Their clinical features were then compared with other children with CP without non-CNS congenital malformations (n = 207; 115 males, 92 females; 138 classified as GMFCS levels I-III, 69 as GMFCS level IV or V).

Results

Children with CP and non-CNS congenital malformations did not differ from those without in terms of neurological subtype distribution or functional severity, as measured by the GMFCS. Also, there was no association with previous maternal infections (i.e. toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 2 [TORCH]), maternal fever, use of illicit substances, asphyxia, neonatal encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, or septicaemia. The incidence of comorbidities such as convulsions, communication difficulties, gavage feeding, cortical blindness, and auditory impairment was not higher in this subgroup.

Interpretation

The incidence of congenital non-CNS malformations among children with CP is appreciable. Children with these non-CNS malformations do not appear to differ from other children with CP regarding neurological subtype, functional severity, and comorbidities, or maternal or obstetrical factors. Thus, the specific presence of a non-CNS congenital malformation does not appear to assist the practitioner in the management or understanding of a child's CP.

### Velmanase alfa-tycv (Lamzede) [^e9d354a6]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.000000000000000e+00 3 Embryo -F etal Toxicity

Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, LAMZEDE may cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Administration of velmanase alfa-tycv to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused skeletal and visceral malformations. In rats and rabbits, skeletal and visceral malformations were observed at exposures that were approximately 7- and 2.5-fold, respectively, those observed in patients treated at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg.

The decision to continue or discontinue LAMZEDE treatment during pregnancy should consider the female’s need for LAMZEDE, the potential drug-related risks to the fetus, and the potential adverse outcomes from untreated maternal disease.

For females of reproductive potential, verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiating treatment with LAMZEDE. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LAMZEDE and for 14 days after the last dose if LAMZEDE is discontinued [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Genomic and genic deletions of the FOX gene cluster on 16q24.1 and inactivating mutations of FOXF1 cause alveolar capillary dysplasia and other malformations [^102fc4e4]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Foxf1 has been shown to be downregulated in Shh −/− mice, probably through Gli proteins,and activated by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4).In Foxf1 −/+ mice, a diminished expression of Vegfa, Vegfr2, Bmp-4, Tbx, Lklf, Fgf-10, Gli3, and Notch-2 has been found.,,Some of these genes, critical for lung development, may be mutated in patients with ACD/MPV without detectable abnormalities in FOXF1.

DNA sequence analysis of the deletion breakpoints in nine patients (D1–D9) revealed that in six patients (D1, D3–D6, and D8), both breakpoints map in the portions of Alu elements showing perfect microhomology (eight to 43 base pairs) (Table 3), suggesting replication error MMBIR/FoSTeS as a mechanism of their formation.Alternatively, these deletions might have occurred via nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). In patients D2, D7, and D9, the presence of short microhomologies (D2 and D7) and AGC insertion (D9) at the junction fragments indicate that these deletions probably arose via nonhomologous end joining or the MMBIR/FoSTeS mechanism.

Our data may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of malformations seen in patients with the VACTERL (v ertebral, a nal, c ardiac, t racheo- e sophageal, r enal and l imb malformations) association (MIM).Cardiac malformations, esophageal and anal atresia, renal and vertebral/axial malformations, and a single umbilical artery appear to be common to both VACTERL association and 16q24.1 microdeletion. However, although lung malformations have been reported occasionally in cases of VACTERL association, ACD/MPV has not been described in this context. We suggest that microdeletions at 16q24.1 should be considered in cases of apparent VACTERL association for which there is a severe respiratory distress and/or neonatal lethality. We propose that patients with intestinal atresia, isolated diastasis recti, or umbilical hernia should be screened for mutations and deletions in FOXL1. Given that FOXF1 maps only ∼3.7 Mb from 16qter, we also suggest that a balanced rearrangement involving 16qter (e.g. submicroscopic subtelomeric reciprocal translocation) should be excluded in parents with an ACD/MPV-affected child from whom no material is available for testing.

### Delaying invasive treatment in unilateral head and neck lymphatic malformation improves outcomes [^f3985d6c]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Large (De Serres stage [IV-V]) head and neck lymphatic malformations (HNLMs) often have multiple, high-risk, invasive treatments (ITs) to address functional compromise. Logically reducing HNLM ITs should reduce treatment risk. We tested whether delaying HNLM ITs reduces total IT number.

Materials

Consecutive HNLM patients (n =199) between 2010 and 2017, aged 0-18years.

Methods

ITs (surgery or sclerotherapy) were offered for persistent or dysfunction causing HNLMs. Treatment effectiveness categorized by IT number: optimal (0-1), acceptable (2-5), or suboptimal (>5). Clinical data were summarized, and outcome associations tested (χ 2 ). Relative risk (RR) with a Poisson working model tested whether HNLM observation or IT delay (>6months post-diagnosis) predicts treatment success (i.e., ≤1 IT).

Results

Median age at HNLM diagnosis was 1.3months (interquartile range [IQR] 0-45m) with 107/199(54%) male. HNLM were stage I-III (174 [88%]), IV-V (25 [13%]). Initial treatment was observation (70 [35%]), invasive (129 [65%]). Treatment outcomes were optimal (137 [69%]), acceptable (36 [18%]), and suboptimal (26 [13%]). Suboptimal outcome associations: EXIT procedure, stage IV-V, oral location, and tracheotomy (p <0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs were initially observed compared with stage I-III having ITs within 6months of HNLM diagnosis, had a 82% lower relative treatment failure risk ([i.e., >1 IT], RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.36, p <0.001). Stage I-III HNLMs with non-delayed ITs had reduced treatment failure risk compared with IV-V (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.66, p <0.001).

Conclusion

Observation and delayed IT in stage I-III HNLM ("Grade 1") is safe and reduces IT (i.e., ≤1 IT). Stage IV-V HNLMs ("Grade 2") with early IT have a greater risk of multiple ITs.

### Mutation of key signaling regulators of cerebrovascular development in vein of galen malformations [^fdcd23af]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

46 LoF and 72 D-mis damaging variants in total were identified in genes associated with axon guidance terms REAC:R-hsa-422475 (see above) or related axon guidance term GO:0007411 (p = 2.16 x 10 −8), including five DNVs (Supplementary Table 9). Besides RASA1 and EPHB4, several other high-pLI genes essential to cerebrovascular development contained multiple rare, damaging de novo or transmitted variants, including ACVRL1, NOTCH1, PTPN11, and ITGB1 (Supplementary Tables 10 – 11). These genes also contributed to enrichment signals identified in both the heart development term GO:0007507 and/or the Ras GTPase activator activity term GO:0005096 (Fig. 3a) and mapped onto a robust STRINGprotein-protein interactome (PPI enrichment p < 1.0 x 10 −16) with other Ras signaling genes harboring rare, damaging variants (Supplementary Table 12 and Fig. 3b). We, therefore, examined the probands harboring these variants in greater detail.

### Vascular malformations [^bbcb353e]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the nomenclature and classification system of vascular malformations. 2. Evaluate these patients diagnostically. 3. Outline the surgical and nonsurgical options for treating these lesions.

Summary

Vascular anomalies can be classified into two unique groups-hemangiomas and vascular malformations-based on their endothelial properties. The present review focuses on vascular malformations rather than hemangiomas. The authors address capillary malformations, lymphatic malformations, venous malformations, and arteriovenous malformations. Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed with relevant case examples. A MEDLINE search was performed to gather all pertinent references. The physician treating these challenging lesions should ideally use a multidisciplinary team-based approach with multispecialty experience in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for the management of vascular malformations.

### Development of an integrated, district-wide approach to pre-pregnancy management for women with pre-existing diabetes in a multi-ethnic population [^e83efe4d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Poor diabetes management prior to conception, results in increased rates of fetal malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. We describe the development of an integrated, pre-pregnancy management strategy to improve pregnancy outcomes among women of reproductive age with diabetes in a multi-ethnic district.

Methods

The strategy included (i) a narrative literature review of contraception and pre-pregnancy interventions for women with diabetes and development of a draft plan; (ii) a chart review of pregnancy outcomes (e.g. congenital malformations, neonatal hypoglycaemia and caesarean sections) among women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (n=53) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n=46) between 2010 and 2015 (iii) interview surveys of women with T1D and T2D (n=15), and local health care professionals (n=13); (iv) two focus groups (n=4) and one-to-one interviews with women with T1D and T2D from an Australian background (n=5), women with T2D from cultural and linguistically diverse (CALD) (n=7) and indigenous backgrounds (n=1) and partners of CALD women (n=3); and (v) two group meetings, one comprising predominantly primary care, and another comprising district-wide multidisciplinary inter-sectoral professionals, where components of the intervention strategy were finalised using a Delphi approach for development of the final plan.

Results

Our literature review showed that a range of interventions, particularly multifaceted educational programs for women and healthcare professionals, significantly increased contraception uptake, and reduced adverse outcomes of pregnancy (e.g. malformations and stillbirth). Our chart-review showed that local rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes were similarly poor among women with both T1D and T2D (e.g. major congenital malformations [9.1% vs 8.9%] and macrosomia [34.7% vs 24.4%]). Challenges included lack of knowledge among women and healthcare professionals relating to diabetes management and limited access to specialist pre-pregnancy care. Group meetings led to a consensus to develop a district-wide approach including healthcare professional and patient education and a structured approach to identification and optimisation of self-management, including contraception, in women of reproductive age with diabetes.

Conclusions

Sufficient evidence exists for consensus on a district-wide strategy to improve pre-pregnancy management among women with pre-existing diabetes.

Participant characteristics

In total 269 participants from 45 countries participated in the first study round. Of these, 163 were (parents of) patients with CM from 28 countries. Of all participating patients, 95 (58%) had SWS. Some patients had a CM in combination with a venous malformation (n = 18), an arteriovenous malformation (n = 4), a lymphatic malformation (n = 1) or combinations of these (n = 24). In addition, 106 CM experts from 32 countries participated, of whom the majority were dermatologists (59%) or plastic surgeons (18%). Most physicians had 15–20 years (21%) or > 20 years (39%) of experience in the field of CMs. Tables 1 and 2 present the participant characteristics of the first e‐Delphi round, and Table 3 shows the number of participants and response rates per e‐Delphi round. Overall, the response rate was ≥ 70% in each round. Participant characteristics of round 3 can be found in Table S3 (see Supporting Information).

### Controlling the pandemic during the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rollout [^ae49d370]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The vaccine efficacy in reducing infectivity (V E I) was assumed to be the same as vaccine efficacy in reducing disease conditioned on infection (V E disease∣infection), i.e. V E disease∣infection ≡ V E I. V E disease∣infection was calculated using the efficacy against disease (V E disease) reported in clinical trials as follows

The vaccine efficacy in reducing hospitalization rate (V E H) is equal to vaccine efficacy against severe disease conditioned on disease, i.e.was calculated using the vaccine efficacy against severe disease (V E severe disease) reported in trials as follows

We used an optimistic and a pessimistic set of vaccine efficacies for V E S, V E I and V E H (Supplementary Table 1) based on the range of values for V E infection, V E disease, and V E severe disease reported in the literature,–. For the optimistic set explored in the main analyses (Figs. 6 and 7), we used V E infection = 94%, V E disease = 94%, and V E severe disease = 98% (corresponding to V E S = 94%, V E I = 0%, and V E H = 67%),,,,,. For the pessimistic set explored in sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Fig. 7), we used V E infection = 55%, V E disease = 55%, and V E severe disease = 55% (corresponding to V E S = 55%, V E I = 0%, and V E H = 0%),,. Other efficacies reported in the literature for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and other existing vaccines fall in between the optimistic and pessimistic values we used. This broad range of values is also relevant in case the market share of different vaccine brands in Portugal gets changed throughout 2021.

Note that both the optimistic and pessimistic sets imply that the infectivity of breakthrough cases in vaccinated persons is the same as infectivity of cases in unvaccinated persons (V E I = 0%). Therefore, we included sensitivity analyses for this parameter (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 6) by taking two additional values (Supplementary Table 1): V E I = 50% that corresponds to 50% infectivity of vaccinated persons relative to infectivity of unvaccinated persons and V E I = 100% that is a best-case scenario implying that breakthrough cases are not infectious at all.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found no association between the presence of PAVMs in patients with HHT and mechanical properties of the lung as evaluated using routine PFTs, even in patients with numerous, macroscopic or bilateral malformations, suggesting that the presence of PAVMs does not contribute to the patients’dyspnea by a mechanical effect.

### Endoluminal biopsy for vein of galen malformation [^8e77fe02]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We describe here a method for successfully performing ETS in VOGM that addresses unique properties of this formidable arteriovenous shunt. The potential benefits of ETS in VOGM are numerous and include (1) acquisition of lesional tissue to identify somatic mutations, (2) ability to study molecular alterations in the shunt over time as they remodel, and (3) enabling precision medicine–based approaches to pharmacologically targetable mutations. Nevertheless, ETS devices, sequencing platforms, and genomic informatics all demonstrate substantial opportunities to improve. Our understanding of VOGM pathophysiology and vascular maintenance will grow in concert with such advances, potentially informing novel treatments to better outcomes across this specific population and cerebrovascular disease more broadly.

### Effect of reduced versus usual lipid emulsion dosing on bilirubin neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental impairment in extremely preterm infants: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^5dd08030]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

BAERs can detect auditory pathway dysfunction and serve as a sensitive indicator of otherwise unrecognizable BN. Each of the waves reflect synchronized neuronal activity in the distal auditory nerve (wave I), the proximal auditory nerve (wave II), cochlear nucleus (wave III), superior olive (wave IV), and the lateral lemniscus (wave V), respectively. We chose wave V latency as the primary predictor for this study because it is rostral and thus affected when the highly sensitive cochlear nucleus (wave III) is abnormal, and it has been used in previous studies. Note that the BAER waveforms are present at 34–36 gestational week preterm birth, but latencies, i.e. the conduction time from the stimulus to the wave, shorten from birth to 2 years of age, maturing sooner for the earlier waves and later for each subsequent wave. BAER latencies are similar to adult latencies by 24 months after birth. Therefore, because of the known physiologic development of BAER latencies associated with postnatal age, and wave V latency will be the primary predictor of interest and will be adjusted for PMA. Interwave intervals I-III and III-V are used to measure the conduction times between the respective generators of those waves and peak-to-trough amplitude are available with no extra effort or testing, and will be analyzed as secondary variables. Finally, we will record separately responses to rarefaction and condensation click stimuli to record cochlear microphonic responses, which is cases that have no replicable BAER responses can distinguish auditory dysfunction from BN from most other causes of no responses (e.g. genetic, ototoxic, malformation deafness, cochlear microphonic absent).

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and their mimics [^f709fde8]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal communications between the pulmonary arteries and veins, which result in a right-to-left (R-L) shunt with resultant hypoxemia, the severity of which will depend upon the size and number of lesions. Most PAVMs occur in individuals with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and are a cause of serious morbidity and mortality largely related to cerebrovascular complications secondary to paradoxical embolization. The importance of their recognition and treatment by embolization, even in the absence of symptoms, is well known. Their appearances on chest radiographs are often, but not always, characteristic and the CT appearances are diagnostic; however, there are a number of both vascular and non-vascular diseases that can cause confusion. This review serves to highlight these PAVM "mimics".

Osler-Weber-Rendu, also known as Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, is an autosomal dominant disease with phenotypic manifestations that include pulmonary, cerebrospinal, hepatic, and other visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Pulmonary AVMs can result in hypoxemia, hemoptysis, or stroke due to paradoxical embolism. The mainstay of treatment is transcatheter embolization. Central nervous system and abdominal visceral AVMs contribute to morbidity of the disease. Radiologists should be familiar with the imaging manifestations and treatment algorithm of AVMs in Osler-Weber-Rendu to effectively guide patient care.

### Sotorasib for vascular malformations associated withG12C mutation [^bbb1a1df]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

KRAS gain-of-function mutations are frequently observed in sporadic arteriovenous malformations. The mechanisms underlying the progression of such KRAS -driven malformations are still incompletely understood, and no treatments for the condition are approved. Here, we show the effectiveness of sotorasib, a specific KRAS G12C inhibitor, in reducing the volume of vascular malformations and improving survival in two mouse models carrying a mosaic Kras G12C mutation. We then administered sotorasib to two adult patients with severe KRAS G12C-related arteriovenous malformations. Both patients had rapid reductions in symptoms and arteriovenous malformation size. Targeting KRAS G12C appears to be a promising therapeutic approach for patients with KRAS G12C-related vascular malformations. (Funded by the European Research Council and others.).

Eisenmenger syndrome—recommendations for adults: When evaluating adults with presumed Eisenmenger syndrome, clinicians should confirm diagnostic imaging and cardiac catheterization data accuracy and exclude other potential contributors to right-to-left shunting or pulmonary hypertension (I; C-EO). Bosentan is beneficial in symptomatic adults with Eisenmenger syndrome with ASD or VSD (I; A). In symptomatic adults with Eisenmenger syndrome, bosentan and PDE-5 inhibitors are reasonable in combination if symptomatic improvement does not occur with either medication alone (IIa; B-R). Bosentan is a reasonable therapy to treat symptomatic adults with Eisenmenger syndrome with 1 of the following: shunts other than ASD/VSD (e.g., PDA, aortopulmonary window), or complex congenital heart lesions or Down syndrome, with Level of Evidence C-EO or B-NR as specified (IIa). It is reasonable to use PDE-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) to treat symptomatic adults with Eisenmenger syndrome with ASD, VSD, or great artery shunt (IIa; B-NR).

Variants in CM-AVM genes RASA1 and EPHB4

We first investigated the contribution of DNVs to VOGM pathogenesis (Supplementary Data 2). The average DNV rate of 1.19 per subject (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3) resembled previous results obtained from a similar sequencing platformand followed a Poisson distribution (Supplementary Fig. 5). The burden of DNVs in the control cohort was comparable (Supplementary Table 3). There was no enrichment of synonymous or missense DNVs inferred to be tolerated in VOGM cases. In contrast, D-mis (1.65-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 0.02) and protein-damaging DNVs (LoF + D-mis; 1.50-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 0.02) were enriched among all genes in cases but not in controls (Table 1). RASA1 (probability of loss-of-function intolerance [pLI] = 1.00 in gnomAD v.2.1.1) was the single gene that harbors a genome-wide significant burden of damaging DNVs (2042.5-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 4.79 x 10 −7) with two novel LoF DNVs (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 4). The only other gene with more than one protein-altering DNV (p.Gly202Ser and p.Gln321*) was endothelin-3-converting enzyme ECE3 (KEL) (440.7-fold, one-sided Poisson p = 1.03 x 10 −5). From the observed fraction of patients with damaging DNVs we infer that damaging DNVs account for >12% of VOGM cases (Table 1 and see Methods).

Arch abnormalities—3V or 3VT abnormal—are organized by lesion as follows: Coarctation shows RV > LV discrepancy, ascending Ao smaller than SVC, small transverse and descending/isthmus, with LSVC to coronary sinus, mitral anatomy and atrial septal flow direction considerations, outflow findings of aortic valve stenosis and bicuspid aortic valve, and false positive and false negative rates are substantial. Vascular rings demonstrate that 3VT has “U” shape around esophagus and trachea, instead of “V” to left of trachea, require outflow imaging to exclude aberrant subclavian arteries and double aortic arch, and have increased risk for tracheal anomalies and tracheal rings. Ductal aneurysm presents in late gestation with abnormal 3V, 3VT, or sagittal arch images with pulsatile, tortuous appearance, uses the aortic isthmus and diameter of arterial duct at its widest for additional measurements, and is generally a normal variant with no clinical correlate in newborn.

### Exertional hypoxia in a healthy adult: a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation [^e7427e99]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are a rare cause of pulmonary symptoms, including dyspnoea on exertion, hypoxemia and haemoptysis. PAVMs are an aetiology that is often overlooked by physicians when developing a differential diagnosis for pulmonary symptoms and unidentified lung masses. However, it is an important differential diagnosis to have as PAVMs can have serious sequelae including strokes, brain abscess and life-threatening bleeding. We present a case of an impressive PAVM presenting with chest pain, chronic cough, feelings of anxiety, mild resting hypoxemia and exertional hypoxemia. Of note, on previous chest X-ray, 8 years prior to presentation, an incidental mass was found during a shoulder repair presurgical workup but not further evaluated.

Discussion of Case and Literature

AVMs are pathogenic connections between a feeding artery and a draining vein. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations occur in the pulmonary vasculature where segmental or subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery form abnormal connections with the venous system. Arteriovenous malformations are pathogenic connections between a feeding artery and a draining vein. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations occur in the pulmonary vasculature where segmental or subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery form abnormal connections with the venous system. Arteriovenous malformations create a shunt that bypasses the pulmonary capillary bed which limits gas exchange. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are extremely rare with a prevalence estimated to be 38 per 100,000 individuals. Arteriovenous malformations create a shunt that bypasses the pulmonary capillary bed which limits gas exchange. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are extremely rare with a prevalence estimated to be 38 per 100,000 individuals.Most of the PAVMs occur in adulthood and only 10% occur in childhood.As in our case, PAVMs can be an incidental finding, or can present with symptoms such as hemoptysis, shortness of breath, or respiratory distress. Unilateral PAVMs are more common than bilateral PAVMs. Large and multiple PAVMs are more likely to be symptomatic.Despite large and bilateral PAVMs, our patient was asymptomatic with an incidental finding of hypoxemia. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations require prompt recognition and treatment as they pose the risk of serious complications such as life-threatening hemorrhage, cerebral embolic stroke, and abscess.

Ventilation/perfusion mismatching

The ratio of ventilation (V) to perfusion (Q) is decisive for the quality of the gas exchange in the lungs. Pronounced ventilation/perfusion mismatch (V/Q) occurs in pulmonary disease, pulmonary vascular disorders and heart failure. Therefore, gas exchange measurements are central to the understanding of the pathophysiology of exercise limitation.

Due to gravity, at rest there is a small gradient in ventilation and a much more pronounced gradient in perfusion from the apex to the bottom of the lung in the upright position (e.g. V/Q drops from the apex [high V/Q] to the bottom) and renders gas exchange ineffective. During exercise, these V/Q heterogeneities diminish, because the upper lung segments are now well ventilated and perfused through deep inhalation, vascular dilation and recruitment of previously closed capillaries. The result is an enlarged gas exchange area. In principle, two kinds of ventilation/perfusion disturbances reflecting true ventilatory inefficiency can be distinguished, and these often overlap:
low V/Q regions (incomplete ventilation disorder; shunt effect). The ventilation to perfusion ratio decreases in subventilated but normally perfused alveoli (relative hypoventilation). Examples include chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD) and restrictive lung diseases (pulmonary fibrosis). As a net effect, hypoxaemia occurs as a result of venous admixture, which cannot be compensated for by hyperventilation, resulting in an increase of P(A-a) O 2. Elevated PaCO 2 is usually prevented by hyperventilation in other lung areas. The different effects on PaO 2 and PaCO 2 are attributable to the different dissociation curves of O 2 (sigmoidal form of the O 2 dissociation curve) and CO 2 (linear form of the CO 2 dissociation curve). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is one mechanism to redistribute perfusion to better oxygenated regions and thus limit the extent of hypoxaemia.
high V/Q regions (incomplete distribution disorder; increased dead-space ventilation [VD/VT↑]). In normally ventilated but poorly perfused alveoli (relative hyperventilation), the V/Q ratio increases (dead-space effect). Examples include pulmonary emphysema (compression effects due to hyperinflation, reduced capillary bed), chronic heart failure, primary or secondary pulmonary vascular disease, and restrictive lung disease (e.g. interstitial lung disease [ILD] with reduced capillary bed). Overall, high V/Q mismatch usually has only a minor effect on arterial blood gases (more on CO 2 than on O 2 due to impaired release of CO 2 to the alveoli), resulting in increased P(a-ET)CO 2, because other lung areas are overventilated in a compensatory manner.

We report on the treatment of a voluminous vulvar AVM in a 16-year-old girl. After failure of medical therapy, we performed a radical surgical resection with preliminary embolization and flap reconstruction.

Summary and Conclusion

A multidisciplinary approach is required for AVM management. Early intervention and complete surgical resection combined with preliminary embolization represents the ideal therapy.

### The role of noninvasive and invasive diagnostic imaging techniques for detection of extra-cranial venous system anomalies and developmental variants [^5c8c041c]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Because of the advantages of DS in detecting intra-luminal venous pathology, it was initially promoted as a method of choice for the screening of extra-cranial venous anomalies and developmental variants, indicative of CCSVI. The diagnosis of CCSVI is both based on hemodynamic and imaging findings that utilize DS to study the deep cerebral veins, the IJVs and the vertebral veins (VVs) in both erect and supine positions. DS can also assess the hemodynamic consequences of outflow derangement while B-mode ultrasound detects structural venous intra-luminal anomalies (Figure 1 E, F). Zamboni et al. created a set of five DS VH criteria by which MS patients were differentiated from healthy controls with 100% specificity and sensitivity (Figure 1). However, in their original publication, they did not recommend exact technical procedures for the protocol application in either a research or routine clinical setting. The first attempt to define the standardized CCSVI scanning protocol was recently presented. More recently, the International Society for the Neurovascular Disease (ISNVD) developed a more comprehensive consensus document that included the participation of more than 40 international experts in DS imaging. DS was proposed as a standardized screening tool for determining CCSVI status. The protocol proposes the use of quantitative measures for the definition of functional anomalies, such as blood flow velocity and volume (Figure 2) that could be potentially more reliable in assessing the degree of venous outflow obstruction in the IJVs. It also refines originally proposed VH criteria. Even more recently, the European Society of Neurosonology and Cerebral Hemodynamics (ESNCH) expressed considerable concerns regarding the accuracy of the proposed criteria for CCSVI in MS, and proposed the central blinded DS reading as part of a recent multi-center Italian CoSMo study investigating the prevalence of CCSVI in MS patients, controls and patients with OND.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot—electrophysiologic risk stratification and invasive hemodynamic assessment: Programmed ventricular stimulation can be useful to risk-stratify adults with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and additional risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) (IIa, B-NR). In patients with repaired TOF, cardiac catheterization with angiography, if indicated, is reasonable to assess hemodynamics when adequate data cannot be obtained noninvasively in the setting of an arrhythmia, heart failure (HF), unexplained ventricular dysfunction, suspected pulmonary hypertension or cyanosis (IIa, C-EO).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (l‑TGA) assessment with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is outlined as follows: 'Pre-operative and post-operative assessments require an evaluation similar to that was discussed for the other conotruncal lesions.' Specifically, 'the preoperative assessment involves evaluation of the systemic AV valve, since there is commonly an Ebstein-like malformation of the left-sided TV,' and after an anatomic or double-switch repair, 'Post-operative assessment, when the repair entails an anatomic repair or “double switch” operation, evaluates all aspects of the atrial and arterial switches discussed earlier.'

### Refractory hypoxemia in an asymptomatic 6-year-old: It is not always the heart [^8a61c422]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoxemia and clubbing in otherwise healthy children have a broad differential diagnosis and require a thorough work-up. Hypoxemia unresponsive to supplemental oxygen is strongly suggestive of shunting. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, though less common than intra-cardiac shunts, can present in a similar fashion and physicians must have a high index of suspicion when evaluating patients with hypoxemia refractory to oxygen therapy. Echocardiography with bubble study is a helpful bedside tool that provides rapid diagnosis. Computed tomography angiography and catheterization provides definitive diagnosis. The management of PAVMs is similar irrespective of cause, with the primary modality considered embolization. Patients must be followed closely after embolization to monitor sequelae and observe for recurrence.

### Valproic acid [^e347619e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Structural Birth Defects

Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

5.3 Decreased IQ Following in utero Exposure

Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure. Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs. The largest of these studies1is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I. 94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I. 105-110]), carbamazepine (105 [95% C.I. 102-108]), and phenytoin (108 [95% C.I. 104-112]). It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur. Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.

Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.

In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .

### 4.5 tetralogy of Fallot | CDC (...) [^d9a51796]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

4. 5d Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a structural heart anomaly that comprises a. spectrum of disease, from severe to mild, with a common anatomic finding of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction – due to pulmonic and subpulmonic stenosis or atresia, or an absent pulmonary valve – associated with a malpositioned aorta that overrides a ventricular septal defect. The functional consequence is shunting/mixing of poorly oxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the aorta and thus to the systemic circulation. Depending on the degree of the shunting, which is a function of the severity of outflow tract obstruction, the child might become cyanotic, either constantly or intermittently. This form of CHD requires surgical treatment. Fig.
4. 17. Tetralogy of Fallot.
- Pulmonary valve atresia with ventricular septal defect is nearly always a form of tetralogy of Fallot, and for this reason it is grouped with classic tetralogy of Fallot.
- Pentalogy of Fallot – which comprises tetralogy of Fallot plus atrial septal defect – is an old term seldom used now. If tetralogy of Fallot occurs with an atrial septal defect, code separately the two defects; this approach also allows the atrial septal defect to be coded using a more specific code. Echocardiography has largely superseded other imaging techniques. Newborn screening via pulse oximetry – which is based on the non-invasive detection of peripheral blood hypoxygenation – is effective in detecting tetralogy of Fallot as long as the condition causes the level of blood oxygenation to go below the cut-off for newborn screening testing.

For this reason, some cases of tetralogy of Fallot, especially milder cases, might be missed at newborn screening or on clinical examination before discharge from the nursery. Postnatal. .

### Ebstein's anomaly in children and adults: multidisciplinary insights into imaging and therapy [^8fed6231]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

EA diagnosis or diagnostic suspect should guide patient’s referral to a specialised multidisciplinary team. EA spectrum of heterogeneous anatomical and clinical features requires a patient-tailored monitoring strategy. Large cohort studies are needed to assess the impact of medical treatment and to identify the best interventional approach, which should rely on time of presentation to medical attention as well as on indicators effectively correlating with clinical outcome.

### Ventilation-to-perfusion relationships and right-to-left shunt during neonatal intensive care in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^f635dc64]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Calculation of V A / Q and shunt with the oxygen dissociation curve

The method has been previously described in detail.The relative position of an individual’s oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve can be used to calculate the degree of shunt and V A / Q inequality as a non-invasive measure of oxygenation impairment.Briefly, right-to-left shunt causes a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation, which cannot be overcome by increasing the amount of inspired oxygen. The level of the right-to-left shunt can be thus quantified by the degree of the depression of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. A reduction in the V A / Q results in a post-alveolar reduction in the blood oxygen content, which produces a rightward shift of the curve. This shift can be overcome by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen. The reduction, thus, in V A / Q can be measured by the degree of the right shift of the curve compared to an ideal reference curve (Fig. 1). Similarly, the further downwards an individual’s curve is positioned relative to the ideal curve, the higher that individual’s right-to-left shunt (Fig. 1).Using at least two paired values of peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and F I O 2 for each infant taken ≤4 h apart, an oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve was constructed for each subject. Using the paired values of F I O 2 and SpO 2, the V A / Q and the percentage of right-to-left shunt were calculated at four time endpoints: during the first 24 h of life, in the 12 h before operation (pre-operation), in the 12 h before extubation (pre-extubation) and, in the infants who died, in the last 12 h before death. V A / Q and right-to-left shunt were derived using software that derives results for each dataset from a two-compartment model: shunt and V A / Q for a single homogeneous ventilated compartment.The contemporaneous haemoglobin value from the arterial blood gas analysis at the time of each assessment was used in the calculations. For ventilated infants treated with NO, the F I O 2 was measured and recorded as delivered to the patient from the NO delivery system.
