## Question

what's difference between MN and MPGN on ABIM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between membranous nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis as relevant to ABIM. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each entity fundamentally represents. Then, I should compare their pathophysiology. Next, I will contrast the histopathologic signatures on light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. After that, I need to differentiate the clinical presentations. Then, I should classify etiologies and align diagnostic workups accordingly. Next, I will map management strategies to mechanisms. Finally, I will synthesize ABIM high-yield patterns, pitfalls, and test-taking cues with explicit self-checks and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental nature of each entity, because mislabeling here derails everything downstream; membranous nephropathy (MN) is best considered a specific autoimmune disease defined by autoantibodies targeting podocyte antigens with in situ subepithelial immune complex formation, whereas membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is no longer a single disease but a pattern of injury that necessitates pathogenesis-based classification into immune complex–mediated versus complement-mediated forms, not merely a historical type I/II/III label [^113E54sf] [^11121LqD] [^114ce8tj] [^112YLhDF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking mechanisms; in MN, antibodies against podocyte antigens such as PLA2R drive in situ subepithelial immune complexes that activate complement, injure podocytes, and cause heavy proteinuria, with PLA2R accounting for roughly 70–80% of primary cases, while in MPGN the membranoproliferative pattern arises either from immune complex activation of the classical pathway (e.g., infections, autoimmunity, monoclonal gammopathy) or from alternative pathway dysregulation with dominant C3 deposition defining C3 glomerulopathy, and these mechanistic branches are what ultimately steer therapy selection [^113E54sf] [^113XLc9q] [^11121LqD] [^116BKTeh] [^1173k4yv].

> Next, I should review light microscopy because it anchors the pattern recognition; MN classically shows diffuse capillary wall thickening with minimal hypercellularity and can show "spikes" on silver stain, whereas MPGN shows mesangial expansion and hypercellularity with capillary wall remodeling and glomerular basement membrane (GBM) double contours or "tram tracks" from mesangial interposition, a hallmark of the membranoproliferative pattern that should trigger IF-based subclassification rather than a premature etiologic label [^113E54sf] [^114tzfZm] [^11121LqD] [^114ce8tj].

> Wait, let me verify the immunofluorescence fingerprints because they are the quickest discriminators; MN typically has granular capillary wall IgG with C3 along the GBM reflecting subepithelial immune complexes, while immune complex–mediated MPGN shows IgG plus C3 (often with IgM/IgA) in mesangium and capillary walls and C3 glomerulopathy shows dominant or isolated C3 with minimal immunoglobulin, but I need to remember the pitfall of "masked" deposits where paraffin IF after antigen retrieval can unmask monoclonal Ig in cases that look C3-only on frozen IF, preventing misclassification of monoclonal gammopathy–related disease as C3 glomerulopathy [^11121LqD] [^117R51pv] [^113Vm6G1].

> I will now examine electron microscopy to complete the triad; MN shows subepithelial electron-dense deposits between podocyte foot processes and the GBM with stage I–IV evolution based on deposit incorporation and GBM response, whereas MPGN patterns show subendothelial and mesangial deposits with GBM duplication in immune complex–mediated cases and intramembranous dense ribbon-like transformation in dense deposit disease (historical MPGN type II), so if I see subepithelial-dominant deposits I should think MN, and if I see subendothelial/mesangial ± intramembranous deposits with duplication I should think MPGN pathway and then align IF to immune complex versus C3-dominant [^11121LqD] [^11121LqD] [^114xjdCn].

> Let me think about clinical phenotypes to refine pretest probability; MN classically presents with pure nephrotic syndrome (heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia), often in adults 40–60 years, with venous thromboembolism risk that escalates as serum albumin falls, whereas MPGN often blends nephritic and nephrotic features with hematuria, variable proteinuria, hypertension, and reduced GFR, and hypocomplementemia — particularly low C3 — is common in immune complex–mediated forms, although I should confirm complements to avoid anchoring bias [^113XLc9q] [^114tzfZm] [^112GYEDG] [^11121LqD] [^114N58tx].

> I should confirm etiologic classifications before ordering tests; for MN, the antigen-driven paradigm reframes "primary" disease as autoantibody-mediated (PLA2R, THSD7A, NELL1, and others) and "secondary" MN as associated with infections such as HBV/HCV/HIV, malignancy, autoimmune disease, or drugs including NSAIDs, while for MPGN the modern KDIGO schema is pathogenesis-based into immune complex–mediated (infections, autoimmune disease, monoclonal gammopathy/MGRS) and complement-mediated C3 glomerulopathy from alternative pathway dysregulation, with truly idiopathic MPGN now uncommon after thorough evaluation [^113E54sf] [^116xSjfB] [^113sEEzt] [^11121LqD] [^116EBLbm] [^116BKTeh] [^116RasWB].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic algorithms to avoid unnecessary biopsies; for suspected MN with nephrotic syndrome, a positive anti-PLA2R in a typical presentation can obviate kidney biopsy per KDIGO, although I still need to screen for secondary causes regardless of serology, whereas for MPGN the kidney biopsy is essential to establish the membranoproliferative pattern and then IF and EM guide classification; concurrently, I should order complements (C3, C4, CH50), infection serologies, autoimmune panels, and evaluate for monoclonal gammopathy with SPEP/UPEP and immunofixation, and if IF is C3-dominant or discordant with EM/clinical context I need to consider paraffin IF to exclude masked monoclonal deposits and contemplate genetic testing for complement dysregulation in C3 glomerulopathy [^113tA1sb] [^116xSjfB] [^113E54sf] [^11121LqD] [^116EBLbm] [^115DsqmD] [^117RVVUK] [^117R51pv].

> Next, I should review MN management in a risk-stratified manner to align therapy with trajectory; all patients require optimal supportive care including RAAS blockade, lipid management, and thromboembolism risk assessment with prophylactic anticoagulation considered when serum albumin is very low, then immunosuppression choices follow KDIGO risk tiers with rituximab, calcineurin inhibitors, or cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids used according to risk and kidney function, and serial PLA2R antibody monitoring guides continuation or modification of therapy at 6 months in a biomarker-driven fashion [^1127uLxk] [^112GYEDG] [^115KPDH2] [^111rSoUE] [^114Q5HY1] [^111RoC86] [^115KpA3b] [^115ejTJt].

> I need to ensure MPGN treatment is pathogenesis-directed rather than pattern-directed; for immune complex–mediated disease, treating the underlying driver is first priority with supportive care alone appropriate in low-risk idiopathic cases and escalation to corticosteroids with additional immunosuppression for persistent activity or kidney dysfunction and cyclophosphamide-based regimens for rapidly progressive crescentic presentations, whereas for C3 glomerulopathy initial therapy is mycophenolate plus corticosteroids in the absence of monoclonal gammopathy, with eculizumab as a consideration in refractory or severe cases and clinical trial enrollment encouraged when standard options fail [^1173k4yv] [^1159fdV8] [^117F4Uah] [^116UPBtB] [^116BKTeh] [^111Kw9Cs] [^116MDVHe].

> But wait, what if the biopsy reads "MPGN" without IF detail; I should double-check that the report specifies whether deposits are Ig-dominant or C3-dominant because therapy diverges markedly, and in adults with C3-only staining I should verify that masked monotypic Ig has been excluded with paraffin IF, especially if a concomitant monoclonal gammopathy is suspected, to avoid missing MGRS-directed therapy that targets the clone rather than the complement pathway alone [^11121LqD] [^117R51pv] [^1128VPJ7].

> Next, I should review ABIM-oriented pattern recognition and pitfalls to optimize test performance; classic vignettes feature a middle-aged adult with heavy proteinuria, normal complements, and positive PLA2R serology pointing to MN without mandatory biopsy, versus a patient with hematuria, hypertension, reduced GFR, low C3, and a biopsy with mesangial hypercellularity and double contours suggesting an MPGN pattern that triggers a workup for infection, autoimmunity, and monoclonal gammopathy, and high-yield caveats include recognizing C3-dominant disease as alternative pathway dysregulation and remembering the "masked deposits" phenomenon to avoid misclassification, all of which aligns with ABIM's emphasis on clinically relevant pattern recognition and diagnostic algorithms over rote memorization [^113tA1sb] [^116EBLbm] [^11121LqD] [^117R51pv].

> Hold on, I should verify a couple of edge cases that ABIM might probe; if MN shows crescents or rapidly worsening kidney function, I should consider a dual process such as superimposed ANCA-associated GN or anti-GBM disease and send serologies accordingly, and conversely, MPGN with few urinary abnormalities but hypocomplementemia — particularly in pediatrics — should still prompt biopsy and complement pathway evaluation to avoid missed diagnoses [^114RDT7U] [^117RVVUK] [^114N58tx].

> Let me close the loop with testable "if-then" heuristics I would use on exam day while keeping room for verification; nephrotic syndrome with normal complement and positive PLA2R serology means MN and no biopsy needed unless atypical features are present, mixed nephritic–nephrotic picture with low C3 and an MPGN pattern means pursue infection, autoimmunity, and monoclonal gammopathy plus full complement workup and classify by IF, and C3-dominant staining without immunoglobulin should trigger an alternative pathway dysregulation evaluation and consideration of MMF plus steroids, with escalation or trials if refractory, always rechecking for masked deposits when the story does not fit [^113tA1sb] [^116EBLbm] [^11121LqD] [^116BKTeh] [^117R51pv].

Key ABIM point: MN has subepithelial immune complex deposits with a "spike and dome" pattern [^113E54sf] and **normal complement**, whereas MPGN shows mesangial/endocapillary proliferation with **double-contour GBM** [^11121LqD], subendothelial or intramembranous deposits, and **low C3** [^114ce8tj]. MN typically presents with nephrotic syndrome [^1152Fm9c] and is managed with risk-based immunosuppression (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or CNIs) [^111rSoUE], whereas MPGN often presents with mixed nephritic–nephrotic features and is treated by addressing the underlying cause [^1173k4yv], providing supportive care [^1159fdV8], and adding immunosuppression if needed [^117F4Uah].

| **Feature** | **Membranous nephropathy (MN)** | **Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathogenesis | Subepithelial immune complexes (PLA2R/THSD7A) [^113E54sf] | Immune complex or complement-mediated (C3G) [^11121LqD] |

| Treatment | Risk-based immunosuppression [^114Q5HY1] | - Treat underlying cause [^1173k4yv] <br/> - Supportive care [^1159fdV8] <br/> - Immunosuppression if needed [^117F4Uah] |
| Prognosis | Variable; spontaneous remission is common [^1152rD9E] | Progressive; risk of ESRD |

MN and MPGN differ in **pathogenesis, histology, complement, and management**: MN is subepithelial with normal complement [^113E54sf], whereas MPGN is mesangial/endocapillary with low C3 [^11121LqD].

### Histopathology of MPGN and C3 glomerulopathies [^11121LqD]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2015). High credibility.

'Membranoproliferative' describes glomerular injury characterized by capillary wall thickening and mesangial expansion due to increased matrix deposition and hypercellularity. The presence of immune deposits indicates membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Historically, MPGN was classified into three types based on the appearance and site of the electron-dense deposits observed by electron microscopy. However, it is now recognized that many cases show only deposition of the complement component C3, due to abnormal control of the alternative pathway of complement activation — these cases are now classified as C3 glomerulopathies.

Not all cases of C3 glomerulopathy, however, exhibit an MPGN pattern. C3 glomerulopathies include dense deposit disease, characterized by dense osmiophilic deposits, and C3 glomerulonephritis, characterized by isolated deposits. In many cases, the genetic mutations or autoantibodies responsible for C3 deposition have been identified. Some patients with abnormal complement control will accumulate small amounts of immunoglobulin in their glomeruli. Therefore, in everyday practice, the morphological diagnosis of 'glomerulonephritis with dominant C3' is useful for identifying patients who require investigation of the complement pathway. The recognition that many cases of MPGN are C3 glomerulopathies and that the underlying cause can often be identified in immunoglobulin-associated cases means that the diagnosis of idiopathic MPGN is now very uncommon.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis pattern of injury [^114ce8tj]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is no longer considered a single disease but is instead recognized as a pattern of injury within various diseases. This pattern is characterized by electron-dense deposits, mesangial proliferation, and duplication of the glomerular basement membrane. MPGN was previously classified based on findings observed through electron microscopy. However, understanding complement dysfunction in association with cases presenting the MPGN pattern of injury has significantly altered our perspective on its pathogenesis. A new classification system, which includes immune complex-mediated and complement-mediated MPGN, is now preferred and has been incorporated into international guidelines.

Despite these advancements, accurately diagnosing MPGN remains a clinical challenge due to the pathological and clinical similarities between immune complex-mediated and complement-mediated MPGN. Additional testing, such as molecular and genetic testing, is often required. This article serves as an introductory exploration to summarize the understanding of the MPGN pattern of injury from a pathological perspective, preceding further detailed discussions in subsequent chapters.

### Mayo Clinic consensus report on membranous nephropathy: Proposal for a novel classification [^113E54sf]. Kidney International (2023). High credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a pattern of injury caused by autoantibodies binding to specific target antigens, resulting in the accumulation of immune complexes along the subepithelial region of glomerular basement membranes. Over the past 20 years, there have been revolutionary advances in understanding MN, particularly through the discovery of novel target antigens and their respective autoantibodies. These discoveries have challenged the traditional classification of MN into primary and secondary forms. At least 14 target antigens have been identified, accounting for 80%-90% of MN cases. Many forms of MN associated with these novel target antigens exhibit distinctive clinical and pathologic phenotypes.

The Mayo Clinic consensus report on MN proposes a two-step classification of MN. The first step, when possible, is the identification of the target antigen based on a multistep algorithm. This algorithm uses a combination of serology, staining of kidney biopsy tissue by immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, and/or mass spectrometry methodology. The second step involves searching for a potential underlying disease or associated condition, which is particularly relevant when knowledge of the target antigen is available to guide this search. The meeting acknowledges that the required resources and equipment for the proposed testing may not be generally available. However, the consensus is that the time has come to adopt an antigen-based classification of MN. This approach will allow for accurate and specific MN diagnosis, with significant implications for patient management.

### Pathogenesis of the C3 glomerulopathies and reclassification of MPGN [^1147Vguy]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Until recently, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was clinically classified as either primary, idiopathic MPGN, or as secondary MPGN when an underlying aetiology was identifiable. Primary MPGN was further classified into three types — type I, type II, and type III — based principally on the ultrastructural appearance and location of electron-dense deposits. Both the clinical and histopathologic schemes presented problems, however, as neither was based on disease pathogenesis.

An improved understanding of the role of complement in the pathogenesis of MPGN has led to a proposed reclassification into immunoglobulin-mediated disease (driven by the classical complement pathway) and non-immunoglobulin-mediated disease (driven by the alternative complement pathway). This reclassification has led to improved diagnostic clinical algorithms and the emergence of a new grouping of diseases known as the C3 glomerulopathies, best represented by dense deposit disease and C3 glomerulonephritis.

In this review, we re-examine the previous classification schemes of MPGN, focusing on the role of complement. We survey data about the pathogenesis of the C3 glomerulopathies, including familial studies and patient cohorts from the United States and Europe. In addition, we discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the C3 glomerulopathies.

### Membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG kappa deposits [^113Vm6G1]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic classification of glomerulonephritis is determined by the interplay of changes observed using light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of the renal biopsy. Routine direct immunofluorescence on fresh tissue is currently considered the gold standard for detecting and characterizing immune deposits. We recently discovered a peculiar form of glomerular immune complex deposition in which masked deposits required an antigen-retrieval step to be visualized.

Over a 2-year period, 14 cases were characterized by numerous large subepithelial deposits visualized by electron microscopy and C3-predominant staining by routine immunofluorescence on fresh tissue with weak to negative immunoglobulin staining. Upon repeating immunofluorescence after digestion of the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue with pronase, strong IgG-κ staining restricted within the deposits was elicited. The patients were typically young, with a mean age of 26 years, and commonly exhibited clinical evidence of vague autoimmune phenomena.

The clinicopathologic findings in this unusual form of glomerulopathy do not neatly fit into any currently existing diagnostic category. We have termed this unique form of glomerulopathy as membranous-like glomerulopathy with masked IgG-κ deposits.

### Diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with anti-GBM glomerulonephritis: A case series report [^116dkGAM]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, characterized by the presence of subepithelial immune complexes followed by complement activation, basement membrane damage, and proteinuria. Fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation are rarely encountered with MN. MN with crescents may occur as a "dual glomerulopathy" with superimposed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated crescentic glomerulonephritis or, less often, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The combination of MN and anti-GBM disease has been well documented since the first report in 1974. This dual glomerulopathy likely represents the coincidental occurrence of two separate disease processes: MN followed by anti-GBM disease or the simultaneous presence of both diseases. Occasionally, anti-GBM followed by MN has also been reported in individual cases.

We report three cases of MN with anti-GBM disease and analyzed their clinical and pathological characteristics. The correct diagnosis of MN with anti-GBM disease should rely on a combination of renal biopsy findings and serological testing.

### Kidney biopsy in patients with glomerulonephritis: Is the earlier the better [^1129U2sm]? BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

The time points when interventions should be recommended have been investigated and established in multiple fields of medicine. For patients with renal disease, a kidney biopsy can be necessary for diagnosis and treatment selection. Technical advances, such as real-time ultrasound and automated biopsy needles, have improved the general implementation of this procedure. Major complications occur in less than 0.1% of kidney biopsies.

The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in Western communities, and outcomes are poor. The number of patients with CKD undergoing maintenance hemodialysis is expected to rise further. Complications of decreased kidney function or concomitant cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be preventable by early diagnosis and treatment. However, CKD is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.

There is insufficient evidence to conclude the best timing of invasive diagnostic procedures in patients with several kidney diseases. An early kidney biopsy may be of particular interest for patients where disease classification is based on histological diagnosis and where disease progression can be mitigated by treatment. While guidelines have established the medical management of glomerulonephritis (GN), including the necessity of histological analysis and administration of immunosuppressive therapies, it remains unclear if early diagnosis may result in the prevention of CKD development in this heterogeneous group of patients.

We therefore performed a retrospective analysis to address the question of whether the diagnosis of GN from an early kidney biopsy.

Regarding medical management for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, more specifically with respect to management of immune complex-mediated MPGN, KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of supportive therapy with RAAS inhibition alone in patients with idiopathic immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. This is advised in cases with proteinuria less than 3.5 g/day, absence of nephrotic syndrome, and normal eGFR.

### Distribution of IgG subclasses in a biopsy specimen showing membranous nephropathy with anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis: An uncharacteristically good outcome with corticosteroid therapy [^115wAaEj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Few occurrences of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis superimposed on membranous nephropathy have been reported; most reported cases began as membranous nephropathy. Little is known about the etiology, pathogenesis, or immunoglobulin G subclasses in glomerular basement membrane deposits in these combined cases. The authors report the case of an elderly patient with apparently simultaneous onset of both membranous nephropathy and anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis who had an excellent outcome with only pulse corticosteroid therapy. Successive renal biopsy specimens showed occurrence and disappearance of immunoglobulin G4 deposits in the glomerular basement membrane. Immunoglobulin G subclass analysis was important in recognizing membranous nephropathy underlying the anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.

- **Full medical history**: Including systemic diseases, thyroid disease; history of medication use such as NSAIDs, gold, and penicillamine; and a physical examination focusing on skin and joints.

- **Screening for malignancies**: This should be population and age-appropriate.

- **Kidney ultrasound**.

- **CXR**: Specifically for sarcoidosis.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^117R51pv]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The finding of 'masked' deposits is a rare phenomenon, and paraffin immunofluorescence (IF) is certainly not warranted in the vast majority of cases. We recently published our experience with this technique over a 9-month period at Nephropath. During this period, 2% of the 4969 native kidney biopsies were evaluated by paraffin IF for masked deposits. Out of a total of 97 cases evaluated, paraffin IF was useful or had a significant contribution in identifying masked deposits in 22 cases (23%).

Paraffin IF is often useful when the findings by routine IF do not match either the clinical scenario or electron microscopic findings. In this series, a masked deposit was uncovered in 36% of Mayo Clinic cases that initially showed C3 glomerulonephritis (GN) with monoclonal gammopathy. The Nephropath cases demonstrate that in adults with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and C3-only staining on routine IF, there were equal numbers of cases of C3 GN and MPGN with masked immunoglobulin (Ig) deposits. Given the high frequency of masked deposits in C3 GN in this biopsy series and others, it is our opinion that C3 GN in adults should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion only after masked deposits have been excluded by paraffin IF.

Although paraffin IF is a useful technique in the renal pathology laboratory, there are inherent pitfalls to be aware of with this procedure. One example is the positive staining of intraluminal serum, which could lead to a false positive diagnosis if care is not taken to determine the exact location of the deposits. Therefore, it should not be interpreted as positive unless staining can be identified along the capillary walls and within the mesangium.

### Comparison of content on the American Board of Internal Medicine maintenance of certification examination with conditions seen in practice by general internists [^112gkdTJ]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

Success on the internal medicine (IM) examination is a central requirement of the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM's) Maintenance of Certification program (MOC). Therefore, it is important to understand the degree to which this examination reflects conditions seen in practice, one dimension of content validity which focuses on the match between content in the discipline and the topics on the examination questions.

- **Objective**: To assess whether the frequency of questions on IM-MOC examinations were concordant with the frequency of conditions seen in practice.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The 2010–2013 IM-MOC examinations were used to calculate the percentage of questions for 186 medical condition categories from the examination blueprint. This blueprint balances examination content by considering the importance and frequency of conditions seen in practice. Nationally representative estimates of conditions seen in practice by general internists were estimated from the primary diagnosis for 13,832 office visits (2010–2013 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys) and 108,472 hospital stays (2010 National Hospital Discharge Survey).

- **Exposures**: Prevalence of conditions included on the IM-MOC examination questions.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The outcome measure was the concordance between the percentages of IM-MOC examination questions and the percentages of conditions seen in practice during either office visits or hospital stays for each of 186 condition categories (e.g. diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, liver disease). The concordance thresholds we

### Deep learning-based framework for the distinction of membranous nephropathy: A new approach through hyperspectral imagery [^112Ng5Po]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The WHO estimates that more than 257 million people, or 3.5% of the world population, are living with chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem in China. Previous case reports have associated chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with several types of glomerulonephritis (GN). Almost all morphological forms of renal disease, including membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), mesangial proliferative GN, minimal change disease, focal glomerulosclerosis, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), have been described. The most common type of GN is membranous nephropathy, and the natural history of this condition is not clear. By employing a hyperspectral imaging-based architecture consisting of filtering, projection transformation, high-level feature extractor, and Softmax classification, we could identify HBV-MN and IMN cases using a novel and accurate technique.

Compared with conventional bidimensional images obtained by light microscopy, the hyperspectral imaging system provides superior resolution and sensitivity and the capability to simultaneously process multidimensional images. HSI was initially applied to fields such as remote sensing, archaeology, and drug identification. In recent years, the extension of HSI to the biomedical field has started to achieve promising results. In theory, compositions of different materials will present significant discrepancies in spectral curves; therefore, curves of IMN and HBV-MN would be distinguishable due to their different immune complex components led by diverse pathogenesis.

	- The patients exhibited various clinical characteristics, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT). Other features were significant white blood cell (WBC) counts, positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
	- The presence of membranous nephropathy (MN) was confirmed through tests.
	- Notably, antibodies targeting the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) were detected.

- **Pathological features**:
	- Semi-quantitative scoring was applied to assess tubulointerstitial lesions.
	- **Scores were given as follows**: 0% of the cortical area or tubules scored as 0, 25% as 1, 25–50% as 2, and more than 50% as 3.
	- The analysis focused on glomeruli and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).

- **IgG subclass and PLA2R distribution**:
	- The distribution of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses was investigated in relation to PLA2R.

Overall, the findings provide important insights into the clinical presentation and pathology of patients with anti-GBM and MN overlap.

### Renal pathology in idiopathic membranous nephropathy: A new perspective [^114tzfZm]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Histology findings in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MGN) have been associated with the risk of renal failure, but whether they are independent of the clinical variables at the time of biopsy, predict the rate of progression, or should guide therapy is uncertain. Renal biopsies of 389 adult MGN patients were evaluated semiquantitatively for interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, vascular sclerosis, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions (FSGS), complement deposition, and the stage and synchrony of deposits by electron microscopy (EM).

Associations were tested between these findings and the rate of renal function decline (slope), renal survival, remission in proteinuria, and response to immunosuppression. Patients with a greater degree of tubulo-interstitial disease, vascular sclerosis, and secondary FSGS were older, had a higher mean arterial pressure, and a lower creatinine clearance at presentation. Although these histologic features were associated with reduced renal survival, they did not predict this outcome independently of the baseline clinical variables, nor did they correlate with the rate of decline in function or with baseline proteinuria. Furthermore, the severity of tubulo-interstitial and vascular lesions did not preclude a remission in proteinuria in those who received immunosuppressive therapy. Neither the stage nor synchronicity of EM deposits nor the amount of complement deposition predicted renal survival, but the latter did correlate with the progression rate.

In MGN, certain histologic changes are associated with renal survival outcome.

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents [^114RDT7U]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be primary or secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic infection, or drugs. A rapid decline in renal function in patients with membranous nephropathy may be due to renal vein thrombosis, malignant hypertension, or an additional superimposed destructive process involving the renal parenchyma. Crescents are rare in primary membranous nephropathy and thus suggest another underlying disease process, such as combined membranous and focal or diffuse lupus nephritis. However, in some patients with membranous nephropathy and crescents, the crescentic lesion may be due to a distinct, separate disease process, such as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. Here we describe a case with such renal biopsy findings, review previously reported cases, and discuss possible implications for the pathogenesis of the coexistence of these lesions.

### Membranous nephropathy in patients with HIV: A report of 11 cases [^113sEEzt]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The spectrum of renal pathology in patients infected with HIV is broad and includes HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN); focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS); thrombotic microangiopathy; and HIV-associated immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK), among others. HIVICK is a heterogeneous category of disease, comprised of specific, well-characterized glomerular diseases (e.g. IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, etc), as well as immune-complex mediated diseases not otherwise specified, including those with "lupus-like" features. In the era of antiretroviral therapy, some biopsy series in patients infected with HIV have suggested that the prevalence of HIVICK exceeds that of HIVAN. The precise role that HIV plays in the development of HIVICK remains unknown, and studies of clinical outcomes in HIVICK have been hampered largely by small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of diseases falling into this umbrella category.

Among patients with HIVICK, membranous nephropathy (MN) has been reported in approximately 3–30% of cases. Several studies have demonstrated that patients with HIV and MN are often co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B viruses (HBV), and/or syphilis, which are themselves independently associated with MN, challenging a causal association between MN and HIV. At the time of writing, no study specifically investigating MN in patients with HIV who lack known co-infections has been reported. In the past decade, many important advances in the understanding of idiopathic MN have been made, including the discovery of antigens.

### The five types of glomerulonephritis classified by pathogenesis, activity and chronicity (GN-AC) [^112YLhDF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The lesion-based diagnostic approach acts as a barrier to understanding and managing glomerulonephritis (GN). Some examples illustrate the limitations of this approach better.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is perhaps the best example of how using descriptive terms can hamper progress by causing confusion. The broad differential diagnosis of MPGN encompasses completely different disorders with different therapies, disqualifying the use of this term to define a disease entity. The lesion pattern of MPGN can easily be replaced by more specific histopathological descriptions such as immune complex GN (infection or autoimmune), monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) with monotypic deposits, or C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) with the absence or low levels of immunoglobulins in the presence of C3.

C3GN is another descriptive term that may encompass a genetic disease, autoimmunity, or a monoclonal gammopathy as the underlying disease, each requiring different treatments. Even though the upcoming complement inhibitors may show effects on all forms of C3GN, a detailed diagnostic work-up for the sake of correct categorization is still needed to define the adjunct and duration of treatment. For instance, monoclonal gammopathy-related C3GN may require additional therapeutics.

Lupus nephritis remains categorized by the World Health Organization or International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classes, which do not accurately reflect the extent of the disease, do not clearly predict long-term outcomes, and do not define clinical management. Re-biopsy studies comparing classes in the first and second biopsies are often distracting, while activity and chronicity indices are likely to guide lupus nephritis management.

### Case report: A man with untreated rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, membranous nephropathy and pulmonary sarcoidosis [^111pPyFX]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Renal involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis was not included during the development of the aforementioned GISC criteria. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was known to be the predominant histologic pattern in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In a retrospective analysis of the 62 cases of non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (GN) identified in the French CryoVas Survey, 92.5% of the cases had a pathological feature of MPGN, with mesangial proliferative GN constituting the rest of the pathology and none of the cases showing a membranous pattern on biopsy.

On detailed review of the renal pathology of our patient, there were rare eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi (Figs. 2, 3); these have been traditionally viewed as a characteristic feature of cryoglobulinemic GN, correlating with rapid immunoglobulin (often IgM) deposition into the glomerular basement membrane. However, the specificity of this feature is less clear in the background of membranous GN instead of MPGN.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^111ejzsc]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The following definitions were applied: hematuria is defined as having more than five red blood cells per high-power field. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by 24-hour urine protein greater than 3.5 g/day, peripheral edema, and hypoalbuminemia (1.2 mg/dl). Proteinuria is reported in g/day, when available, or as a urine protein/creatinine ratio.

For the purpose of outcome analysis, the definitions are as follows:

- **Complete remission**: Remission of proteinuria to less than 500 mg/day with normal renal function.
- **Partial remission**: A reduction in proteinuria by at least 50% and to less than 2 g/day with stable renal function (no more than a 20% increase in serum creatinine).
- **Persistent kidney dysfunction**: Failure to meet criteria for complete or partial remission but not reaching end-stage kidney disease; this includes patients with unremitting proteinuria or progressive chronic kidney disease.
- **End-stage kidney disease**: Requiring renal replacement therapy.

### The management of membranous nephropathy-an update [^113Gx43x]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

In recent decades, several important advances have taken place in the understanding of the pathogenesis underlying membranous nephropathy (MN) that have sparked renewed interest in its management. Four landmark trials in MN and a fifth clinical trial, which was a pilot study, have been published in recent years. The results from some of these trials have had a significant impact on the recommendations included in the 2021 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases, representing a significant step forward compared with the previous guideline in several aspects, including diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment strategies. However, considering the rapidly evolving advances in the knowledge of MN and the recent publication of the STARMEN and RI-CYCLO trials, several recommendations contained in the guideline warrant updates. This article provides a perspective of the Immunonephrology Working Group of the European Renal Association regarding the management of MN in native kidneys of adult patients.

The only other abnormality detected was hypocomplementemia. This is the first report of biopsy-proven typical MPGN in patients with few urinary abnormalities. A renal biopsy should be considered in children with hypocomplementemia, regardless of urinalysis findings, to exclude MPGN.

### Deep learning-based framework for the distinction of membranous nephropathy: a new approach through hyperspectral imagery [^1152Fm9c]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome in adult patients across all ethnicities and often leads to end-stage renal disease. Data confirm that MN accounts for approximately 20–40% of all patients with nephrotic syndrome worldwide. Most cases are idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN), with the remainder being secondary membranous nephropathy (SMN) attributed to various causes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignancy, and hepatitis B virus infection.

More than 257 million individuals globally are estimated to suffer from chronic HBV infection, leading to nearly 1 million deaths annually. HBV infection is prevalent in China, with approximately 20% of individuals developing extrahepatic manifestations. Among the extrahepatic manifestations related to HBV infection, HBV-related membranous nephropathy is a common outcome. The most crucial aspect of MN diagnosis is to distinguish between idiopathic and secondary disease based on laboratory examinations and renal biopsy outcomes. These values determine specific treatment decisions and guide long-term prognosis.

Conventional approaches to detecting glomerular hepatitis antigen/antibody include positive immunofluorescence outcomes and specific pathological features found in renal biopsy tissue using light and electron microscopy. In theory, IMN patients are associated with only immune complex deposition under the epithelial tissue and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). HBV-MN patients were…

### Consensus definitions for glomerular lesions by light and electron microscopy: Recommendations from a working group of the Renal Pathology Society [^113hWsYd]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, scoring systems for multiple glomerular diseases have emerged, as have consortia of pathologists and nephrologists for the study of glomerular diseases, including correlation of pathologic findings with clinical features and outcomes. However, one important limitation faced by members of these consortia and other renal pathologists and nephrologists, in both investigative work and routine practice, remains a lack of uniformity and precision in clearly defining the morphologic lesions on which the scoring systems are based.

In response to this issue, the Renal Pathology Society organized a working group to identify the most frequently observed glomerular lesions using light microscopy and electron microscopy. The group aimed to review the literature to capture the published definitions most often used for each lesion, and determine consensus terms and definitions for each lesion through a series of online and in-person meetings.

The defined lesions or abnormal findings are not specific to any individual disease or subset of diseases; rather, they can be applied across the full spectrum of glomerular diseases and within the context of different scoring systems used for evaluating and reporting these diseases. In addition to facilitating glomerular disease research, standardized terms and definitions are expected to help harmonize the reporting of medical kidney diseases worldwide, leading to more precise diagnoses and improved patient care.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (dense deposit disease): An update [^114xjdCn]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN II) is a rare disease characterized by the deposition of abnormal electron-dense material within the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney and often within Bruch's membrane in the eye. The diagnosis is predominantly made in patients between the ages of 5 and 15 years, and within 10 years, approximately half progress to end-stage renal disease, occasionally accompanied by the late comorbidity of visual impairment. The pathophysiologic basis of MPGN II is associated with the uncontrolled systemic activation of the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade.

In most patients, the loss of complement regulation is caused by C3 nephritic factor, an autoantibody directed against the C3 convertase of the AP; however, in some patients, mutations in the factor H gene have been identified. For these patients, plasma replacement therapy can prevent renal failure, but for the majority, there is no proven effective treatment. Notably, the disease recurs in virtually all renal allografts, and a high percentage of these ultimately fail.

The development of molecular diagnostic tools and new therapies directed at controlling the AP of the complement cascade, either locally in the kidney or at the systemic level, may lead to effective treatments for MPGN II.

### The ASN in-training examination and the ABIM certifying examination: Time for a new testing paradigm [^113jga51]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2009, a new computer-based in-training examination (ITE) was created by the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) in conjunction with the National Board of Medical Examiners to assess the medical knowledge of fellows training in nephrology. The ITE, patterned after the American Board of Internal Medicine certifying examination for nephrology (ABIM-CE), allowed fellows and training program directors (TPDs) to compare their performance with programs nationwide.

However, despite using case vignettes to simulate real-life clinical experiences, the nation's graduating fellows answered a mean of only 69% of the questions correctly. Although unpublicized, the ABIM-CE passing grade can be estimated to be approximately 65%, resulting in a passing rate of 94%. The ABIM states that they are testing 85% synthesis and clinical judgment, rather than recall memory. So, are we to conclude from these two exams that the medical knowledge of our graduating nephrology fellows allows them to properly manage only about two-thirds of their patients? Rather, the construction of the test questions and their relevance to clinical practice should be reassessed.

The time has come for a new testing paradigm, one that would require candidates passing the ABIM-CE to score 85% to 90% correct answers to more relevant "core" examination questions that assess the actual medical knowledge needed to practice competently in our subspecialty. If the ABIM-CE was revised, the ASN ITE, with no specific passing grade, could then test core and "factual" recall knowledge with feedback of questions to TPDs.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^1119vBMF]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Glomerular involvement is not uncommonly present in patients with paraproteinemia. The paraprotein-associated glomerulopathies are classified according to the findings on renal biopsy utilizing light, immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy in combination with the clinical information. Glomerular disorders in this category include immunoglobulin (Ig)-related amyloidosis, immunotactoid GN, type 1 cryoglobulinemic GN, monoclonal Ig deposition disease, proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits, and C3 glomerulopathy with monoclonal gammopathy. These cases commonly fall into the category of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance when the associated hematological process does not meet diagnostic criteria for overt multiple myeloma or B-cell lymphoma. Even in the lack of a diagnostic hematological process, the monoclonal Ig can have serious renal consequences and treatment of the underlying clonal process is frequently warranted.

It has recently been reported that Ig proteins occasionally show false negative staining by routine IF. These deposits can be 'unmasked' by performing IF on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue after protease digestion (paraffin IF). Applying this technique to cases that show a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) pattern has enabled this case series detailing the first clinicopathological description of glomerulopathy with an MPGN pattern by light microscopy and masked monotypic Ig deposits by IF. All these patients had an associated underlying clonal hematological disorder, and many of them would have been misdiagnosed.

### American Board of Internal Medicine nephrology procedure requirements for initial certification: Time for a change and pursuing consensus in the nephrology community [^111QnoKu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In 1988, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) defined essential procedural skills in nephrology, requiring candidates for ABIM certification to demonstrate skills necessary for placement of temporary dialysis vascular access, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and percutaneous renal biopsy. In 1996, continuous renal replacement therapy was added to the list of requirements. These procedure requirements have not been modified since 1996, although the practice of nephrology has changed dramatically.

In March 2021, the ABIM Nephrology Board began a policy journey to revise the procedure requirements for nephrology certification. With guidance from nephrology diplomates, training program directors, professional and patient organizations, and other stakeholders, the ABIM Nephrology Board revised the procedure requirements to reflect practice and national priorities. The approved changes include the Opportunity to Train standard for placement of temporary dialysis catheters, percutaneous kidney biopsies, and home hemodialysis. This new standard better reflects the state of training in most programs, and the requirements for home dialysis therapies training will align with national priorities to address the underuse of home dialysis therapies.

This perspective details the ABIM process for considering changes to the certification procedure requirements and how ABIM collaborated with the larger nephrology community in considering revisions and additions to these requirements.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: No longer the same disease and may need very different treatment [^113k9FBs]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a pattern of glomerular injury that may be primary or secondary to infections, autoimmune diseases, and hematological disorders. Primary C3G and IC-MPGN are rare, and the prognosis is unfavorable. Based on immunofluorescence findings, MPGN has been classified into complement-mediated C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and immune complex-mediated MPGN (IC-MPGN). However, this classification leaves a number of issues unresolved. The finding of genetic and acquired complement abnormalities in both C3G and IC-MPGN indicates that they represent a heterogeneous spectrum rather than distinct diseases.

An unsupervised hierarchical clustering in a cohort of patients with primary C3G and IC-MPGN identified four distinct pathogenetic patterns, characterized by specific histologic and clinical features, and genetic and acquired complement abnormalities. These results provide the groundwork for a more accurate diagnosis and the development of targeted therapies. The drugs that are currently used, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, are frequently ineffective in primary C3G and IC-MPGN.

Eculizumab, an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, has been used occasionally in single cases or small series; however, only a few patients have achieved remission. This heterogeneous response could be related to the extent of terminal complement activation, which may vary substantially from patient to patient. Several drugs that target the complement system at different levels are under investigation for C3G and IC-MPGN. However, clinical trials to test new therapies are needed.

### Performance on the nephrology in-training examination and ABIM nephrology certification examination outcomes [^116HKzps]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Medical specialty and subspecialty fellowship programs administer subject-specific in-training examinations to provide feedback about the level of medical knowledge to fellows preparing for subsequent board certification. This study evaluated the association between the American Society of Nephrology In-Training Examination and the American Board of Internal Medicine Nephrology Certification Examination in terms of scores and passing status.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: The study included 1,684 nephrology fellows who completed the American Society of Nephrology In-Training Examination in their second year of fellowship training between 2009 and 2014. Regression analysis examined the association between In-Training Examination and first-time Nephrology Certification Examination scores as well as passing status relative to other standardized assessments.

- **Results**: This cohort included primarily men (62%) and international medical school graduates (62%). Fellows had an average age of 32 years old at the time of first completing the Nephrology Certification Examination. An overwhelming majority (89%) passed the Nephrology Certification on their first attempt. In-Training Examination scores showed the strongest association with first-time Nephrology Certification Examination scores, accounting for approximately 50% of the total explained variance in the model. Each standard deviation increase in In-Training Examination scores was associated with a difference of 30 units (95% confidence interval, 27 to 33) in certification performance.

### Performance on the American Board of Family Medicine certification examination by country of medical training [^111yYci8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Performance on the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) Certification and Recertification Examinations by country of medical school training has not been examined. Based on internal medicine patterns, we hypothesize that examinees trained in the United States and Canada would outperform examinees trained in other countries.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2011, data on the ABFM examinations were obtained from the ABFM. Fisher exact and χ² tests were performed across years based on the country of examinee training. Simple linear regression was performed to evaluate pass rates over time. All statistics were performed using an α = 0.05.

- **Results**: The overall pass rate over the study period was 84.4% (74,821 of 88,680). The pass rate for US medical graduates (USMGs) was 88.3% (60,328 of 68,332). The pass rate for Canadian medical graduates (CMGs) was 93.8% (872 of 930). The pass rate for non-Canadian foreign medical graduates (NC-FMGs) was 70.1% (13,621 of 19,418). CMGs had a higher pass rate than USMGs (P < .001) and NC-FMGs (P < .001). Simple linear regression showed significant decreasing trends over time for all examinees (P = 0.02), for USMGs (P = 0.02), and for CMGs (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: USMGs and CMGs outperform NC-FMGs on the ABFM certification and recertification examinations. These findings may alter acceptance patterns for Family Medicine residency programs.

### Diagnostic tests and treatment options in glomerular disease: 2014 update [^114LdPAy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Glomerular diseases have historically been challenging disorders to comprehend and treat for patients and physicians alike. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but the link between pathophysiology and the histologic representation of kidney injury has remained elusive in many of these diseases. Consequently, the treatment of glomerular disease usually involves therapies that are not specific to disease pathogenesis, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and various immunosuppression regimens.

Recent research has resulted in greater insight into some glomerular diseases, providing hope that new diagnostic tests and treatments targeting disease-specific mechanisms are on the horizon. We review recent progress on the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of four glomerular diseases: immunoglobulin A nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the C3 glomerulopathies, and idiopathic membranous nephropathy.

### Deep learning-based framework for the distinction of membranous nephropathy: A new approach through hyperspectral imagery [^113Jyxy4]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Medical hyperspectral imaging has been employed in several areas, including blood vessel visualization enhancement, estimation of cholesterol levels, histopathological tissue analysis, and identification of glioblastoma. However, there are no studies regarding membranous nephropathy nor the distinction between idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and hepatitis B virus-associated membranous nephropathy (HBV-MN).

Potentially, the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the renal pathology field can improve the situation in three ways:

- **HSI can extract intrinsic features in real-time**: Rapid detection of HBV-MN and IMN on unstained slides could enhance the results of immunoelectron microscopy by binding the HBV antigen/antibody before fixation and embedding of the renal tissue.
- **Advancements in deep learning (DL) algorithms and frameworks**: Different glomerular diseases with immune complex formations, such as IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and dense deposit disease (DDD), can be diagnosed using HSI.
- **HSI reduces variability in traditional histological techniques**: Traditional techniques' staining reaction degree could be affected by conditions like room temperature, pH of the solution, or reaction time. As a result, pathological images from different facilities may vary. HSI avoids uncontrollable factors and subjective judgment limitations, potentially contributing to standardizing diagnosis criteria for certain diseases.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study assessed how changes between 2010 and 2019 in characteristics of 4094 graduates of US ACGME-accredited nephrology fellowship programs taking the ABIM nephrology certifying exam for the first time, and how characteristics of their fellowship programs were associated with exam performance. The primary outcome measure was performance on the nephrology certifying exam. Fellowship program pass rates over the decade were also studied.

- **Results**: Lower IM certifying exam score, older age, female sex, international medical graduate (IMG) status, and having trained at a smaller nephrology fellowship program were associated with poorer nephrology certifying exam performance. The mean IM certifying exam percentile score among those who subsequently took the nephrology certifying exam decreased from 56.7 (SD, 27.9) to 46.1 (SD, 28.7) from 2010 to 2019. When examining individuals with comparable IM certifying exam performance, IMGs performed less well than United States medical graduates (USMGs) on the nephrology certifying exam. In 2019, only 57% of nephrology fellowship programs had aggregate 3-year certifying exam pass rates ≥ 80% among their graduates.

- **Conclusions**: Changes in IM certifying exam performance, certain trainee demographics, and poorer performance among various demographics were identified.

### Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), various diseases or a spectrum of complement-mediated glomerular diseases [^115tPxnR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, patients with kidney diseases caused by genetic or acquired dysregulation of the complement alternative pathway have been grouped into clinical syndromes: C3 glomerulopathy (C3GN/DDD) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), specifically atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Recent data suggest that these diseases share a common pathophysiology and that patients can transition between glomerulopathies in this spectrum.

Histopathologically, the main difference cited is the immunofluorescence (IF) findings, with C3 predominance in C3 glomerulopathy — compared with immunoglobulins and complements in immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) — and negative IF in TMA.

We report a case in which a patient presented with hypertension, seizures, proteinuria, renal impairment, and immune complex-mediated MPGN on kidney biopsy. Months later, she presented with classical TMA. She failed to respond to steroids and plasma exchange therapy but subsequently made a remarkable haematological and renal recovery after eculizumab treatment, thus supporting an underlying complement dysregulation and a diagnosis of aHUS.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: A systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case, it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: "Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?" This work, which is both evidence and experience-based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

- **Summary**: The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing and the rationale for each test.

- **Key message**: This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Glomerular disease: Predicting outcomes in idiopathic membranous nephropathy [^1152rD9E]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Several immunosuppressive treatments have demonstrated their efficacy in idiopathic membranous nephropathy, but spontaneous remission occurs in more than 30% of patients. The availability of a validated biomarker that is easy to measure and can accurately predict long-term outcomes would be very helpful for tailoring treatment of the disease to the individual.

### Mycophenolate mofetil or standard therapy for membranous nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: A pilot study [^1137UWoF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

The treatment regimens for patients with nephrotic syndrome due to idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are based on steroids and/or cytotoxic agents. Data on the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for these conditions are scarce and confounding.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy of an MMF-based therapy with standard therapies in inducing remission in adult nephrotics with MN and FSGS in a randomized pilot study. MMF was administered at 2 g/day for 6 months along with prednisolone at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2–3 months. Conventional therapy involved prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for 3–6 months for FSGS and alternating monthly cycles of steroids and cyclophosphamide for 6 months for MN. The primary endpoint was the change in urinary protein/creatinine ratio.

- **Results**: A total of 54 patients (21 MN and 33 FSGS) were recruited; 28 were randomized to receive MMF (group A) and 26 were on conventional treatment (group B). There was no difference in the proportion of patients achieving remission between the two groups (64% and 80% in MN and 70% and 69% in FSGS). The frequency of relapses and incidence of infections was also similar. FSGS patients in group A achieved remission faster and received a lower cumulative steroid dose.

- **Conclusions**: A 6-month treatment with MMF is as effective as conventional treatment for the primary treatment of MN and FSGS in the short term. It induces remission faster and reduces steroid exposure in FSGS patients. Studies with more cases and longer follow-up are required to evaluate its impact on the preservation of kidney function.

### Membranous nephropathy with crescents: a series of 19 cases [^112SaoBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Membranous nephropathy (MN) with crescents is rare and, in the absence of lupus, is usually associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) nephritis or antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis. Only rare cases of crescentic MN without ANCA or anti-GBM have been reported.

- **Study design**: Case series.

- **Setting & participants**: 19 patients with ANCA- and anti-GBM-negative crescentic MN and no clinical evidence of systemic lupus.

- **Outcomes**: Clinical features, kidney biopsy findings, laboratory results, treatment, and follow-up of patients with crescentic MN.

- **Results**: Mean age was 55 (range, 5–86) years. All patients presented with proteinuria (mean protein excretion, 11.5 [range, 3.3–29] g/d) and nearly all had hematuria; 16 of 19 (84%) patients had decreased estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs; mean serum creatinine, 2.9 [range, 0.4–10] mg/dL; mean eGFR, 39.7 [range, 4 to > 100] mL/min/1.73 m²). Glomeruli showed on average 25% (range, 2%-73%) involvement by crescents. All showed a membranous pattern; 7 showed mesangial and 2 showed segmental endocapillary proliferation.

	- By immunofluorescence, all cases showed granular subepithelial immunoglobulin G (IgG) and κ and λ light chains, and all but one showed C3; 5 showed C1q or IgA.
	- Electron microscopy revealed stages I-III MN; 38% of cases were M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) associated, indicating that at least some were primary MN.

Follow-up clinical data were available for all patients (mean, 22 [range, 1.5–138] months). Fourteen patients received immunosuppressive therapy (details truncated).

### Manifestations of complement-mediated and immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: A comparative consecutive series [^114RRWM2]. Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was recently reclassified to reflect its underlying causes as a complement-mediated and immune complex-mediated disease. This reclassification is based on renal biopsy immunofluorescence examination, rendering the former electron microscopy classification obsolete. In this report, we describe related eye findings in patients with MPGN according to the new classification.

This study is a retrospective case series including all Mayo Clinic Rochester patients with pathology-confirmed complement- and immune complex-mediated MPGN who had available ophthalmology records from 1997 through 2014. The medical and pathologic records of these patients, along with their eye examination results, were reviewed for the years 1997 through 2014.

- **Main outcome measures**: The number of patients and eyes with MPGN-related pathologic features were examined, and visual acuity was considered.

The results revealed that among 23 patients with complement-mediated MPGN and available eye examination results, 9 patients (39%) and 17 eyes (37%) exhibited retinal pathologic features likely related to the same underlying pathophysiologic process as their renal disease. Additionally, 5 patients (22%) and 6 eyes (13%) experienced significant vision loss. For immune complex-mediated MPGN, there were 23 patients with available eye examination results; however, only 2 patients (9%) and 4 eyes (9%) showed retinal pathologic features potentially related to the same underlying renal process, with none experiencing significant vision loss.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^1128VPJ7]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a pattern of glomerular injury recognized on kidney biopsy when glomeruli show mesangial expansion and basement membrane duplication by light microscopy. Traditionally, MPGN has been divided into three categories based on the appearance and location of the immune deposits by electron microscopy (types 1, 2, and 3). More recently, there has been a shift toward a pathogenesis-based classification system based on the pattern of staining by immunofluorescence (IF).

Specifically, biopsies that show the light and electron microscopic findings of MPGN are now categorized as C3 glomerulopathy when there is C3-only or dominant staining as identified by IF. This is an important distinction, as this designation implies a unique pathogenesis in which the glomerular disease is driven by abnormalities of the alternative complement cascade.

C3 glomerulonephritis (C3 GN) with monoclonal gammopathy is a subtype of C3 glomerulopathy characterized by C3 deposition in the glomeruli with little to no immunoglobulin in the setting of a monoclonal gammopathy. The paraprotein in these cases is thought to cause GN indirectly through interacting with complement regulatory proteins, leading to overactivation of the alternative complement pathway. However, based on the findings in this study, it is likely that at least some of these cases are caused by paraprotein deposition in the glomeruli, resulting in injury.

The underlying pathogenic driver of this disease is the presence of a clonal plasma cell or B cell population in most cases. Therefore, it is best considered a hematological disorder-associated glomerulonephritis (GN) as far as treatment is concerned.

Regarding medical management for membranous nephropathy, particularly concerning anticoagulant therapy, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines emphasize recognizing that the risk of venous thromboembolic events is high if serum albumin levels are below 20 g/L by bromocresol purple, or below 25 g/L by bromocresol green. It is crucial to assess bleeding risk using glomerulonephritis tools. If the risk is high, initiate aspirin. If the risk is low, initiate either warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin in combination with aspirin.

### Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with masked monotypic immunoglobulin deposits [^116Jm16w]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether the ultrastructural findings can predict whether paraffin IF will show monoclonal deposits or not in patients with clinical evidence of monoclonal gammopathy and renal biopsy findings that would have been consistent with C3 GN based on frozen IF only, we compared the ultrastructural findings of seven cases of true C3 GN with monoclonal gammopathy (without masked monoclonal deposits) versus four cases of MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits and staining for C3 only on frozen tissue from the Mayo cohort. As evident from the data in Supplementary Table S1 online, subepithelial 'humps', intramembranous deposits, or deposits with only mild electron density, seen in 43%, 57%, and 29% of cases of true C3 GN with monoclonal gammopathy, respectively, were not present in any case of MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits, while organized deposits were only seen in MPGN with masked monoclonal deposits.

Follow-up data was available for 10 patients with a mean follow-up of 12.2 months (ranging from 2 to 27 months). The medications used in the treatment of each patient are listed in Table 1. Most of these patients were treated with therapy directed against the underlying hematological neoplasia, if present. At follow-up, 2 patients (20%) had partial remissions, 6 patients (60%) had persistent renal dysfunction, and 1 patient progressed to end-stage renal disease. The remaining patient experienced normalization of serum creatinine, but follow-up 24-hour urinary protein collection was not available.

### USMLE performance, subsequent standardized testing, and ABIM certification exam preparation for internal medicine residency programs: A narrative review [^113YFhLh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Standardized examinations measure progress throughout medical education. Successful completion of the American Board of Internal Medicine Certification Examination (ABIM-CE) benchmarks completion of internal medicine (IM) residency training. Recent declines in initial ABIM-CE pass rates may prompt residency programs to examine strategies to improve learner performance. We synthesized published literature on associations between the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), in-training examination (ITE), and board preparation to support residents for ABIM-CE. We searched MEDLINE for test performance and preparation strategies for IM board certification during training. Relevant articles published until March 15, 2024, were screened using pre-defined criteria for narrative review, then codified into three domains (USMLE, ITE, curriculum/program strategies).

- **Themes drawn from articles focused on USMLE include**: Validity in predicting CE performance, noting (1) failing USMLE Step 1 is associated with failing ABIM-CE, (2) any USMLE score in the 70th percentile is predictive of passing.

Lastly, inferences from curriculum- and program-focused articles contribute to considerations for training programs seeking guidance on learning augmentation plans to improve resident performance on ABIM-CE.

### Kidney biopsy in patients with glomerulonephritis: Is the earlier the better [^113krqU4]? BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

A limitation in the analysis of the efficiency of drug treatment is that response rates have improved over time due to the availability of refined dosing schemes and new drugs. However, this does not limit the principal finding of this observational study, because no therapy was withheld and all patients had access to optimized medical treatment provided by the national sickness fund during the observation period.

This study has not compared individual treatments within groups of patients with different glomerulonephritis (GN) entities, and numbers within subgroups are too small for such analysis. While this is a large study, the median follow-up is four years, which may not be long enough to observe clinically relevant outcomes or progression in diseases such as IgA nephropathy or membranous nephropathy.

A further limitation of our study is that only a controlled interventional trial may demonstrate if baseline differences account for the results seen. However, ethical concerns prevent the conduct of such a trial.

### Concurrent IgG4-related membranous nephropathy and proliferative diabetic kidney disease: A diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic strategy in long-standing diabetes [^116GnwQn]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this case provides several critical clinical insights into the management of complex renal disease in patients with long-standing diabetes. First, this case underscores the indispensability of renal biopsy for patients with diabetes who present with atypical features, such as nephrotic-range proteinuria disproportionate to the duration of diabetes or the degree of retinopathy. Second, the diagnosis of IgG4-MN, particularly in the absence of classic TIN, requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary evaluation integrating serological, radiological, and extrarenal histopathological findings. Finally, this report demonstrates that a carefully tailored, low-intensity immunosuppressive regimen can achieve favorable renal outcomes without compromising metabolic control, highlighting the importance of individualized therapy in this complex, comorbid patient population. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to guide appropriate treatment and mitigate the risks associated with both complex renal disease and its treatment.

### Idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis: Does it exist [^116RasWB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

When membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) was first delineated as a discrete clinico-pathological entity more than a half-century ago, most cases were regarded as idiopathic (or primary). Advances in the analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms and etiologies underlying the lesion of MPGN have radically altered the prevalence of the truly idiopathic form of MPGN. In addition, MPGN as a category among renal biopsies showing glomerulonephritis has diminished over time.

In the modern era, MPGN is mainly classified morphologically on the basis of immunoglobulin (Ig; monoclonal or polyclonal) and complement (C3 only or combined with Ig) deposition, and secondarily on the basis of its appearance on ultra-structural examination. Idiopathic MPGN is a diagnosis of exclusion, at least in many adults and a portion of children, and a systematic approach to evaluation will often uncover a secondary cause, such as an infection, autoimmune disease, monoclonal gammopathy, neoplasia, complement dysregulation, or a chronic thrombotic microangiopathy. Idiopathic MPGN remains an 'endangered species' after its separation from these known causes.

### C3 glomerulopathy: consensus report [^112KS5ZL]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

More information is required on the relationship of morphological changes in biopsies with clinical features, clinical course, and outcome. Specific research questions include: What features on biopsy are predictive of the clinical course? Are there correlations between biopsy appearances and underlying pathogenic processes, particularly specific genetic mutations? Are there characteristic electron microscopic features that suggest C3 glomerulonephritis?

Which C3 fragments are deposited in glomeruli in C3 glomerulopathy, and is there any significance to their relative locations? Are these C3 fragments different from those seen in either 'MPGN type I with immunoglobulin deposits' or those seen in typical post-infectious GN? What is the etiologic and clinical significance of subepithelial hump-shaped deposits in cases of C3 glomerulopathy?

How can we refine the diagnosis of C3 glomerulopathy to address cases that also have immunoglobulin deposits?
