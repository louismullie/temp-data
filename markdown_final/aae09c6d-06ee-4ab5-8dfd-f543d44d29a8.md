## Question

High fever with swollen glands

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient presenting with high fever and swollen glands. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the physical findings to distinguish localized from generalized lymphadenopathy and identify malignancy features. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and outline an initial diagnostic workup. Finally, I will consider empiric management, when to escalate to biopsy or advanced imaging, and special populations and medication-related causes, while continuously checking for pitfalls and correcting assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities, because I need to ensure we do not miss life-threatening entities. High fever with lymphadenopathy warrants urgent evaluation for sepsis, severe infection, malignancy, and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndromes. I should check for hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, respiratory distress, and signs of organ failure, and I must not forget medication-induced DRESS or serotonin syndrome, which can present with fever and lymphadenopathy and can be fatal if unrecognized [^114fgWhW] [^111oVJYJ] [^116EJVzK].

> Next, I should review the history with a structured approach, and I need to ensure I capture chronology, systemic features, exposures, and medications. I will ask about duration and tempo of nodes, associated B symptoms, sore throat, rash, arthralgia, and localizing symptoms; I should confirm travel, animal exposures, sexual history, recent vaccines, and immunocompromise, and I must obtain a meticulous medication list including antiepileptics, psychotropics, and immunomodulators because several can cause fever and lymphadenopathy or DRESS, and I should double-check for zonisamide, ethosuximide, phenytoin, olanzapine–fluoxetine, pimecrolimus, and bupropion as notable triggers [^116EJVzK] [^1153L5YU] [^114Zexwh] [^117TQX1x] [^114fgWhW] [^1126hjWG] [^116pMgUQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the physical examination strategy. I will distinguish localized from generalized lymphadenopathy, characterize nodes by size, consistency, fixation, and tenderness, and look for red flags such as nodes larger than 2 cm, hard or matted consistency, fixation, supraclavicular or epitrochlear location, and the absence of tenderness, which raise concern for malignancy or granulomatous disease; I will also examine for pharyngitis, tonsillar exudates, splenomegaly, rash, and mucocutaneous findings that support infectious mononucleosis or streptococcal disease, and I should remember that posterior cervical nodes and atypical lymphocytosis increase the likelihood of mononucleosis [^111uRjxx] [^116EJVzK] [^112HmwKa].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, and I need to ensure I prioritize by prevalence and severity. Infectious causes are most common and include EBV infectious mononucleosis with fever, sore throat, and posterior cervical nodes; streptococcal pharyngitis with anterior cervical nodes and exudative tonsillitis; mumps with parotid swelling; HIV with generalized lymphadenopathy; dengue in endemic regions with high fever, rash, and nodes; and less common entities such as tularemia, plague, and melioidosis depending on exposure history; I should also consider tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial disease, especially with persistent nodes and systemic symptoms [^112HmwKa] [^1162iWrc] [^117Y2bwv] [^116Rx8Nc] [^113ii2TQ] [^116EJVzK] [^1177WXV1] [^111eVdEj].

> But wait, what if the nodes are hard, fixed, or supraclavicular? I should double-check for malignancy. Lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin types, can present with fever and lymphadenopathy, and I should also consider intravascular large B-cell lymphoma when fever, cytopenias, and organ dysfunction coexist with minimal or absent peripheral nodes. Castleman disease and TAFRO syndrome can mimic severe systemic inflammation with fever and multi-region nodes. And I should not overlook solid organ metastases to supraclavicular nodes, which are a red flag for advanced disease [^1138n77B] [^116aw8Z7] [^112RNprj] [^111LUEdA] [^111uRjxx].

> Let me consider autoimmune and inflammatory etiologies, and I should confirm that I am not missing mimics. Sarcoidosis can cause bilateral parotid or lacrimal gland swelling with systemic symptoms. Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease presents with painful cervical nodes, fever, and leukopenia and is a critical benign mimic of lymphoma. And subacute thyroiditis can cause fever, neck pain, and thyrotoxicosis, sometimes following viral illness or vaccination, so I should palpate the thyroid carefully and check thyroid function if neck tenderness is present [^115P62NM] [^111qNbzm] [^111buqxU] [^1165nScU] [^116wADRG] [^115mg4w2].

> I need to check for drug-induced etiologies explicitly, because missing DRESS or related syndromes can be dangerous. Zonisamide, ethosuximide, and phenytoin can cause systemic hypersensitivity with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and organ involvement; olanzapine–fluoxetine can precipitate DRESS or serotonin syndrome; pimecrolimus has been associated with viral infections and lymphadenopathy; and bupropion can rarely cause severe hypersensitivity with fever and nodes; if suspected, the offending agent should be stopped promptly and appropriate supportive care initiated [^1153L5YU] [^114Zexwh] [^117TQX1x] [^114fgWhW] [^1126hjWG] [^116pMgUQ].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic workup, and I need to ensure it is targeted yet comprehensive. Basic labs should include CBC with differential, ESR and CRP, comprehensive metabolic panel, LDH, and urinalysis. I should add EBV serology with heterophile testing, HIV testing, and streptococcal testing when indicated. Chest radiography is appropriate for persistent nodes or systemic symptoms. And if nodes persist beyond four weeks or red flags are present, I should proceed to excisional or core biopsy rather than fine-needle aspiration to preserve architecture for lymphoma evaluation, while reserving FNA for accessible superficial nodes when malignancy risk is low [^116EJVzK] [^113wGzNw] [^112HmwKa] [^1162iWrc].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate imaging and advanced diagnostics. If the diagnosis remains elusive and inflammatory markers are elevated, FDG-PET/CT can help localize metabolically active disease and guide biopsy. In children with persistent unexplained lymphadenopathy, ultrasound can characterize nodes and identify abscesses or atypical infections. And in suspected thyroiditis or thyroid abscess, neck ultrasound with Doppler and, if needed, fine-needle aspiration can clarify etiology and guide therapy [^112FQ7yj] [^112YtB8B] [^1167Vcbv] [^114Sg8ma].

> I will now examine empiric management, but I need to ensure I do not mask a malignancy or serious infection. Supportive care with antipyretics and hydration is appropriate for viral illnesses such as EBV or dengue; for suspected streptococcal pharyngitis with high pretest probability, empiric antibiotics are reasonable while awaiting culture confirmation; for mumps, management is supportive with isolation precautions; and for suspected DRESS or drug-induced hypersensitivity, immediate withdrawal of the culprit drug and specialist input are critical, with corticosteroids reserved for severe systemic involvement after infection is reasonably excluded [^112HmwKa] [^1162iWrc] [^117Y2bwv] [^113WLJcz].

> Wait, let me verify the role of corticosteroids in infectious mononucleosis, because I recall conflicting data. The Cochrane review suggests only transient benefit for sore throat at 12 hours and insufficient evidence for routine steroid use, with reports of complications; thus, steroids should be avoided for symptom control unless there is airway compromise or severe complications, and even then, the risks must be weighed carefully [^1176LuAq].

> I should double-check special populations and exposures, because they shift pretest probabilities. In children, EBV, streptococcal disease, and mumps are common, and cat-scratch disease should be considered with animal exposures. In adolescents and young adults, infectious mononucleosis predominates. In endemic regions, dengue, tuberculosis, and melioidosis rise on the list. In immunocompromised patients, HIV, opportunistic infections, and lymphoma must be prioritized. And in postpartum patients, acute systemic infection with fever and swollen nodes is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise until resolved [^112HmwKa] [^116HYrH7] [^113ii2TQ] [^111eVdEj] [^1177WXV1] [^116Rx8Nc] [^114LhxTb].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic pitfalls, because I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely. Kikuchi–Fujimoto disease can mimic lymphoma and tuberculosis and requires biopsy for diagnosis; intravascular large B-cell lymphoma lacks prominent peripheral nodes and may present with fever and organ dysfunction; and persistent unexplained fever with lymphadenopathy may represent fever of unknown origin, where a clue-directed approach and judicious use of PET/CT and tissue diagnosis offer the highest yield, and empiric antibiotics or steroids should be avoided outside specific scenarios [^111buqxU] [^116aw8Z7] [^112FQ7yj] [^114rkC3H].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, stepwise approach: triage for red flags, elicit a meticulous history including exposures and medications, distinguish localized from generalized nodes with careful examination, prioritize infectious etiologies but remain vigilant for malignancy and drug-induced disease, use a targeted initial workup, escalate to biopsy or PET/CT when nodes persist or systemic features suggest serious disease, and tailor empiric therapy while avoiding interventions that obscure diagnosis, adjusting the differential and management as new data emerge [^116EJVzK] [^112FQ7yj] [^111uRjxx].

High fever with swollen glands most often reflects **infectious mononucleosis** (EBV) [^112HmwKa], streptococcal pharyngitis [^1162iWrc], or **mumps** [^117Y2bwv], but the differential is broad and includes HIV [^116Rx8Nc], tuberculosis [^116EJVzK], lymphoma [^1138n77B], and drug reactions (e.g. DRESS) [^114fgWhW]. Red flags include **nodes > 2 cm, hard/fixed nodes, persistent fever > 1 week, weight loss, night sweats, organomegaly, or immunocompromise** [^116EJVzK]. Initial workup should include CBC, ESR/CRP, EBV serology, HIV test, strep testing, and chest X-ray; if nodes persist > 4 weeks or red flags are present, obtain ultrasound and consider excisional biopsy [^116EJVzK]. Management is cause-specific: supportive care for viral illness, antibiotics for bacterial infection, and urgent oncology/infectious disease referral for suspected malignancy or severe disease [^116EJVzK].

- Systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^113wGzNw]
- Suspicion of malignancy or granulomatous disease [^116EJVzK]

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**: provide supportive care for viral illness, antibiotics for bacterial infection, and urgent oncology/infectious disease referral for suspected malignancy or severe disease [^112FQ7yj]. Supportive care includes antipyretics, hydration, and rest; antibiotics are used for confirmed bacterial infections; and urgent referral is warranted for suspected malignancy, severe infection, or immunocompromise [^116wADRG].

---

High fever with swollen glands has a broad differential, but a **focused history, exam, and targeted tests** usually reveal the cause. Persistent nodes, systemic symptoms, or red flags should prompt imaging and biopsy to exclude malignancy or serious infection [^116EJVzK].

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources

Incidence data of mumps from 2004 to 2018 were provided by the Public Health Sciences Data Center of China, which is a component of the national scientific data sharing platform of the national science and technology infrastructure in China and covers a population of approximately 1.3 billion people from 31 provinces and regions in mainland China. Mumps is classified as a Category C infectious disease in China. Health departments command that infected patients, suspected infection patients, or infectious pathogens must be reported online within 24 h once diagnosed or be reported by means of a network report card filled out by trained health personnel and sent within 24 h if the medical institutions do not have the conditions for direct reporting on the internet. All disease‐reporting data were reviewed by professionals to ensure their accuracy and reliability. The diagnosis of mumps cases was based on the "Diagnostic Criteria for Mumps" issued by the Ministry of Health. The diagnosis is not difficult according to the epidemic situation and exposure history, as well as the characteristics of parotid gland enlargement. In case of atypical suspicious cases, further diagnosis can be made by laboratory examination. A mumps case met at least one of the following criteria: (1) a history of close contact with mumps patients 1–4 weeks before the onset of the disease; (2) fever, chills, fatigue, loss of appetite, and after 1–2 days unilateral or bilateral non‐suppurative parotid swelling and pain or other salivary gland swelling and pain; the parotid duct orifice may appear redness; (3) laboratory examination: (I) white blood cell count normal or slightly low; (ii) serum amylase was slightly or moderately elevated in 90% of patients; (iii) serological and etiological tests can also be used as diagnostic evidence.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^113kQ7Qw]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pharyngitis is a common reason for seeking medical advice. The majority of pharyngitis cases are caused by viruses, and approximately 24–37% of children's pharyngitis is caused by Group A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS). In high-income countries, rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease are rare complications of GAS infections, but they still impose a large disease burden in low-income countries. GAS pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications, such as peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscess, as well as toxin-mediated complications, scarlet fever, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. These complications are rare in high-income countries, and GAS is usually self-limited; therefore, antibiotic treatment should not be started to only prevent suppurative complications or relieve symptoms in patients with mild symptoms.

The Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat were updated in June 2020, and the Centor score was presented as a diagnostic tool for GAS pharyngitis. According to the Centor criteria, one point is given for each of the following symptoms and clinical findings: absence of cough, tender and swollen submandibular lymph nodes, tonsillar exudate or swollen tonsils, and fever ≥ 38˚C. In the guideline update Centor score is recommended to use to direct antibiotic treatment to patients with more severe symptoms and higher likelihood of GAS. Patients with mild symptoms and Centor score (0–2) are recommended to be treated symptomatically and patients with severe symptoms (3–4) are recommended to be treated based on microbiological test results. A new guideline for microbiological testing of GAS was also provided. The new guidelines recommend using a rapid antigen detection test in patients with a Centor score of 3 or more. Throat culture should only be used in patients with prolonged symptoms or in epidemic situations. The guidelines also recommend against using C-reactive protein (CRP) tests in the diagnosis of pharyngitis, as they are ineffective at distinguishing viral from bacterial pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine how the publication of the updated Finnish Current Care Guidelines affected treatment for pediatric patients, particularly the use of the Centor criteria, CRP tests, and microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS tonsillitis.

### Rifampin (Rifadin IV) [^114D1Ek3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, and pain or swelling of the joints.

Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.

Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.

Laboratory Tests

Adults treated for tuberculosis with rifampin should have baseline measurements of hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, serum creatinine, a complete blood count, and a platelet count (or estimate). Baseline tests are unnecessary in pediatric patients unless a complicating condition is known or clinically suspected.

Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary. Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity in people with normal baseline measurements is generally not necessary.

### Fever of unknown origin: a clinical approach [^115ChBjx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fevers of unknown origin remain one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges in medicine. Because fever of unknown origin may be caused by over 200 malignant/neoplastic, infectious, rheumatic/inflammatory, and miscellaneous disorders, clinicians often order non-clue-based imaging and specific testing early in the fever of unknown origin work-up, which may be inefficient/misleading. Unlike most other fever-of-unknown-origin reviews, this article presents a clinical approach. Characteristic history and physical examination findings together with key nonspecific test abnormalities are the basis for a focused clue-directed fever of unknown origin work-up.

### Consensus guidelines for evaluation and management of pulmonary disease in Sjögren's [^112Sz5e6]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Evaluating for potential Sjögren's in patients with pulmonary symptoms — Table 2 lists patient questions to screen for sicca and systemic features, including "Does your mouth feel dry?", "Do your eyes frequently feel dry, irritated, itchy, or painful?", and "Have you noticed gland swelling in your face or along the jaw line (swollen parotid and/or submandibular glands)?", and notes that such symptoms should prompt further serologic evaluation and/or rheumatology consultation.

### Scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy caused by Rickettsia massiliae [^113tSvrg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

On May, 10, 2012, a 13-year-old boy was examined for headache, high fever, and right painful neck and occipital swelling. Six days earlier, a tick had been removed from the top of his scalp, after which signs and symptoms arose and gradually worsened.

Physical examination revealed temperature 39.5°C, pulse rate 70 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. The boy appeared to be in good condition. An ≈1-cm black eschar was noted at the site of the tick bite. Palpation of the neck revealed painful bilateral adenopathies. Other lymph nodes in the occipital region were enlarged. No exanthema was noted, the liver was palpable 1 cm under the costal margins, and the spleen was not enlarged. Laboratory evaluation indicated blood cell counts and liver and kidney function within reference limits, mild elevation of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 1.2 mg/dL [reference < 0.5 mg/dL]), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43 mm/h). Ultrasonography of the neck confirmed the presence of numerous, enlarged, oval lymph nodes (maximum 17 mm) with hilar vascularity within normal limits. A scalp eschar biopsy sample and acute- and convalescent-phase (day 30) serum samples were sent to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia.

### Granulomatous diseases of the breast and axilla: radiological findings with pathological correlation [^116HYrH7]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Cat-scratch disease

Although granulomatous lymphadenitis of the axilla has multiple causes, only a few specifically have a preference for the axilla and typically spare the breast parenchyma. Cat-scratch disease, or cat-scratch fever, is one of those processes. It is caused by a bacterial infection and most commonly occurs in children after a cat scratches or bites an arm. It has worldwide distribution and has been described in all areas of North America. In northern temperate zones, it occurs more often from August through October, usually in humid, warm locales. There are an estimated 22,000 new cases of cat-scratch disease per year in the United States.

Clinical

Cat-scratch disease is usually limited to one side of the body and commonly presents as tender, swollen lymph nodes near the site of the bite or scratch. Regional lymphadenopathy occurs 1–3 weeks after inoculation. A vesicle or an erythematous papule may form at the site of initial infection, and regional lymphadenopathy (85%), axillary lymphadenopathy (27%), and fever, headache and malaise (77%) often develop. It may take 7–14 days before symptoms appear, and most cases are self-limited, resolving within 1 month with or without treatment. The lymphadenopathy may, however, persist for several months after the other symptoms have disappeared.

Mammography/ultrasound

Lymph nodes are enlarged on mammography. On ultrasound they are hypoechoic lobular or oval masses with central hyperaemia and occasional adjacent fluid. The presence of asymmetry and a hyperechoic hilum may differentiate cat-scratch disease from other aetiologies (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11
Cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae). A 59-year-old woman had a 1-month history of a left axillary mass. Ultrasound-guided biopsy showed follicular hyperplasia with non-necrotising epithelioid granulomas. B. henselae (cat-scratch disease) titre was more than 1:1,024, consistent with recent infection. a Left mediolateral-oblique view with magnified image showed a new left axillary mass (arrow). b Ultrasound showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla with lobulated margins, thickened cortices and increased cortical vascular flow

Histology

Cat-scratch disease is characterised by granulomatous inflammation on histological examination of the lymph nodes. Breast parenchymal involvement occurs less commonly; when it does, it presents as a palpable mass with enlarged lymph nodes within the axilla in 38% of patients.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^1167Vcbv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Case 3

A 73-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department because of a swollen and tender resistance in the neck for five days, and fever of 38 °C the last two days. She had difficulties to swallow. Two years earlier she had had the same experience, FNA at that time was normal and the swollenness subsided spontaneously. Epipharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were normal at inspection. CRP was 104 mg/L (< 3), ESR 40 mm/hr (< 30) and thyroid function tests were normal. The left part of the thyroid was enlarged, tender and an erythema 10–15 cm in diameter was seen in the anterior neck. Ultrasound revealed a 30x30x30 mm mass in the thyroid with low echogenicity, and a deep puncture for culture and drainage was performed and brownish fluid was extracted. She was treated with oral clindamycin 300 mg tds and oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid. The following day she continued to have high fever (38.6 °C). Thyroid surgery was considered. Due to a tick bite a week prior borrelia infection was excluded. Fever, local symptoms and laboratory subsided, she was admitted for four days and antibiotics were continued for in total 10 days. All cultures were negative. A FNA two weeks after discharge showed a colloid cyst, and she had no longer difficulties to swallow. She is still euthyroid without medication four years after this episode.

### Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone combined with high-dose methotrexate plus intrathecal chemotherapy for newly diagnosed intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (PRIMEUR-IVL): long-term results of a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial [^116aw8Z7]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare type of extranodal large B-cell lymphoma characterized by the selective growth of lymphoma cells in the lumina of small vessels of various organs. Lymphadenopathy is a common characteristic of malignant lymphomas that is usually lacking in IVLBCL, leading to delay of a timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment, resulting in poor prognosis. Awareness of IVLBCL has improved since its listing as a disease entity in the 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and patients with IVLBCL have thus received a more accurate and timely diagnosis in recent years.

Due to the lack of specific signs, the existence of IVLBCL is suspected only when systemic symptoms such as fever, general malaise and weight loss appear due to progression of the disease. Thus, most patients with IVLBCL also have fever, cytopenia, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation, and poor performance status (PS) and are graded as high-risk by the international prognostic index (IPI). Moreover, systemic involvement of organs such as the kidneys and adrenal glands is frequently observed in IVLBCL, which means that most IVLBCL patients are also graded as high-risk by the central nervous system (CNS)-IPI.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a differential for fevers and lymphadenopathy [^1165nScU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A woman in her early 20s with no significant medical history presented with tender cervical lymphadenopathy, swinging feverish episodes up to 39.6°C, a widespread maculopapular rash and polyarthralgia. She was extensively investigated as an inpatient with multiple imaging studies and blood tests to encompass the potential diagnosis of infection, malignancy or autoimmune disorders. She was discharged after undergoing an excisional cervical lymph node biopsy, which was later reported as consistent with the diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

### Rare case of dengue encephalitis with extensive brain lesions from Pakistan [^113ii2TQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Dengue infection is common in 129 countries including Pakistan, with an estimated 390million dengue virus infections per year. Asia accounts for 70% of the actual burden. Clinical signs and symptoms of dengue include a high fever (40°C/104°F) accompanied by two of the following symptoms during the febrile phase: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands and rash. Severe dengue is a potentially fatal complication, due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding or organ impairment. Dengue virus does not usually cause neurological manifestations, unlike other arboviral infections. Encephalopathy is the most common neurological complication. Encephalitis is rare manifestation. We report a rare case of dengue encephalitis from Pakistan, with extensive brain lesions involving the thalamus, cerebellar vermis and frontoparietal periventricular regions. Therefore, we suggest dengue encephalitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever with altered sensorium, especially in Asian countries such as Pakistan where dengue is rampant as dengue encephalitis can be fatal at times.

### Ocular surface involvement and histopathologic changes in the acute stage of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: a cross-sectional study [^115EZPA1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Historically, SJS was first described by two American pediatricians named Stevens and Johnson in 1922 and occurred in two children characterized by persistent fever, widespread skin eruption, and serious purulent conjunctivitis. TEN was first reported in 1956 by Lyell, who described four cases with exfoliative mucocutaneous resembling burns. SJS/TEN is one of the rare skin diseases that constitute a true medical emergency. Acute conjunctivitis, simultaneously or followed by skin lesions accompanied by extraordinarily high fever, nails, and oral mucosa involvement, indicates the onset of SJS/TEN. Even if these patients survive the severe acute illness, serious sequelae often last a lifetime. Ocular complications are considered to be the most common complication among SJS/TEN survivors.

As reported, at least one-third of acute ocular manifestations may develop into chronic sequelae, including severe dry eye diseases, symblephara, trichiasis, and persistent corneal epithelial defects, which have an obvious effect on the quality of SJS/TEN survivors' life. However, effective treatment for chronic sequelae is lacking. Therefore, increased awareness and understanding of acute ocular involvement of SJS/TEN are needed. Positive and proper management of acute ocular involvement is essential to decelerate ongoing damage and prevent late complications. In our study, we paid attention to the acute phase of ten SJS/TEN patients. The limitation of this study is the sample size of patients since SJS/TEN is a very rare disease. We found the ocular objective signs seemed basically normal. These findings are similar to a previous study: no or mild ocular involvement was present in one-half of patients at their acute stage. It is worth noting that most acute SJS/TEN patients have abnormal meibomian gland secretions, which may eventually develop into meibomian gland dysfunction and severe evaporative dry eye. As previously reported, acute ocular involvement is a risk factor for serious meibomian gland dysfunction in chronic SJS patients.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for plague [^114kGb7E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Although efficient antimicrobials are available, plague still has a high mortality rate as most outbreaks take place in remote places in resource‐limited settings, where proper diagnosis and treatment remains challenging (WHO 2009). While bubonic plague is associated with case fatality ratios (CFRs) of 10% to 20%, pneumonic plague is highly fatal, with a CFR close to 100% if left untreated and over 50% when adequately treated with antimicrobials (Prentice 2007).

In addition to the sporadic cases and outbreaks, because of the characteristics of the disease resulting in high mortality, Y pestis has been used as a biological weapon and is currently a bioterrorism threat (CDC 2019).

Due to its historical pandemics and high fatality rate, plague continues to cause fear and panic, and is sometimes associated with a disproportionate public health response, which has considerable social and economic consequences (Mavalankar 1995; Mead 2018). A clinical diagnosis of plague is difficult and not reliable. The symptoms of pneumonic plague are not specific and can be present in a person with pneumonia caused by many other pathogens. These include other bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae or tuberculosis, that would require different antibiotics than plague, but also viruses, such as influenza, which would require no antibiotics. A person with a swollen lymph node in an endemic area or in the context of an outbreak is more likely to receive an accurate diagnosis of bubonic plague than people with suspected pneumonic plague. However, other diagnoses need to be considered, mainly other infections that cause swollen lymph nodes such as pyogenic abscess, tularaemia, tuberculosis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and cat scratch fever. A point‐of‐care diagnostic tool that is quick to use and highly accurate would help ensure appropriate response, especially in the context of outbreaks.

Recommendation on relative contraindications to MVPA (22/22 authors assent)

We recommend several conditions be considered as relative contraindications. Those involving the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems include: postpartum cardiomyopathy; calf pain or swelling suggestive of deep vein thrombosis; haemodynamic instability (ischaemic symptoms combined with systolic BP decrease > 10 mmHg with MVPA); high blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg SBP/DBP); breathing difficulties, such as shortness of breath at rest that is not relieved with medications; the new onset of chest pain, discomfort, and other angina-like symptoms with exertion; new symptoms of heart disease, stroke. Those involving musculoskeletal systems include: caesarean section with symptoms that worsen with MVPA (eg, surgical incision pain); fractures and/or other significant musculoskeletal injuries. Additional relative contraindications include: severe abdominal pain; vaginal bleeding not associated with menses; an eating disorder; malnutrition; anaemia; excessive fatigue suggestive of anaemia or low energy availability (eg, REDs); acute systemic infection accompanied by fever, body aches or swollen lymph glands; dizziness or light-headedness during MVPA; loss of consciousness for any reason; neurological symptoms such as ataxia or muscle weakness affecting balance; renal or kidney disease. These relative contraindications would apply for at least the first year postpartum or until they resolve.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a rare but important differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy [^114Bv3uu]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue. A CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed left cervical lymphadenopathy, enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla and groin and hepatomegaly. A left cervical excisional lymph node biopsy was undertaken and the histopathological findings were consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. He was treated with high-dose prednisolone for 1 week, which was then tapered. Generalised arthralgia and daily episodes of malaise were experienced for a subsequent 2 months following the cessation of corticosteroids. The condition lasted 4 months from the onset of symptoms. This case report highlights the importance of including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has commonly been mistaken for tuberculosis and lymphoma, and unnecessary exposure to agents used to treat these conditions can be avoided by prompt histological diagnosis.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Prolonged febrile illness and fever of unknown origin in adults [^114rkC3H]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin has been described as a febrile illness (temperature of 101°F [38.3°C] or higher) for three weeks or longer without an etiology despite a one-week inpatient evaluation. A more recent qualitative definition requires only a reasonable diagnostic evaluation. Although there are more than 200 diseases in the differential diagnosis, most cases in adults are limited to several dozen possible causes. Fever of unknown origin is more often an atypical presentation of a common disease rather than an unusual disease. The most common subgroups in the differential are infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous. Clinicians should perform a comprehensive history and examination to look for potentially diagnostic clues to guide the initial evaluation. If there are no potentially diagnostic clues, the patient should undergo a minimum diagnostic workup, including a complete blood count, chest radiography, urinalysis and culture, electrolyte panel, liver enzymes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level testing. Further testing should include blood cultures, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Human immunodeficiency virus and appropriate region-specific serologic testing (e.g., cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, tuberculosis) and abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography or computed tomography are commonly performed. If the diagnosis remains elusive, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography plus computed tomography may help guide the clinician toward tissue biopsy. Empiric antibiotics or steroids are generally discouraged in patients with fever of unknown origin.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on management of adult and juvenile onset Sjögren disease [^115Qdpwo]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

From these studies, and acknowledging the differences in case ascertainment and other factors, the following consistently emerge as predictors of future lymphoma development:

Low C3/C4 with low C4 being the strongest predictor
Clinical evidence of salivary gland enlargement
Clinical evidence of lymphadenopathy
Cryoglobulinaemia
Monoclonal gammopathy
High focus score (> 4)

In addition, clinical signs and symptoms associated with lymphoma should alert to the possible existence of early/microscopic NHL. These include B symptoms (persistent night sweats, fevers and weight loss of ≥ 10% over the preceding 3 months), clonal lymphocytosis in peripheral blood flow cytometry and splenomegaly.

Recommendation

Individuals with SD should be offered further investigation early if they present with new salivary gland swelling or other symptoms that might suggest the development of lymphoma (1, A) (SOA 98.75%).

Consider a minor labial salivary gland biopsy to provide additional prognostic data regarding lymphoma risk in both seronegative and seropositive individuals (2, C) (SOA 92.7%).

### Case report: disseminated Burkholderia pseudomallei with acute suppurative thyroiditis and abscess formation [^1177WXV1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Melioidosis has a highly variable presentation. Almost any organ can be involved, although an antemortem diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) has not, to our knowledge, been previously described. A 68-year-old Australian male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with fever, odynophagia, and thyroid function tests consistent with hyperthyroidism. Imaging demonstrated a lung abscess and an enlarged thyroid gland with three nodules. Blood cultures and fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodules grew Burkholderia pseudomallei. He received intravenous ceftazidime and concurrent oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 4 weeks followed by high-dose oral TMP/SMX for a further 3 months and made a complete recovery. Acute suppurative thyroiditis is an uncommon cause of hyperthyroidism and thyroid aspirates are not commonly sent for bacterial culture. The case highlights the need to consider AST in patients presenting with a hyperthyroid state and disseminated infection. It also demonstrates that in a case of disseminated melioidosis any symptom may be a clue to underlying metastatic infection.

### Primary tuberculosis of the thyroid gland: an unexpected cause of thyrotoxicosis [^111eVdEj]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We describe a 38-year-old Indian man who presented with a 2-week history of fever, night sweats and neck swelling who was found to be clinically thyrotoxic with a nodular goitre, tachycardia and high fever. Biochemical investigation revealed hyperthyroidism in association with deranged liver function tests and raised inflammatory markers. Ultrasound and CT scans of the neck revealed multinodular thyroid enlargement. He was considered most likely to have an acute infectious thyroiditis with a differential diagnosis of a toxic multinodular goitre and was started on carbimazole and antibiotics. He underwent fine needle aspiration of the thyroid which revealed necrotic cells and acid-fast bacilli, confirming a diagnosis of primary tuberculosis (TB) of the thyroid gland with no evidence of any other organ involvement on systemic imaging. He was started on TB therapy for 6 months and discharged with outpatient follow-up. Symptoms and biochemical markers subsequently resolved.

### Hoarseness as the first symptom in a patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis secondary to a pyriform sinus fistula: a case report [^1153G43L]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pyriform sinus fistulas (PSFs) are rare congenital anomalies of the third or fourth brachial pouch. Dyspnea is reportedly secondary to compression by a neck mass. However, hoarseness, as the first symptom of PSF, has not yet been reported.

Case Presentation

This report describes an 11-year-old girl presenting with hoarseness as the first symptom of PSF. Hoarseness occurred 2 days prior to admission. On admission, she had fever, hoarseness, and an elastic soft mass on her left anterior neck. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the cervical region demonstrated an abscess partially infiltrating the thyroid gland and an air pocket near the pyriform sinus. Pharyngoscopy revealed swelling of the left arytenoid region, with purulent retention. The left vocal cord was swollen but not paralyzed. Additionally, the laboratory data indicated thyrotoxicosis. Suspecting a PSF infection, parenteral treatment with cefotaxime and dexamethasone was initiated. On the following day, the hoarseness disappeared, and the fever resolved. Four weeks after onset, the thyroid hormone levels returned to the normal range, and a barium esophagogram revealed residual contrast in the left pyriform sinus, leading to a diagnosis of PSF.

Conclusion

PSF presenting with hoarseness as the first symptom in patients should be considered.

### Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites: a unique pathogenic mechanism linking Epstein-Barr virus infection, allergy and oncogenesis [^115jGowE]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2007). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB) is characterized by intense local skin reactions and systemic symptoms, such as high fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Half of the patients reported died of hemophagocytic syndrome or lymphocyte proliferative disorders. Clinical and laboratory studies have revealed that HMB occurs in association with natural killer (NK) cell lymphocytosis related to chronic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Recent studies have clarified the unique pathogenic mechanism of this mysterious disease, and demonstrated the close relationship between HMB and EBV-carrying NK cell lymphocytosis; i.e. CD4(+) T cells from the patients markedly responded to mosquito salivary gland extracts, and the CD4(+) T cells stimulated by mosquito bites may play a key role in the development of HMB and NK cell oncogenesis via the induction of EBV reactivation and EBV-oncogene expression, respectively.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [^114ZMcxy]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Learning points

The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can trigger Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD).
Symptoms of KFD mimic those of other serious diseases, such as infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, and even reactive lymphadenopathy following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
When painful lymphadenopathy does not improve spontaneously and/or with initial treatment (eg, antimicrobial prescription), lymph node biopsy should be considered for diagnosing KFD.
The clinician should include KFD as a differential diagnosis in patients with painful lymphadenopathy and fever following SARS-Cov-2 vaccination.

### Presentation and outcomes of lassa fever in children in Nigeria: a prospective cohort study (LASCOPE) [^112b2JY8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

After fever, the most frequent clinical features were digestive disorders. Symptoms of the upper gastrointestinal tract were more common than those of the lower tract. Some authors reported an association between the presence of vomiting and a positive LF test result in febrile children seeking hospital care in a highly endemic area of Nigeria. LF can mimic pediatric abdominal emergencies such as intestinal intussusception, peritonitis, and can even be associated with a genuine acute appendicitis. Clinicians caring for children in LF endemic areas, including surgeons, should therefore maintain a high index of suspicion where there is vomiting or abdominal pain. Invasive management of LF-infected patients without proper barrier measures could expose other patients, healthcare staff, and relatives to the risk of nosocomial transmission.

The "swollen baby syndrome", is often considered as a classical and pejorative clinical presentation of pediatric Lassa fever, even though it has only been mentioned once in a small retrospective cohort conducted in Liberia in 1987. In the study by Monson and colleagues, among 33 children with LF diagnosed by serology, 4 died, of whom 3 presented with this syndrome. In the present prospective study, 4 infants < 12 months died but none had facial swelling, and the 2 neonates with facial swelling survived. Also, sore throat, which is often considered as a common sign in patients with LF, was infrequently reported here.

### Typhi: a rare cause of parotid abscess [^115jCRd3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The incidence of extraintestinal infection caused by Salmonella spp has been increased during the past decade. Here we report a case of a parotid abscess caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) in an individual without any significant abnormality of the parotid gland. A 68-year-old man presented to the surgical department with high-grade intermittent fever associated with painful swelling over the right side of the face, extending into the neck. An ultrasound of the neck revealed an abscess of the right parotid gland. S Typhi was isolated from the pus drained from the parotid gland. The patient was treated with intravenous followed by oral cephalosporin for a period of 7days. This case gives an insight into one of the rarer aetiological agents causing parotid abscess.

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cysts of the parotid glands confirmed by HIV-1 p24 antigen immunostaining [^112EBE9M]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

BLEC can be defined as the occurrence of single or multiple cysts in the parotid gland lymph nodes. The clinical presentation of BLEC is typically gradual, painless and comprises bilateral parotid swelling with diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy. Unilateral parotid swelling has also been reported; however, it is usually found in HIV-negative patients, and rarely found in HIV-positive patients. Most patients who develop BLEC are generally not aware of potential HIV infection, but are more concerned with the cosmetic implications. However, BLEC rarely causes facial palsy and xerostomia, and if patients present with systematic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss or night sweats, they should be examined for tuberculosis or lymphoma.

BLEC is diagnosed based on medical history, physical examination and biopsy. Non-invasive diagnostic modalities include ultrasound examination, CT scanning and MRI, which are able to detect multiple thin-walled cysts with diffuse cervical lymphadenopathy. Invasive diagnostic modalities include fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and parotid gland biopsy, which can exclude malignancy in the differential diagnosis. However, malignancy only occurs in less than 1% of patients with HIV-associated cystic lesions.FNAC of BLEC is a safe examination that usually reveals a heterogeneous cell population, which consists of scattered foamy macrophages and anucleated squamous cells in a proteinaceous background. When a small amount of sample is obtained, it may be difficult to exclude malignant diseases such as lymphoma, Warthin's tumour and cystic metastatic squamous cell carcinoma by FNAC. Since biopsy often includes the collection of multiple tissue specimens, it may have a higher sensitivity to diagnosis than FNAC. Thus, pathological tissue examination is the only method that definitively diagnose BLEC.

### Mumps caused hemophagocytic syndrome: a rare case report [^116wsnCD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Mumps-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is exceptionally rare. Here, we report a fatal case of concurrent mumps and HPS. A previously healthy 21-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases on October 18, 2011, with complaints of parotid gland pain for 30 days and persistent fever (38.3°C-40°C) for 15 days. Admission examinations showed severe pancytopenia, liver dysfunction, hyperferritinemia, fibrinopenia, elevated lactalase dehydrase, bilateral pulmonary inflammation and pleural effusion, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. The patient was accordingly suspected to have mumps-associated HPS and received nutrition support and hormonal therapies as well as platelet transfusions. On hospitalization day 3, the fever stayed high, and painful swelling in the right testicle was reported. A bone marrow biopsy evaluation and serological tests were then performed. Histiocytic hyperplasia and hemophagocytic macrophage infiltration were demonstrated in the bone marrow and antimumps virus immunoglobulin M was detected positive, but bacteria, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus were detected negative in the peripheral blood. The initial diagnosis of mumps-associated HPS was eventually confirmed. Treatments with high doses of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and etoposide were continued. By hospitalization day 20, patient's condition was improved, his body temperature and blood counts were almost normal, and the pain and swelling in his parotid glands and right testicle subsided considerably. On hospitalization day 28, however, patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and pancytopenia became evident again. On hospitalization day 33, the patient died of multiple organ dysfunction.

### About mumps… [^117Y2bwv]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Mumps is a contagious viral infection that can be serious.
- Common symptoms include painful swelling of the jaw, fever, tiredness, appetite loss, and headache.
- Get vaccinated for mumps with the MMR vaccine, especially before travelling internationally. What it is Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus that affects the salivary glands. Mumps is still a common disease in many countries, so it's important to get vaccinated to protect yourself. Most people with mumps recover completely within 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms People who are infected with mumps don't get sick right away. It can take 2 to 4 weeks for them to show signs of infection. Common signs of mumps are puffy cheeks and a tender, swollen jaw. This is caused by the swollen salivary glands under one or both ears. Early symptoms can begin a few days before the swelling. The most serious complication is inflammation of the brain.

Some people who have been vaccinated against mumps can still get the disease. However, they usually have milder symptoms and complications are less frequent. Keep ReadingMumps Symptoms and Complications Who is at risk Anyone who is not protected against mumps is at risk of getting the disease. Some groups of people have a higher likelihood of spreading disease because they are constantly in close contact with each other. These include school-aged children, students at post-high school educational institutions, and healthcare personnel. People traveling internationally to areas where mumps is still common, or people near outbreaks, are also more likely to get mumps. How it spreads Mumps is a contagious disease caused by the mumps virus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. You can get mumps and spread the virus by:

- Coughing, sneezing, or talking.
- Sharing items that may have saliva on them, such as water bottles or cups.
- Participating in close-contact activities with others, like playing sports, dancing, or kissing. When people are contagious A person infected with mumps can spread it:

- Beginning a few days beforetheir salivary glands begin to swell.
- Until up to 5 days afterswelling begins.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^114GrJQe]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Parotid gland anomalies

Parotitis

Parotitis is defined as inflammation of the parotid gland, which may have various causes, including infectious (viral or bacterial), autoimmune, lithiasic or idiopathic causes. Infectious sialadenitis is more common in parotid than other salivary glands. In contrast, sialolithiasis is much rarer in parotid than in submandibular glands and has no specific imaging appearance.

Acute viral parotitis

Acute viral parotitis is more common than bacterial parotitis and is frequently bilateral (90% of cases) but not always synchronously. The main viruses are paramyxovirus (mumps, whose incidence has greatly reduced due to vaccination), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza and HIV. Clinical signs are painful swelling of the parotid gland, fever and inflammation of the orifice of Stensen's duct. Occasionally, the submandibular and sublingual glands are also affected. Imaging is not needed for the diagnosis. When performed, ultrasonography shows a glandular enlargement with foci of salivary secretions, lymph nodes and increased vascularization (Fig. 3). Spontaneous regression in a few days is the rule.

The special case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Note that HIV children prevalence rate is low, in western countries. Indeed, if the estimated 1.72 million children under 15 years of age are living with HIV, 89 per cent live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition to causing acute parotitis, HIV infection may cause persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (including intraparotid lymph nodes), lympho-epithelial cysts and benign lympho-epithelial lesions. These lesions occur early in the course of the retroviral infection and consist of lymphocytic infiltration, intraductal epithelial proliferation and atrophy of salivary acini. Sonography and MRI reveal a diffuse glandular enlargement, multiple thin-wall cysts of variable size and/or multiple solid masses and cervical lymphadenopathies (Fig. 4). These lesions may also be present in disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis. With HIV infection, there is also increased risk of malignant lymphoma.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin xl) [^116pMgUQ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Before taking bupropion, tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had depression or other mental illnesses. You should also tell your doctor about any symptoms you had during other times you tried to quit smoking, with or without bupropion.

What Other Important Information Should I Know About WELLBUTRIN XL?

Seizures: There is a chance of having a seizure (convulsion, fit) with WELLBUTRIN XL, especially in people:
with certain medical problems.
who take certain medicines.

The chance of having seizures increases with higher doses of WELLBUTRIN XL. For more information, see the sections " Who should not take WELLBUTRIN XL? " and " What should I tell my doctor before using WELLBUTRIN XL? " Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions and all the medicines you take. Do not take any other medicines while you are using WELLBUTRIN XL unless your doctor has said it is okay to take them.

If you have a seizure while taking WELLBUTRIN XL, stop taking the tablets and call your doctor right away. Do not take WELLBUTRIN XL again if you have a seizure.

High blood pressure (hypertension): Some people get high blood pressure, that can be severe, while taking Wellbutrin XL. The chance of high blood pressure may be higher if you also use nicotine replacement therapy (such as a nicotine patch) to help you stop smoking.
Severe allergic reactions: Some people have severe allergic reactions to Wellbutrin XL. Stop taking Wellbutrin XL and call your doctor right away if you get a rash, itching, hives, fever, swollen lymph glands, painful sores in the mouth or around the eyes, swelling of the lips or tongue, chest pain, or have trouble breathing. These could be signs of a serious allergic reaction.
Unusual thoughts or behaviors: Some patients have unusual thoughts or behaviors while taking Wellbutrin XL, including delusions (believe you are someone else), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there), paranoia (feeling that people are against you), or feeling confused. If this happens to you, call your doctor.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^113WLJcz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Mumps — background and residential facility restrictions — "Mumps is a viral infection characterized by the swelling of one or more salivary glands of the head and neck, usually the glands located on the face immediately in front of the ears". Transmission and contagious period are described as "Mumps spreads through contact with respiratory droplets or saliva. Individuals are most contagious several days before the appearance of swollen glands until 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Mumps can be prevented by vaccination". Facility guidance states: "Restrict individuals with mumps from the family-centered residential facility until at least 5 days from the appearance of swollen glands. Individuals must obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician before entering the facility". It further advises: "Restrict individuals who have been exposed to a person with mumps, even if they do not have symptoms of illness, from the facility until they obtain written medical clearance from a licensed clinician".

### Isolated thyroid abscess in early childhood [^114Sg8ma]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Isolated thyroid abscess is a rare entity in early childhood. Among thyroid disorders, thyroid abscess or acute suppurative thyroiditis constitutes about 0.7%-1% of all cases. The thyroid gland is normally resistant to infections due to its well-enveloped capsule, rich blood supply, and high iodine content. A child presented with tender neck swelling accompanied by fever for 3days. Ultrasound of the neck showed features suggestive of left parapharyngeal abscess. Laboratory parameters including thyroid function test were within normal limits. Contrast-enhanced CT of the neck was done and showed an isolated thyroid abscess with no other abnormalities. The patient was started on intravenous antibiotics followed by incision and drainage of the abscess. The child improved symptomatically. This report discusses the differential diagnosis and management of this rare entity.

Investigation and Results

On June 23, before the July 24 start of the 2020 season, MLB implemented health and safety protocols, which included COVID-19 mitigation strategies (Table). The health and safety protocols established tiered, risk-based testing for MLB teams, which called for persons who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result to be placed in isolation and for close contacts to be quarantined separately. Tier 1 included players and persons with high interpersonal contacts with players (e.g. coaches, umpires, and medical staff members). Tier 2 included persons who were able to wear face masks, maintain social distance, or both during their regular interactions with tier 1 persons (e.g. travel and home clubhouse staff members). Tier 3 included persons with minimal contact with other staff members (e.g. cleaning service and stadium security staff members).

### Antiviral agents for infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) [^115stouV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome, usually caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EPV), characterised by lymphadenopathy, fever and sore throat. Most cases of symptomatic IM occur in older teenagers or young adults. Usually IM is a benign self-limiting illness and requires only symptomatic treatment. However, occasionally the disease course can be complicated or prolonged and lead to decreased productivity in terms of school or work. Antiviral medications have been used to treat IM, but the use of antivirals for IM is controversial. They may be effective by preventing viral replication which helps to keep the virus inactive. However, there are no guidelines for antivirals in IM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral therapy for infectious mononucleosis (IM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, March 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2016), Embase (1974 to 15 April 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 April 2016), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2016) and Web of Science (1955 to 15 April 2016). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antivirals versus placebo or no treatment in IM. We included trials of immunocompetent participants of any age or sex with clinical and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of IM, who had symptoms for up to 14 days. Our primary outcomes were time to clinical recovery and adverse events and side effects of medication. Secondary outcomes included duration of abnormal clinical examination, complications, viral shedding, health-related quality of life, days missing from school or work and economic outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the included studies' risk of bias and extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet. We used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We pooled heterogeneous data where possible, and presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antivirals in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir. Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis of IM was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance. There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants). Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse events and side effects of medication' were reported narratively in only five studies. In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event was related to medication or complication of disease. These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding, the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention. Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse events and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance. Further research in this area is warranted.

### Permanent correction of an inherited ectodermal dysplasia with recombinant EDA [^111szqiq]. Nature Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED; OMIM 305100) is a genetic disorder characterized by absence or deficient function of hair, teeth and sweat glands. Affected children may experience life-threatening high fever resulting from reduced ability to sweat. Mice with the Tabby phenotype share many symptoms with human XLHED patients because both phenotypes are caused by mutations of the syntenic ectodysplasin A gene (Eda) on the X chromosome. Two main splice variants of Eda, encoding EDA1 and EDA2, engage the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptors EDAR and XEDAR, respectively. The EDA1 protein, acting through EDAR, is essential for proper formation of skin appendages; the functions of EDA2 and XEDAR are not known. EDA1 must be proteolytically processed to a soluble form to be active. Here, we show that treatment of pregnant Tabby mice with a recombinant form of EDA1, engineered to cross the placental barrier, permanently rescues the Tabby phenotype in the offspring. Notably, sweat glands can also be induced by EDA1 after birth. This is the first example of a developmental genetic defect that can be permanently corrected by short-term treatment with a recombinant protein.

### Case report: novel coronavirus – A potential cause of acute pancreatitis? [^116vNKSW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

CASE DESCRIPTION

A 32-year-old male patient presented to the outpatient clinic at Nishtar Hospital, Multan, Pakistan, with a history of relapsing fever, sore throat, productive cough, myalgia, and diarrhea for 1 week. The patient was a medical physician currently working in the medicine ward. He did not report any prior comorbidities or high-risk travel history.

Considering the exposure history, a reverse transcriptase–PCR for COVID-19 was obtained. Initially, the patient's temperature was 38°C, the blood pressure 110/80 mmHg, the pulse rate 110 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minutes, and oxygen saturation 99–100% while breathing in ambient air. He was managed with simple supportive measures.

After 21 hours, his tests for COVID-19 were reported positive. The patient chose to self-isolate at home until his symptoms subsided and his results came negative. He was advised to report to the emergency department in case of severe dyspnea, chest pain, cyanosis, or altered mental status.

A week after the diagnosis, the patient reported to the emergency department with severe mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back accompanied by intermittent high fevers, chills, and non-biliary vomiting. He was noted to have a white cell count of 12 × 10⁹/L and glucose levels of 192 mg/dL. Liver function tests revealed aspartate aminotransferase of 29 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase of 27 IU/L. Kidney functions were normal, serum triglycerides were 150 mg/dL, and serum calcium was 8.9 mg/dL. Serum amylase was 672 IU/L and serum lipase 721 IU/L (Table 1). The patient reported no history of use of alcohol.

Table 1
Clinical laboratory results

Ultrasound in the emergency ward showed no signs of inflammation of the gall bladder or cholelithiasis. Computed axial tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a bulky and swollen pancreas with significant peripancreatic inflammatory changes and fluid collection along the gastrosplenic ligament. Otherwise, the pancreas was non-enhancing, with no evidence of low-attenuation areas in the pancreatic parenchyma to suggest necrosis (Figure 1).

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: part 2 [^115SjWw8]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Results: A 14-year-old female, previously healthy, presented with an acute history of fever and left-sided neck swelling, associated with erythematous-popular rash over the face, neck, and chest. Initial laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia of 2.6×10³/uL and elevated inflammatory markers, CRP 33 mg/L, ESR 64 mm/hr, ferritin of 415 ug/L and D-Dimer 4429 ng/mL. The peripheral smear showed no blast cells. Infectious workup came back negative, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serial labs showed persistent leukopenia and elevated inflammatory markers despite a course of empirical antibiotics.

An MRI of the neck was performed and showed multiple abnormal glands and cervical lymph nodes involvement.

Excisional lymph node biopsy was performed and showed a partial preservation of the follicular architecture and several areas of paracortical necrosis. with a diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. There was abundant single cell apoptosis. There were no viral cytopathic features and no evidence of pathogenic organisms. EBV in situ hybridization was negative. Submandibular salivary gland biopsy was performed and showed a similar process with infiltration of activated lymphocytes. The interstitium was involved by immunoblasts and prominent karyorrhectic activity. The apoptosis and inflammation within the salivary gland represent features of KFD.

Taken together, the findings are of necrotizing lymphadenitis with a marked paucity of granulocytes. a pattern keeping with KFD in the lymph node and the salivary gland. The relative paucity of plasma cells and the absence of vasculitis with DNA encrustation (Azzopardi phenomenon) make KFD more likely than a SLE.

Conclusion: This rare case report highlights the importance of considering KFD as part of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with fever and lymphadenopathy, particularly in the presence of uncommon features of KFD such as salivary and parotid glands involvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pediatric KFD with salivary and parotid gland involvement.

### Mumps outbreak at a university and recommendation for a third dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine-Illinois, 2015–2016 [^111Ryvix]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Mumps is an acute viral disease characterized by fever and swelling of the parotid or other salivary glands. On May 1, 2015, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) confirmed a mumps outbreak at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. IDPH and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (C-UPHD) conducted an investigation and identified 317 cases of mumps during April 2015-May 2016. Because of sustained transmission in a population with high 2-dose coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a third MMR dose was recommended by IDPH, C-UPHD, and the university's McKinley Health Center. No formal recommendation for or against the use of a third MMR dose has been issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (1). However, CDC has provided guidelines for use of a third dose as a control measure during mumps outbreaks in settings in which persons are in close contact with one another, where transmission is sustained despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional control measures fail to slow transmission (2).

Greater Than 1 in 100 Patients

Body as a Whole: Reported incidences of death range from 6.6 per 1 million (0.00066 percent) to 1 in
10,000 patients (0.01 percent). Most deaths occur during injection or 5 to 10 minutes later, the main
feature being cardiac arrest with cardiovascular disease as the main aggravating factor.

Isolated reports of hypotensive collapse and shock following urography are found in the literature.
The incidence of shock is estimated to occur in 1 out of 20,000 (0.005 percent) patients.

Cardiovascular System: The most frequent adverse reaction to diatrizoate salts is vasodilation
(feeling of warmth). The estimated incidence is 49 percent.

Digestive System: Nausea 6 percent, vomiting 3 percent.

Nervous System: Paresthesia 6 percent, dizziness 5 percent.

Respiratory System: Rhinitis 1 percent, increased cough 2 percent.

Skin and Appendages: Urticaria 1 percent.

Pain at the injection site is estimated to occur in about 12 percent of the patients undergoing

### Hoarseness as the first symptom in a patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis secondary to a pyriform sinus fistula: a case report [^111bcEUA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The initial symptoms of PSF include neck mass with or without abscess, acute thyroiditis, and thyroid lesion. In some cases, particularly in neonates, a neck mass compressing the surrounding structure, resulting in dyspnea, has been reported. However, hoarseness, as the first symptom of PSF, has not yet been reported. This study presents a case of PSF with hoarseness as the first symptom preceding fever and neck swelling. Flexible laryngoscopy, performed to evaluate hoarseness, revealed swelling of the arytenoid region with purulent retention. The left vocal cord was swollen but not paralyzed. Hoarseness disappeared with DEX on the day after admission, and swelling disappeared on the third day. Thus, hoarseness may be derived from the swelling of the left vocal cord due to the PSF infection. As vocal cord movement was normal, the hoarseness was not caused by a recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Dyspnea has been reported to be secondary to lesion compression in some patients with PSF. However, in our case, no evidence of airway obstruction was identified, although hoarseness, fever, and anterior neck swelling were noted. Hence, the larynx and airways in patients with hoarseness need to be evaluated.

Acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare clinical condition in childhood because the thyroid gland is remarkably resistant to infections owing to its high iodine content, rich blood and lymphocyte supply, and protective fibrous capsule. Infection with PSF is often reported to cause acute suppurative thyroiditis. In our case, a low TSH level and high FT4 and TG levels suggested that the abscess had partially destroyed the thyroid gland. Considering the suppressed TSH level, high FT3 level may have occurred before admission, although the FT3 level on admission was low. The presence of complicated low T3 syndrome due to infection and decreased intake was indicated. A previous study has reported that low T3 syndrome was associated with acute suppurative thyroiditis because of PSF infection in an adult case. The thyroid hormone levels returned to the normal range within 3 weeks.

### Neighbourhood level real-time forecasting of dengue cases in tropical urban Singapore [^1129WyfQ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dengue, a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus (DENV, four serotypes DENV1–4), has spread through tropical and subtropical regions of the world in recent decades. It is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, and in urban areas, primarily by the anthropophilic Aedes aegypti. The total number of dengue infections globally has been estimated to be 390 million per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically, the majority of which (70%) are found in Asia. It has been estimated that 3.97 billion people from 128 countries are at risk of dengue infection, and as urbanisation continues across much of Asia, the incidence is liable to grow. Dengue fever usually leads to self-limiting symptoms including fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, rash, and joint, bone, or muscle pains. However, when dengue fever develops into severe dengue, then plasma leakage, severe bleeding, severe organ impairment, and even death may occur, making dengue control an important public health problem.

In the equatorial city state of Singapore, since the 1990s there has been a dramatic increase in the number of notified dengue cases, and all four serotypes are endemic. Singapore's favourable climatic condition (average monthly temperature varying from 26 to 28 °C), its highly urbanised environment and its being a hub for international travel and transition make it ideal for the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes and transmission of dengue. Since 2013, a dengue incidence of more than 150 per 100,000 population has been reported and this has been related to a sizable disease burden to Singapore. Although a new dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia® (CYD-TDV), first licensed in Mexico in 2015, has been approved by the Health Science Authority in Singapore for persons aged 12 to 45, and has been available commercially since 2017, the vaccine is primarily effective against DENV3 and DENV4 but less so against DENV1 and DENV2, which are the predominant serotypes in Singapore. The vaccine is more effective for individuals with a prior exposure to dengue virus, but increases the risk of severity in subsequent infection for immune naïve individuals. It is, thus, not recommended for Singapore where endemicity and seroprevalence are low.

### Hypopituitarism and cranial nerve involvement mimicking tolosa-hunt syndrome as the initially presenting feature of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a case report [^115PVuJM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of lymphoma involving the central nervous system is sometimes difficult but emergent to avoid the delay of therapeutic initiation. Pituitary insufficiencies are usually associated with lymphoma in the pituitary gland. There have been no cases of lymphoma originating from extra pituitary gland with hypopituitarism that simultaneously presenting unilateral upper cranial nerve palsies and ophthalmalgia. These symptoms are mostly caused by neoplastic involvement of the skull base or benign diseases such as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (THS). We report a case of lymphoma with unique clinical courses initially presenting hypopituitarism and symptoms mimicking THS with a mass in sphenoidal and cavernous sinuses accompanying sphenoidal bone erosion.

Case presentation.

A 71-year-old woman visited our hospital with left ophthalmalgia, ptosis, and diplopia. Neurological findings revealed left oculomotor, trochlear and abducent nerve palsies. Endocrine tests indicated partial hypopituitarism. Initial CT and MRI revealed that a mass in sphenoidal and cavernous sinuses had invaded the sella with osteolysis of the sphenoid bone. At around four weeks, almost all the symptoms of cranial nerve palsies were relieved. Seven weeks later, she had a high fever and cervical lymph node (CLN) swellings. CLN biopsy revealed CD20-positive B-cells. She was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed elevated uptake at the erosion lesion of the sphenoidal bone, but not the pituitary gland. After chemotherapy, all the symptoms related to systemic lymphoma were relieved, but partial hypopituitarism remained. The mass in sphenoidal and cavernous sinuses and elevated uptake by PET/CT were dissolved.

Conclusion

This case of DLBCL had a unique clinical course; initial presentation of hypopituitarism and symptoms mimicking THS. There was also rare demonstration of mass lesions related to DLBCL in the sphenoidal and cavernous sinuses compressing the pituitary gland through an eroded area of the sphenoidal bone. It should be clinically cautioned that DLBCL can be associated with erosion of the sphenoidal bone and cause both hypopituitarism and THS-mimicking symptoms.

### HLA typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a case report [^115mg4w2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical examination revealed a slightly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid gland, which was tender upon palpation. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a slightly swollen right lobe of the thyroid gland and a focal hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow (Fig. 1 A), which coincided with the site of tenderness. The volume of the thyroid lobes was calculated using the volumetric formula reported by Suzuki et al. The width (cm), thickness (cm), and height (cm) of each lobe were measured during ultrasonography, and the volume (mL) of each lobe was calculated using the volume formula for ellipsoid (π/6 × width × thickness × height). The volumes of the right and left lobes were 8.8 mL and 5.9 mL, respectively. The patient was diagnosed with SAT and treated with oral acetaminophen (1000 mg/day for the first 5 days). Consequently, tenderness of the thyroid gland was alleviated although did not resolve. Fever (37.5 °C) recurred and fatigue occurred within 5–6 hours of oral acetaminophen administration. On day 6 of acetaminophen treatment, oral prednisolone (PSL) administration was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/day, which resolved the fever and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Subsequently, the PSL dose was tapered. On day 43 after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, serum FT3 and FT4 levels decreased and TSH level increased (Table 1). The next day, i.e. on day 44 after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, PSL was discontinued. On day 92 after vaccination, serum FT3, FT4, and TSH levels were within the normal range, even in the absence of thyroid hormone (TH) replacement therapy. After the discontinuation of PSL treatment, neither the symptoms nor the abnormal blood chemistry values recurred. On day 176 after vaccination, serum TSAb, TgAb, and TPOAb levels decreased to 108.0%, 13.0 IU/mL, and 12.0 IU/mL, respectively.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^111L39fR]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Sarcoidosis presenting as bilateral lacrimal gland swelling: a pediatric case report [^111qNbzm]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

She was next seen approximately 6 weeks later when she presented to the pediatric emergency department with significant worsening of bilateral upper eyelid swelling (Fig. 1). Her exam continued to demonstrate giant papillary reaction temporally in the bilateral superior palpebral conjunctiva. Of note, the upper lid swelling was much more pronounced than at previous visits and the lacrimal glands were palpable bilaterally. She had continued to use topical steroid, tacrolimus, and artificial tears, but had discontinued olopatadine as she had minimal to no itching. Decision was made to pursue tissue diagnosis by obtaining a lacrimal gland biopsy. She was also referred to pediatric rheumatology for evaluation as she complained of joint pains at her emergency department visit. The onset of the joint pain was around the same time as the patient's swollen eyelids, however there was no joint effusion, limitation, or tenderness on exam. Subsequent radiographs of bilateral ankles and elbows also showed no joint effusion or signs of chronic arthritis. Exam did show bilateral flexible pes planus which likely contributed to patient's lower extremity pain with high impact weight-bearing activity. She had dry skin on exam without ichthyosiform cutaneous manifestations that can be seen in children with sarcoidosis. There were no discrete lesions or papules, and thus skin biopsy was not pursued. There was also no unexplained fever, weakness, alopecia, sicca symptoms, or oral ulcers by history or exam. Extensive lab evaluation showed normal/negative complete blood count, liver, kidney, and thyroid function, creatine kinase, complement studies (C3, C4, CH50), anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and urinalysis. Sedimentation rate was persistently elevated at 25 mm/hr. Genetic testing for the NOD2 gene mutation associated with Blau syndrome was not performed due to lack of uveitis, rash, and arthritis seen in this disease.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^1176LuAq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) is associated with fatigue, fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The severity of symptoms can vary. In extreme cases, breathing difficulties because of swelling in the throat and other complications can require hospitalization. The duration of symptoms is also variable; in some instances they can last for months. There are few treatments available. There are no universal criteria for using steroids in glandular fever. While their use is generally reserved for severe complications, there are reports of practitioners treating most symptomatic people with steroids. As glandular fever often affects young people at a time in their studies where they need to be continually productive, the potential duration of the condition is perhaps a key factor in prescribing such a potent drug for symptom control.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy for symptom control in glandular fever.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2005); MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2005); EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2005); and the UK National Research Register (November 2005).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness for symptom control of a steroid to placebo or to another intervention for people of any age with documented glandular fever were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors independently assessed trial inclusion according to predetermined criteria. Results are presented separately for each symptom and, where possible, it was intended to combine results in a meta-analysis.

Main Results

Seven trials were included. The diagnosis, steroid regime, outcomes and methodological quality varied between trials. The sample size ranged from 24 to 94. For sore throat the results of two studies suggest a benefit at 12 hours of steroid therapy over placebo; however this benefit was not maintained. The evidence from one trial suggests a longer benefit when the steroid is combined with an antiviral drug. There was evidence from one trial that steroids may improve resolution of fatigue around four weeks; however it is unclear if this is only in combination with an antiviral. Two trials reported severe complications in participants in the steroid group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence - the trials were few, heterogeneous and some were of poor quality, to recommend steroid treatment for symptom control in glandular fever. There is also a lack of research on the side effects, potential adverse effects or complications, particularly in the long term.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults [^112FQ7yj]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Fever of unknown origin is defined as a clinically documented temperature of 101°F or higher on several occasions, coupled with an unrevealing diagnostic workup. The differential diagnosis is broad but is typically categorized as infection, malignancy, noninfectious inflammatory disease, or miscellaneous. Most cases in adults occur because of uncommon presentations of common diseases, and up to 75% of cases will resolve spontaneously without reaching a definitive diagnosis. In the absence of localizing signs and symptoms, the workup should begin with a comprehensive history and physical examination to help narrow potential etiologies. Initial testing should include an evaluation for infectious etiologies, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, and miscellaneous causes such as venous thromboembolism and thyroiditis. If erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels are elevated and a diagnosis has not been made after initial evaluation, 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan, with computed tomography, may be useful in reaching a diagnosis. If noninvasive diagnostic tests are unrevealing, then the invasive test of choice is a tissue biopsy because of the relatively high diagnostic yield. Depending on clinical indications, this may include liver, lymph node, temporal artery, skin, skin-muscle, or bone marrow biopsy. Empiric antimicrobial therapy has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of fever of unknown origin and therefore should be avoided except in patients who are neutropenic, immunocompromised, or critically ill.

### Strep throat… [^1162iWrc]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the probability of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis in a patient who presents with sore throat. Applying the Evidence: Justin is a 13-year-old boy who has had sore throat, fever, and swollen glands for two days. On examination, he has exudative tonsillitis and tender anterior cervical nodes, but no posterior cervical adenopathy. What is his probability of having strep throat. Answer: Justin has a strep score of 5, which indicates a 52 percent risk of GABHS pharyngitis. It would be reasonable to treat him empirically. As another option, the physician could obtain a specimen for throat culture and call the patient in two days to discontinue the antibiotics if the culture is negative; however, the physician should consider the possibility of false-negative culture results when the pretest probability of strep throat is sufficiently high.

Evidence Summary The probability of GABHS pharyngitis as the cause of sore throat is greatest in children younger than 15 years, especially those younger than 10. In a typical outpatient setting, 30 percent of children five to nine years of age with sore throat have GABHS pharyngitis; the probability declines to 15 to 20 percent in preadolescents and adolescents. Only 5 to 10 percent of adults with sore throat have GABHS pharyngitis. 1–3 Signs and symptoms that help rule in GABHS pharyngitis include tonsillar exudates, pharyngeal exudates, and exposure to strep throat in the previous two weeks. 4 The presence of a scarlatiniform rash or palatine petechiae is uncommon but very specific for the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis. 4 A number of clinical decision rules have been developed and validated to help physicians more accurately estimate the probability of GABHS pharyngitis.

Some have been tested only in adults, some only in children, some only in primary care settings, and some only in emergency departments or college health centers. The spectrum of disease may differ in each setting. The best clinical decision rule, created by McIsaac and colleagues.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^114fgWhW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): DRESS can occur. Features of DRESS may include rash, fever, swollen glands and other internal organ involvement such as liver, kidney, lung and heart. DRESS is sometimes fatal; therefore, tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these signs.
Tardive Dyskinesia: This condition causes body movements that keep happening and that you cannot control. These movements usually affect the face and tongue. Tardive dyskinesia may not go away, even if you stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. It may also start after you stop taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Tell your doctor if you get any body movements that you cannot control.
Serotonin Syndrome: This is a condition that can be life threatening. Call your doctor right away if you become severely ill and have some or all of these symptoms:

agitation, hallucinations, coma or other changes in mental status
coordination problems or muscle twitching (overactive reflexes)
racing heartbeat, high or low blood pressure
sweating or fever
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
muscle rigidity
dizziness
flushing
tremor
seizures

Visual problems:

eye pain
changes in vision
swelling or redness in or around the eye

Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are.

### Axillary swelling and a reduced general condition in a middle-aged man [^1138n77B]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

A 48-year-old man presented to his GP with an indolent swelling in his left axillary region. He also complained of a cough, a feeling of pressure in his chest, general poor health, and had increasingly suffered from night-time sweating and fever. Physical examination and an ultrasound revealed an enlarged lymph node of almost 4 cm in the left axillary region and several smaller lymph nodes of 1.5–2.0 cm in the left cervical region. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Investigations

Excisional biopsy, radiography, ultrasound, CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, radionuclide imaging, echocardiography and lung function tests.

Diagnosis

Early-stage unfavorable (intermediate) lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Management

Chemotherapy (treatment with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) and involved-field radiotherapy.

### Intraglandular toxoplasmic lymphadenitis of the parotid gland [^111Sgkzn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Most preauricular masses are parotid neoplasms; however, some infectious and inflammatory causes may exhibit similar presentation. Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide parasitary disease. The clinical presentation of toxoplasmosis is mostly asymptomatic and may include subfebrile fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. Only 13 clinical reports of intraglandular toxoplasmic lymphadenitis have been previously reported in the English literature. A careful history and examination with appropriate investigations, including immunoglobulin G avidity assay, will frequently provide the diagnosis of intraparotid toxoplasmosis. Surgery might therefore have been delayed or avoided depending on a satisfactory clinical improvement in consequence of proper medical treatment.

### Bacillus calmette-guerin (Tice bcg) [^1141jofK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of Serious BCG Complications

Acute, localized irritative toxicities of TICE BCG may be accompanied by systemic manifestations, consistent with a "flu-like" syndrome. Systemic adverse effects of 1 to 2 days' duration such as malaise, fever, and chills often reflect hypersensitivity reactions. However, symptoms such as fever of ≥ 38.5°C (101.3°F), or acute localized inflammation such as epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis persisting longer than 2 to 3 days suggest active infection, and evaluation for serious infectious complication should be considered.

In patients who develop persistent fever or experience an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, 2 or more antimycobacterial agents should be administered while diagnostic evaluation, including cultures, is conducted. BCG treatment should be discontinued. Negative cultures do not necessarily rule out infection. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of BCG-related complications and, when appropriate, should consult an infectious disease specialist or other physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infections.

TICE BCG is sensitive to the most commonly used antituberculous agents (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol). TICE BCG is not sensitive to pyrazinamide.

### Kikuchi disease: a case report [^116SrP8s]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Kikuchi disease, also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, is a rare, benign cause of cervical lymphadenitis. It is characterized by painful cervical lymphadenopathy with fevers, leukopenia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is diagnosed by obtaining a biopsy specimen from a lymph node that shows characteristic histopathologic findings.

Case Report

We highlight a 42-year-old Japanese man who presented with persistent fevers and cervical lymphadenopathy who was misdiagnosed at multiple urgent care facilities and emergency departments. He was eventually diagnosed with Kikuchi disease after a biopsy specimen was obtained from a lymph node 1 month after his symptoms began. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone with resolution of his symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although Kikuchi disease has been previously described in various specialty medical journals, the published literature on Kikuchi disease in emergency medicine is relatively scarce. Given that cervical lymphadenopathy is a common presentation to emergency departments, it is important for emergency physicians to be cognizant of Kikuchi disease in the differential diagnosis of cervical lymphadenopathy to prevent misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments.

### Albendazole alone or in combination with microfilaricidal drugs for lymphatic filariasis [^116V1Skf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Many people with filariasis are asymptomatic, even when there are high parasite densities. However, even people without clinical symptoms often have lymphatic changes, including lymphangiectasia (widening of the lymphatic vessels) and thickening of the spermatic cord (Addiss 2000; Dreyer 2000), which can be detected using ultrasound.

People can experience acute inflammatory episodes, including acute filarial lymphangitis (AFL), believed to be triggered by the death of the adult worm, and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA), linked with secondary bacterial infection (Dreyer 1999). An AFL episode presents with lymphangitis that spreads distally or in a 'retrograde' manner along the lymphatic vessel, creating a palpable 'cord' (Addiss 2007). ADLA episodes reportedly may last up to 16 days and cause malaise, fever, chills, pain, and swelling, with episodes typically recurring several times a year (Addiss 2007). Symptoms of ADLA are more severe and occur much more frequently compared to AFL (Dreyer 1999). Recurrent ADLA attacks are a major factor in the progression to chronic lymphoedema. Clinical symptoms and signs of chronic conditions include hydrocoele (excess fluid inside the scrotal sac), lymphoedema (swelling and enlargement of affected areas of the body), and elephantiasis (long‐standing enlargement and swelling of the limbs, scrota, or breasts associated with skin thickening).

How the filarial worm causes disease is not well understood. The following have been proposed: adult worms living in and damaging lymph vessels; immunological reactions to the presence and death of filarial worms; secondary infections of affected areas, which contribute significantly to both acute and chronic disease manifestations; and host genetics (Dreyer 2000; Cuenco 2009). A major contributor to inflammation is the release of lipoproteins from the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia, which is found within the cells of filarial worms (Taylor 2001; Turner 2009). Some or all of these processes may be important in pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis (Babu 2012).

### Proceedings of the 31st European paediatric rheumatology congress: part 2 [^1142z5Tt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods: We described the initial presentation, clinical course, laboratory and imaging results, treatment and outcome of two pediatric patients with TAFRO syndrome presentation, followed at our tertiary referral center.

Results: Case 1. A 14-year-old Caucasian male presented with persistent fever, headache, vomiting, and positive Helicobacter pylori antigen. Symptoms progressed to an inflammatory syndrome with fever, and generalized anasarca, necessitating ICU admission. A lymph node biopsy confirmed Castleman's Disease suspicion. Acute renal failure required hemodialysis; renal biopsy revealed tubular necrosis. Central venous catheter removal led to dyspnoea and hemoptysis from superior vena cava thrombosis, treated with heparin. For the onset of seizures a brain MRI was performed, showing leptomeningeal involvement. Case 2. An 8-year-old North African female was transferred to our institute due to persistent fever associated with vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, and progressive development of anasarca. A change in behaviour with aggressiveness prompted a brain MRI, revealing a small frontal ischemic focus requiring heparin therapy. Blood and platelet transfusions were required. Total body MRI showed multiple lymphadenopathies; axillary lymph node biopsy confirmed histology compatible with Castleman's disease. Interestingly, the patient tested positive for anti-SSA/Ro and SSB/Ra autoantibodies on multiple occasions, despite never experiencing xerostomia or xerophthalmia and having normal salivary gland ultrasound at onset. Salivary gland biopsy, however, revealed lymphocytic infiltration. In both cases, given the poor response to antibiotics, high-dose intravenous steroid therapy, combined with interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra) and supportive treatment, allowed to control the clinical picture. The two patients are still in treatment with IL-1-inhibitor for 6 years and 6 months respectively with complete control of the disease.

### Amyloid goiter: a diagnosis to consider in diffuse fatty infiltration of the thyroid [^114wME83]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

An amyloid goiter is the presence of amyloid protein in the thyroid in sufficient amounts to produce enlargement of the gland, accompanied by fat deposition of varying extents. It can be seen in long-standing inflammatory disorders such as familial Mediterranean fever. Imaging findings depend on the amount of fat and amyloid deposition; however, the main imaging finding is diffuse fatty infiltration of the thyroid. Herein, the multimodality imaging features in 3 cases of amyloid goiters secondary to familial Mediterranean fever are presented.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. < 38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. > 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. 'Red flags' for malignancy are a diameter > 1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### Infectious mononucleosis… [^112HmwKa]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Ebell MH. Infectious Mononucleosis. JAMA. 2016; 315:

1532. doi: 10.1001/jama.2016.2474 Infectious mononucleosis is an infection that causes sore throat, fever, swollen glands, and tiredness or fatigue. Most patients with mono have a sore throat, fever, and headache and feel tired or fatigued. Most also have swollen glands in the neck, behind the ears, and even toward the back of the head. Some also have pus on the tonsils and small red dots on the roof of the mouth. A doctor may order a blood test to help diagnose mono. He or she may look for certain kinds of white blood cells called lymphocytes. Patients with mono may have high levels of lymphocytes in their blood, especially forms of these cells called atypical lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are not dangerous and are produced by the body to help fight infection. A doctor may also order a test for the antibodies that the lymphocytes make to fight the infection, often called a monospot test.

Because it takes your body time to make these antibodies, the results of these tests are sometimes normal in patients who actually do have mono, especially during the first week or so of their infection. Treatment for mono consists mainly of rest. Patients can take medicine such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen for fever and body aches. Aspirin should be avoided in children because it is associated with Reye syndrome. Corticosteroids are sometimes prescribed in severe cases or in patients with complications. Patients should get as much rest as they need, but being confined to bed is not necessary and does not improve outcomes. Antibiotics do not help unless the patient has also had a positive test result for strep throat. Many patients with mono have an enlarged spleen, which is part of their body's response to the infection.

Because an enlarged spleen is more likely to rupture, patients with mono should avoid contact sports and activities that could result in blows to the abdomen until they have recovered. It may take 3 months or more to completely recover from mono. Womack J, Jimenez M. Common questions about infectious mononucleosis. Am Fam Physician. 2015; 91: 372–376.

### Febrile palpebral edema [^112usaed]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Atopic dermatitis (AD) flareup – Incorrect. Although a flareup of AD may accompany viral infection, there is no erythema, pruritus, or scaling of the eyelids. Integument examination did not show any symptoms of AD. Dennie-Morgan infraorbital folds are a double crease on the lower eyelids and are a minor criterion of AD. This sign was not observed in the patient.
B. Kawasaki disease – Incorrect. Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis that occurs mainly in children. It combines persistent high fever for at least 5 days and 4 of the 5 following criteria: bilateral conjunctival congestion, lips and oral cavity alterations (cheilitis, strawberry tongue, and polymorphous rash), changes of the extremities, and cervical adenopathy without any other explanation. There is no specific testing. Main complication is coronary aneurysms. Echocardiography is a must.
C. Trichinosis – Incorrect. Trichinosis is a parasitic infection caused by nematodes, and it occurs worldwide secondary to the consumption of undercooked meat. Although palpebral edema is described in the larval dissemination phase, it typically manifests as a triad of symptoms, including fever, myalgia, and edema (particularly palpebral). Blood tests may reveal an elevation of creatine kinase and eosinophilia.
D. Herpetic blepharitis – Incorrect. Herpetic blepharitis is typically unilateral and manifests as monopalpebral vesicular rash, eyelid edema, skin erythema, and acute local pain. Atypical lymphocytosis is extremely unusual.
E. Infectious mononucleosis – Correct. Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and usually presents with a triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. A transient edema of the bilateral upper eyelids, known as Hoagland sign, is an occasional early sign of the infection. This finding is more commonly reported in pediatric patients compared with adults. The pathophysiology remains unclear; palpebral edema may be related to the lymphatic obstruction or lymphocyte infiltration of the lachrymal glands by lymphoproliferation.

### Bilateral parotid swelling with blindness [^115P62NM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with bilateral parotid gland enlargement. She had no systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, and weight loss. She had bilateral blindness for a long time. The results of a physical examination revealed a bilateral firm, painless mass in the parotid region. A computed tomographic scan showed no clear lymphadenopathy in the neck but showed localized infiltrates and multiple pulmonary nodules with enlargement of the mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes in the chest. The patient underwent a superficial parotidectomy. A histopathologic finding revealed an epithelioid noncaseating granuloma, which is consistent with sarcoidosis. In summary, this current study shows that sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all painless swelling of the parotid gland, especially in women, which could be an earlier complaint.

### Analysis of vitamin D nutritional status and disease risk factors in patients with subacute thyroiditis [^116wADRG]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Research methods

General medical information including sex, age, medical history, height (cm), weight (kg), and body mass index (BMI; weight in kg/height in m²) was collected. In SAT patients, the presence of fever, the maximum temperature during fever, enlargement of the thyroid gland, and tenderness of the thyroid gland were recorded. Additionally, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), 25 (OH)D, free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb), 25(OH)D, thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and free thyroxine/free triiodothyronine (FT4/FT3) data were recorded in SAT patients. The severity of SAT was scored as follows: fever — none, < 38°C, and > 38°C (0, 1, and 2 points, respectively); tenderness — none, mild, and severe (0, 1, and 2 points, respectively); goiter palpation — none and yes (0 and 1 point, respectively); and ESR — normal, 21–50 mm/h, and > 50 mm/h (0, 1, and 2 points, respectively). A score of < 3 and ⩾3 was defined as mild SAT and moderately severe SAT, respectively. After the SAT diagnosis, according to the treatment guidelines of the Chinese and American Thyroid Association, patients with mild SAT were advised general treatment (adequate rest and plenty of drinking water) or oral NSAIDs, and glucocorticoid hormone treatment was provided for other bodily symptoms such as persistent high fever, thyroid pain, enlarged thyroid gland with marked tenderness, or ineffective treatment with NSAIDs.

### Exploring the clinical diversity of castleman disease and TAFRO syndrome: a Japanese multicenter study on lymph node distribution patterns [^111LUEdA]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals diagnosed with Castleman disease (CD) and TAFRO syndrome (characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, bone marrow fibrosis, and organomegaly) displays a wide range of clinical symptoms, including varying patterns of lymph node enlargement, systemic inflammation, and impaired organ function. Some patients may present with both CD and TAFRO syndrome concurrently. A retrospective study conducted across multiple centers in Japan examined 321 cases to determine if the quantity and position of swollen lymph nodes could forecast the clinical progression and intensity of these conditions. Interestingly, the study revealed that patients with TAFRO syndrome exhibited lymphadenopathy across all ranges of lymph node region counts. Moreover, no specific clinical patterns were associated with the number of affected lymph node regions in CD patients, regardless of whether they also had TAFRO syndrome. These results enhance our understanding of the clinical variability in CD and TAFRO syndrome, suggesting that a comprehensive clinical evaluation, rather than relying solely on lymph node count, is crucial for effectively managing these conditions. Additional studies are required to establish reliable diagnostic markers and to predict disease severity at the time of diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
