## Question

any evidence for treatments?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for treatments. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and grade the strength of evidence using established frameworks. Then, I should verify how to appraise individual studies for validity and applicability. Next, I will consider evidence hierarchies and the role of RCTs, observational studies, and synthesis methods. After that, I should apply disease-specific examples to illustrate the process. Finally, I need to integrate patient values, implementation science, and guideline quality into a practical decision-making approach with shared decision-making at the center.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework for judging evidence. The GRADE system provides a transparent way to rate certainty of evidence and translate that into strong or conditional recommendations, while GRADEpro and similar tools standardize these judgments; for time-sensitive decisions, rapid reviews adapt GRADE to preserve core principles while accelerating assessment, so I should keep both the full and accelerated GRADE workflows in mind depending on urgency and scope [^113dGx3U] [^117X8a5p].

> I need to check how evidence strength is typically described. High-quality evidence usually reflects consistent results across multiple high-quality RCTs or well-conducted meta-analyses, whereas moderate-quality evidence may rely on fewer RCTs or high-quality observational data; low or very low quality evidence reflects design limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, or indirectness, so I should verify that each appraisal I make aligns with these categories and is explicit about downgrades and reasons [^113dGx3U].

> Next, I should review how to appraise individual studies. Validity hinges on study design, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition, and outcome ascertainment. For therapy questions, I must confirm whether the control was appropriate and whether patient-important outcomes were measured and analyzed with intention-to-treat principles. Applicability requires matching populations, interventions, and settings to the patient in front of me, so I need to double-check that external validity is not being over-assumed [^111EsXYJ] [^1112Xz8Z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about study quality just because it's an RCT. Implementation flaws like inadequate power, suboptimal randomization or masking, or lack of validated outcomes can downgrade a nominally Level I RCT to a lower effective level, so I should confirm the details of conduct and reporting before assigning weight [^112r9KFM].

> I will now examine evidence hierarchies, but I should confirm I don't overstate them. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs generally sit at the top for internal validity, with individual RCTs, observational studies, and mechanistic or expert evidence following; however, high-quality observational data using target trial emulation and causal inference methods can provide useful effectiveness signals, and for some questions — especially rare diseases, real-world policy, or harms — observational designs are indispensable, so I must weigh the question type against the hierarchy rather than apply it rigidly [^1163SfpY] [^117St3Me] [^1144nfK1].

> Let me consider indirect and network evidence carefully. When head-to-head trials are lacking, network meta-analyses can rank interventions using direct and indirect comparisons, but I should verify assumptions of homogeneity and consistency and check for effect modifiers that could bias indirect estimates. Still, NMAs often increase precision and can yield robust comparative inferences when assumptions are reasonable [^112hgkeG] [^111m1d7d] [^116AbVUd].

> Next, I should review disease-specific exemplars to make this concrete. For carpal tunnel syndrome, contemporary high-quality comparative evidence suggests no consistent superiority among nonoperative treatments; guideline panels downgraded to a conditional option and emphasized shared decision-making and cost considerations, so I need to ensure I don't over-recommend any one modality without clear benefit [^115Z1XXE].

> For low back pain, I should double-check how recommendations are graded. NASS and related guidelines tie letter grades to levels of evidence, requiring consistent Level I studies for Grade A; if evidence is limited or inconsistent, Grade I ("insufficient") is appropriate, so I must be explicit about whether I'm suggesting, recommending, or stating insufficient evidence based on the volume and consistency of high-quality data [^114xtQtx] [^1168DSRb].

> For PTSD, let me verify the comparative framework. The APA guideline distinguishes efficacy versus inactive controls from comparative effectiveness versus active treatments, and it rates strength of evidence across outcomes; treatments are tiered by the certainty and direction of benefit, with conditional recommendations reflecting lower certainty, so I should align my counseling with that tiered structure and be transparent about the comparator used in the evidence base [^1122LxzK] [^116ftJE6].

> But wait, what if there is no high-quality direct evidence at all. In lymphedema, current evidence does not support pharmacologic therapy, so I should avoid recommending medications for disease modification and instead emphasize established conservative measures, clearly documenting that the recommendation is driven by negative or insufficient evidence rather than bias against nonpharmacologic care [^116vKX6S].

> I should confirm that my use of guidelines meets trustworthiness standards. Trustworthy guidelines use systematic reviews, GRADE, explicit consideration of benefits, harms, burdens, and costs, and they disclose conflicts; GOBSAT approaches undermine credibility, so I need to check for adherence to these methodological safeguards before relying on a guideline's recommendations [^113MKVkR].

> Let me integrate patient values and preferences, because this can change the optimal choice even when evidence is strong. Shared decision-making should be explicit, using NNT/NNH and decision aids where available, and I must verify that my framing aligns with what matters to the patient, including acceptability, feasibility, and cost, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all "best" option [^113dGx3U] [^111JDrd7].

> I need to ensure I account for heterogeneity of treatment effects and personalize estimates. Predictive approaches that stratify by baseline risk or model effect modifiers can narrow the reference class and provide more patient-specific benefit estimates, but I should double-check calibration and transportability before applying these tools to an individual patient [^113VghbY].

> Next, I should review implementation science principles to close the evidence-to-practice gap. Measurement-based care, care pathways, and pragmatic trials can improve uptake and outcomes in real-world settings; I should confirm that the chosen intervention is not only efficacious but also feasible and sustainable in the local system of care [^113HkV48] [^1146cws5].

> Hold on, I should verify the evolving critique of evidence-based medicine and avoid dogmatism. Calls for "real EBM" emphasize individualization, attention to patient experience, and recognition of uncertainty; this means I must continuously re-evaluate whether the evidence truly applies to this patient, today, in this context, and document that reasoning transparently [^113qNnid] [^111JDrd7].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach I can defend. Define the clinical question in PICO terms and classify it as efficacy, comparative effectiveness, or effectiveness. Search for the highest-level synthesis first, then individual studies. Appraise validity, precision, consistency, and applicability. Rate certainty with GRADE and map to recommendation strength. Consider patient values, comorbidities, and context. And document the decision rationale, noting any evidence gaps that warrant shared monitoring and reassessment over time [^113dGx3U] [^117X8a5p] [^111EsXYJ].

---

The best evidence for treatment decisions comes from **RCTs and meta-analyses** [^111EsXYJ] at the top of the evidence hierarchy, with observational studies and expert opinion used when higher-level evidence is limited [^114xtQtx] [^117St3Me]. Evidence quality varies by study design, population, and outcomes, so **apply GRADE to judge certainty** and tailor choices to patient values and context [^117X8a5p] [^1112Xz8Z]. Use guidelines and living reviews to stay current, and **prefer interventions with consistent, reproducible benefits** across high-quality studies [^1146KT9N] [^114NGGwh].

---

## Hierarchy of evidence

The evidence hierarchy ranks study designs by their ability to **minimize bias and confounding** [^1112Xz8Z]:

| **Level** | **Study design** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Systematic reviews and meta-analyses | Synthesize multiple RCTs; highest internal validity [^1163SfpY] |
| 2 | Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) | Gold standard for causal inference; control for confounding [^113QE5aq] |
| 3 | Observational studies (cohort, case-control) | Useful when RCTs infeasible; prone to bias [^117St3Me] |
| 4 | Expert opinion, case reports | Lowest level; useful when other evidence absent [^111SKDBo] |

---

RCTs and meta-analyses are considered the **highest quality evidence** because they control for confounding and bias, whereas observational studies and expert opinion are more susceptible to bias and confounding [^1163SfpY].

---

## Evaluating evidence quality

Several factors influence **evidence quality**:

- **Study design**: RCTs > observational studies > expert opinion [^115KoroL].
- **Sample size and power**: Larger samples improve precision and generalizability [^notfound].
- **Consistency of results**: Reproducible findings across studies increase confidence [^1168DSRb].
- **Directness of evidence**: Direct comparisons between interventions are stronger than indirect evidence [^111m1d7d].
- **Risk of bias**: Assessed using tools like Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I [^notfound].

---

## Grading systems

Grading systems, such as GRADE, provide a **standardized approach** to assessing evidence quality and strength of recommendations [^113dGx3U]. GRADE considers:

- **Quality of evidence**: High, moderate, low, very low [^1114uRHt].
- **Balance of benefits and harms**: Net clinical benefit [^113dGx3U].
- **Patient values and preferences**: Importance of shared decision-making [^111JDrd7].
- **Resource considerations**: Cost-effectiveness and feasibility [^113QE5aq].

---

## Limitations and biases

Common **limitations and biases** include:

- **Publication bias**: Positive results more likely to be published [^116JSLSa].
- **Selection bias**: Non-randomized studies prone to confounding [^1114uRHt].
- **Measurement bias**: Inconsistent outcome measures or follow-up [^notfound].
- **Industry sponsorship**: Potential for biased reporting [^111RkeC1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines synthesize evidence and provide **recommendations**. Trustworthy guidelines use rigorous methods, transparent processes, and consider patient values [^113MKVkR]. However, guidelines may lag behind emerging evidence, and some recommendations are based on lower-quality evidence or expert consensus [^117St3Me].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Evidence must be **individualized** to the patient, considering:

- **Clinical characteristics**: Age, comorbidities, disease severity [^115xK4WW].
- **Preferences and values**: Shared decision-making is essential [^111JDrd7].
- **Resource availability**: Access, cost, and feasibility [^115ZZVhf].

---

## Emerging trends

Recent developments include **living systematic reviews** for real-time updates, **network meta-analyses** for multiple comparisons, and **personalized medicine** to tailor interventions to individual patient characteristics [^114NGGwh] [^112hgkeG] [^113VghbY].

---

The best evidence for treatment decisions comes from **RCTs and meta-analyses**, with quality assessed using standardized grading systems like GRADE [^113dGx3U]. Evidence must be **individualized** to patient characteristics and preferences, and clinicians should remain aware of biases and limitations in the literature [^113VghbY] [^117St3Me].

### APA guidelines on evidence-based psychological practice in health care [^113QE5aq]. APA (2021). High credibility.

Research evidence — when evaluating the research evidence, psychologists endeavor to pay attention to both efficacy (the strength of evidence for a causal effect) and clinical utility (generalizability, feasibility, and cost–benefit analysis) and recognize the value of various study designs including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case control studies, case series, single-case experimental designs, process-outcome studies, effectiveness research, ethnographic research, clinical observation, qualitative research, and mixed-methods research; different designs are best suited to answering different types of questions. For example, RCTs control most effectively for threats to internal validity and are thus best suited for drawing causal inferences about treatment effects; however, RCTs often have specific selection criteria that may not generalize to patients typically seen in practice, generally study changes in diagnostic symptoms or status, typically do not test the mechanisms hypothesized to underlie the treatment, and generally examine treatments as a whole such that RCT findings for multicomponent treatment methods do not identify the necessary and sufficient subcomponents. Effectiveness studies are well positioned to establish the ecological validity and portability of treatments in real-world practice settings.

### Use of massage therapy for pain, 2018–2023: a systematic review [^1119Z66M]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Although this systematic review found that the number of conclusions about the effectiveness of massage therapy that were judged to have at least moderate certainty of evidence was greater now than in 2018, it was still small relative to the need. More high-quality randomized clinical trials are needed to provide a stronger evidence base to assess the effect of massage therapy on pain. For painful conditions that do not have at least moderate-certainty evidence supporting use of massage therapy, new studies that address limitations of existing research are needed. The field of massage therapy would be best advanced by educating the wider research community with clearer definitions of massage therapy and whether it is appropriate to include multiple modalities in the same systematic review.

### Asking a question: linking evidence with practice [^112Q6NFr]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

For clinicians and researchers alike, a clear and answerable question is the starting line of the evidence-based practice process. For clinicians, the question captures the patient and defines the information needed to treat this patient. For researchers, the question directs study design and drives everything from recruitment to reporting. The question is also the anchor point that links clinical practice to research. Engaging in evidence-based practice forces a subconscious process that occurs during assessment of the patient into the conscious mind and makes it explicit. Clearly and concisely defining the question leads directly to the search for relevant research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(7):596–597. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0702.

Delivery format of stop‑smoking interventions with evidence of effectiveness — group, individual, phone, and technology-based modalities: Group in‑person support with multiple sessions facilitated by a trained specialist plus pharmacotherapy, when properly implemented, increases quit rates by 300% compared with unassisted quitting. Individual in‑person support with multiple counseling sessions plus pharmacotherapy increases quit rates by 200%–300% compared with unassisted quitting, and individual by phone support increases quit rates by 50%–100% compared with unassisted quitting. Brief advice delivered by a doctor or other healthcare provider plus pharmacotherapy increases quit rates by 50% compared with unassisted quitting, and adding follow‑up visits/calls can increase quit rates. Text messaging increases quit rates by 70% when used alone or as an adjunct to other treatment approaches, and the evidence supporting the effectiveness of smartphone apps is currently limited. As an adjunct to other treatment approaches, online systems may be useful; however, as a stand‑alone treatment there is limited evidence that online systems are very effective in increasing quit rates, and as an adjunct written materials may be useful; however, there is little evidence that written materials are effective in increasing quit rates when used as a stand‑alone treatment.

### Evidence-based medicine [^1157AZ2r]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine refers to an explicit process of using and evaluating information to make medical decisions. Evidence-based medicine, perhaps contrary to popular perception, requires its users to embrace uncertainty in medical decision making because information that is simultaneously true and complete cannot be attained. Recognizing medicine's inherent uncertainty, proponents of evidence-based medicine advocate using a five-step process for sound decision making: formulate answerable questions, gather evidence, appraise the evidence, implement the valid evidence, and evaluate the process. The formulation of answerable questions requires categorizing the facts of the case in terms that allow comparison to evidence gathered from prior studies. The appraisal of the evidence uses the tools of clinical epidemiology to assess the validity and applicability of the evidence. Implementation refers to the construction of a clinical plan based on the evidence collected as well as on the physician's judgment and patient's preferences. Finally, evidence-based medicine requires continued evaluation and refinement. The methods of evidence-based medicine are especially germane to contemporary medicine as physicians practice under increasing demands to deliver optimal outcomes yet face an ever-expanding body of medical knowledge.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^116ftJE6]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD clinical practice guideline evidence synthesis methods — control comparators, intervention grouping, and effect size handling — are described as follows: In efficacy, effectiveness, and comparative effectiveness research, the nature of the control condition is the foundation for building a comparison, and how control conditions were defined and grouped in the systematic reviews made clarity about the comparator condition a challenge. Systematic reviews sometimes distinguished inactive from active comparators with labels such as "waitlist", "assessment only", "treatment as usual", "psychoeducation", and "advocacy", yet some "inactive" control conditions incorporated active therapy components; because what counts as "inactive" was inconsistent, the Panel examined waitlist conditions separately from treatment as usual or other control conditions where possible. Interventions were commonly combined when they shared therapeutic features but not always combined similarly; for example, cognitive therapy techniques might be grouped together or separated into specific interventions (e.g. CPT) or techniques (e.g., cognitive restructuring). When specific and brand-name interventions were grouped within larger categories, this raised questions about distinct recommendations and impinged on the level of detail the Panel could make in coverage of/comments on these therapies; to address this, whenever there was a sizable literature base for a brand-name therapy not examined individually in meta-analyses, the Panel included a discussion of the specific evidence base in the guideline narrative. Recommendations were made separately based on the comparator used for a specific intervention for efficacy (e.g., waitlist, TAU, placebo) and comparative effectiveness (e.g., another active intervention), and there was occasional variation between showing efficacy and comparative effectiveness (superiority or noninferiority). Finally, standardized effect size estimates depend on review methods and can be problematic when RCT sample sizes are small or when network meta-analyses include low sample size studies; based on this and other limitations of network meta-analyses, the Panel used direct but not indirect effect size estimates from the network meta-analysis.

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of… [^116JSLSa]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY Although the use of antidepressants is widespread, research has shown mixed effectiveness. Selective publication of positive results causes meta-analyses of published trials to exaggerate the benefits of treatment. 4 A review of published clinical trials of 12 antidepressants approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration between 1987 and 2004 suggested that 94% of trials had positive results; in contrast, the FDA analysis of all studies showed that only 51% had positive results.
4. 1 All studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were of short duration and were industry funded. The number needed to treat ranged from seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants and seven or eight for SSRIs. Numbers needed to treat were generated from studies with dichotomous remission outcomes: either 50% reduction from the initial score, or a score of less than 8 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY Clinical guidelines based on moderate-quality evidence recommend choosing among second-generation antidepressants based on cost, adverse effect profiles, and patient preference. EVIDENCE SUMMARY The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial studied 2, 876 adults 18 to 75 years of age who were treated for nonpsychotic depression in the psychiatric or primary care setting. Two meta-analyses of published and unpublished studies submitted to the FDA concluded that antidepressants were superior to placebo in patients with more severe depression, and that there was little difference between drug therapy and placebo in patients with less severe depression. 44, 45 Patients with severe depression did not respond as well to placebo. A patient-level meta-analysis of six trials found that patients with severe depression had more robust responses to antidepressants compared with placebo than did patients with mild to moderate depression.

56 A randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with recurrent depression who were treated to remission with venlafaxine or fluoxetine for six months. 57 The venlafaxine-treated group was then randomized to maintenance venlafaxine or placebo for 12 months, after which those with sustained remission in the venlafaxine arm were rerandomized for another 12 months. Those treated with fluoxetine were continued on fluoxetine for both maintenance phases. After both follow-up periods, depression recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients treated with fluoxetine or venlafaxine compared with those who received placebo.

### Grading the evidence: levels of evidence and grades of recommendation [^111rnfhw]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine is using the best available evidence in order to make accurate and knowledgeable treatment decisions. It is not the automatic gainsay of "low quality" evidence and acceptance of randomized controlled trials (RCT's). To be able to make a sound recommendation for a therapy based on the best available evidence, it is necessary to follow steps in acquiring literature, appraising it for study design and quality, and to assess its results, as well as look at the net benefits and net harms.

### Patterns of scientific and clinical impact in cancer randomized clinical trials [^1139B3fX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Findings from randomized clinical trials of cancer treatments represent the highest level of evidence for informing cancer care guidelines. Trials with both positive and negative findings can influence guideline care recommendations. This highlights the importance of completing all trials successfully and demonstrates how trials with negative findings are critical for understanding which newly developed treatments should not be used. One question is whether negative trials that influence guideline care are recognized for their scientific relevance by the research community.

### What constitutes reasonable evidence of efficacy and effectiveness to guide oncology treatment decisions? [^111f9AZ6]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

The need to practice evidence-based medicine is the current prevailing paradigm within the medical community. Evidence to guide practice can and should come from a variety of sources, including clinical trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of both or either. This paper discusses the relative strengths and weaknesses of data that arise from these various sources. The different types of evidence required to demonstrate "efficacy" versus "effectiveness", a critical and often overlooked distinction, are discussed. In the genomic age, in which targeted therapies with or without specific biomarkers are emerging in cancer care, new approaches are necessary to generate the evidence required for decision making.

### Evidence-based cessation treatment… [^113zBjLc]. progressreport.cancer.gov (2011). Low credibility.

Cessation success is increased by the use of evidence-based treatment, including the use of behavioral counseling and medications. The combination of behavioral counseling and medication is especially effective. FDA-approved cessation medications include various forms of nicotine replacement therapy, and two medications that do not contain nicotine: bupropion, and varenicline. Behavioral support can be delivered in person, in group settings, over the phone, and with other mobile technology tools and methods. However, few people who smoke use evidence-based cessation treatments when attempting to quit, which decreases their likelihood of success.

Measure The three measures presented here use a common denominator consisting of adults who smoke at the time of interview and report a quit attempt during the past 12 months as well as adults who formerly smoked but quit smoking within the past 12 months. The numerators for each measure consist of adults reporting the following behaviors:

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should it be practiced? [^111yGMc4]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Responding to the limitations of traditional expert recommendations as a guide to clinical practice, evidence-based medicine has presented a paradigm shift in the way clinicians learn and practice medicine. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires careful examination of the evidence, using a set of formal rules applied in an explicit manner. The clinician then judiciously applies the evidence to decision-making, with an understanding of the patient context and values. Using examples pertinent to respiratory therapists, we discuss evidence-based decision-making as a clinical problem-solving strategy, its basis on a hierarchy of evidence, and the interplay of values, preferences, expertise, and circumstances that affect its application. We briefly describe some resources available to obtain evidence reports and to learn to critically appraise and apply them.

### How to appraise the effectiveness of treatment [^111EsXYJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Before implementing a new therapy, we should ascertain the benefits and risks of the therapy and assure ourselves that the resources consumed during the intervention will not be exorbitant. In the hierarchy of research designs, the results of randomized controlled trials, especially if systematically reviewed, are considered the highest level of evidence. We suggest a three-step approach to using an article from the medical literature to guide your patient care. We recommend that readers ask whether the study can provide valid results, review the results, and consider how the results can be applied to patient care. Given the time constraints of busy surgical practices and surgical training programs, applying this analysis to every relevant article will be challenging. However, the basis of this process is essentially what we all do many times each week when making decisions about whether and how to treat patients. Making this process explicit with guidelines to assess the strength of the available evidence can serve to improve patient care. It also allow us to defend therapeutic interventions based on available evidence and not anecdote.

### Are there circumstances in which phase 2 study results should be practice-changing? [^11248WV2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

New pharmaceuticals, innovative combinations of approved agents, and novel treatment modalities have resulted in a marked increase in the need for clinical trials. Evidence for treatment efficacy is best derived from large phase 3 randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, phase 3 investigations are lengthy and expensive, and consume patient resources. Furthermore, some diseases and treatment indications are rare, and adequate numbers of patients for a definitive phase 3 trial do not exist. Consequently, it is imperative for clinicians to understand phase 2 trial design, since their interpretation is required to apply the findings in clinical practice appropriately. The complexity of phase 2 studies is explored, including unique designs, possible use of randomization, and other key elements necessary for interpretation of phase 2 trials. Specific examples and application of these concepts are discussed in this review.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^1168DSRb]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Appendix C — linking levels of evidence to grades of recommendation maps standard language and evidence thresholds as follows: Grade A is "Recommended" with "Two or more consistent Level I studies"; Grade B is "Suggested" with either "One Level I study with additional supporting Level II or III studies" or "Two or more consistent level II or III studies"; Grade C is "May be considered; is an option" with either "One Level I, II, III or IV study with supporting Level IV studies" or "Two or more consistent Level IV studies"; and Grade I is "Insufficient evidence to make recommendation for or against" with "A single level I, II, III or IV study without other supporting evidence" or "More than one study with inconsistent findings". The footnote clarifies, " Note that in the presence of multiple consistent studies and a single outlying, inconsistent study, the Grade of Recommendation will be based on the level of the consistent studies".

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^111cVNp3]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Research must transcend conflicts of interest

To support real evidence based medicine, and in particular to reassure policy makers, clinicians, and the public that research and the guidance derived from it can be trusted, the infrastructure for research and guideline development must show the highest standards of probity. Independent funding of national bodies for medical research is crucial.

Broader, more imaginative research is needed

The research agenda for real evidence based medicine is much broader than critical appraisal and draws on a wider range of underpinning disciplines. For example, it should include the study of the patient's experience of illness and the real life clinical encounter for different conditions and in different circumstances. The field would be enriched, for example, by qualitative research to elucidate the logic of care–that is, the numerous elements of good illness management that are complementary to the application of research evidence.

We need to gain a better understanding (perhaps beginning with a synthesis of the cognitive psychology literature) of how clinicians and patients find, interpret, and evaluate evidence from research studies, and how (and if) these processes feed into clinical communication, exploration of diagnostic options, and shared decision making. Deeper study is also needed into the less algorithmic components of clinical method such as intuition and heuristic reasoning, and how evidence may be incorporated into such reasoning.

In relation to producing usable evidence, we need to identify how to balance gold standard systematic reviews with pragmatic, rapid reviews that gain in timeliness and accessibility what they lose in depth and detail. In the same vein, we need research on how and in what circumstances to trade detail for brevity in developing guidelines. We need to develop decision aids that support clinicians and patients to clarify the goals of care, raise and answer questions about the quality and completeness of evidence, and understand and contextualise estimates of benefit and harm. We also need to improve both the usefulness and ease of use of these and other evidence based tools (models, scores, algorithms, and so on) including the intellectual, social, and temporal demands they make on users and the resource implications for the healthcare organisation and system.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^1114uRHt]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Evaluating the evidence (APA Depression Guideline) — Evidence profiles were created by the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center team from systematic reviews and include, for each outcome, the number of studies, absolute effect sizes, confidence intervals (when available), and strength of evidence ratings. Decision tables and grids were used to summarize and evaluate evidence, with four main domains documented: (1) strength of evidence; (2) treatment outcomes and the balance of benefits vs. harms and burdens of interventions; (3) patient values and preferences; and (4) applicability of the evidence to various treatment populations. Strength of evidence was rated as either insufficient/very low, low, moderate, or high, and only interventions that had at least low strength of evidence for one of the outcomes were decision tables or grids completed. The panel generated evidence that met the criteria for the completion of 38 decision tables and three grids on which to base the APA Depression Guideline. To improve efficiency while maintaining consistency and transparency, a revised "grid" process was created with distinct columns for separate questions and outcomes and individual decision-making regarding efficacy but shared consideration of the same data for harms and burdens across columns. Although some questioned applicability of randomized trials, the panel decided not to supplement the randomized trials with observational or other treatment studies due to potential confounding bias, but made two significant exceptions when randomized trial data were lacking on two outcomes — (1) harms and burdens of psychological treatments and (2) patient values and preferences regarding particular treatments — and authorized APA staff to compile additional information from the literature on these topics.

### The evidence missing from evidence-based practice [^114gYRHt]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

Comments on the report by the APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice entitled Evidence-based practice in psychology. Regrettably, the task force report was largely silent on three critical issues. As a consequence, it omitted much of the evidence necessary for a complete picture of evidence-based practice. First, the task force report did not operationalize "evidence". Second, the task force report did not address the crucial problem of iatrogenic treatments. Third, the task force report said little about the necessity for ongoing objective evaluation of clinical cases, which is critical to ethically responsible services. Current debate centers on how research findings should be factored into interventions, not on whether it is necessary to do so. Rather than waiting for the resolution of competing views on the matter, psychologists bear an ethical obligation to offer evidence-informed services. Three critical steps that were largely neglected by the task force report can go far toward helping psychologists honor that commitment: (a) providing a clearer operationalization of scientific evidence, (b) using current research to rule out the use of potentially harmful methods, and (c) using objective criteria to evaluate all of their cases on an ongoing basis. These steps, in turn, clarify the menu of options available to therapists, help protect clients from harm, and offer the advantage of allowing clinicians to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about what does and does not work in psychotherapy.

### Multimorbidity and evidence generation [^115xK4WW]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Most people with a chronic disease actually have more than one, a condition known as multimorbidity. Despite this, the evidence base to prevent adverse disease outcomes has taken a disease-specific approach. Drawing on a conference, Improving Guidelines for Multimorbid Patients, the goal of this paper is to identify challenges to the generation of evidence to support the care of people with multimorbidity and to make recommendations for improvement. We identified three broad categories of challenges: 1) challenges to defining and measuring multimorbidity; 2) challenges related to the effects of multimorbidity on study design, implementation and analysis; and 3) challenges inherent in studying heterogeneity of treatment effects in patients with differing comorbid conditions. We propose a set of recommendations for consideration by investigators and others (reviewers, editors, funding agencies, policymaking organizations) involved in the creation of evidence for this common type of person that address each of these challenges. The recommendations reflect a general approach that emphasizes broader inclusion (recruitment and retention) of patients with multimorbidity, coupled with more rigorous efforts to measure comorbidity and comorbidity burden and the influence of multimorbidity on outcomes and the effects of therapy. More rigorous examination of heterogeneity of treatment effects requires careful attention to prioritizing the most important comorbid-related questions, and also requires studies that provide greater statistical power than conventional trials have provided. Relatively modest changes in the orientation of current research along these lines can be helpful in pointing to and partially addressing selected knowledge gaps. However, producing a robust evidence base to support patient-centered decision making in complex individuals with multimorbidity, exposed to many different combinations of potentially interacting factors that can modify the risks and benefits of therapies, is likely to require a clinical research enterprise fundamentally restructured to be more fully integrated with routine clinical practice.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Moving toward evidence-based practice [^112As73s]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

"Evidence-based practice" involves applying the best available evidence to the care of individuals. Explicit, systematic methods have developed for determining what is the best available evidence. However, often even the highest-level evidence is not thoroughly or effectively used in practice, even if it is widely known. We must rigorously and critically analyze study results to understand their strengths, limitations, and generalizability, and bear in mind that our knowledge will evolve and thereby change our practice. The clinical question is not always how to apply the evidence but whether the available evidence applies to a particular patient. We should always ask whether the right provider is doing the right thing for the right patient at the right time in the right setting with the right resources.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115vHgct]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guideline for the Treatment of Depression — recommendation framework and key definitions across children and adolescents, the general adult population, and older adults are described as follows: No treatment is defined as "No active treatment was provided (i.e., waitlist)". Efficacy is "The impact of an intervention compared to an inactive control", and comparative effectiveness "compares at least two different active treatments to each other to assess for the benefits of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination)". Recommendations pertaining to efficacy "do not imply that these treatments are superior to other active treatments". Decision-making criteria were that the panel "recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions or for which there was evidence of equivalency or superiority to other treatments", "conditionally recommended treatments that were consistently superior to nonactive control conditions" when either "Other active treatments… were superior", there was "Insufficient evidence that the treatment was equivalent to other effective treatments", or there were "Greater harms/burdens than with other treatments", and the panel "did not recommend treatments or recommended against treatments if there was insufficient evidence of efficacy or if the harms were considered to outweigh any benefits". The ultimate decision "should be based on shared decision-making with the patient" and, for youth, "the parents/guardians or family members actively involved in their care".

### Using natural experimental studies to guide public health action: turning the evidence-based medicine paradigm on its head [^117FPWuK]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We are more likely to halt the rise in the global prevalence of non-communicable diseases by taking and evaluating new, more ambitious or radical actions to address the underlying causes than by merely applying existing preventive approaches — even if these are effective — with greater intensity. Even apparently simple questions about effectiveness in this arena cannot be answered without action — although based on the best available evidence at the time — that necessarily precedes evaluation. The practice-based evidence pathway can be regarded as an essential, and currently under-resourced and undervalued, complement to the more established evidence-based practice pathway. It is neither inferior nor merely the best available when all else fails. On the contrary, it is often the only way to generate meaningful evidence to address critical questions about investing in population health interventions.

The two pathways for generating evidence described in this paper do not represent mutually exclusive approaches. Some policy and practice innovations could and should be evaluated in RCTs, and many more would benefit from more planned evaluation using a wider range of study designs. Nevertheless, the public health research community and those who fund and publish their work have key roles to play in supporting the development and credibility of researchers in this field, and the more thoughtful conduct, appraisal and synthesis of natural experimental studies, to populate critical missing pieces of the evidence base to support more effective public health action.

What is already known on this subject

There are well-established associations between behaviour and chronic disease, which justify government efforts to reduce behavioural risk factors. However, the question of how population behaviour patterns might most effectively be shifted remains one of the greatest uncertainties for research and policy. This reflects the substantial challenges of evaluating population preventive strategies, interpreting the findings and translating them into action. Greater effort and investment in this area may help ensure that research more effectively supports public health action.

What this study adds

We discuss the growing importance of evaluating natural experiments and their distinctive contribution to the evidence for public health policy. We contrast the established evidence-based practice pathway, in which randomised controlled trials generate 'definitive' evidence for particular interventions, with a practice-based evidence pathway in which evaluation can help adjust the compass bearing of existing policy. We propose that intervention studies should focus on reducing critical uncertainties, that non-randomised study designs should be embraced rather than tolerated and that a more nuanced approach to appraising the utility of diverse types of evidence is required.

### Personalized evidence based medicine: predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects [^113VghbY]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The use of evidence from clinical trials to support decisions for individual patients is a form of "reference class forecasting": implicit predictions for an individual are made on the basis of outcomes in a reference class of "similar" patients treated with alternative therapies. Evidence based medicine has generally emphasized the broad reference class of patients qualifying for a trial. Yet patients in a trial (and in clinical practice) differ from one another in many ways that can affect the outcome of interest and the potential for benefit. The central goal of personalized medicine, in its various forms, is to narrow the reference class to yield more patient specific effect estimates to support more individualized clinical decision making. This article will review fundamental conceptual problems with the prediction of outcome risk and heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), as well as the limitations of conventional (one-variable-at-a-time) subgroup analysis. It will also discuss several regression based approaches to "predictive" heterogeneity of treatment effect analysis, including analyses based on "risk modeling" (such as stratifying trial populations by their risk of the primary outcome or their risk of serious treatment-related harms) and analysis based on "effect modeling" (which incorporates modifiers of relative effect). It will illustrate these approaches with clinical examples and discuss their respective strengths and vulnerabilities.

### From evidence based medicine to medicine based evidence [^1168KHJM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine, using randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses as the major tools and sources of evidence about average results for heterogeneous groups of patients, developed as a reaction against poorly designed observational treatment research and physician reliance on personal experience with other patients as a guide to decision-making about a patient at hand. However, these tools do not answer the clinician's question: "Will a given therapeutic regimen help my patient at a given point in her/his clinical course?" We introduce fine-grained profiling of the patient at hand, accompanied by comparative evidence of responses from approximate matches to this patient on whom a contemplated treatment has/has not been administered. This represents medicine based evidence that is tuned to decision-making for the particular patient.

### Where is the evidence for "Evidence-based" therapy? [^11199aVs]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The term evidence-based therapy is a de facto code word for manualized therapy, most often brief cognitive behavior therapy and its variants. It is widely asserted that "evidence-based" therapy is scientifically proven, superior to other forms of psychotherapy, and the gold standard of care. Research findings do not support such assertions. Research on evidence-based therapies demonstrates that they are weak treatments. They have not shown superiority to other forms of psychotherapy, few patients get well, and treatment benefits do not last. Questionable research practices create a distorted picture of the actual benefits of these therapies.

### Tackling benzodiazepine misuse [^116H9FZP]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

De-prescribing and withdrawal

Professional guidelines recommend treatment withdrawal for most patients on long term benzodiazepines. This usually takes 3 to12 months or longer, often supported by switching to diazepam, a benzodiazepine whose long half life and availability in various strengths allows gradual dose reduction. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effective interventions to support withdrawal, and a recent review failed to identify evidence of sufficient quality to support any pharmacological interventions. Psychosocial interventions may be more promising: cognitive behavioural therapy plus tapering is effective in the short term, and relaxation techniques and individualised GP letters to patients can facilitate withdrawal. However, better evidence is urgently required for both drug and non-drug options.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^114xtQtx]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & Treatment of Low Back Pain — levels of evidence and grades of recommendation are standardized. NASS has adopted standardized levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, and the levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus). Grades of Recommendation are defined as follows: A: Good evidence (Level I studies with consistent findings) for or against recommending intervention; B: Fair evidence (Level II or III studies with consistent findings) for or against recommending intervention; C: Poor quality evidence (Level IV or V studies) for or against recommending intervention; and I: Insufficient or conflicting evidence not to recommend for or against intervention. Guideline recommendations are written utilizing a standard language that indicates the strength of the recommendation, where "A" recommendations indicate a test or intervention is "recommended"; "B" recommendations "suggest" a test or intervention; "C" recommendations indicate a test or intervention "may be considered" or "is an option"; and "I" or "Insufficient Evidence" statements clearly state that "there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against" a test or intervention, with consensus statements stating that "in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the work group's opinion that" a test or intervention may be appropriate. Levels of evidence have very specific criteria and are assigned to studies prior to developing recommendations, and recommendations are then graded based upon the level of evidence.

### Use of acupuncture for adult health conditions, 2013 to 2021: a systematic review [^115DNQKA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the certainty or quality of evidence in recent systematic reviews for use of acupuncture in adult health conditions?

Findings

This systematic review identified 434 systematic reviews published since 2013; of these, 127 assessed the certainty or quality of evidence of their conclusions. Overall, 82 systematic reviews regarding 56 health conditions were mapped, and most reviews concluded the certainty of evidence was low or very low.

Meaning

Despite acupuncture having been the subject of hundreds of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews for dozens of adult health conditions, there were few conclusions that had greater than low certainty of evidence.

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^111RkeC1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

In the educational field, it is time we extended the evidence base for integrated curriculums that promote reflection and case discussion alongside the application of evidence. Discussions on how to interpret and apply evidence to real cases, and the sharing of collective knowledge and expertise in the form of "mindlines" among cliniciansor within illness communitiesmay provide useful data sources for such studies. It is by studying these more sophisticated forms of knowing that we are likely to determine how best to produce expert clinicians and expert patients, and to prevent the harms that arise from overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and overscreening.

In relation to effectiveness, we need greater attention to postmarketing research in day to day hospital and primary care settings to confirm that subsequent experience replicates the results of licensing trials. This will allow gold standard tests and their cut-off points for ruling out diagnoses and treatments to be revised to minimise overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis.

Finally, in relation to the collective effort to prevent the misappropriation of the evidence based quality mark, a key research priority remains the study of hidden biases in sponsored research — for example, by refining the statistical techniques for challenging findings that appear too good to be true.

### The effectiveness of enhanced evidence-based care for depressive disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HkV48]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based care is the use of the best available evidence together with clinical judgement, as well as patient preferences, to make healthcare decisions. Over the past 50 years, several psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of depressive disorders. Yet remission rates remain low, with only about one-in-three individuals achieving remission in acute treatment trials. In fact, Pence and colleagues estimate that only about 6% of individuals with depression in primary care achieve remission. Clearly, efforts are needed to improve outcomes for depression treatment.

Several care models have been developed to improve treatment for depression, all of which provide "enhanced" evidence-based care (EEC). The essential component of all of these approaches is Measurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC in psychiatry is defined as the use of validated clinical measurement instruments to objectify the assessment, treatment, and clinical outcomes, including efficacy, safety, tolerability, functioning, and quality of life, in patients with psychiatric disorders. The concept of MBC was derived from the stepwise treatment algorithm by Trivedi et al.

Rigorous assessment and treatment algorithms of MBC are regarded as key instruments to optimize treatment delivery and outcomes for MDD. These explicit treatment protocols aim at a predefined treatment goal (e.g. remission or response). Treatment algorithms provide strategies (which treatments to use), tactics (how to implement the treatments), treatment steps (in what order to implement the different treatments), standardized evaluation instruments, critical decision points and standardized medical decisions based on preset "if-then-rules". Simply put, MBC is "the routine measurement of symptoms and side effects at each treatment visit and the use of a treatment manual describing when and how to modify medication doses based on these measures". MBC uses patient-reported rating scales in conjunction with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to provide an objective assessment of patient progress over time to guide a more effective plan of care.

### Translation of clinical trials into clinical practice [^1142TPu6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The results of well-conducted clinical trials should be translated into practice but there is good evidence that this is not happening. There are a number of reasons for this - ignorance of doctors and patients, uncertainty as to the applicability of trials to individual patients, indolence and inefficiency on the part of practitioners, and financial considerations. More attention needs to be paid to correct all these factors.

Purpose of guidelines

As pathophysiology of disease and therapy effectiveness, particularly in specific scenarios, is better understood, physicians may struggle to keep up with the latest evidence. Treatment guidelines are designed with several goals in mind: to educate providers, particularly in a changing therapeutic landscape; to describe 'best care' through processing of the best available scientific evidence and broad consensus and to simultaneously point out where there is little information to guide treatment decisions; to reduce inappropriate variation in care and set standards for quality control; to promote efficient use of resources; and to highlight the research that needs to be done to inform future care.

### The concept of difficult-to-treat disease in rheumatology: where next? [^115F2bGJ]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

New pathogenesis-based therapeutics and evidence-based consensus treatment recommendations, often with predefined treatment goals, have remarkably improved outcomes across many chronic diseases. However, a clinically significant subgroup of patients responds poorly to interventions and show a progressive decline in the disease trajectory, which poses an increasing health-care challenge. Difficult-to-treat approaches exist in several areas of medicine and the need for similar definitions has recently also emerged in rheumatology. The term difficult-to-treat refers not only to patients with pathology-driven, treatment-refractory disease, but also implicates multiple other factors that can contribute to patients being in this state, including having few treatment options, misdiagnosis, and coincident psychosocial factors. Therefore, the difficult-to-treat state requires a comprehensive, holistic, multidisciplinary approach that considers the specific characteristics of each disease and the personalised needs of the patient. In this Personal View, we provide an overview of the different aspects of the concept of difficult-to-treat disease, highlight its advantages, and propose the importance of incorporating this concept more widely in the design of rheumatological treatment strategies.

Greece — Instructions for treating schizophrenia in Greece (Ministry of Health, 2015) offers a detailed overview of various non-pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia. It contains information on when, where, and how it is best to deliver different interventions.

Moldova — Schizophrenia first episode psychotic: National clinical protocol (Ministry of Health, 2016) contains several tables with recommendations on specific effects and how to deliver different non-pharmacological interventions, with no indications whether the recommendations are evidence-based.

Montenegro — National guidelines of good clinical practice in treating schizophrenia (Ministry of Health, 2013) provides short descriptions of non-pharmacological interventions and the strength of evidence for their effectiveness based on the results of studies conducted in international settings.

North Macedonia — Instructions for practicing evidence-based medicine within the treatment of schizophrenia (Ministry of Health, 2013) includes a list with several non-pharmacological interventions. Information provided is very scarce. This guideline refers to the degree to which each recommended intervention is supported by research evidence.

Serbia — National guidelines of good clinical practice in treating schizophrenia (Ministry of Health Working Group 2013) were gathered to create and implement good clinical practice guidelines. The benefits of the recommended interventions were listed and supported by scientific references. Furthermore, the context of their delivery was explained.

Table 2 shows Kosovo (UN Resolution) and Romania, two countries without published treatment guidelines. Slovenia has published treatment guidelines for schizophrenia however they do not recommend non-pharmacological interventions. However, a handbook Where and how to get help for mental illness? provides a list of the recommended interventions coupled with their positive effects on mental health. In Romania, a handbook of Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (2012) was written by Ienciu, Romosan, and Lazarescu. The handbook cites various scientific sources when highlighting the importance of psychosocial rehabilitation techniques and methods in schizophrenia. It offers an overview of several interventions with detailed descriptions of their principles and usefulness.

### Understanding evidence-based medicine: a primer [^112EcNtE]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Evidenced-based medicine is the concept of formalizing the scientific approach to the practice of medicine for identification of "evidence" to support our clinical decisions. It requires an understanding of critical appraisal and the basic epidemiologic principles of study design, point estimates, relative risk, odds ratios, confidence intervals, bias, and confounding. By using this information, clinicians can categorize evidence, assess causality, and make evidence-based recommendations. Evidence-based medicine allows analysis of complicated material so that we can make the best possible clinical decisions for the populations we serve.

### The state of implementation science in major depressive disorder: a narrative review [^1146cws5]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders with high recurrence rate. There is often a gap between scientific evidence related to the effective and cost-effective treatment of depression and clinical practice. Implementation science is a field of inquiry that aims to advance the process of applying evidence-based interventions to real-world problems. Implementation research consists of two broad phases. The first phase seeks to identify the gaps that exist between evidence and practice and their impact on outcomes. The second phase, building on the first, evaluates the effectiveness of implementation strategies by examining various implementation indicators to support the adoption and scale up of interventions. Although implementation research can facilitate the uptake and adoption of evidence-based interventions, it is underused in depression research. In this narrative review, the authors will introduce the definition of implementation science and the state of implementation science in MDD in order to support more widespread use of implementation science for scaling up evidence-based interventions.

### Methods for evidence synthesis in interventional pain management [^112PHtQe]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Healthcare decisions are increasingly being made on research-based evidence, rather than on expert opinion or clinical experience alone. Consequently, the process by which the strength of scientific evidence is evaluated and developed by means of evidence-based medicine recommendations and guidelines has become crucial resulting in the past decade in unprecedented interest in evidence-based medicine and clinical practice guidelines. Systematic reviews, also known as evidence-based technology assessments, attempt to minimize bias by the comprehensiveness and reproducibility of the search for and selection of articles for review. Evidence-based medicine is defined as the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Thus, the practice of evidence-based medicine requires the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available external evidence from systematic research. To arrive at evidence-based medicine decisions all valid and relevant evidence should be considered alongside randomized controlled trials, patient preferences and resources. However, many systematic reviews in interventional pain management fail to follow evidence-based medicine principles. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that assist clinicians, consumers and policy makers to make appropriate healthcare decisions. The complex processes of guideline development depend on integration of a number of activities, from collection and processing of scientific literature to evaluation of the evidence, development of evidence-based recommendations or guidelines and implementation and dissemination of the guidelines to relevant professionals and consumers. Guidelines are being designed to improve the quality of healthcare and decrease the use of unnecessary, ineffective or harmful interventions. This review describes various aspects of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews in interventional pain management, evaluation of the strength of scientific evidence, differences between systematic and narrative reviews, rating the quality of individual articles, grading the strength of the body of evidence and appropriate methods for searching for the evidence.

### Trustworthy evidence-based versus untrustworthy guidelines: detecting the difference [^113MKVkR]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In making decisions, patients and clinicians must trade off the benefits against the downsides of alternative strategies. Formal guidelines are essential tools in healthcare decision-making which, when optimally developed, provide health professionals with trustworthy evidence-based recommendations to guide their practice when confronting such trade-offs.

In producing trustworthy guidelines, developers must consider, in addition to the best estimates of effect size for both harms and benefits, their confidence in these estimates (the certainty or quality of the evidence). Trustworthy guidelines should, therefore, inform clinicians not only on the direction (against or in favour) and strength (strong or weak/conditional) of recommendations but also on the certainty of underlying evidence. To obtain the best estimates of intervention benefits, harms and burdens and assess the credibility of the evidence, guidelines require rigorously conducted systematic reviews.

Once guideline panels have such reviews available, they must interpret results, which requires both clinical and methodological expertise, and consider patients' values and preferences. When panels have conducted the process optimally, healthcare professionals can confidently consider recommendations to help make decisions in complex clinical circumstances, evaluate different treatment options and through shared decision-making facilitate patients' choice of clinical management.

This usefulness of guidelines presupposes that they have been rigorously developed and, thus, meet standards of trustworthiness. Historically, very few if any guidelines adhered to these standards; we sometimes refer to this traditional approach as GOBSAT — good old boys sitting around a table. Many guidelines still fail to adhere to trustworthiness standards, still looking more like GOBSAT.

It is, therefore, essential that healthcare professionals — and, for system-level guidelines, policymakers — are able to distinguish guidelines that are trustworthy from those that are not. The aim of this paper is to inform clinicians and policymakers on how to determine guideline trustworthiness. To do so, we offer eight domains (see table 1) in which a lack of rigour can compromise guideline trustworthiness.

### Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations [^113dGx3U]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Users of clinical practice guidelines and other recommendations need to know how much confidence they can place in the recommendations. Systematic and explicit methods of making judgments can reduce errors and improve communication. We have developed a system for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations that can be applied across a wide range of interventions and contexts. In this article we present a summary of our approach from the perspective of a guideline user. Judgments about the strength of a recommendation require consideration of the balance between benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence, translation of the evidence into specific circumstances, and the certainty of the baseline risk. It is also important to consider costs (resource utilisation) before making a recommendation. Inconsistencies among systems for grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations reduce their potential to facilitate critical appraisal and improve communication of these judgments. Our system for guiding these complex judgments balances the need for simplicity with the need for full and transparent consideration of all important issues.

### The relationship between evidence and guidelines [^116gEoAC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This reflection aims to soothe some frustrations, to cool current debates, and to encourage an understanding whereby the relationship between evidence and guidelines can be more productive in future. The relationship of evidence to guidelines, an important link between research and application, is not as simple and unidirectional as is often imagined. The recent emphasis on evidence of high quality and aggregation of evidence is appropriate but can be modified and extended. There are other important elements in guidelines besides the available evidence (which is centered on efficacy and effectiveness). Available evidence may be poor, or not be the most relevant to the decision at hand. To offset the limitations to which this predicament leads, effort is also appropriate to develop more rigorous principles for interpretation and evaluation of evidence, so as to make better use of what is available. The processes for generating guidelines from evidence emphasize reliability, generalizability of a limited kind, and freedom from bias to be achieved via systematic review. If the inclusion criterion for studies is too stringent, there may be little to say from evidence alone, or the evidence that remains may suffer limitations of relevance due to context, or it may be misapplied, simply because it has been endorsed as to quality. Knowledge-based medicine (KBM) would acknowledge a greater role for the scientific principles underlying particular pieces of evidence and deploy a fuller understanding of the health-care context. It should thus make guidelines more professionally accepted and useful in the future.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The evidence for efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, not surprisingly, most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs), but these RCTs provide little direction for the clinician as to what next steps might be optimal in non‐ or partial‐responders and in those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Given this and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we thought it appropriate to begin a discussion of the quality of the data that some experts in the field might consider using in choosing and sequencing drugs and their combination. We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer very different sequences, but thought the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, might start discussions of other options in the literature, and, at the same time, provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much‐needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice. Given the very wide range of the quality of the data and clinical principles on which the current suggestions are based, only minimal references are included and a comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option would be outside the scope of this manuscript.

### Psychosocial treatments targeting anxiety and depression in adolescents and adults on the autism spectrum: review of the latest research and recommended future directions [^116P1mpj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This synthesis of treatment research related to anxiety and depression in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on the scientific support for various forms of psychosocial interventions, useful adaptations to standard interventions, and engagement of candidate therapeutic mechanisms.

Recent Findings

There is considerable evidence for the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat co-occurring problems with anxiety, but there has been relatively little research on treatment of co-occurring depression. Multiple mechanisms of treatment effect have been proposed, but there has been little demonstration of target engagement via experimental therapeutics. Comorbidity between ASD and anxiety and/or mood problems is common. Although there is evidence for the use of CBT for anxiety, little work has addressed how to effectively treat depression. There is emerging support for alternative treatment approaches, such as mindfulness-based interventions. We encourage rigorous, collaborative approaches to identify and manipulate putative mechanisms of change.

### Evidence in practice [^115ZZVhf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

A clinical scenario is used to illustrate how the principles outlined in the previous articles in the series could be applied to help improve patient care. A practical demonstration of the art of formulating answerable clinical questions, finding evidence, critically appraising evidence, and putting evidence into practice is provided. The importance of integrating evidence with patient's preferences, and taking account of issues such as availability of interventions, costs, and so on is discussed. Finally, some of the issues involved in the development of evidence based policies within clinical teams are outlined.

### Other approaches to treatment… [^114fMuED]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

19 In the absence of relevant risk factors, AED therapy is not indicated after a first unprovoked childhood seizure. Such treatment is reasonable, however, in children with relevant risk factors if the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure are thought to outweigh the risks of an adverse effect.
19. Surgical Intervention Up to 30% of patients with epilepsy can have medically refractory epilepsy. These patients have continued seizures despite appropriate AED therapy. 30 Surgical resection of the seizure focus in appropriately selected patients often results in decreased frequency or elimination of seizures with improvement in quality of life. Seizure freedom is achieved in up to 76% of patients after resection.
31. Other Approaches to Treatment Nonpharmacologic approaches may be useful adjuncts in patents with difficult-to-control seizures or who find medication difficult to tolerate. They require a team-based approach for implementation.

13, 33, 34 Vagus nerve stimulation may increase seizure-free time in patients with medically refractory epilepsy who are not candidates for surgery or in whom surgery has been ineffective. It is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use in persons older than 12 years. In this procedure, a battery-powered vagus nerve stimulator is implanted with the leads around the left vagus nerve and attached to a programmable pacemaker. The exact mechanism of action is unclear but likely due to vagal afferent activity that suppresses the electrical circuits in the brain that lead to seizures. 13, 35–38 Responsive neurostimulation is another approach to treating medically refractory partial-onset seizures. This recently approved system is different from the vagus nerve stimulator in that the leads are implanted directly into the seizure-onset zone, which may be cortical or subcortical.

In response to abnormal electrical activity, the neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulation to the target seizure-onset zone. Adverse effects include implant site pain, implant site infection, headache, and dysesthesia. 39, 40. Data Sources: PubMed was searched using the MeSH function and the key phrase epilepsy treatment. Meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and reviews were included. Also searched were Essential Evidence Plus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force website, and recommendations from the International League Against Epilepsy and the American Academy of Neurology. Search dates: December 15, 2015, to November 1, 2016.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^1122LxzK]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Treatment recommendations terminology and tier wording — Intervention Names are based on how they appeared in the systematic reviews, and the Panel notes that the classification of interventions varied across systematic reviews. Treatment as usual (TAU) refers to the care customarily provided in a particular context, with TAU inconsistently defined across studies and comparisons with TAU lacking precision. No treatment means that no active treatment was provided (e.g., waitlist). Efficacy is defined as the benefit (or lack thereof) of an intervention compared to an inactive control, while comparative effectiveness is defined as comparing at least two different active treatments to each other to assess the benefits (or lack thereof) of one (or combination) versus the other (or combination). First-line recommendations are supported by the most high-quality evidence and are worded as "recommend (Strength/Direction: Strong For)" or "recommend against (Strength/Direction: Strong Against)". Second-line recommendations are based on less or weaker evidence and are worded as "suggests (Strength/Direction: Conditional For)" or "suggests against (Strength/Direction: Conditional Against)". When there is "insufficient evidence" or "no difference in effect", interventions are listed as other treatments reviewed to inform guideline users and were considered by the Panel even though the evidence was not yet sufficient to justify a recommendation.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^111uRugq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitation of the literature

A wide variety of topical estrogen administration forms and different dosages were used in the reported studies. Furthermore, heterogeneous control groups were used, and LET was compared with placebo or no treatment or non-hormonal treatment. There were a few RCTs, but they were not adequately powered. Therefore, most of the results have to be interpreted with caution.

Summary and recommendations

Most of the recommendations are evidence level 2C, meaning a low quality of evidence, and there is still a need for additional robust evidence.
LET seems to be safe and beneficial in the treatment of VVS compared with placebo.
LET improves lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency and UI in postmenopausal women.
LET improves the vaginal environment and reduces UTIs at the time of prolapse surgery.
Little evidence exists to support the effect of LET on the quality of surgical repair, prolapse recurrence, etc.
Postmenopausal women on systemic hormonal treatment should be counseled regarding the increased risk of worsening of urinary incontinence symptoms or development of de novo incontinence and possibly fecal incontinence.

Still unclear:
Evidence is too sparse to give any recommendations regarding the effectiveness of LET in the treatment or prevention for POP.
No evidence and recommendations exist regarding the duration, optimal dosage, long-term effect and cost-effectiveness of estrogen treatment.

### Using natural experimental studies to guide public health action: turning the evidence-based medicine paradigm on its head [^111k4gbQ]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Public health research is concerned with 'generating discoveries and new knowledge within the public health field itself'. This implies an opportunity and need to complement the evidence-based practice pathway, described above, with innovative solutions — generated in and for the real world by policymakers and practitioners — that can also be rigorously evaluated to produce 'practice-based evidence' (as shown in the lower pathway of figure 1). In this latter pathway, the purpose of evaluation can be seen as more akin to adjusting the compass bearing followed by existing policy rather than enabling a binary decision to proceed or not with the widespread implementation of a particular intervention. Whereas the former pathway depends on multiple instances of evidence of effectiveness to justify action, the latter depends more on multiple instances of action from which to develop at least preliminary evidence of effectiveness. This may in turn support taking further evaluable action and the consequent, cumulative reduction of uncertainty about its effects.

### Child and adolescent psychosocial support programs following natural disasters-a scoping review of emerging evidence [^111GwDqP]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Level 3 interventions are high-intensity, evidence-based psychological therapies aimed at treating diagnosed posttraumatic mental health disorders and must be delivered by specialist mental health professionals. Interventions with the strongest evidence base are Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapies and can be transdiagnostic in nature or targeting a specific disorder.

While the stepped care approach is widely endorsed by trauma specialists and treatment guidelines internationally, the evidence supporting its effectiveness has been slow to develop, particularly regarding level 1 and 2 and child-focussed interventions. However, recent meta-reviews have identified a range of post-disaster psychological and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents that demonstrate those receiving interventions fared better than those in control or waitlist groups. The strongest evidence available was for eye movement desensitization therapy (EMDR), Exposure and Strict Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in level 3 interventions. While pre-post studies present evidence of stronger effects when programs were delivered by qualified professionals, and when delivered to individuals rather than groups, these differences in effect sizes were lower or absent in the controlled studies. A meta-review of level 1, school-based programs delivered post disaster and published between 2000 and 2015 showed that "school-based, universal programmes that are conducted by teachers or local paraprofessionals are effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents" (p. 161). This finding of the effectiveness of school-based programs is also supported by a previous meta-analysis of school-based (level 3) treatment programs targeted at reducing symptoms of PTSD arising from exposure to various forms of trauma including disaster. All the reviews used measures of psychological distress or PTSD as the outcome measure regardless of whether the intervention was universal (level 1), targeted (level 2) or treatment (level 3). Arguably, measures of PTSD symptoms or any other diagnosable mental health disorder are not appropriate for a level 1 intervention given those interventions do not target specific disorders. Even if used as a screening tool, students with sub-clinical symptoms should be directed to a level 2 intervention and those with more severe symptoms to a level 3 intervention. A common recommendation was to conduct further studies with larger samples. Brown and colleagues suggested that the evidence supported a stepped care approach that provides individual treatments for those with high need and a small number of group treatment sessions for those with lesser needs.

### Managing treatment-resistant major depression [^111Ut3ER]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A sizable proportion of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression experience only partial or no clinical response to antidepressant treatment. Switching, augmenting, and combining various pharmaceutical agents can be effective strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression. The empirical evidence supporting these approaches is inconsistent, however, and there is a paucity of controlled studies to support their efficacy. Additionally, it has been difficult to demonstrate the advantages of these strategies over increasing the dose or duration of the initial drug treatment. This article will review available evidence and clinical considerations regarding switching, augmenting, and combining various agents in the treatment of patients suffering from nonpsychotic unipolar depression who have failed adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. More research is needed that controls for continued time on the initial agent, that compares different strategies, and that determines which patients are the best candidates for which treatment.

### Improving the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^111eaMRU]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based treatments for ADHD - an Overview

Multiple groups, committees, and professional organizations have provided the field with recommendations for evidence-based treatment approaches for ADHD. There is clear consensus across these recommendations that pharmacological treatments, notably stimulant medication, psychosocial treatments, and a combination of these two approaches have the strongest evidence base. Table 1 provides a brief overview of the major conclusions of each guideline for the treatment of ADHD in children. It is clearly recommended that families should receive psychoeducation regarding ADHD, and that the evidence-based psychosocial treatments are behavioral parent training (BPT), behavioral interventions in classroom and peer settings, and organizational skills training.

Table 1
Review of practice parameters and treatment guidelines for ADHD.

ADHD attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, FDA food and Drug Administration, PTBM parent training behavior management.

There are inconsistencies among the guidelines that make broad statements of consensus difficult. For instance, there are differences in precision in recommendations for psychosocial treatments, with some very broad in scope compared to others with more precise recommendations regarding particular treatment types (e.g. BPT) and particular populations (e.g. children under six;). Broad suggestions of seeking "psychological" or "educational" treatment is unhelpful in some guidelines and practice parameters, as there are many approaches that fall under this category and some are clearly efficacious whereas other approaches commonly deployed do not have evidence of efficacy for ADHD. There are also differences in the strength of recommendations, with more contemporary guidelines emphasizing multimodal treatments more so than older guidelines. However, perhaps most notably, there is not clear consensus among the recommendations on the best sequence or combination of treatments for ADHD, even though this is a key question for most families pursuing treatment for ADHD. It is also important to note that most guidelines focus on proximal ADHD treatment – as ADHD is now conceptualized as a life-course persistent disorder, treatment efforts will need to be protracted across time and appropriate for evolving developmental levels.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116iVbuu]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Defining efficacy and comparative effectiveness — comparators and control groups: In this guideline, efficacy refers to the impact of a treatment compared with an inactive control (i.e., waitlist), while comparative effectiveness refers to the benefit of one active treatment compared with another. Across reviews, comparison groups varied, but broadly included both active and nonactive controls; examples include treatment as usual as an active control and waitlist and no treatment as nonactive controls.

### Network meta-analysis explained [^111m1d7d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
An example of a network of three treatments compared in two trials (solid black lines), where an indirect comparison can be made (dashed grey line). MD, mean difference.

Suppose now that we also had evidence from a new study on the same patient population which compared treatment C with B, giving an MD of −1.8 95% CI (−3.66 to 0.06). Traditional hierarchies of evidence state that estimates from direct head-to-head RCTs provide the 'best available' evidence of intervention effects. Should we now discard the indirect evidence? Or perhaps we should prefer the indirect evidence since it suggests a statistically significant effect? To do either is contrary to the principle of using all relevant evidence for decision making. The solution is to use both the direct and indirect evidence to do a mixed (evidence) treatment comparison, or NMA, under the assumption that both the direct and indirect evidence are estimating the same, true, underlying treatment effect of C versus B in our target population. The exact same principles apply when multiple RCTs are available for each of the possible comparisons and for more than three interventions.

NMA relies on the same assumptions underlying pairwise meta-analysis, that is, the included studies are sufficiently homogenous in terms of the condition being studied, the included participants and the definition of active and control interventions. In other words, we are assuming that the effects of B versus A and C versus B that would have been observed if the C versus A RCT had included all three treatments, is the same as that observed in the B versus A RCT (apart from sample variability). This assumption is the basis for coherent decisions whether they involve two or more treatments. One way to empirically check this is to ask: 'given the known study and participant characteristics, if all these studies compared the same two treatments, would it be suitable to combine them in a meta-analysis?' If the answer to this is yes, and the only distinction is that instead the studies compare different sets of interventions, then the assumption of 'sufficient homogeneity' is, in principle, satisfied.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111tirQm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.

### Evidence based medicine: a movement in crisis? [^111JDrd7]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Return to real evidence based medicine

To address the above concerns, we believe it is time to launch a campaign for real evidence based medicine (box 2).

Individualised for the patient

Real evidence based medicine has the care of individual patients as its top priority, asking, "what is the best course of action for this patient, in these circumstances, at this point in their illness or condition?"It consciously and reflexively refuses to let process (doing tests, prescribing medicines) dominate outcomes (the agreed goal of management in an individual case). It engages with an ethical and existential agenda (how should we live? when should we accept death?) and with that goal in mind, carefully distinguishes between whether to investigate, treat, or screen and how to do so.

To support such an approach, evidence must be individualised for the patient. This requires that research findings be expressed in ways that most people will understand (such as the number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and number needed to screen) and that practitioners, together with their patients, are free to make appropriate care decisions that may not match what "best (average) evidence" seems to suggest.

Importantly, real shared decision making is not the same as taking the patient through a series of if-then decision options. Rather, it involves finding out what matters to the patient — what is at stake for them — and making judicious use of professional knowledge and status (to what extent, and in what ways, does this person want to be "empowered"?) and introducing research evidence in a way that informs a dialogue about what best to do, how, and why. This is a simple concept but by no means easy to deliver. Tools that contain quantitative estimates of risk and benefit are needed, but they must be designed to support conversations not climb probability trees.

### What is evidence? [^116PnQwr]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The evidence-based practice movement rests on the premise that the scientific evidence regarding treatment should be used judiciously to inform treatment decisions. This article focuses on the most fundamental question regarding evidence-based practice: What is evidence? To address this question, the authors first review several of the definitions, criteria, and strategies that have been used to define scientific evidence. Second, a number of critical issues that have been raised regarding the nature of treatment evidence are discussed. Finally, suggestions for further consideration in the process of synthesizing evidence for clinicians are offered.

### Cognitive-behavioural therapies and exercise programmes for patients with fibromyalgia: state of the art and future directions [^114nZwBe]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the effects of non-pharmacological treatments for patients with fibromyalgia (FM), including cognitive-behavioural therapy, exercise training programmes, or a combination of the two. After summarising and discussing preliminary evidence of the rationale of non-pharmacological treatment in patients with FM, we reviewed randomised, controlled trials for possible predictors of the success of treatment such as patient and treatment characteristics. In spite of support for their suitability in FM, the effects of non-pharmacological interventions are limited and positive outcomes largely disappear in the long term. However, within the various populations with FM, treatment outcomes showed considerable individual variations. In particular, specific subgroups of patients characterised by relatively high levels of psychological distress seem to benefit most from non-pharmacological interventions. Preliminary evidence of retrospective treatment analyses suggests that the efficacy may be enhanced by offering tailored treatment approaches at an early stage to patients who are at risk of developing chronic physical and psychological impairments.

### Exploring the diverse definitions of' evidence': a scoping review [^113wPhhU]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The term 'evidence' is widely used in today's society. Reviewing The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and The BMJ, it is not difficult to find that the term 'evidence' has been used in scientific research articles since its publication, and the use is gradually increasing in scholarly papers. In addition to researchers, the public also use evidence to make judgements and decisions in their daily life. In Europe and the USA, beginning in the 18th century, and escalating in the 20th century, increasing attention was given to the empirical underpinnings of rational decision-making in medicine, particularly with respect to therapeutics. By the 1990s, this concern was crystallised as an attempt to promote 'evidence-based medicine', explicitly juxtaposed to authority-based ('eminence-based') medicine. At these points, evidence-based medicine was born; evidence-based health sciences and evidence-based social sciences have since gradually emerged with a similar emphasis on 'evidence' as the foundation for scientific discussions and decision-making.

### Neurostimulation for drug-resistant epilepsy: a systematic review of clinical evidence for efficacy, safety, contraindications and predictors for response [^112DdZ5f]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neurostimulation is becoming an increasingly accepted treatment alternative for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who are unsuitable surgery candidates. Standardized guidelines on when or how to use the various neurostimulation modalities are lacking. We conducted a systematic review on the currently available neurostimulation modalities primarily with regard to effectiveness and safety.

Recent Findings

For vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), there is moderate-quality evidence for its effectiveness in adults with drug-resistant partial epilepsies. Moderate-to-low-quality evidence supports the efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) in patients with DRE. There is moderate-to-very low-quality evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is effective or well tolerated. For transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS), there are insufficient data to support the efficacy of any of these modalities for DRE. These treatment modalities, nevertheless, appear well tolerated, with no severe adverse events reported.

Summary

Head-to-head comparison of treatment modalities such as VNS, DBS and RNS across different epileptic syndromes are required to decide which treatment modality is the most effective for a given patient scenario. Such studies are challenging and it is unlikely that data will be available in the near future. Additional data collection on potentially promising noninvasive neurostimulation modalities like tVNS, TMS, TNS and tDCS is warranted to get a more precise estimate of their therapeutic benefit and long-term safety.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should I care? [^1112Xz8Z]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The principles of evidence-based medicine provide the tools to incorporate the best evidence into everyday practice. Evidence-based medicine is the integration of individual clinical expertise with the best available research evidence from systematic research and the patient's values and expectations. A hierarchy of evidence can be used to assess the strength of evidence upon which clinical decisions are made, with randomized studies at the top of the hierarchy. The efficient approach to finding the best evidence is to identify a systematic review or evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Calculated metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, receiver-operating-characteristic curves, and likelihood ratios, can be used to examine the evidence for a diagnostic test. High-level studies of a therapy are prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, have a concealed allocation, have a parallel design, and assess patient-important outcomes. Metrics used to assess the evidence for a therapy include event rate, relative risk, relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, and odds ratio. Although not all tenets of evidence-based medicine are universally accepted, the principles of evidence-based medicine nonetheless provide a valuable approach to respiratory care practice.

### Clinical evidence 2030 [^113fbJFU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

PRINCIPLE 1: PATIENTS ARE AT THE CENTER OF CLINICAL EVIDENCE GENERATION AND GUIDE EVERY STEP

Clinical evidence is generated for patients' needs and public health. Through their engagement, patients provide critical insight into their medical needs and what really matters to them at every level of healthcare decisions. Clinical evidence generation should revolve around these needs. Patients have been increasingly involved in healthcare decisions, including those related to the evaluation of the benefit–risk of medicines by regulators, where patients bring their personal experience, knowledge, and expertise both on the conditions and the available treatment options, and also on the impact of regulatory decisions on their lives.

Efforts are ongoing to guide the generation, collection, and use of patient experience data to support decisions on the development and benefit–risk evaluation of medicines. To further build on these efforts, multi‐stakeholder collaboration in this field is encouraged.

The centerpiece of evidence-based medicine is the randomized controlled trial, a rigorous experiment. We use the study by Roozeboom et al. to illustrate how research guides clinical decisions. We describe levels of evidence, review criteria for assessing a trial regarding noninferiority of a therapy, and discuss challenges for evidence-based medicine in guiding care precisely targeted to an individual patient.

### Extending the reach of evidence-based medicine: a proposed categorization of lower-level evidence [^111SKDBo]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical practice involves making many treatment decisions for which only limited formal evidence exists. While the methodology of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has evolved tremendously, there is a need to better characterize lower-level evidence. This should enhance the ability to appropriately weigh the evidence against other considerations, and counter the temptation to think it is more robust than it actually is. A framework to categorize lower-level evidence is proposed, consisting of nonrandomized comparisons, extrapolation using indirect evidence, rationale, and clinical experience (ie, an accumulated general impression). Subtypes are recognized within these categories, based on the degree of confounding in nonrandomized comparisons, the uncertainty involved in extrapolation from indirect evidence, and the plausibility of a rationale. Categorizing the available evidence in this way can promote a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of using such evidence as the basis for treatment decisions in clinically relevant areas that are devoid of higher-level evidence.

### Network meta-analysis explained [^112hgkeG]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

When more than two interventions are being considered, synthesis of RCTs using an NMA will ensure that all the relevant evidence, whether direct or indirect, is used to produce coherent estimates of the relative effects of every intervention compared with every other. This allows for more efficient use of the relevant evidence, which can increase the precision of the estimates. In addition, because multiple sources of evidence are used, the final estimates are more robust than if only direct sources of evidence were included, that is, they are less likely to be influenced by the inclusion or exclusion of a single trial. The underlying assumption is that there are no participant or study characteristics that would modify the relative treatment effect of each treatment compared with every other.

Relying on multiple pairwise meta-analyses, each including a different set of trials may lead to incoherent decisions and does not make the best use of the available evidence.

It is important to display NMA results carefully to aid interpretation and to clinically and statistically assess the plausibility of the assumptions made.

### Treatment in the pediatric emergency department is evidence based: a retrospective analysis [^112wmixU]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The term "evidence-based medicine" has become a catchphrase for the twenty-first century. Physicians are being called upon to justify their treatment decisions with valid, up-to-date evidence. There have been attempts within many areas of medicine to quantify the evidence that is available to, and used by, the physicians of that discipline. The first such study, conducted by Ellis et al in 1995, found that 82% of treatments in internal medicine were evidence-based. This study has been replicated among a variety of disciplines, including family medicine (81% evidence-based interventions), hematology (70% evidence-based interventions), and surgery (45% interventions based on randomized control trial [RCT] evidence or better).

Within pediatrics, there have been three such studies. Moyer et al examined pediatric inpatients and found that 75% of primary interventions were supported by evidence. Rudolf et al found 40% of clinical actions in a community-based pediatric practice were supported by RCT evidence and 7% were supported by convincing non-experimental evidence. In a study of pediatric surgical patients, Baraldini et al found that only 29% of their treatments were based on level I or II evidence, as defined by Ellis et al (described below).

There is a need to investigate whether and to what extent the treatment of pediatric emergency patients is based on evidence. The wide variety of ailments seen within this area should offer a more comprehensive assessment of the overall state of evidence within pediatrics – encompassing surgical, outpatient and inpatient medicine, across all ages. At the same time, we need to gain an understanding of the quality and quantity of evidence in existence to support pediatric clinical decisions. How often is adult evidence generalized to the treatment of children? This is an important issue given that children differ from adults in terms of their physiology, biology, and developmental processes. There is limited health information available from research in children and, as a result, health care providers repeatedly turn to other sources of evidence, such as adult studies, to assist with managing health care issues in children.

In the present study, we sought to identify the extent to which evidence exists for use within the unique environment of the pediatric emergency department. A secondary objective was to determine the amount of evidence, applied to pediatrics, that is derived from adult studies. We hypothesized, a priori, that this was a common practice within pediatrics. Our hope was to identify areas within the body of evidence for pediatric emergency medicine that require future study.

### Innovative research methods for studying treatments for rare diseases: methodological review [^1144nfK1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Though an individual rare disease is by definition uncommon, according to the statutory definitions set in the United States (prevalence < 200 000 people each year; equating to a prevalence of approximately < 64 per 100 000 people) and European Union (< 50 per 100 000 people), more than 6800 different conditions qualify as rare diseases and 6–8% of the population is affected. This translates to about 60 million people in the United States and EU alone. Rare diseases comprise a heterogeneous set of conditions that afflict various organ systems, have wide ranging prognoses, and even vary along a gradient of rareness.

Many barriers exist to advancing knowledge of and treatment options for rare diseases. The small patient populations can dampen commercial interest in development of treatments. Yet even for those rare conditions where funding is plentiful and manufacturers of therapeutics are engaged, methodological and data constraints limit the ability to generate evidence on patient health outcomes. The most obvious challenge to conducting rigorous research is the small number of eligible participants for a given study. In addition, geographic dispersion of patients, lack of knowledge about the clinical course of disease, and lack of appropriate comparator treatments further hinder the generation of evidence. As a result relatively little is known about the clinical course of many rare diseases and few treatment options exist.

However, there may be pathways for collectively advancing the study of rare diseases. Although rare diseases may present unique clinical problems, the methodological challenges to studying health outcomes are often communal. In recent years, innovative epidemiological and clinical trial methods have been developed that offer promise for promoting more efficient and effective research. Because rare diseases are so clinically dissimilar, clinicians, scientists, and other stakeholders working in one medical specialty may not be familiar with methods being applied in other disciplines. Thus, we conducted a methodological review to catalogue and describe innovative approaches to studying health outcomes in patients with rare diseases. Our goal was to identify innovative approaches to research that have been, or can be, applied to overcome the methodological challenges inherent in the study of rare diseases.

### Invited article: comparative effectiveness research, evidence-based medicine, and the AAN [^114MxTnj]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Comparative effectiveness research (CER) is the study of the relative effects of treatments to determine which will be most likely to improve overall health for a specific condition. This area has received a great deal of political focus, and substantial funding for CER is included in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. The results of CER are intended to inform evidence-based guidelines and to improve the quality and effectiveness of medical care. In the absence of such research, guidelines often depend on consensus to rank available therapies. We believe that an increase in CER would clearly enhance evidence-based guidelines. However, the research must be performed and analyzed with great care to avoid reaching unhelpful, or even harmful, conclusions. Specifically, individual patient characteristics must be taken into account, study endpoints must approximate the most important patient outcomes, therapies must be used optimally within the studies, and the most relevant therapies for a given indication must be included for comparison. CER that is not performed or interpreted correctly could have the potential to affect negatively our choices of therapies. The neurology community must help inform the process of CER to ensure the highest-quality research, which in turn will result in the most valid outcomes.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons / ASSH clinical practice guideline summary management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^115Z1XXE]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome non-operative treatments — comparative effectiveness indicates that Evidence suggests no significant difference in patient reported outcomes between non operative treatment techniques for carpal tunnel syndrome. Quality of Evidence: High, and Strength of Option: Limited (Downgraded). Evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention. Option was downgraded based on EtD framework. When comparing corticosteroid injection versus shockwave therapy, the results were equivocal with one study out of four favoring ESWT, another favoring CSI, and two showing no significant difference between the treatment groups; when comparing ESWT with various treatments, three studies showed a slight benefit in ESWT. As there is limited data with mixed quality of evidence, any particular non-operative treatment cannot be recommended over another non-operative treatment. The above non operative treatments do not show a consistent significant difference from other treatments and add to the time and monetary expense for patients suffering from CTS. None of the non-operative treatments have shown long-term success in the treatment of CTS and therefore, are not considered cost-effective options. Due to lack of supporting evidence, this guideline is anticipated to be accepted by surgeons, patients, and therapists. Readily available and feasible to not use these modalities. No long-term follow up studies are available to confirm the lack of effectiveness of these therapies, however, are likely not necessary, given the lack of short-term benefits.

### Is network meta-analysis as valid as standard pairwise meta-analysis? It all depends on the distribution of effect modifiers [^112sFoZy]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered as the gold standard of whether a health intervention works and/or whether it is better than another. Although often placed at the top of evidence hierarchies, single RCTs rarely provide adequate information for addressing the evidence demands of patients, clinicians and policymakers. Instead, each trial provides a piece of evidence that, when taken together with others, addresses important questions for patients, clinicians, and other healthcare decision-makers. Traditional pairwise meta-analyses of RCTs are increasingly used to synthesize the results of different trials evaluating the same intervention(s) to obtain an overall estimate of the treatment effect of one intervention relative to the control.

In the last decade, network meta-analysis has been introduced as a generalization of pairwise meta-analysis. When the available RCTs of interest do not all compare the same interventions but each trial compares only a subset of the interventions of interest, it is possible to develop a network of RCTs where all trials have at least one intervention in common with another. Such a network allows for indirect comparisons of interventions not studied in a head-to-head fashion. For example, the treatment effects from trials comparing treatments B relative to A (AB trials) and trials comparing treatments C relative to A (AC trials) can be pooled to obtain an indirect estimate for the comparison between treatments B and C. Even when a trial comparing treatments C and B (BC trial) exists, combining the direct estimates with the results of indirect comparisons can result in refined estimates as a broader evidence base is considered. In general, if the available evidence base consists of a network of interlinked multiple RCTs involving treatments compared directly, indirectly, or both, the entire body of evidence can be synthesized by means of network meta-analysis.

Although assumptions underlying standard pairwise meta-analyses of direct comparisons are well understood, those concerning network meta-analysis for both direct and indirect comparisons might be perceived to be more complex, and might be prone to misinterpretation. In this paper, we aim to compare pairwise meta-analysis with network meta-analysis with a specific focus on the primary role of effect modifiers as the common cause of heterogeneity and bias. We discuss effect modification first within individual trials, then in standard pairwise meta-analyses of multiple randomized trials, and finally in network meta-analyses.

### How to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis: a guide for clinicians [^114XC468]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based practice relies on using research evidence to guide clinical decision-making. However, staying current with all published research can be challenging. Many clinicians use review articles that apply predefined methods to locate, identify, and summarize all available evidence on a topic to guide clinical decision-making. This paper discusses the role of review articles, including narrative, scoping, and systematic reviews, to synthesize existing evidence and generate new knowledge. It provides a step-by-step guide to conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis, covering key steps such as formulating a research question, selecting studies, evaluating evidence quality, and reporting results. This paper is intended as a resource for clinicians looking to learn how to conduct systematic reviews and advance evidence-based practice in the field.

### Characteristics of non-randomised studies of drug treatments: cross sectional study [^117St3Me]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials have long been considered the gold standard for assessing the effects of drug treatments. Whether these trials comprehensively describe the scope of real world clinical practice, however, has been questioned. Also, randomised controlled trials might not be feasible for dealing with specific clinical questions, including a particular population, or providing timely evidence.

The prominence of non-randomised studies has risen in recent years, specifically with the increase in real world data. Subsequently, non-randomised studies can provide evidence on broader patient populations, various treatment regimens, long term outcomes, rare events, and harms. These studies can have a role in generating timely and cost effective evidence for comparative effectiveness research, providing insight for decision making on drug treatments in the real world setting. A study summarising the levels of evidence supporting clinical practice guidelines in cardiology found that 40% of 6329 recommendations were supported by level of evidence B (ie, supported by data from observational studies or one randomised controlled trial), with only few recommendations supported by evidence from randomised trials.

Non-randomised studies are susceptible to numerous limitations related to their design and analysis choices, which could result in effect estimates that are biased. Several guidelines have been developed for reporting non-randomised studies, and the target trial emulation framework has been developed to overcome the avoidable methodological pitfalls of traditional causal analysis of observational data, thus reducing the risk of bias. The framework suggests that a non-randomised study should be conceptualised as an attempt to emulate a hypothetical randomised controlled trial addressing a research question of interest, to make causal inference with observational data. This framework requires specifying key components of the target trial, such as time points of eligibility, treatment assignment, and start of follow-up. Failure to align these time points would impose a risk of bias in effect estimates.

The literature highlights particular concerns in non-randomised studies, such as inadequate reporting, and occasionally focuses on specific conditions. But the heterogeneity and limitations in the conduct, analysis, and reporting of non-randomised studies, in a representative sample of reports, has not been well studied. In this study, our aim was to examine the characteristics of comparative non-randomised studies that assessed the effectiveness or safety, or both, of drug treatments. We focused on general characteristics, reporting characteristics, and time point alignment, and possible related biases.

### Rapid reviews methods series: guidance on assessing the certainty of evidence [^117X8a5p]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

This paper is part of a series from the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group providing methodological guidance for rapid reviews (RRs). In recent years, RRs have become a widely used type of knowledge synthesis to support urgent, time-sensitive decisions. An RR is a type of evidence synthesis that brings together and summarises information from different research studies to produce evidence for people such as the public, researchers, policy makers and funders in a systematic, resource-efficient manner.RRs apply modified systematic review methods to accelerate the review process and complete a review rapidly while maintaining systematic, transparent and reproducible methods.

Assessments of the trustworthiness of available evidence and confidence in effect estimates are key components of any evidence synthesis, including RRs. The goal is to provide knowledge users with transparent, well-reasoned judgements about reviewers' confidence in the evidence underpinning the effects of interventions. Researchers have proposed various methods to assess the certainty of a body of evidence. For systematic reviews, Cochrane recommends the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which uses the term certainty of evidence (COE; also known as quality or strength of evidence) to describe the level of confidence that investigators have in the estimates of treatment effects. Internationally, GRADE has become the most widely adopted tool for rating COE because it requires transparent and explicit judgements by reviewers. In addition, the GRADE Working Group provides extensive training resources and GRADEpro, an open-access software tool, which helps author teams apply GRADE in a standardised manner. For these reasons, the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group also recommends using GRADE for rating the COE in RR products.

This paper presents considerations and recommendations on how to accelerate COE rating for RRs of interventions. It elaborates on the brief guidance by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Groupand its updateand provides more detailed recommendations on how rating the confidence in treatment effects can be accelerated when conducting RRs. Because RRs vary in scope and timelines, these recommendations should be viewed as guidance, which can be used when time or other resource constraints do not allow the full implementation of GRADE for COE. Our recommendations pertain primarily to the process of how GRADE is applied and not to the GRADE approach itself.

In the following sections, we start with general considerations on improving efficiency when rating COE for RRs and then list the GRADE processes that should remain unchanged to maintain consistency with the general GRADE approach. We then describe ways to accelerate the application of GRADE and discuss those cases that use existing systematic reviews or network meta-analyses (NMA) to inform GRADE assessments.

### Generating the right evidence at the right time: principles of a new class of flexible augmented clinical trial designs [^116oNeMe]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

To support informed decision making, clear descriptions of the beneficial and harmful effects of a treatment are needed by various stakeholders. The current paradigm is to generate evidence sequentially through different experiments. However, data generated later, perhaps through observational studies, can be difficult to compare with earlier randomized trial data, resulting in confusion in understanding and interpretation of treatment effects. Moreover, the scientific questions these later experiments can serve to answer often remain vague. We propose Flexible Augmented Clinical Trial for Improved eVidence gEneration (FACTIVE), a new class of study designs enabling flexible augmentation of confirmatory randomized controlled trials with concurrent and close-to-real-world elements. Our starting point is to use clearly defined objectives for evidence generation, which are formulated through early discussion with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and are additional to regulatory requirements for authorization of a new treatment. These enabling designs facilitate estimation of certain well-defined treatment effects in the confirmatory part and other complementary treatment effects in a concurrent real-world part. Each stakeholder should use the evidence that is relevant within their own decision-making framework. High quality data are generated under one single protocol and the use of randomization ensures rigorous statistical inference and interpretation within and between the different parts of the experiment. Evidence for the decision making of HTA bodies could be available earlier than is currently the case.

### Principles of evidence based medicine [^113D53Tk]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Health care professionals are increasingly required to base clinical decisions on the best available evidence. Evidence based medicine (EBM) is a systematic approach to clinical problem solving which allows the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. This paper explains the concept of EBM and introduces the five step EBM model: formulation of answerable clinical questions; searching for evidence; critical appraisal; applicability of evidence; evaluation of performance. Subsequent articles will focus on the principles and critical appraisal of randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and provide a practical demonstration of the five step EBM model using a real life clinical scenario.

### Providing information about the effectiveness of treatment options to depressed people in the community: a randomized controlled trial of effects on mental health literacy, help-seeking and symptoms [^113RY1uU]. Psychological Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Many people who are depressed do not receive any professional help and their beliefs about the helpfulness of treatment do not always correspond with those of health professionals. To facilitate choices about treatment, the present study examined the effects of providing depressed people in the community with evidence on whether various treatment options work.

Method

A randomized controlled trial was carried out with 1094 persons selected at random from the community who screened positive for depressive symptoms and agreed to participate. Participants were mailed either an evidence-based consumer guide to treatments for depression or, as a control, a general brochure on depression. Outcomes were the rated usefulness of the information provided, changes in attitudes to depression treatments, actions taken to reduce depression, and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and disability.

Results

Participants rated the evidence-based consumer guide as more useful than the control brochure. Attitudes to some treatments changed. Improvements in symptoms and disability did not differ significantly between interventions.

Conclusion

Providing people who are depressed with evidence on which treatments work produces some changes in attitudes and behaviour. However, this intervention may need to be enhanced if it is to produce symptom change.

### Efficacy of respiratory support therapies during pulmonary rehabilitation exercise training in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1113C9hx]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

While previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have focused on the effects of respiratory support therapies on enhancing exercise capacity, quality of life, and symptoms, traditional pairwise meta-analyses are limited in comparing only two treatments at a time. Therefore, this study utilized network meta-analysis (NMA) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relative efficacy of different respiratory support methods for COPD during pulmonary rehabilitation exercise training. By evaluating multiple interventions, this approach offers high-quality evidence for ranking optimal intervention strategies, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed treatment decisions. The study systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of various respiratory support methods in COPD patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation exercise training through randomized controlled trials. The findings aim to identify the most effective respiratory support methods, offering detailed evidence-based information to guide future clinical practice and improve the nursing care of COPD patients, while also serving as a reference for future research.

### What systematic reviews exist for the effectiveness of orthopaedic interventions [^1163SfpY]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgeons and patients require evidence to make shared decisions regarding best treatments. Evidence-based medicine is defined as the use of the current best evidence from systematic research. Although clinical decisions must rely on myriad types of evidence and consider patient preferences, the traditional hierarchy of evidence indicates that systematic overviews of randomized clinical trials provide the highest forms of evidence. Identifying quality evidence is an essential component of evidence-based implementation. The purpose of this study was to determine the evidence base for orthopaedics, especially the number and topic of systematic overviews on the effectiveness of orthopaedic interventions.

### New horizons in evidence synthesis for older adults [^114NGGwh]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Evidence synthesis, embedded within a systematic review of the literature, is a well-established approach for collating and combining all the relevant information on a particular research question. A robust synthesis can establish the evidence base, which underpins best practice guidance. Such endeavours are frequently used by policymakers and practitioners to inform their decision making. Traditionally, an evidence synthesis of interventions consisted of a meta-analysis of quantitative data comparing two treatment alternatives addressing a specific and focussed clinical question. However, as the methods in the field have evolved, especially in response to the increasingly complex healthcare questions, more advanced evidence synthesis techniques have been developed. These can deal with extended data structures considering more than two treatment alternatives (network meta-analysis) and complex multicomponent interventions. The array of questions capable of being answered has also increased with specific approaches being developed for different evidence types including diagnostic, prognostic and qualitative data. Furthermore, driven by a desire for increasingly up-to-date evidence summaries, living systematic reviews have emerged. All of these methods can potentially have a role in informing older adult healthcare decisions. The aim of this review is to increase awareness and uptake of the increasingly comprehensive array of newer synthesis methods available and highlight their utility for answering clinically relevant questions in the context of older adult research, giving examples of where such techniques have already been effectively applied within the field. Their strengths and limitations are discussed, and we suggest user-friendly software options to implement the methods described.

### Efficacy and effectiveness too trials: clinical trial designs to generate evidence on efficacy and on effectiveness in wide practice [^115HW9C2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials provide the foundational evidence for market approval and use of drugs. However, clinical trials executed to meet regulatory requirements to gain market approval do not always provide evidence needed by other stakeholders, such as patients, clinicians, payers, and the general public. Nor do they provide generalizable evidence of effectiveness of a new drug in real‐world practice conditions. There is a need for trial designs that could provide useful evidence to all stakeholders with minimal additional costs and delays. Ideally, these designs would enable evaluations of new treatments in the broad range of patients and settings that are representative of real‐world use.

Key contributors to the lack of evidence relevant to all stakeholders are differences between study subjects and investigators included in clinical trials designed for regulatory approval vs. patients and clinical practice settings in which treatments will be used once approved for marketing. For regulatory approval, the efficacy and safety of a drug is generally demonstrated in groups of patients with relatively homogenous characteristics, selected to maximize the study's chances of rejecting the null hypothesis and to minimize the risk of spurious safety signals being imputed to the drug. It would be very helpful if this initial evaluation took place in the broad range of patients and settings representative of its ultimate real‐world use. The risks of broader criteria for patients in these studies are the potential for confounding factors that could make it more difficult to demonstrate efficacy and safety, and thereby reducing the probability of gaining market approval.

### Sunitinib and bevacizumab for first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and indirect comparison of clinical effectiveness [^11136kBv]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

There are no published randomised clinical trials of the effectiveness of treatment with sunitinib and treatment with bevacizumab (in combination with IFN) compared with best supportive care in patients who are unsuitable for treatment with IFN. We considered the validity of performing an indirect comparison between IFN and best supportive care to give a better indication of the anticipated benefit of these interventions against best supportive care. However, there are very few trials of IFN vs best supportive care (which is variously defined) and those that have been performed do not provide results according to prognostic status. Informal extrapolation of available data suggests that if it is assumed that there is no difference in the relative effectiveness of best supportive care and IFN in this population, even if one assumes a milder adverse event profile with best supportive care, the new interventions should still be considered effective.

In conclusion, there is evidence to suggest that treatment with sunitinib and treatment with bevacizumab plus IFN has clinically relevant and statistically significant advantages over treatment with IFN alone in patients with metastatic RCC in terms of PFS. Beneficial effects on OS have also been reported. In cases where either treatment is considered an option, an indirect comparison of available evidence suggests that treatment with sunitinib has benefits in PFS over treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and IFN.

### Challenges to evidence-based prescribing in clinical practice [^114MKQ4S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although there appears to be widespread support of evidence-based medicine as a basis for rational prescribing, the challenges to it are significant and often justified. A multitude of factors other than evidence drive clinical decision-making, including patient preferences and social circumstances, presence of disease-drug and drug-drug interactions, clinical experience, competing demands from more pressing clinical conditions, marketing and promotional activity, and system-level drug policies.

### Self-care for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease and stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^115gapbu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Self-care is defined as a naturalistic decision-making process addressing both the prevention and management of chronic illness, with core elements of self-care maintenance, self-care monitoring, and self-care management. In this scientific statement, we describe the importance of self-care in the American Heart Association mission and vision of building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The evidence supporting specific self-care behaviors such as diet and exercise, barriers to self-care, and the effectiveness of self-care in improving outcomes is reviewed, as is the evidence supporting various individual, family-based, and community-based approaches to improving self-care. Although there are many nuances to the relationships between self-care and outcomes, there is strong evidence that self-care is effective in achieving the goals of the treatment plan and cannot be ignored. As such, greater emphasis should be placed on self-care in evidence-based guidelines.

### Treatments of depressive symptoms in cancer patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116xRhBA]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, non-pharmacological treatments are gaining increasing attention as effective interventions for depression in cancer patients. The ASCO guidelines indicate that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions is stronger than that for pharmacological treatments. Recent high-quality clinical trials have further validated the effectiveness of these non-pharmacological approaches.

Although various interventions have been proposed for managing depression in cancer patients, few trials provide direct head-to-head comparisons, particularly among non-pharmacological treatments. Evidence for pharmacological interventions is also limited and heterogeneous, complicating the synthesis of findings across studies.

To address this, we conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare the relative effectiveness of multiple treatment options. This method combines direct and indirect evidence within a single analytical framework, enabling comparisons even when head-to-head trials are lacking. Unlike traditional pairwise meta-analyses, the Bayesian approach allows for more flexible modelling and provides treatment rankings based on probability estimates. This analysis aims to inform clinical decision-making by offering a clearer understanding of which interventions may be most effective for managing depression in people with cancer.

### Educational review: management of lymphedema-approaches, evidence for surgical and nonsurgical interventions [^116vKX6S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

Optimal treatment for lymphedema begins with an accurate diagnosis as delineated above. Management of lymphedema includes both surgical and nonsurgical approaches, with the latter categorized into physiological and debulking procedures. Patients are initially referred for conservative management, and those who meet criteria may then proceed to surgical intervention.

Nonsurgical Management

Pharmacologic Treatment

Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of medications for treating lymphedema. Various pharmaceutical agents, including diuretics, coumarin, vitamin E, and steroids, have been discussed, but none have demonstrated compelling efficacy in managing lymphedema.

While diuretics may reduce limb volume, this effect is largely anecdotal and likely results from their action on swelling caused by conditions such as heart failure or venous stasis, rather than from treating lymphedema itself. In fact, some authors have raised concern that diuretics may exacerbate the condition by increasing the concentration of high protein fluid in the interstitial space. Similarly, coumarin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline have been explored for their potential in preventing or treating lymphedema, but there is no supporting evidence for their effectiveness. Steroids have been shown to have a temporary benefit in lymphedema treatment, however, this effect is short-lived, and was not shown to extend beyond a month.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^111xVqpa]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Considering 'efficacy' (the effect of an intervention in test conditions compared with a specified alternative) in more detail, Cochrane reviews provide rigorous, independent, quantitative estimates and are subject to a consistent quality control process. They provide meta‐analyses of RCTs usually with a minimum of 6‐month follow‐up, synthesizing data from direct head‐to‐head comparisons between interventions and comparison conditions. It is important to recognize that efficacy estimates based on the Cochrane reviews depend upon the particular circumstances of the trials conducted, including the control conditions used and the target population. However, they provide the best estimates available and a starting point for consideration of effectiveness.

There are many reasons why efficacy estimates from RCTs might not translate into the same level of effectiveness in practice 16, particularly when considering delivery in very different cultures and health‐care systems. We believe, therefore, that it is important to conduct an analysis of likely transferability to different contexts and to supplement efficacy estimates with evidence from 'real‐world' studies, which match as closely as possible the context in which the intervention would be delivered. Real‐world studies often have to be 'observational' (involving cohort studies, analysis of clinical records or surveys), rather than experimental. This is, in part, because willingness to be randomized to conditions in smoking cessation is a major source of sample bias. By themselves they cannot definitely establish a causal connection between interventions and outcomes. However, they can help to form a judgement about whether or not effect sizes found in RCTs are likely to translate into practice in the settings of interest.

### Analysis of the systematic reviews process in reports of network meta-analyses: methodological systematic review [^116AbVUd]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Assessing the comparative effectiveness of many or all available interventions for a clinical indication is challenging. Direct evidence from head to head trials is often lacking. Indirect comparison between two interventions can still be estimated from the results of randomised controlled trials, without jeopardising the randomised comparisons within each trial, if each intervention is compared with an identical common comparator. When both direct and indirect comparisons are available, the two sources of information can be combined by using network meta-analyses — also known as multiple treatments meta-analyses or mixed treatment comparison meta-analyses. These methods allow for estimating all possible pairwise comparisons between interventions and placing them in rank order.

In the past few years, network meta-analyses have been increasingly adopted for comparing healthcare interventions. Network meta-analyses are attractive for clinical researchers because they seem to respond to their main concern: determining the best available treatment. Moreover, national agencies for health technology assessment and drug regulators increasingly use such methods.

Several reviews previously evaluated how indirect comparisons have been conducted and reported. These reviews focused on checking validity assumptions (based on homogeneity, similarity, and consistency) and did not assess the key components of the systematic review process. Network meta-analyses are primarily meta-analyses, and should therefore be performed according to the explicit and rigorous methods used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses to minimise bias. We performed a methodological systematic review of published reports of network meta-analyses to examine how they were reported and conducted. In particular, we assessed whether the reports adequately featured the key methodological components of the systematic review process.
