## Question

How do you treat strep pneumoniae

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat Streptococcus pneumoniae infections across clinical syndromes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical syndrome and ensuring we are dealing with pneumococcus rather than other streptococci. Then, I should evaluate risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and determine site of care to guide empiric therapy. Next, I will outline syndrome-specific regimens for outpatient and inpatient CAP, severe CAP, meningitis, otitis media or sinusitis, and bacteremia or sepsis, including pathways for penicillin allergy. After that, I will define recommended durations, discuss de-escalation and MIC-based definitive therapy, and finally emphasize vaccination, surveillance, and local antibiograms to optimize care.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome and pathogen context, because treatment depends on site of infection and severity; S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia and also causes meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and bacteremia, and I need to keep in mind that guidance for Group A streptococcal pharyngitis does not apply here even though some outpatient references discuss strep throat diagnostics and antibiotics for a different organism.

> I need to check resistance risk and site-of-care next, since comorbidities, age, recent antibiotics, immunosuppression, and nursing-home residence increase the likelihood of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and push choices toward broader empiric therapy or inpatient management per ATS/IDSA CAP guidance, so I should confirm those risk factors before selecting a regimen [^114NQhP1] [^116LD2BE].

> For outpatient CAP with comorbidities or other risk factors, I should confirm the 2019 ATS/IDSA recommendation of either a beta-lactam plus macrolide combination, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime paired with azithromycin or clarithromycin, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, and I should add that macrolide monotherapy should be avoided in many regions due to high macrolide resistance and documented clinical failures, so I will not jump to macrolide monotherapy unless local resistance is low and guidelines permit it [^114NQhP1] [^116LD2BE] [^113CX6u6] [^1122RpZY].

> For inpatient non-severe CAP, I should verify that the same ATS/IDSA framework applies with IV formulations, specifically a beta-lactam such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ceftaroline plus a macrolide, or alternatively respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy if there are no risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, while for severe CAP or ICU admission dual therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or beta-lactam plus a fluoroquinolone is recommended, and I need to ensure we obtain appropriate cultures in severe cases before antibiotics when feasible [^116LD2BE] [^112hi12x].

> Wait, I should consider nursing home settings separately; nursing home–acquired pneumonia often involves pneumococcus but with higher resistance risk and sometimes gram-negative pathogens, so empiric therapy can be an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone or in combination with a high-dose beta-lactam or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus azithromycin, recognizing this population's polypharmacy and drug–drug interaction risks [^112nLfsX].

> For suspected or confirmed pneumococcal meningitis, I will not jump to narrow therapy; recommended initial treatment includes a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime combined with vancomycin to cover potential high-level beta-lactam resistance, and although older surveillance noted no emergence of vancomycin resistance in pneumococcus, I should confirm local MICs and maintain combination therapy until susceptibilities are back, noting that cefuroxime is labeled for meningitis but is not standard first choice for empiric pneumococcal meningitis compared with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, and I should double-check dosing such as ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 hours in adults when aiming for adequate CSF levels [^113vU2tu] [^116pMNrF].

> For otitis media or acute bacterial sinusitis due to S. pneumoniae, first-line outpatient choices commonly include amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, and if I need cephalosporin alternatives I can use labeled options such as cefaclor or cephalexin with appropriate adult dosing and durations, while keeping in mind local resistance and prior beta-lactam exposure when choosing amoxicillin-clavulanate over amoxicillin alone, and I should verify that durations align with current practice, generally 5 to 7 days for mild disease and longer for severe presentations [^116FqGir] [^116sX1X2] [^111vbtb1].

> In bacteremia or sepsis where pneumococcus is the likely pathogen, I need to ensure prompt IV therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone while obtaining blood cultures, then de-escalate to penicillin G or ampicillin if the isolate is penicillin-susceptible, and escalate to combination therapy or alternative agents if high-level resistance is detected, keeping severity and source control in mind [^113vU2tu].

> Hold on, I should review resistance data to justify these choices; historical U.S. data showed high rates of penicillin non-susceptibility and substantial macrolide resistance, which supports beta-lactam–based regimens and avoidance of routine macrolide monotherapy, and importantly, outcomes with beta-lactams remain favorable when the pneumococcal penicillin MIC is below about 4 mcg/mL, whereas higher MICs are linked to increased mortality risk, and for multi-drug resistant pneumococcus, respiratory fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin have demonstrated high clinical and bacteriologic success in CAP [^113vU2tu] [^114huJwJ] [^111EAxHC] [^116ZQPwM].

> I need to ensure I have a clear plan for patients with penicillin allergy; if the history is non-anaphylactic, an oral cephalosporin option may be used when appropriate, whereas for anaphylactic beta-lactam allergy in CAP settings, respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy is a recommended path, and in severe infections where beta-lactams are contraindicated, vancomycin or linezolid could be considered depending on the site and organism, while recognizing variable clindamycin resistance rates among pneumococcal isolates [^114NQhP1] [^112Mbsge] [^112bzRxV] [^116sX1X2].

> Next, I should review durations and the resistance dynamics that argue against unnecessarily prolonged therapy; for uncomplicated CAP a minimum of 5 days with clinical stability is endorsed, with 7 to 14 days for more severe disease or complicated presentations, for pneumococcal meningitis 10 to 14 days is standard, and for otitis or sinusitis adults often receive 5 to 7 days for mild disease and 7 to 14 days for more severe disease using labeled cephalosporin durations, and I should remember that individual-level resistance in pneumococcus rises shortly after antibiotic exposure and wanes toward baseline by about 30 to 40 days, supporting completion of appropriate but not excessive courses [^116LD2BE] [^116FqGir] [^116sX1X2] [^111vbtb1] [^113kh49V] [^111nMFX4] [^114gWn56].

> I will now examine de-escalation to definitive therapy; obtain cultures before antibiotics when feasible in severe disease, then narrow based on susceptibilities, switching to penicillin G or amoxicillin if penicillin-susceptible, continuing high-dose third-generation cephalosporins if penicillin-intermediate but cephalosporin-susceptible, and if penicillin-resistant with elevated MICs or meningitis is present, maintaining vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin until MICs confirm a safe narrow option, while always aligning with clinical response and source control [^116LD2BE] [^114huJwJ].

> But wait, what about special populations; in children, amoxicillin remains a first-line agent for otitis media and non-severe pneumococcal pneumonia with avoidance of fluoroquinolones when possible, immunocompromised hosts often need broader empiric coverage and early involvement of infectious diseases, and across all ages, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination reduces carriage and disease including resistant serotypes, with polysaccharide vaccines also contributing to prevention in adults, so I should confirm vaccine status and recommend immunization as indicated [^112vDCmJ] [^116PxoyZ] [^117DcXAa].

> I should double-check local susceptibility data because hospital and regional variability can be substantial, meaning institutional antibiograms and regional surveillance should inform empiric choices, and aggregated antibiograms are useful but can vary year to year at the hospital level, so I should verify the most current local data before finalizing empiric therapy [^111qJawX] [^116LD2BE] [^116LFnxf].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention is emphasized; decreased transmission and disease from conjugate vaccination programs, along with prudent antibiotic use, have helped mitigate resistant pneumococcal infections, but serotype replacement and switching require ongoing surveillance and vaccination updates, so I should counsel patients on vaccines and steward antibiotics carefully to limit selective pressure [^112vDCmJ] [^116PxoyZ] [^116UqkPH].

> Hold on, I should verify one more common pitfall; guidance for Group A streptococcal pharyngitis, including rapid testing and penicillin V recommendations, does not apply to S. pneumoniae infections of the lower respiratory tract, meninges, or ear or sinus, so I need to avoid extrapolating GAS regimens to pneumococcus outside of labeled cephalosporin uses.

Treat Streptococcus pneumoniae **first-line with beta-lactams** (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) [^113vU2tu] for most infections; use **respiratory fluoroquinolones** (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) [^111EAxHC] when beta-lactam resistance or allergy is present. For **severe infections**, combine a beta-lactam with a macrolide or use a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone. In **meningitis**, give high-dose ceftriaxone or cefotaxime plus vancomycin until susceptibilities are known. Adjust therapy based on local resistance patterns and susceptibility results, and use **pneumococcal vaccination** to prevent disease and reduce resistance [^116AkGd4] [^112vDCmJ].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

Beta-lactam antibiotics are the **cornerstone of treatment** for S. pneumoniae infections given their proven efficacy and safety [^113vU2tu]. The following agents are commonly used:

- **Amoxicillin**: Preferred for mild to moderate infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and non-severe pneumonia.

- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate**: Used for infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms or when broader coverage is needed [^114NQhP1].

- **Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime**: Recommended for severe infections, including bacteremia, meningitis, and severe pneumonia [^116LD2BE].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapy

In cases of **beta-lactam allergy or resistance**, alternatives include:

- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are effective against multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae and are recommended for severe infections or when beta-latams cannot be used [^111EAxHC] [^116jh4f2].

- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin may be used for mild infections, but resistance rates are increasing, limiting their use as monotherapy [^113vU2tu] [^1122RpZY].

- **Clindamycin**: Effective for certain infections, particularly in penicillin-allergic patients, but resistance is a concern [^113vU2tu] [^112bzRxV].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Prompt initiation of **empiric antibiotic therapy** should be based on clinical presentation, illness severity, and local resistance patterns. The following regimens are recommended [^116LD2BE]:

| **Clinical setting** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| - Outpatient <br/> - No comorbidities | - Amoxicillin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Macrolide (if resistance < 25%) [^114NQhP1] |
| - Outpatient <br/> - Comorbidities | - Amoxicillin-clavulanate + macrolide <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone [^114NQhP1] |
| - Inpatient <br/> - Non-severe | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE] |
| - Inpatient <br/> - Severe | - Beta-lactam + macrolide <br/> - Beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone [^116LD2BE] |
| Meningitis | - Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + vancomycin |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **duration of antibiotic therapy** depends on the clinical syndrome and severity of infection:

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: 5–7 days, provided the patient is afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable [^116LD2BE].

- **Bacteremia without focal infection**: 10–14 days.

- **Meningitis**: 10–14 days, depending on clinical response and susceptibility results.

- **Otitis media or sinusitis**: 5–10 days, depending on clinical response.

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

The **clinical response** should be monitored closely, with adjustments based on culture and susceptibility results. If the patient does not improve within 48–72 hours, reassess and modify antibiotic therapy as necessary.

---

## Prevention strategies

The **prevention** of S. pneumoniae infections is critical and includes vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, PCV20) and the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), which reduce pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance [^112vDCmJ] [^116UqkPH]. Antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures — hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and isolation precautions in healthcare settings — also limit transmission and resistance [^116PxoyZ].

---

## Emerging antibiotic resistance

S. pneumoniae **antibiotic resistance** is a growing concern, particularly to beta-lactams, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones [^113kh49V]. Ongoing surveillance and adherence to antibiotic stewardship programs are essential to manage and prevent resistance [^112AuHia].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Administering **effective antibiotic therapy** significantly reduces morbidity and mortality associated with S. pneumoniae infections. However, complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, meningitis, and chronic lung disease can occur, particularly in high-risk populations [^112fwpR7].

---

## Special considerations

In **pediatric patients**, amoxicillin is the preferred antibiotic for mild to moderate infections, with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime recommended for severe infections [^113vU2tu]. In **immunocompromised patients**, broad-spectrum antibiotics and longer treatment durations may be required owing to increased risk of severe infections and complications [^112fwpR7].

---

For Streptococcus pneumoniae infections, **beta-lactam antibiotics** are first-line, with respiratory fluoroquinolones or macrolides used as alternatives based on resistance patterns and patient factors [^116LD2BE]. Effective **prevention** through vaccination and antibiotic stewardship is essential to reduce disease burden and resistance [^112vDCmJ].

### Serotype competence and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116UqkPH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of bacteremia, sinusitis, otitis media, bacterial meningitis, and bacterial pneumonia, causes substantial illness and death worldwide. In recent decades, the increase of S. pneumoniae strains resistant to β-lactam antimicrobial drugs and other classes of antimicrobial drugs has further complicated the treatment of pneumococcal infection. Although the introduction of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has successfully reduced invasive pneumococcal disease caused by the vaccine serotypes and effectively decreased the spread of antimicrobial drug–resistant isolates, pneumococcal infection remains a major issue in light of the selective pressure invoked by vaccination programs.

At least two consequences have been noted since the large-scale use of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine:

- **Serotype replacement**: Serotypes not covered by the conjugate vaccine have increased both in nasopharyngeal colonization and clinical illness.
- **Serotype switching**: Through recombination in naturally transformable clones, there can be an acquisition of a nonvaccine capsule.

Investigating how competent pneumococci can be for genetic transformation is useful because this factor plays a role in the evolution of S. pneumoniae, particularly with respect to virulence and antimicrobial drug resistance. The ability of S. pneumoniae to undergo horizontal gene transfer leads to genetic diversity and helps the organism adapt to environmental changes. Since the discovery of competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) by Havar, this adaptability has been increasingly understood.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae: Epidemiology and patterns of resistance [^113vU2tu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis; it results in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with pneumonia and meningitis. The pneumococcus is a common colonizing bacterium in the respiratory tract; it is especially prevalent in the respiratory tracts of children, where it is frequently exposed to antimicrobial agents. This exposure can lead to resistance.

Penicillin nonsusceptibility is found in nearly 40% of strains causing disease in adults, although often these cases are treatable with appropriate dosing regimens of many oral and parenteral beta-lactam agents. In the United States, resistance to macrolides is widespread, averaging approximately 28%, but it is geographically variable, ranging from 23% in the northwest to 30% in the northeast. Resistance to tetracyclines and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is reported in approximately 20% and 35% of isolates, respectively, and resistance to multiple classes of agents is increasingly common.

Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, respiratory fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin are currently the most effective agents for treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, with over 90% of isolates in the United States being susceptible. Vancomycin is the only agent against which resistance has not emerged.

Patient groups at increased risk for developing resistant pneumococcal infections have been identified and include patients with malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and sickle-cell disease. Judicious use of antimicrobials is recommended.

### Levofloxacin [^111EAxHC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Levofloxacin was effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 mcg/mL), second-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Of the 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 patients (95%) achieved both clinical and bacteriologic success at post-therapy.

- **Clinical and bacterial success rates**: The clinical and bacterial success rates for levofloxacin-treated MDRSP in community-acquired pneumonia patients are detailed in further studies.

- **Patient information**: One patient had a respiratory isolate resistant to tetracycline, cefuroxime, macrolides, and TMP/SMX and intermediate to penicillin. The blood isolate from the same patient was intermediate to penicillin and cefuroxime and resistant to the other classes. This patient is included in the database based on a respiratory isolate.

- **Data definitions**:
	- † n = the number of microbiologically evaluable patients who were clinical successes; N = number of microbiologically evaluable patients in the designated resistance group.
	- ‡ n = the number of MDRSP isolates eradicated or presumed eradicated in microbiologically evaluable patients; N = number of MDRSP isolates in a designated resistance group.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotic use is to employ rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. These rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on June 5, 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomized individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomized.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures).

### Prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 among older adults receiving pneumococcal conjugate vaccine suggests interactions between Streptococcus pneumoniae and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the respiratory tract [^11348ckr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Improved understanding of viral–bacterial interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains necessary to validate the mechanistic basis for our findings. However, our results are in agreement with other data suggesting that the pathogenicity of respiratory viruses may be modified by bacterial carriage. Evidence that upper respiratory commensal bacteria promote viral infection dates back to 1987, with studies demonstrating that enzymes expressed by bacteria (including pneumococci) enhance influenza virus replication and pathogenicity. More recently, blunting of innate immune responses to influenza virus during pneumococcal colonization has been demonstrated in human challenge studies.

Such mechanisms of interaction may account for epidemiologic observations of enhanced virus acquisition and symptom risk among carriers of pneumococci and other respiratory commensal pathogenic bacteria. To substantiate our findings, it remains crucial to determine whether the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and adverse clinical outcomes differ among individuals who carry or do not carry pneumococci. Several classes of observational studies would be helpful to test this hypothesis. Epidemiological studies should evaluate interactions between pneumococci and SARS-CoV-2 by comparing the prevalence and density of pneumococcal carriage among COVID-19 cases and uninfected controls or among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who experience or do not experience symptoms. Such studies will also provide an opportunity to assess whether interactions between pneumococci and SARS-CoV-2 are serotype specific.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^111nMFX4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Quantitative analysis: Eight studies (n = 3101) reported a total of 34 primary resistance data points on β-lactam antibiotics in S. pneumoniae with a maximum follow-up of 60 days and a therapy duration of 10 days. The relationship between resistance to β-lactams in S. pneumoniae and days postexposure revealed a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval, 1.71–6.46) of resistance at day 14, followed by a steady decrease to preexposure level on day 40 (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.55–1.75]).

- **Odds ratios**: Odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of Streptococcus pneumoniae antibiotic resistance to β-lactams (A) and penicillin (B) over time, as determined by robust error meta-regression.

Eight studies (n = 3101) reported a total of 27 primary resistance data points for penicillin treatment of S. pneumoniae with a maximum follow-up of 60 days and a therapy duration of 10 days. The results showed a 4.82-fold increase in odds (95% CI, 2.57–9.01) in resistance at day 14, which steadily decreased to a preexposure level on day 40 (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.41–1.25]). The results for primary resistance data on macrolide antibiotics in S. pneumoniae showed a similar trend but with greater uncertainty.

### Effect of single-dose azithromycin on pneumococcal carriage and resistance: A randomized controlled trial [^115QPgAi]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). High credibility.

We evaluated antibiotic resistance selection in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* isolates from children participating in an individually randomized trial of single-dose azithromycin versus placebo. After 14 days, the prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, oxacillin, and clindamycin was elevated in the azithromycin group compared to the placebo group. Notably, there was no difference observed at 6 months.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^113xm9Qm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); shortening the duration of the illness; preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews.

### Pneumococcal resistance in perspective: How well are we combating it [^116PxoyZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most commonly isolated community-acquired respiratory tract pathogen, reports of high rates of antibiotic resistance worldwide highlight the need for intervention to stem any further increases in resistance. Efforts to reduce the incidence of pneumococcal resistance have been mainly two-fold, involving attempts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, as well as ensuring early childhood immunization with the pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine.

To reduce unnecessary prescribing for infections that are typically viral in etiology, such as acute bronchitis, education efforts have been focused not only on clinicians but also on parents and patients. These education efforts significantly reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and initial evidence suggests they may stabilize, if not reduce, the incidence of penicillin and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal isolates.

Utilization of the relatively new pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine not only reduces the incidence of acute otitis media caused by pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine and diseases caused by related serotypes but also has a highly significant effect on reducing the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children and potential adult contacts. Moreover, more recent data have established that vaccination is also decreasing the carriage and transmission of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal isolates. Education and vaccine programs that attempt to stabilize and/or reduce the rate of pneumococcal resistance are at least crucial.

### Antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae: The paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape [^112WU47A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The development of resistance to different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. However, not all drugs have the same efficiency in selecting for resistance. Large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist, and several authors have consistently reported a direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli, as well as beta-lactams and macrolides use.

In Spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996 with the Willow (SAUCE) Project to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and to couple those data with national antibiotic consumption (IMS) data from both temporal and geographical approaches. Temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001, largely due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in S. pneumoniae was not observed. There was also an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin.

Several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, and the influence of other non-quinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs.

### SPL drug information for cephalexin [^116sX1X2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Cephalexin, also known as Keflex, has several labeled indications:

- **Treatment of respiratory tract infections in adults**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.
- **Treatment of genitourinary tract infections in adults**: Caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae.
- **Treatment of acute otitis media in adults**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Moraxella catarrhalis.

- **Treatment of bone infections in adults**: Caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Proteus mirabilis.

Cephalexin also has off-label indications:

- **Prevention of infective endocarditis in adults**: Before dental procedures, if penicillins are ineffective or contraindicated.
- **Treatment of prosthetic joint infection in adults**: Caused by oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, after debridement and retention of the prosthesis.
- **Treatment of prosthetic joint infection in adults**: Caused by β-hemolytic streptococci or Propionibacterium acnes, after debridement and retention of the prosthesis, if penicillins are ineffective or contraindicated.
- **Secondary prevention of urinary tract infections in female adults**.
- **Secondary prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnant female adults**.
- **Treatment of lactational mastitis in adults**.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^111qJawX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Geographic variation in drug susceptibility among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae has influenced national treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Whether individual hospital susceptibility data provide reliable and valid information for providers is unclear. We examined the geographic and temporal variability in hospital-reported rates of pneumococcal susceptibility.

We surveyed all 52 hospitals that provided acute adult care in the five counties surrounding Philadelphia and collected data on levels of penicillin susceptibility among all pneumococcal blood isolates from 1998 to 2000. In 1998, pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to penicillin varied from 0% to 67% of all blood isolates across the 33 hospitals with more than 10 isolates in that year. Hospital location did not correlate with the level of reported pneumococcal susceptibility (p = 0.8). Additionally, correlations were not significant in reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin within individual hospitals during the three-year period.

### Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and tolerance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^111r22ej]. Microbes and Infection (2000). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen causing potentially life-threatening community-acquired diseases in both the developed and developing world. Since 1967, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of penicillin-resistant and multiply antibiotic-resistant pneumococci worldwide. Prevention of access of the antibiotic to the target, inactivation of the antibiotic, and alteration of the target are mechanisms that S. pneumoniae has developed to resist antibiotics. Recent studies on antibiotic-tolerant pneumococcal mutants permitted the development of a novel model for the control of bacterial cell death.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefits in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^116U2v6M]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The REMR DRMA used time since the first antibiotic as a proxy for "dose", thus producing output that shows how resistance risk increases and then decreases following drug treatment. Fitting these temporal changes in resistance risk to probability distributions enabled estimates for how risk cumulates over different time spans. We made no a priori assumption of the distribution shape and instead fit a range of probability distributions (using a Python library called Reliability) and selected the best fit. These fitted distributions normalize the risk of transmitting resistant pathogens (i.e. ensured the area under the curve summed to 1). Knowing how resistance emergence changed over time allowed estimation of how different patient isolation scenarios reduced the risk that a transmitted pathogen was resistant.

The first, "naive" scenario measured the duration of isolation required to halve risk that a transmitted pathogen was resistant, assuming that isolation was initiated from the first day of treatment. The alternative, "targeted" scenario measured the duration of isolation needed to equivalently impact risk when the isolation window prioritized peak resistance levels.

### Appropriate use of antimicrobials for drug-resistant pneumonia: Focus on the significance of beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^114huJwJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, are commonly prescribed for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common etiologic agent of community-acquired pneumonia, has become increasingly resistant to beta-lactams over the past decade. The results of several studies suggest that penicillins remain effective for streptococcal pneumonia when the infecting pathogen has a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than 4 micrograms/mL.

- **Increased mortality concerns**: For patients with MICs greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/mL, increased rates of mortality may occur, particularly for those who survive their first four days of hospitalization. Currently, 3.5%-7.8% of S. pneumoniae clinical isolates have MICs that fall in this latter class, but these rates may rise in the future.

The clinical relevance of in vitro resistance may be related to at least three factors: concordance of antimicrobial therapy, severity of illness, and virulence.

### What is the relevance of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae? (should macrolide monotherapy be used for mild pneumonia?) [^113CX6u6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Multidrug-resistant pneumococci continue to increase worldwide. Although there are still questions regarding the relevance of β-lactam resistance, the recommendation for the use of macrolides as monotherapy for mild community-acquired pneumonia should be revisited in view of high rates of resistance, the association of clinical failures with low-level and high-level resistance, and the lack of clinical data to support their need for empirical therapy for the atypicals.

### Hidden epidemic of macrolide-resistant pneumococci [^1122RpZY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In the United States, guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTIs) have been established by several organizations, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. The clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been addressed in updates to these organizations' guidelines for treating community-acquired pneumonia and in a report published by the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group convened by the CDC. The consensus among these guidelines is that empiric therapy should be stratified based on the likely cause, treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), and the risk of pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance.

In general, all three guidelines recommend that monotherapy with macrolides be restricted to specific patient subgroups (i.e. those with no coexisting cardiopulmonary disease and no risk factors for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, such as recent antimicrobial drug use). For outpatients with risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, recommended treatment options include combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as high-dose amoxicillin or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The increased use of fluoroquinolones has been associated with the emergence and spread of resistance to these agents and local clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae strains with very high resistance levels.

### Rethinking recommendations for use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults [^115STtLR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of disease worldwide; the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains emphasizes the importance of disease prevention by use of vaccines. Recent studies have provided information that is useful for the evaluation of vaccine recommendations. Recommendations target most people who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease. However, higher risk has also been identified for African Americans and smokers, but these groups are not specifically targeted by recommendations. The vaccine is effective against invasive disease in immunocompetent people, although studies in immunocompromised subjects have found few subgroups in which the vaccine appears to be effective.

Questions with regard to optimal timing and indications for revaccination remain a challenge because the duration of protection and effectiveness of revaccination remain unknown. New pneumococcal vaccines appear promising but will need to be tested against the performance of the polysaccharide vaccine. Improving delivery of the currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to adults who will benefit should be a high priority.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae and community-acquired pneumonia: A cause for concern [^112fwpR7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, posing a major economic burden to the healthcare system. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP. Other common bacterial causes include Haemophilus influenzae, as well as atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species.

Increasing resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents has been documented in S. pneumoniae and is common in H. influenzae as well. Successful empiric therapy is paramount to the management of CAP to avoid treatment failure and subsequent associated costs. Given that resistance is increasing among respiratory pathogens and S. pneumoniae is the most common etiologic agent identified in CAP, strategies for antimicrobial therapy should be based on the likely causative pathogen, the presence of risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, and local resistance patterns.

### Increasing antibiotic resistance of streptococcus species in New York City [^112bzRxV]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus species are common pathogens in head and neck infections and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Emerging penicillin-resistant streptococcal pathogens have shifted empirical antibiotic therapy in favor of valuable alternatives, including erythromycin and clindamycin. This study was undertaken to determine the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance to these antibiotics.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study of two streptococcal species isolates, Streptococcus pyogenes (163 specimens) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (164 specimens), collected between January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, at two academic institutions. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns were analyzed for penicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.

- **Results**: Fourteen percent to 34% of S. pyogenes isolates were erythromycin-resistant, and 0% to 28% were clindamycin-resistant. None of the S. pyogenes isolates were resistant to penicillin. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 33% to 50% were resistant to erythromycin, and 18% to 33% were resistant to clindamycin. The penicillin resistance levels for S. pneumoniae were 0% to 45%.

- **Conclusions**: Our antimicrobial resistance levels for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae significantly exceeded national and worldwide levels of erythromycin and clindamycin resistance. With a diverse population of over 8 million residents and high physician supply, our model is a microcosm for the study of antimicrobial use and susceptibility patterns.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae causes experimental meningitis following intranasal and otitis media infections via a nonhematogenous route [^116Whdac]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Using two different animal models of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, we have demonstrated that this organism is able to spread to the central nervous system and cause meningitis by bypassing the bloodstream. Following respiratory tract infection induced via intranasal inoculation, bacteria were rapidly found in the bloodstream and brains in the majority of infected mice. A similar pattern of dissemination occurred following otitis media infection via transbullar injection of gerbils. However, a small percentage of animals infected by either route showed no bacteria in the blood and yet did have significant numbers of bacteria in brain tissue. Subsequent experiments using a galU mutant of S. pneumoniae, which is impaired in its ability to disseminate to the bloodstream following infection, showed that this organism is able to spread to the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. These results demonstrate that, unlike many bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis, S. pneumoniae is able to do so independent of bloodstream involvement upon different routes of infection. This may address the difficulty in treating human infections caused by this organism.

### Treatment of nursing home-acquired pneumonia [^112nLfsX]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among nursing home residents, with 30-day mortality rates ranging from 10 to 30 percent. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of nursing home-acquired pneumonia, though Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative organisms may be more prevalent in severe cases.

Antibiotic therapy for this condition should target a broad range of organisms, with consideration given to drug-resistant microbes when making treatment decisions. In the nursing home setting, treatment should consist of an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone or in combination with a high-dose beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, together with azithromycin.

In hospitalized patients, broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage for many gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, are required. Appropriate dosing of antibiotics is critical to optimize effectiveness and prevent adverse effects. Given that many nursing home residents are on multiple medications, it is essential to consider potential drug interactions.

### Aggregated antibiograms and monitoring of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [^116LFnxf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Infections from Streptococcus pneumoniae tax the healthcare system in the United States and other countries. Scientific advances have been made in the treatment and prevention of pneumococcal infections through antibiotics and licensure of vaccines for both adults and children. However, the last few decades have witnessed the emergence of S. pneumoniae resistance to antibiotics. In a multistate, population-based surveillance system that follows invasive disease from pneumococcus and other bacterial pathogens, the percentage of isolates resistant to penicillin reached 24% in 1998. Increases in resistance to other antimicrobial drugs have also been noted among penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

- **Implications of drug resistance**: Extend beyond the laboratory and into clinical practice. Treatment failures from drug resistance have been reported with meningitis and otitis media. In some studies, increased death and disease in patients hospitalized with pneumonia caused by high-level β-lactam-resistant pneumococci have been reported.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^114NWazJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

To further refine the temporal dynamics of patient-level resistance emergence and waning, the odds of antibiotic resistance are modeled over time using a dose-response meta-analysis (DRMA) framework, which incorporates time since antibiotic exposure as a continuous variable. This approach has the advantage over fixed time intervals, as used in previous meta-analyses, by reducing information loss and thereby diminishing the risk of distorting exposure-outcome relationships. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between different antibiotic therapies and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens over time. To achieve this objective, the meta-analysis conducted by Bakhit et al. was updated, and the data were reanalyzed using a DRMA.

### Levofloxacin [^116ZQPwM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin was effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (MDRSP). MDRSP isolates are resistant to two or more of the following antibacterials: penicillin (MIC ≥ 2 mcg/mL), 2nd-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Of 40 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 38 (95.0%) achieved clinical and bacteriologic success post-therapy.

- **Resistance details**: One patient had a respiratory isolate resistant to tetracycline, cefuroxime, macrolides, and TMP/SMX; it was intermediate to penicillin. A blood isolate from the same patient was intermediate to penicillin and cefuroxime and resistant to the other classes. This patient is included in the database based on the respiratory isolate.

- **Success and eradication rates**: Not all isolates were resistant to all antimicrobial classes tested. The success and eradication rates are available but not shown here.

### Morphine disrupts interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17-mediated pulmonary mucosal host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection [^116CQy9a]. Infection and Immunity (2010). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a pathogen that causes serious respiratory disease and meningitis in the immunocompromised drug abuse population. However, the precise mechanisms by which drug abuse compromises the host immune defense to pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection are not fully understood. Using a well-established murine model of opiate abuse and S. pneumoniae lung infection, we explored the influence of morphine treatment on the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17 axis and related innate immunity.

Impairment of early IL-23/IL-17 production caused by morphine treatment was associated with delayed neutrophil migration and decreased pneumococcal clearance. Furthermore, morphine treatment impaired MyD88-dependent IL-23 production in alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells in response to in vitro S. pneumoniae cell infection. Moreover, morphine treatment significantly inhibited the S. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), ATF2, and NF-kappaBp65. T-cell receptor delta (TCRdelta)-deficient mice showed a decrease in IL-17 production and a severely weakened capacity to clear lung S. pneumoniae infection. Finally, morphine treatment resulted in diminished secretion of antimicrobial proteins S100A9 and S100A8/A9 during early stages of S. pneumoniae infection.

In conclusion, morphine treatment causes a dysfunction in IL-23-producing dendritic cells and macrophages and IL-17-producing gammadeltaT lymphocytes in response to S. pneumoniae lung infection. This leads to diminished release of antimicrobial S100A8/A9 proteins and compromised neutrophil recruitment.

### Therapeutic potential of kaempferol on Streptococcus pneumoniae infection [^1173na1f]. Microbes and Infection (2022). Low credibility.

Co-infections with pathogens and secondary bacterial infections play significant roles during the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenetic process, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Notably, co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), a major Gram-positive pathogen causing pneumonia or meningitis, severely threaten the diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 worldwide.

Accumulating evidence has emerged indicating that S. pneumoniae evolves multiple virulence factors, including pneumolysin (PLY) and sortase A (SrtA), extensively explored as alternative anti-infection targets. In our study, the natural flavonoid kaempferol was identified as a potential candidate drug for infection therapeutics via anti-virulence mechanisms. We found that kaempferol could interfere with the pore-forming activity of PLY by engaging with catalytic active sites and consequently inhibit PLY-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, exposure to kaempferol significantly reduced the SrtA peptidase activity by occupying the active sites of SrtA. Furthermore, biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to the host cells could be significantly thwarted by kaempferol incubation.

In vivo infection models by S. pneumoniae highlighted that kaempferol oral administration exhibited notable treatment benefits, evidenced by decreased bacterial burden, suggesting that kaempferol has tremendous potential to attenuate S. pneumoniae pathogenicity. Scientifically, our study implies that kaempferol is a promising therapeutic option.

### Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines - implications for community antibiotic prescribing [^1139nJiw]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2000). Low credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population worldwide. The development of increasing resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics is making the treatment of infections caused by this organism much more difficult. To prevent disease, a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is available; however, this vaccine is poorly immunogenic in infants and young children. The development and licensing of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that are safe and effective in the pediatric population is an important step in our ability to decrease the prevalence of pneumococcal disease seen.

### Oxazolidinone antibiotics [^112Mbsge]. Lancet (2001). Low credibility.

Many common gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents, necessitating the development of new drugs with activity against gram-positive bacteria. The oxazolidinones, a new chemical class of synthetic antimicrobial agents, have a unique mechanism of inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone to be approved for clinical use, displays in-vitro activity, generally bacteriostatic, against many important resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Linezolid is a parenteral agent that also possesses near-complete oral bioavailability in addition to favorable pharmacokinetic and toxic effect profiles. Clinical trials confirm the activity of linezolid in the setting of pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infections, and infections due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid shows promise as an alternative to glycopeptides and streptogramins for treating serious infections due to resistant gram-positive organisms. New agents with greater potency and new spectra of activity could arise from further modification of the oxazolidinone nucleus.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy. This regimen involves a β-lactam, such as ampicillin/sulbactam (1.5–3 g every 6 hours), cefotaxime (1–2 g every 8 hours), ceftriaxone (1–2 g daily), or ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 hours), in conjunction with a macrolide, such as azithromycin (500 mg daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg BID). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin (750 mg daily) or moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), is recommended for adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who exhibit no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^114gWn56]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Patient exposure to antibiotics promotes the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify whether the temporal dynamics of resistance emergence at the individual-patient level were predictable for specific pathogen-drug classes.

Following a systematic review, a novel robust error meta-regression method for dose-response meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying resistant bacteria during and following treatment compared to baseline. Probability density functions fitted to the resulting dose-response curves were then used to optimize the period during and/or after treatment when resistant pathogens were most likely to be identified.

Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae treatment with β-lactam antibiotics demonstrated a peak in resistance prevalence among patients 4 days after completing treatment with a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval, 1.71–6.46). Resistance waned more gradually than it emerged, returning to pre-exposure levels 1 month after treatment (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.55–1.75]). Patient isolation during the peak dose-response period would be expected to reduce the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant equivalently to a 50% longer isolation window timed from the first day of treatment.

Predictable temporal dynamics of resistance levels have implications both for surveillance and control.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP.

Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardized tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of the severity of illness and for establishing the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically.

Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include the spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include the administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway.

The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for the management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are re…

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown.

Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a significant pathogen of respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis, and acute otitis media. Rising incidences of antimicrobial resistance among pneumococcal strains worldwide have led to research into and development of advanced antibacterials with improved gram-positive activity. Moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxy quinolone, has been tested against a variety of S. pneumoniae strains, including penicillin-sensitive, intermediately resistant to penicillin, and penicillin-resistant strains. We review the preclinical data corroborated by the available clinical experience to demonstrate moxifloxacin's activity against S. pneumoniae strains, irrespective of penicillin susceptibility.

### Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis in adults [^117DJAYZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae septic arthritis is an uncommon infection. The classic clinical picture includes concomitant pulmonary and/or meningeal and joint infections in the presence of predisposing local and systemic factors. Initial laboratory tests are usually inconclusive, and joint aspiration is required for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy, usually with penicillin, combined with closed or open joint drainage. Increasing reports of infections involving penicillin-resistant strains are a concern. The prognosis is usually favorable, but early recognition and aggressive management are essential to reduce the likelihood of significant joint injury.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^111iSPHV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have contributed significantly to extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose dependent: higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between the level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, at the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital-

### Safety of Streptococcus pyogenes vaccines: Anticipating and overcoming challenges for clinical trials and post-marketing monitoring [^115VWbf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), a human pathogen, afflict more than 800 million people each year and result in an estimated 639,000 deaths, most attributable to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and invasive infections. Clinical manifestations vary from mucosal diseases (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, superficial skin infections) to locally invasive and systemic diseases (bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) and immune-related sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD. While most manifestations of S. pyogenes infection can be treated with penicillin, the lack of prevention strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causes infections to progress to severe disease and death. Hence, the 71st World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2018 to prioritize the development of a safe and effective S. pyogenes vaccine.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for atypical pathogens.

Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe, these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^111sa4N4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Consistent patterns emerged from the dose-response analyses across studies, showing that the odds of resistance increased to a maximum level on day 14 for the β-lactams (Figure 2). Macrolide treatment studies were also consistent, but they exhibited peak resistance much later, between approximately days 30 and 60. This knowledge of temporalities could strategically inform timed sampling to improve estimates of resistance incidence and prevalence. Potentially, this information could also contribute toward temporally targeted isolation of patients with the goal of reducing the risk that transmitted pathogens are drug-resistant.

The relative reduction in risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant when isolating patients from the first day of treatment was compared with isolation during the period when the odds of resistance were found to be highest in the meta-analysis. Both scenarios for β-lactams (including the subgroup of penicillin) are shown in Figure 3. For macrolide treatments of S. pneumoniae, see Supplementary Material 5.

- **Strategically timed isolation of patients**: Treated for Streptococcus pneumoniae infection can reduce the risk that transmitted pathogens are resistant. Alternative isolation windows are shown: time extending from the first day of treatment ("naive"; solid line) or during windows of highest resistance risk as identified in the meta-analysis ("targeted"; dashed line). The dotted lines denote the durations of isolation required to halve the risk that transmitted S. pneumoniae pathogens are resistant.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^113kh49V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Antibiotic resistance incurs a huge and growing toll in terms of morbidity, mortality, and societal costs. Previous studies have provided evidence of nonlinear temporal trends in the emergence of resistance among patients following exposure to antibiotics. Using a novel meta-analytical approach, this study sought to refine our understanding of the temporality of resistance emergence and waning. After pooling the evidence from 8 studies (n = 3101 participants), an increased risk of resistant S. pneumoniae among patients was found, peaking at day 14 for β-lactams and for the penicillin subgroup, 4 days after treatment cessation. Evidence is shown for an eventual waning in resistance 30 days following cessation of the antibiotics course, corroborating findings from earlier studies.

Identifying consistent dynamics in resistance emergence and waning offers new opportunities for understanding the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Surveillance is crucial for tracking resistance spread and in targeting its control. It is one of the five strategic priorities of the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, and research on resistance is dominated by surveillance reports. A recent report from the Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance describes several ways in which surveillance can support efforts to reduce antimicrobial resistance: improve detection of the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, help guide patient treatment, identify populations at risk, inform policy development, and assess the impact of interventions.

### Vaccines for preventing pneumococcal infection in adults [^117DcXAa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Diseases caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (*S. pneumoniae*) continue to cause substantial morbidity and mortality globally. While pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) have the potential to prevent disease and death, the degree of protection afforded against various clinical endpoints and within different populations is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and effectiveness of PPVs in preventing pneumococcal disease or death in adults. We did not assess adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 6, MEDLINE (January 1966 to June Week 2, 2012), and EMBASE (1974 to June 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults, provided the study outcome met the definition of the outcome considered in the review. We also considered non-RCTs in adults, where the study assessed PPV effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), provided the study controlled for important confounding factors.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors assessed trial quality of RCTs, and three review authors extracted the data. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Two review authors assessed study quality and extracted data for non-RCTs. We calculated ORs and 95% CIs using a random-effects model following the conversion of each study outcome to a log OR and standard error (SE).

- **Main results**: Twenty-five studies met our inclusion criteria (18 RCTs involving 64,852 participants and seven non-RCTs involving 62,294 participants).

### Management of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections and the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [^115KNkFY]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of meningitis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, and acute otitis media in both children and adults, has been altered by the availability of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and selection pressure from broad-spectrum antibiotics. In Spain, the rates of antimicrobial consumption and resistance are high; of all S. pneumoniae isolates collected between 2001 and 2003, 9.2% were penicillin-resistant, and 26.4% were penicillin-intermediate. These rates were even higher in children aged ≤ 4 years; 52.3% of isolates were penicillin-resistant or penicillin-intermediate.

Serogroup 14 comprises nearly 9% of pneumococcal strains and exhibits the highest resistance to penicillin, at 69%. Since the introduction of PCV7 in Madrid, the isolates collected from hospitalized children aged < 15 years across 21 hospitals revealed that only 8% of cases involving S. pneumoniae isolates were due to PCV7 serotypes, and no PCV7 vaccination failures were identified. These isolates demonstrated low rates of penicillin-non-susceptible and erythromycin-non-susceptible strains. Among multiresistant strains, serotype 19A was identified as most important. Although the recent WHO position paper on childhood immunizations highlights the growing resistance of pneumococci, antibiotic resistance in Spain is noted to be decreasing and must be evaluated in conjunction with global studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

- **Results**: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae: Implications for drug selection [^112j74Po]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important pathogen in many community-acquired respiratory infections in the United States and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, S. pneumoniae is becoming increasingly resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Results of recent surveillance studies in the United States show that the prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae ranges from 25% to > 50%, and rates of macrolide resistance among pneumococci are reported to be as high as 31%. A high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial classes is found among penicillin-resistant strains. Newer quinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) that have better antipneumococcal activity in vitro are the most active agents and therefore are attractive options for treatment of adults with community-acquired respiratory infections. Efforts should be made to prevent pneumococcal infections in high-risk patients through vaccination.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^115WGnja]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Strengths of this study include the novel statistical approach, which allowed for time to be treated as a continuous variable instead of being categorized (e.g. before vs. after, or intervention vs. control). This meant that the multiple longitudinal observations per study could be capitalized upon more effectively for analysis. Limitations of this study include the insufficiency of extracted data from the reviewed studies to analyze pathogens other than S. pneumoniae, and the analysis was restricted to a single antibiotic class with two subclasses. It was also not possible to assess the differences between high- and low-dose antibiotics, or between adults and children.

The study identified consistent temporal dynamics in the emergence and waning of drug resistance for specific drug-pathogen combinations. Acknowledging the shortfall in the development of new drugs, the World Health Organization recently reiterated the critical importance of alternative infection control strategies. Implications of predictable dynamics extend beyond improved targeting for future surveillance and highlight a potential novel strategy of temporally optimized patient isolation to reduce transmission of resistant pathogens. Future work will explore alternative data sources beyond published research (e.g. hospital records) to investigate the generalizability of the new methods and results presented here to other pathogen-drug class combinations.

### Resistance decay in individuals after antibiotic exposure in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GbDWA]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and penicillin exposure were studied in only one controlled study with 35 participants. Before exposure to penicillin, resistance was not significantly different between the group of patients subsequently exposed and those not exposed (OR 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5–15.3). After exposure, the OR of resistance in those exposed was 9.4 (95% CI 0.6–149.3). After three months, there was no longer a significant difference in resistance (OR 0.4, CI 0.02–9.8).

- **Prospective cohort studies**: More data were obtained from prospective repeated measures cohort studies that compared resistance rates before antibiotic exposure (baseline data) and after penicillin exposure after one week (0 to 7 days; six studies, 1060 participants, and eight antibiotic exposure groups) and after one month (> 1 week to ≤ 1 month; four studies, 772 participants, and five antibiotic exposure groups). After one week, resistance had increased significantly (OR 4.2, 95% CI 3.3–5.4). Thereafter, resistance had reduced after one month (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.1).

- **Randomized controlled trial on amoxicillin**: One RCT investigated reported resistance in isolates (rather than individuals) after exposure to amoxicillin, and its data were analyzed separately. It found that the changes in resistance following amoxicillin exposure were short-lived, returning to normal by one month after the end of treatment.

- **S. pneumoniae and cephalosporin exposure**: There were no RCTs. Four cohort studies (519 participants and eight different antibiotic exposure groups) reported that resistance had increased at one week after exposure (OR 2.2).

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (MSSA coverage), the ATS/IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend considering administering antibiotics with activity against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem, or meropenem, for the initial empiric treatment of patients with HAP who have no risk factors for MRSA infection and are not at high risk of mortality.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^1156eu3L]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

The data extraction was conducted by M. G. and L. F.-K. using an Excel spreadsheet; in cases of discrepancies, L. Y. was consulted. The following items were extracted from the studies: authors and year of publication; patient characteristics (e.g. symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, age, proportion of females); study characteristics (e.g. study design, recruitment location, duration of study/follow-up); antibiotic exposure (e.g. antibiotic class, duration of antibiotic therapy); and bacterial infection (e.g. type of bacteria, number of antibiotic-resistant isolates at different time points).

Some studies reported their case counts relative to the total included patients (pathogen carriers and noncarriers) and others to the respective pathogen carriers. Here, only data from participants carrying pathogens were retained to describe the burden of resistance among those with infections. In addition, some studies provided data for resistance against multiple antibiotic classes after treatment, but only studies reporting resistance to the treatment antibiotic (so-called primary resistance) were retained.

All antibiotic drugs were classified according to their respective chemical structures. Combined treatments were classified by their active agent in case of an antibiotic and nonantibiotic combination (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate classified as β-lactam). An antibiotic combination was treated as its own class. Studies that were randomized by design but had data extracted from each arm separately were reclassified as prospective repeated-measures cohort studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) is recommended for outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Antimicrobial-drug use and changes in resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae [^112AuHia]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antimicrobial drugs is increasing. To investigate the relationship between antimicrobial use and susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolates at 24 U.S. medical centers, we obtained data on outpatient antimicrobial-drug use for the regions surrounding 23 of these centers. We found an association between decreased penicillin susceptibility and the use of beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs.

### β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: A dose-response meta-analysis [^112aT6f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Patient exposure to antibiotics promotes the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. The aim of this study was to identify whether the temporal dynamics of resistance emergence at the individual-patient level were predictable for specific pathogen-drug classes.

- **Methods**: Following a systematic review, a novel robust error meta-regression method for dose-response meta-analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for carrying resistant bacteria during and following treatment compared to baseline. Probability density functions fitted to the resulting dose-response curves were then used to optimize the period during and/or after treatment when resistant pathogens were most likely to be identified.

- **Results**: Studies of Streptococcus pneumoniae treatment with β-lactam antibiotics demonstrated a peak in resistance prevalence among patients 4 days after completing treatment, with a 3.32-fold increase in odds (95% confidence interval, 1.71–6.46). Resistance waned more gradually than it emerged, returning to preexposure levels 1 month after treatment (OR, 0.98 [95% CI, .55–1.75]). Patient isolation during the peak dose-response period would be expected to reduce the risk that a transmitted pathogen is resistant, equivalently to a 50% longer isolation window timed from the first day of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Predictable temporal dynamics of resistance levels have implications both for surveillance and control.

### Hospital-reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin [^116AkGd4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Geographic variation in drug susceptibility among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae has influenced national treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Whether individual hospital susceptibility data provide reliable and valid information for providers is unclear. We examined the geographic and temporal variability in hospital-reported rates of pneumococcal susceptibility. We surveyed all 52 hospitals that provided acute adult care in the five counties surrounding Philadelphia and collected data on levels of penicillin susceptibility among all pneumococcal blood isolates from 1998 to 2000.

In 1998, pneumococcal nonsusceptibility to penicillin varied from 0% to 67% of all blood isolates across the 33 hospitals with more than ten isolates in that year. Hospital location did not correlate with the level of reported pneumococcal susceptibility (p = 0.8). In addition, correlations were not significant in reported pneumococcal susceptibility to penicillin within individual hospitals during the three years.

### Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia due to vaccine serotypes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112vDCmJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the most commonly implicated bacterial pathogen, and the spectrum of pneumococcal disease ranges from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage through localized infections to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), although non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common manifestation. The Global Burden of Diseases Study estimated that in 2016 pneumococcal lower respiratory infections caused around 1.2 million deaths worldwide and 197 million episodes. The burden of pneumococcal disease follows a U-shaped curve, with the greatest incidence and mortality in young children under 5 and older adults aged 65 and above.

With 100 documented pneumococcal serotypes, which vary in their disease severity, invasiveness, and antimicrobial susceptibility, pneumococcal disease is at least partially vaccine-preventable. Many countries have established infant immunization programs against pneumococcal disease, most using either a 13-valent or 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). The introduction of childhood PCV immunization has been associated with a reduction of overall and serotype-specific IPD in young children. Furthermore, infant PCV immunization reduces nasopharyngeal carriage in those who are vaccinated, thus preventing onward transmission to unvaccinated children and adults, and has resulted in reductions in both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia across all ages.
