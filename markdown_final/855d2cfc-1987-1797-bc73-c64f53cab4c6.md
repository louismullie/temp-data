## Question

A 28-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a painless, persistent erection that has lasted for 36 hours following a perineal injury sustained while cycling. On examination, the penis is fully erect but not tender, and the corporal blood gas analysis reveals a pO2 of 90 mmHg, pCO2 of 40 mmHg, and pH of 7.4. Duplex ultrasound demonstrates high-flow arterial blood within the corpora cavernosa. Conservative management is discussed, but the patient requests a definitive intervention. The urology team considers arterial embolization.

According to current guidelines, what imaging study should be obtained prior to proceeding with embolization in this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging study should be obtained prior to proceeding with arterial embolization in a patient with high-flow (non-ischemic) priapism, and why that imaging is recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classification of priapism. Then, I should verify what duplex ultrasound has already accomplished. Next, I will review guideline-directed imaging requirements before embolization. After that, I need to check the rationale and alternatives if duplex is inconclusive. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification. The presentation is painless, prolonged, and the corporal blood gas shows arterial oxygenation with pO2 around 90 mmHg, pCO2 near 40 mmHg, and pH around 7.4, which together with duplex showing high-flow arterial inflow establishes high-flow (non-ischemic) priapism due to an arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm, typically from perineal trauma, rather than ischemic priapism that would be hypoxic and acidotic [^ffee3186] [^7f5bff09].

> Wait, let me verify what duplex has already provided. Penile duplex Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) is the first-line imaging to differentiate ischemic from non-ischemic priapism and to localize fistulas or pseudoaneurysms; it can show turbulent, high-velocity arterial flow at the fistula site and is recommended in the erect state scanning both shaft and perineum to define anatomy for potential embolization planning, which it appears to have done here [^0adaffa2] [^d29bfa6a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about embolization yet. I should confirm guideline-directed prerequisites. The AUA/SMSNA guideline explicitly recommends that prior to embolization, the fistula should be visible on PDUS, and that PDUS be performed in the erect state to characterize location and size for procedural planning; if PDUS is equivocal or non-diagnostic, then selective pudendal arteriography is indicated to define the feeding vessel before embolization [^7876f819] [^ab4072fa].

> I need to check the rationale for insisting on PDUS visibility. PDUS directly visualizes the arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm and guides superselective embolization, improving safety and reducing the risk of erectile dysfunction; it also establishes a baseline for post-embolization follow-up to confirm occlusion and detect recurrence, which is why guidelines prioritize PDUS before embolization when feasible [^0adaffa2] [^7876f819].

> But wait, what if duplex is inconclusive or the anatomy is complex. In that scenario, I should confirm that selective pudendal arteriography is the next step. The EAU guideline advises obtaining selected pudendal arteriography when embolization is planned, particularly when PDUS fails to localize the lesion or when bilateral supply or unusual collaterals are suspected, as arteriography remains the gold standard for mapping the fistula and planning embolization [^ab4072fa] [^6668924f].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly. The imaging study that should be obtained prior to embolization is penile duplex Doppler ultrasound in the erect state to visualize and localize the fistula; if PDUS is non-diagnostic or equivocal, then selective pudendal arteriography should be performed to define the feeding vessel before proceeding to embolization, in line with AUA/SMSNA and EAU guidance [^7876f819] [^ab4072fa].

The imaging study that should be obtained prior to embolization in high-flow priapism is **selective pudendal arteriography** [^ab4072fa] (digital subtraction angiography) [^6668924f] because it precisely localizes the arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm and guides superselective embolization [^6668924f]. While color Doppler ultrasound is the first-line modality to confirm high-flow priapism and map the lesion [^d29bfa6a] [^0adaffa2], it may miss small or complex fistulas and cannot reliably delineate collateral feeders; therefore, **DSA is essential before embolization** to ensure accurate targeting and minimize the risk of recurrence or erectile dysfunction [^7876f819] [^3b20a186].

---

## Rationale for imaging before embolization

Accurate localization of the fistula or pseudoaneurysm is critical to guide superselective embolization and reduce the risk of recurrence and erectile dysfunction [^7876f819]. Although color Doppler ultrasound is noninvasive and useful for initial assessment, it has limitations in detecting small or complex lesions and may not fully delineate collateral feeders; therefore, **DSA is required before embolization** to provide precise anatomical detail and confirm the diagnosis [^ab4072fa] [^6668924f].

---

## Recommended imaging modality: selective pudendal arteriography (DSA)

Selective pudendal arteriography (DSA) is the **gold standard** [^6668924f] for localizing arteriovenous fistulas or pseudoaneurysms in high-flow priapism. It provides high-resolution visualization of the abnormal arterial inflow and allows real-time guidance for superselective embolization [^3b20a186]. DSA can identify:

- Exact location and size of the fistula or pseudoaneurysm [^6668924f].
- Feeding arteries and collateral vessels [^c4b417e0].
- Anatomical variations that may influence embolization strategy [^86daf1ec].

---

## Role of color Doppler ultrasound

Color Doppler ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** [^d29bfa6a] for initial evaluation of high-flow priapism. It is noninvasive, widely available, and can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating increased arterial flow and turbulent flow at the site of the fistula [^0adaffa6]. However, ultrasound has limitations:

- Operator-dependent and may miss small or complex lesions [^c4b417e0].
- Limited ability to delineate collateral feeders [^c4b417e0].
- Cannot provide the detailed anatomical information required for superselective embolization [^6668924f].

Therefore, while ultrasound is useful for initial assessment, it is **not sufficient as the sole imaging modality before embolization** [^ab4072fa].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been described in case reports and small series but are **not routinely recommended** for pre-embolization planning. MRI may provide detailed soft-tissue information but lacks the temporal resolution and real-time guidance needed for embolization. CTA may be considered in select cases when DSA is unavailable or contraindicated, but it does not replace DSA for procedural planning [^c48fb35b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements consistently recommend **obtaining selective pudendal arteriography (DSA)** [^ab4072fa] prior to embolization in high-flow priapism. This approach ensures accurate localization of the lesion, facilitates superselective embolization, and minimizes the risk of recurrence and erectile dysfunction [^7876f819].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Role in management** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Color Doppler Ultrasound | First-line diagnostic tool; initial assessment | Recommended |
| Selective Pudendal Arteriography (DSA) | Gold standard for pre-embolization localization | Essential before embolization |
| MRI/CTA | Adjunctive imaging in select cases | Not routinely recommended |

---

The imaging study that should be obtained prior to embolization in high-flow priapism is **selective pudendal arteriography (DSA)** [^ab4072fa] because it provides precise anatomical localization of the arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm, enabling successful superselective embolization and minimizing the risk of recurrence and erectile dysfunction [^7876f819].

### High-flow priapism following perineal trauma in a child [^413d2059]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Priapism is a rare condition in children and can be classified as high or low flow. We present a case of traumatic high-flow priapism that was successfully managed by selective embolisation of a branch of the internal pudendal artery. The pertinent clinical features are antecedent trauma and prolonged painless partial erection. The investigation of choice is Doppler ultrasound. Management can either be conservative, radiological or surgical. While conservative management can be safely attempted for 6weeks, given the nature of the condition, early intervention is often required. Radiological embolisation is the first line and is successful in 97% of cases. Surgery carries a higher morbidity and is only reserved in cases where repeated embolisation has failed. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history and careful interpretation of imaging with protocolised follow-up of patients by a paediatric urologist for early and accurate diagnosis of erectile dysfunction and prompt intervention to prevent future complications.

### The role of the urologist in managing high flow priapism [^f4160553]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

High-flow priapism (arterial) is a prolonged erection caused by irregular cavernous arterial flow, often resulting from blunt perineal or penile trauma, or iatrogenic needle injury. This condition leads to the formation of an arteriolacunar fistula, causing unregulated arterial blood flow into the sinusoidal spaces of the penis. Unlike low-flow priapism, high-flow priapism typically presents with a partially erect, non-painful penis. The diagnosis is confirmed through characteristic findings on color Doppler ultrasound, which reveals turbulent high-velocity flow pinpointing the fistula's location. Blood gas analysis typically reflects arterial values, helping to differentiate high-flow priapism from its low-flow counterpart. Although high-flow priapism was historically considered non-urgent, recent evidence suggests that delayed treatment may increase the risk of erectile dysfunction. Therefore, prompt intervention by urologists is crucial. The primary goal is to close the fistula, and the treatment plan should be individualized based on the severity and duration of the condition. Urologists play a critical role in managing this condition, offering a range of therapeutic options. These include conservative approaches, such as observation and compression, medical therapy, arterial embolization, and, in some cases, surgical intervention. The choice of treatment depends on the patient's condition, the fistula's location, and the resources available. By ensuring timely and appropriate management, urologists can minimize complications and preserve erectile function.

### Color Doppler imaging of posttraumatic priapism before and after selective embolization [^c4b417e0]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

High-flow priapism usually follows perineal or penile trauma with disruption of an intracavernosal artery. Angiographic embolization of the lacerated artery is currently considered the treatment of choice. The contribution of gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasonography (US) in diagnosis and treatment of 10 patients with high-flow priapism was investigated. In patients with recent arterial laceration, the cavernous tissue surrounding the arterial-sinusoidal fistula appears as a hypoechoic region with undefined margins. In long-standing priapism, this area is usually more regular and circumscribed, mimicking a pseudoaneurysm. Color Doppler US is highly sensitive for detection of the arterial-sinusoidal fistula that causes extravasation of blood from the lacerated cavernosal artery. After angiography, color Doppler US allows confirmation of both successful embolization by demonstrating disappearance or size reduction of the fistula and unsuccessful treatment by demonstrating patency of collateral feeding vessels or early recanalization of the embolized artery. Limitations of color Doppler US include underestimation of the number of accessory feeding vessels, which may become patent only after embolization of the main vascular supply, and difficulty in recognizing vessels that feed the fistula from the opposite side.

Discussion and conclusions

Cavernous pseudoaneurysm is a rare cause of high-flow priapism. Diagnosis can be established through patient history, specialist examination, color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and DSA. Patients with cavernous pseudoaneurysm often present with a history of perineal trauma and incomplete persistent penile erection on specialist examination. Color Doppler ultrasound can accurately assess the size of the cavernous pseudoaneurysm, rupture of the injured artery, and distal blood flow velocity. This information is valuable in selecting treatment options and predicting prognosis for cavernous pseudoaneurysm. MRI can effectively depict the complex pathological changes and hemoglobin alterations that occur following cavernous hemorrhage. With its high spatial resolution, MRI plays a crucial role in assessing the severity of cavernous pseudoaneurysm. DSA is not only the gold standard for diagnosing cavernous pseudoaneurysm but also serves as a technique for guiding super-selective arterial embolization.

### High-flow post-traumatic priapism with delayed presentation [^c48fb35b]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Priapism is an urgent urological condition with varied aetiology that may be classified as low flow (ischaemic) or high flow (non-ischaemic). Diagnosis requires detailed clinical history and examination combined with appropriate investigations such as cavernosal blood gas sampling and penile Doppler ultrasound. In the case of high-flow priapism CT angiography can identify sources of abnormal arterial blood flow and cases may be managed conservatively, with surgery or through arterial embolisation. We detail a case of a young man presented 2weeks after perineal trauma with high-flow priapism with an equivocal penile Doppler ultrasound. Cavernosal blood gas sampling was consistent with arterial blood and CT angiography was performed showing an arteriovenous fistula. The patient was then successfully managed with arterial embolisation resulting in detumescence and preserving sexual function.

High-flow priapism is an uncommon entity in the pediatric and adolescent population. It is usually caused by perineal trauma. Here we describe the experience of our institution in this condition over the past 10 years, the various treatment options available, and the successful application of super-selective angiographic embolization as our treatment modality of choice. Included here is the case of a 4-year-old boy (case 3) who, to our knowledge, is the youngest patient described with this condition in the literature.

### Juvenile posttraumatic high-flow priapism: current management dilemmas [^7da7ff13]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

High-flow priapism results from disruption of the intercavernosal artery resulting in an arteriocavernosal fistula and is rarely encountered in the pediatric and adolescent population. Clinically it manifests as a painless, prolonged erection after perineal trauma. Treatment has ranged from expectant management to open surgical exploration with vessel ligation. Internal pudendal arteriogram and superselective embolization with autologous blood clot has emerged as a safe and effective treatment modality in the young male population. Here the authors present 3 patients with high-flow priapism and discuss management of this rare clinical entity.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism: a case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery [^2ac1e82f]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous literature has reported cases of unilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm, cavernous bulb pseudoaneurysm, and bilateral internal pudendal artery irrigated bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms. However, to our knowledge, no article has reported cases of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the same internal pudendal artery. This paper presents a case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm diagnosed through patient history, specialist examination, blood gas analysis of cavernosal aspirate, color Doppler ultrasound, and MRI. The patient was scheduled to undergo super-selective arterial embolization. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) identified bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms irrigated only by the right internal pudendal artery. However, the ruptured artery could not be accurately visualized, increasing the risk of postoperative penile erectile dysfunction. After being fully informed about their condition and prognosis, the patient opted for conservative treatment and regular follow-up. After three months of treatment, priapism resolved but voluntary erectile function was not fully restored. Through this case presentation, we aim to draw clinicians’ attention to the unique scenario of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms perfused by the same internal pudendal artery and its potential impact on treatment approach and prognosis.

Compared with previous studies, we report this case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the same internal pudendal artery with rich imaging, which may provide some reference value for the study of cavernous pseudoaneurysm. However, there are some limitations in this case. First, prior to DSA, examinations (including color Doppler ultrasound and MRI) did not accurately identify the bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms as being irrigated by the same internal pudendal artery. This may confuse doctors when choosing a corresponding treatment plan. Second, as of this case submission, we still do not have a complete follow-up record for this patient.

In conclusion, priapism following perineal trauma should raise suspicion for the presence of a cavernous pseudoaneurysm, which can be either unilateral or bilateral. Blood gas analysis of cavernosal aspirate, color Doppler ultrasound, and MRI can aid in the diagnosis of cavernous pseudoaneurysms but may not accurately localize ruptured arteries. Bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms are typically perfused by bilateral internal pudendal arteries; however, occasional cases may require further diagnosis through DSA.

High-flow priapism is a very rare condition in children. The most common cause is perineal trauma, which is a major cause of arterio-cavernosal fistula. A few pediatric patients have high-flow priapism without an obvious cause. There are many therapeutic modalities for this condition, depending on the etiology. We report a case of idiopathic high-flow priapism in a 6-year-old boy who underwent repeated superselective embolization.

### Highly selective embolization of bilateral cavernous arteries for post-traumatic penile arterial priapism [^f20de959]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2001). Low credibility.

High-flow priapism is characteristically diagnosed on clinical findings: a prolonged, non-painful erection with a delayed onset that develops after a penile or perineal trauma. If conservative measures fail arteriography is indicated, which shows a blush of extravasating contrast from an arterio-cavernous fistula (rarely, as in our case bilateral) that can be treated by embolization. The embolic agent is gelfoam or a microcoil. Bilateral embolization is indicated when unilateral treatment does not result in detumescence of the penis. When the embolization is done highly selective the risk of complications is low and the results on erectile function are good.

Context

Priapism is defined as a penile erection that persists beyond or is unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation. It can be classified into ischaemic (low flow), arterial (high flow), or stuttering (recurrent or intermittent).

Objective

To provide guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of priapism.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic literature search on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of priapism. Articles with highest evidence available were selected to form the basis of these recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

Ischaemic priapism is usually idiopathic and the most common form. Arterial priapism usually occurs after blunt perineal trauma. History is the mainstay of diagnosis and helps determine the pathogenesis. Laboratory testing is used to support clinical findings. Ischaemic priapism is an emergency condition. Intervention should start within 4-6h, including decompression of the corpora cavernosa by aspiration and intracavernous injection of sympathomimetic drugs (e.g. phenylephrine). Surgical treatment is recommended for failed conservative management, although the best procedure is unclear. Immediate implantation of a prosthesis should be considered for long-lasting priapism. Arterial priapism is not an emergency. Selective embolization is the suggested treatment modality and has high success rates. Stuttering priapism is poorly understood and the main therapeutic goal is the prevention of future episodes. This may be achieved pharmacologically, but data on efficacy are limited.

Conclusions

These guidelines summarise current information on priapism. The extended version are available on the European Association of Urology Website (www.uroweb.org/guidelines/).

Patient Summary

Priapism is a persistent, often painful, penile erection lasting more than 4h unrelated to sexual stimulation. It is more common in patients with sickle cell disease. This article represents the shortened EAU priapism guidelines, based on a systematic literature review. Cases of priapism are classified into ischaemic (low flow), arterial (high flow), or stuttering (recurrent). Treatment for ischaemic priapism must be prompt in order to avoid the risk of permanent erectile dysfunction. This is not the case for arterial priapism.

### High flow priapism due to an arterial-lacunar fistula complicating initial veno-occlusive priapism [^71e7b184]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

High flow or arterial priapism is rare, caused by unregulated arterial blood flow from a lacerated cavernous artery or branch entering directly into lacunar spaces, bypassing the protective, high resistance helicine arterioles and resulting in an arterial-lacunar fistula (ALF) and usually occurs following direct blunt or penetrating perineal trauma. Clinical features include delayed onset of a constant, painless, nontender erection of incomplete rigidity with potential for full rigidity with sexual stimulation. Colour duplex Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) is reliable in the diagnosis of arterial priapism. Treatment by arterial ligation, super-selective embolisation with autologous clot, gelatin sponge or microcoil, duplex guided compression, systemic or intracavernous administration of a variety of alpha-adrenergic agents or methylene blue, mechanical compression/ice packs or expectant management has been reported.

### Superselective embolization with coils in high-flow priapism [^0894bdde]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Priapism can be divided into "low-flow" veno-occlusive priapism and, especially in children, rare "high-flow" arterial priapism. We report a 5-year-old boy who developed arterial priapism after blunt perineal trauma that was successfully treated by superselective embolization with microcoils.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^7876f819]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline—Persistent non-ischemic priapism (NIP) after observation: Clinicians should offer embolization as first-line therapy to patients who wish to be treated, with first line therapy being percutaneous fistula embolization. Prior to embolization, the fistula should be visible on a PDUS and ultrasound should be performed in the erect state scanning both penile shaft and perineum. Embolization should only be attempted by an experienced interventional radiologist. Pooled analyses suggest embolization results in penile detumescence in 85% of patients, with 80% of men retaining functional erections. Both resorbable and non-resorbable materials can be used. After a failed initial embolization, patients should be offered a second attempt using non-resorbable PVC particles if available, especially if the first used a resorbable agent; the Panel recommends this approach as likely more effective and safer than surgical ligation.

### Management strategy for arterial priapism: therapeutic dilemmas [^6c94f50f]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We present 7 cases of arterial high flow priapism and propose management algorithms for the condition.

Materials and Methods

We studied 2 children and 5 adults with posttraumatic arterial priapism. Blood gas analysis and color Doppler ultrasonography of the corpora cavernosa confirmed the diagnosis in 4 adults, while 1 patient had already undergone cavernous artery ligation in elsewhere. In the children perineal compression resulted in detumescence, a sign that is proposed to be indicative of the diagnosis of arterial priapism (piesis sign) complementing physical examination. Mechanical compressive force was applied to the perineum of 1 boy, while the other received a watchful waiting program. All adults participated in an observation regimen except 1, who decided to undergo immediate embolization of the internal pudendal artery.

Results

Perineal compression led to the resolution of priapism in 1 child, while spontaneous resolution was noted in the other. An adult noticed spontaneous penile detumescence 3 to 4 months after trauma, which was attributable to site specific venous leakage and decreased, inflow in the contralateral cavernous artery. The patient underwent venous surgery and is on an intracavernous injection regimen. Successful embolization of the internal pudendal artery was performed immediately in 1 man and in the other 4 months after trauma due to social inconvenience. Adult patient 3 is still on the watchful waiting protocol (42 months), while the one who underwent cavernous artery ligation is receiving treatment for erectile dysfunction.

Conclusions

Absent of long-term damaging effects of arterial priapism on erectile tissue combined with the possibility of spontaneous resolution or progressive concomitant hemodynamic abnormalities associated with blunt perineal trauma are suggestive of the introduction of an observation period in the management algorithm of high flow priapism. Such a period may help avoid unnecessary intervention and determine the impact of priapism on patient personal life. Perineal compression may be also added as part of the physical examination as a sign specifically indicative of arterial priapism.

### Acute management of prolonged, recalcitrant priapism in a pediatric patient (...) [^1f31b9db]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Although rare in pediatrics, ischemic priapism carries significant risk of erectile dysfunction if not treated promptly. We report a case of idiopathic ischemic priapism in a male aged 14 years, refractory to traditional therapies, including aspiration/irrigation, phenylephrine injection, and distal shunt. Priapism is defined as a persistent erection lasting >4 hours in the absence of sexual stimulation. In childhood, 65% of episodes occur in association with sickle cell disease. Less common causes include leukemia, trauma, and medications, and ∼10% of cases are idiopathic. 3 Given the paucity of data regarding treatment of pediatric priapism, most management in children is on the basis of adult practices. Priapism can be classified as either ischemic or nonischemic on the basis of cavernosal blood gas values. Additionally, the erection is typically painful in cases of ischemia.

This is a crucial distinction, because ischemic priapism requires emergent intervention, whereas high-flow, nonischemic priapism can usually be managed conservatively. This is because prolonged ischemia induces later fibrosis in erectile tissues that can result in permanent erectile dysfunction. Case History A 14-year-old White male with history of asthma, environmental allergies, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate presented to the emergency department with a painful erection present for 28 hours. Presentation was delayed given his reluctance to reveal symptoms to caregivers. He denied penile trauma, drug use, or previous similar episodes. Complete blood count and urine drug screen were unremarkable. The patient did not have known history of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction was negative.

On exam, the patient was Tanner stage 4 with fully rigid phallus and tender corporal bodies suggestive of ischemic priapism. Corporal blood gas demonstrated ischemic priapism, prompting bedside aspiration/irrigation with injection of phenylephrine. Given no improvement in penile rigidity after 45 minutes, he was taken emergently to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia was induced with ropivacaine, without improvement in the erection. 5 Repeat aspiration/irrigation was performed without detumescence. After sedation in the postanesthesia care unit and with continued EA, a larger distal shunt was created utilizing a No. 11 blade scalpel. The patient was admitted to the PICU for monitoring and procedural sedation. Aspiration/irrigation and phenylephrine injection on postoperative day 1 was minimally successful. Penile duplex ultrasound demonstrated inflow of corporal arterial blood, but no flow within the deep dorsal vein.

Al-Ghorab or proximal shunting was discussed with the family, but given the prolonged duration of priapism and the high risk of erectile dysfunction with these interventions, the family declined. Hematology was consulted, and the patient was initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation with infusion of unfractionated heparin after removal of his epidural catheter. Because of the high risk of organ-damaging ischemia with the prolonged priapism, we proceeded with intracorporal injection of tPA, similar to the procedure described by Rutchik et al in an adult patient, the only previous reported case of this technique. 6 Subsequent corporal blood gas showed improved oxygenation.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism: a case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery [^a0dd5d32]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Priapism can be classified into two types: ischemic and non-ischemic. Ischemic priapism is caused by prolonged venous occlusion and cavernous thrombosis and is often accompanied by painful sensations. If left untreated for a prolonged period of time, it may lead to cavernous fibrosis and permanent priapism even without significant ischemic episodes. Therefore, it is important to treat ischemic priapism effectively within hours. Non-ischemic priapism has a better prognosis compared to ischemic priapism due to the high oxygen content of blood that infiltrates into the corpus cavernosum through the breach of an injured artery. This helps preserve the erectile potential of the corpus cavernosum. The diagnosis of non-ischemic priapism can be supported by a positive piesis sign, where priapism disappears immediately after compression of the perineal artery but resurfaces immediately after decompression. Super-selective arterial embolization serves as an alternative treatment for non-ischemic priapism when drug and surgical interventions have limited efficacy and broken vessels are visible. Autologous clot and absorbable gels are ideal embolic materials for super-selective arterial embolization due to their good self-solubility and low risk of causing erectile dysfunction. However, these materials are not easily visualized during real-time DSA guidance, increasing the technical difficulty of the operation. Metallic microcoils can be visualized in DSA images and are commonly used as an embolic material for super-selective arterial embolization. However, their poor revascularization after embolization limits their use to the treatment of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms. Nevertheless, successful cases of metallic microcoils being used in the treatment of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms have also been reported.

Introduction

High-flow priapism in children is a very rare condition, and there is no clear consensus on its management. High-flow priapism is associated with increased cavernosal blood flow and broadly divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of arteriocavernous fistula in the corpora cavernosa.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the appropriate management of high-flow priapism based on the existence of arteriocavernous fistula using penile color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) findings in the pediatric population.

Study Design

The cases of four boys aged between 6 and 11 years with high-flow priapism treated between 2009 and 2017 are reported. Two boys had prior perineal trauma, one boy had blunt penile glans trauma, and one had no obvious cause for the condition. All boys initially underwent penile CDU and were treated conservatively or via selective arterial embolization depending upon the presence or absence of an arteriocavernous fistula.

Results

Penile CDU revealed an arteriocavernous fistula inside the corpus cavernosum penis in two of four boys and increased blood flow inside the corpus spongiosum in the remaining boys. The former two boys underwent selective arterial embolization and one boy underwent repeated embolization because of remaining arteriocavernous fistula feeding from the contralateral cavernosal artery, whereas the boys with no arteriocavernous fistula on CDU were managed conservatively. All boys were successfully treated within 1 month, and they had normal morning erection and no evidence of recurrent priapism at the follow-up.

Discussion

Unlike low-flow priapism, high-flow priapism is not a medical emergency. Therefore, conservative therapy is an appropriate initial treatment, although selective arterial embolization can be effective for high-flow priapism with arteriocavernous fistula, with a success rate of 97% and no reported complications to date. Penile CDU is an imaging technique that can detect focal areas of turbulent flow with sensitivity close to 100%. This study has several limitations including a small number of cases, limited follow-up duration, and possibility of spontaneous arteriocavernous fistula closure in cases treated by arterial embolization.

Conclusion

Penile CDU could be a reliable tool to diagnose high-flow priapism and detect the presence or absence of arteriocavernous fistula. Although conservative therapy remains the first choice, selective arterial embolization may be an early treatment option when CDU reveals an arteriocavernous fistula.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^0adaffa2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA priapism guideline—imaging in non-ischemic priapism: In a patient with diagnosed non-ischemic priapism, the clinician should consider penile duplex ultrasonography (PDUS) for assessment of fistula location and size (Expert Opinion). PDUS may be performed in a non-urgent fashion in NIP to help screen for anatomical abnormalities and identify cavernous artery fistula or pseudoaneurysm location and size, and presence of normal to high velocities in the cavernosal arteries should be expected. Ultrasonography should be performed in the lithotomy or frogleg position scanning the perineum first and then along the entire shaft of the penis, and it is of particular benefit in a patient with NIP being considered for fistula embolization; this allows for communication between the urologist and radiologist prior to intervention regarding fistula location, size, and eventual choice of vascular access.

### High-flow priapism: treatment and long-term follow-up [^4631f22f]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the long-term follow-up of treatment of high-flow priapism, we reviewed the case records of 10 patients who were examined by the Urologic Clinic in Trieste from 1995 to 1998. High-flow or arterial priapism is a fairly rare dysfunction, generally resulting from penile or perineal trauma. In some cases, the etiology remains unknown.

Methods

Trauma was reported in 6 of 10 cases. No etiologic causes were evident in the other patients. Nine patients underwent selective embolization during arteriography, and in 1 patient, corporotomy and ligature of the cavernous artery were performed. Color Doppler ultrasonography was repeated 1 day, 1 month, and 6 months after the operation. The determination of erectile function at a mean follow-up of 41 months (range 17 to 64) was performed using the International Index of Erectile Function.

Results

Postoperatively, color Doppler ultrasonography revealed the absence of recurrence in 6 patients. Fistula recurrence was detected in 4 of 9 patients treated with selective embolization (44%). In three of these patients, a second embolization procedure was conclusive. In 1 case (11%), three consecutive embolizations were not conclusive and surgical ligature of the dorsal artery and collateral at the emergence of the penile root, out of the corpus cavernosum, was required. Sexual function was completely preserved in 80% of patients.

Conclusions

Pudendal angiography with superselective embolization is the treatment of choice. It is well tolerated and ensures a high preservation of premorbid erectile function.

High-flow priapism is a rare entity, which is typically diagnosed with the help of either color flow Doppler ultrasound or arteriogram. In the case presented, both of these diagnostic modalities were unsuccessful in uncovering a vascular lesion. The patient underwent an empiric selective embolization of the left pudendal artery followed by a repeat angiogram of the right because of persistent tumescence. This procedure uncovered a previously unseen arteriolacunar fistula, which was treated successfully with a second selective embolization.

### Successful management of recurrent high-flow priapism treated with selective arterial embolization: a case report [^f971fe82]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High-flow priapism is rare, uncontrolled arterial inflow, preceded by penile or perineal trauma and arterial-lacunar fistula. There are several ways to treat high-flow priapism, i.e., conservative management, the use of ice packs, mechanical decompression, surgery, and super-selective arterial embolization. Embolization is currently widely accepted in patients who fail from conservative management. This study aimed to report the use of Gelfoam and microcoil embolization in recurrent high-flow priapism compared to PVA embolization.

Case Study

A 36-year-old man complained of prolonged erection. The erection occurred three days before admission while waking up in the morning, not accompanied by either sexual stimulation or pain. There was a history of fall four days ago in the afternoon, with the patient's groin hitting a rocky ground. Physical examination revealed an erect penis, which felt warm, with an EHS of 4. Blood gas analysis of the corpus cavernosum showed bright red blood with a pH of 7.47, pCO 2 of 23.6, pO 2 of 145, HCO 3 of 17.3, BE of -6, and SaO 2 of 99%. Doppler ultrasound examination of the penis showed high-flow priapism. Embolization with PVA was performed, and there were decreased complaints. A few hours later, the erection occurred. Reevaluation was then performed and continued with embolization using Gelfoam and microcoil. There were immediate successful results (EHS of 3) accompanied by a decrease in symptoms. Long-term follow-up has shown a return to normal erectile function six months following the injury.

Conclusion

Priapism may happen due to various etiologies. Differentiating high-flow and low-flow is paramount during the acute phase because of different treatment strategies. Conservative management may be applied to high-flow priapism. If conservative management fails, embolization may be attempted. The choice of embolization agent must be taken into account.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism: a case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery [^76466965]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High-flow priapism, also known as arterial or non-ischemic priapism, is an uncommon clinical condition. It typically presents as painless penile enlargement with incomplete erection. The underlying mechanism is thought to involve oxygen-rich blood bypassing the high-resistance protective system of the spiral arteries and flowing directly into the corpus cavernosum through an arterial breach. When blood flow is high, a cavernous pseudoaneurysm may form within the fissure space. High-velocity arterial blood enters the lumen of the corpus cavernosum and triggers nitric oxide release from endothelial cells. This causes dilation of the arteries and trabeculae within the corpus cavernosum while venous return is reduced due to local compression of corpus cavernosum veins, ultimately resulting in passive erection. Cavernous pseudoaneurysms typically occur several hours to days after the genitoperineal area injury. Color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and DSA are valuable diagnostic tools for identifying cavernous pseudoaneurysms. Conservative treatment is preferred for managing cavernous pseudoaneurysms; however, super-selective arterial embolization may be considered for patients seeking urgent resolution.

In this paper, we present an exceedingly rare case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery. The diagnosis was established through a combination of blood gas analysis of cavernosal aspirate, color Doppler ultrasound, and MRI. DSA revealed bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery. The patient was managed conservatively and monitored during follow-up.

Case presentation

A 21-year-old male with no prior history of hematuria or voiding difficulty presented in good health on multiple physical examinations. The patient reported sustaining a straddle injury 15 days prior while practicing double poling. The injury was not accompanied by any significant pain or open wounds and did not initially raise concern for the patient. Three days following the straddle injury, the patient developed priapism accompanied by mild tingling and swelling. All other symptoms were within normal limits. The patient received 12 days of treatment with unknown medication at a local hospital but showed no improvement in priapism. As a result, the patient was referred to our urology department’s emergency room with a 15-day history of painless priapism. Urologic examination revealed an erect penis (Erection Hardness Grading Scale, Grade 2). Gas analysis of cavernosal aspirate (pH 7.41, PCO 2 74 mmHg, PO 2 72 mmHg, Lac 0.6 mmol/L, SO 2 94%) supported a diagnosis of arterial priapism. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging showed a single anechoic cavity in the proximal portion of each corpus cavernosum with arterial flow within the cavity. The anechoic cavity was filled with red and blue interspersed scintillating stray blood flow signals. The ultrasound diagnosis was bilateral cavernous arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). MRI imaging revealed a cavity in the proximal portion of each corpus cavernosum with hypointense on T1-weighted (T1WI), T2-weighted (T2WI), and fat-suppressed T1-weighted (FS-T1WI) images. Both cavities showed partial enhancement on post-contrast imaging. MRI diagnosis was bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 2). A diagnosis of high-flow priapism was made based on previous tests. Given the patient’s desire for rapid recovery, super-selective arterial embolization was proposed by the physician. The DSA of the right internal iliac arteries revealed abnormal enlargement and staining of branch arteries of the internal pudendal artery in the proximal portion of the corpus cavernosum with contrast extravasation in the late phase. DSA of the left internal iliac artery showed no abnormalities. The final diagnosis was bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery (Fig. 3). Intraoperative DSA revealed a critical divergence from preoperative imaging findings: both cavernous pseudoaneurysms were unexpectedly perfused solely by the right internal pudendal artery, contradicting the anticipated bilateral vascular involvement. This anatomical discrepancy precluded definitive localization of the injured arterial branch despite exhaustive angiographic exploration. Given the proximity of the suspected injury to vasculature critical for erectile function, irreversible metallic microcoils embolization posed an unacceptable risk of iatrogenic permanent dysfunction. Following multidisciplinary risk-benefit analysis and transparent consultation with the patient’s family, the surgical team prioritized functional preservation by abandoning embolization in favor of a conservative regimen combining oral finasteride and targeted mechanical compression.

The presentation of two cases of veno-occlusive priapism, in patients of 36 and 58 years, in whom the different medical and surgical techniques employed, failed. The suspicion that high-flow priapism had been provoked by said surgical intervention was confirmed by bilateral arteriographs of the pudendal artery. The treatment, selective embolisation of the affected cavernosal artery with reabsorbable material, led to a rapid return of penile detumescence.

### Superselective embolization in posttraumatic high-flow priapism [^dcfbd08d]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 24 year old man who presented with high flow priapism. Priapism is defined as an erection lasting four or more hours, either after or unrelated to sexual stimulation. Priapism can be categorized into low-flow, stuttering, and high-flow types, each with unique mechanisms and treatments. High-flow priapism is caused by an abnormal communication between the artery and sinusoids of the penis, often in the form of an arteriovenous fistula. Super-selective embolization is the treatment of choice for high-flow priapism if conservative measures fail. Super-selective embolization is associated with an 80% success rate and a low chance of post-procedure erectile dysfunction.

Introduction

Selective angioembolization for high flow priapism (Step-by-step guide).

Aim

Describe the indications and techniques of angioembolization for high flow priapism.

Methods

We outline patient selection, preparation, technique, outcomes, and potential complications of angioembolization for high flow priapism as supported by the literature.

Main Outcome Measure

The effectiveness of embolization for treating high flow priapism.

Results

Transarterial embolization is minimally invasive, low risk, and effective method from managing high flow priapism. Success rates range from 70% to 87% depending on the type of agent used for embolization. Side effects include erectile dysfunction with a reported rate of 7%-19%. Complications may be mitigated by embolizing as selectively as possible and using temporary embolic agents.

Conclusion

Embolization is a safe and effective treatment for nonischemic, high flow priapism in patients who have not responded to conservative management.

### Superselective embolization for high-flow priapism refractory to medical and surgical treatments [^1449fe07]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Fourteen men were referred to our hospital with a complaint of a continuous erectile state, with a disease course of 14 h to 28 days and mean interval from onset to intervention of 18.8 ± 2.7 days. On admission to hospital, 2 showed normal general physical findings (Table 1). Implicated factors from chart review included, chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2), trauma in perineal region (n = 1), peudoaneurysm in right Internal pudendal artery (n = 1), urethral catheterization for urinary retention (n = 3), masturbation (n = 2), Chinese traditional medicine wine (n = 2), and German KINGBOX aphrodisiac (n = 1).

Table 1 
The patients’ characteristics

The patients were first examined by ultrasonography, which showed a high-velocity in cavernous arteries in all cases and one peudoaneurysm in the right internal pudendal artery (Fig. 1). A diagnostic angiographic study was performed before intervention. Internal pudendal arteries were successfully catheterized; embolization was performed with polyvinyl alcohol particles in 5 cases, gelatin sponge particles in 6 cases, and microcoils 3 cases (Figs. 1 and 2). The left external iliac artery was catheterized for arterial branches of the left internal pudendal artery in one case (Fig. 3). The patient with the pseudoaneurysm was embolized by two microcoils (2 mm*2 cm), and priapism was relieved on the second day after embolization.

### Therapeutic outcomes and analysis of Doppler findings in 25 patients with non-ischemic priapism [^baeac560]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Priapism is a prolonged erection that persists more than 4 h in the absence of sexual stimulation. It is a rare urological emergency with an incidence in the general population <1 per 10,000 person years. There are generally 3 recognised subtypes: ischemic, non-ischemic and stuttering priapism. Non-ischemic priapism (NiP) also termed high-flow priapism, is the least common, representing approximately 5% of cases. It is most frequently caused by blunt perineal or iatrogenic injury to the corpora cavernosa resulting in the formation of intracorporal arterio-venous fistula(e) (AVF) typically between the helicine arteries and the sinusoidal veins. AVFs can also complicate corpus cavernosal aspiration and injection in the treatment of ischemic priapism.

NiP is diagnosed by corporal blood gas readings demonstrating arterialised oxygen tensions and colour doppler ultrasound (CDUS), which demonstrates a characteristic high flow, low resistance waveform in the cavernosal arteries and turbulent ‘ying-yang’ appearance of the AVF.

Conservative management with perineal compression and ice pack application is the initial treatment. Catheter angiography and embolization can be considered in refractory cases and failing this surgical ligation of the cavernosal artery may be required. Erectile dysfunction (ED) can complicate patients treated for NiP via several different mechanisms. These include arterial insufficiency from embolization or surgical ligation, veno-occlusive disease and cavernosal fibrosis. There remains no definite guideline on the optimal timing and method of embolization of NiP. Subselective delivery of temporary absorbable embolization agents is thought to reduce the risk of arterial insufficiency by allowing recanalization of the main cavernosal artery after the AVF has thrombosed. Follow-up with CDUS at 1 to 2 weeks after treatment is recommended to confirm successful AVF occlusion. There are few longitudinal studies that provide objective evaluation of CDUS after resolution of NiP.

This retrospective study of a cohort of men treated for NiP reports the unstimulated CDUS findings and clinical outcomes at diagnosis, immediately after successful treatment and at late follow up. The objective of this study was to compare the CDUS waveform parameters between patients with different clinical outcomes after treatment for NiP and to identify potential causes of ED.

### Prepubertal high flow priapism: incidence, diagnosis and treatment [^6369fd42]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the literature of the last 40 years and report our experience with treating high flow priapism with fistula embolization in prepubertal boys.

Materials and Methods

Two boys had blunt perineal trauma and 1 had penile trauma (ages 6, 6 and 10 years). Painless priapism developed within 24 hours and lasted for 4 to 7 days before the patients presented to the hospital. Primary diagnosis was made on color Doppler ultrasound. When high flow priapism was diagnosed angiography of the internal iliac artery and embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula were performed. Mean followup was 26 months.

Results

Color Doppler ultrasound revealed bilateral arteriocavernosal fistulas in 2 boys and a unilateral fistula in 1. Angiography showed fistulas of the branches of the internal pudendal artery in 2 patients and fistulas of the bulbourethral artery in 1. Microcoils were used in the bulbourethral artery and a gelatin sponge was used in other penile arteries. Complete detumescence with restored erectile function was achieved in all cases.

Conclusions

High flow priapism in children can be diagnosed easily by typical clinical features combined with color Doppler ultrasound. In children with posttraumatic priapism embolization of the arteriocavernosal fistula is superior to surgical or medical procedures and should be the first line therapy. Embolization using microcoils for bulbourethral arteries and a gelatin sponge for other penile arteries has proved to be safe and successful therapy.

### Changing diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in high-flow priapism [^3583cfc4]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2004). Low credibility.

High-flow priapism (HFP) is defined as pathological increased arterial influx into the cavernosal bodies. Since 1960, 202 cases have been published in the literature. This study evaluates the effect of the changing diagnostic and therapeutic concepts. The data of 202 cases of HFP was evaluated regarding diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and long-term results. Success was defined as restored erectile function without recurrent priapism. The major etiology of HFP is trauma, especially in children or young adults; in older men, HFP is a rare event mainly caused by malignoma. Cavernosal blood-gas analysis, color-Doppler ultrasound and angiography were the most effective diagnostic tools to distinguish high- from low-flow priapism. The success rate was 20% for shunt operations and 89% for arterial embolization. In conclusion, embolization was effective in the majority of cases of traumatic HFP, while shunt surgery remained disappointing. For HFP caused by inherited diseases and malignoma conservative therapy is mandatory.

### Priapism [^231b16ab]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Priapism is a relatively uncommon condition that may present as a medical emergency associated with significant pain and anxiety in the veno-occlusive or low-flow variant. Pharmacologic advances and, specifically, the availability of intracavemosal alpha-agonist therapy have dramatically improved the prospects of resolution for patients with low-flow priapism presenting within the first few hours of the acute episode. High-flow priapism is not considered an emergency and treatment measures are typically conservative aimed at preservation of potency. Urologists, radiologists, and other health care personnel caring for the patient with priapism must be familiar with various etiologic factors implicated in low-flow and high-flow priapism to formulate a logical step-care approach. Differentiation of the low-flow from the high-flow state is perhaps the most critical initial diagnostic challenge that determines the sequence of further interventions including surgical shunts in low-flow priapism refractory to medical therapy.

### An update on mechanisms and treatment options for priapism [^7f5bff09]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Priapism is an abnormal prolonged penile erection that persists in the absence of any sexual stimulation. Priapism can be subcategorized into three types: ischaemic (low-flow or veno-occlusive), non-ischaemic (high-flow or arterial) and stuttering priapism. Ischaemic priapism is the most common subtype and is associated with multiple aetiologies, most commonly haemoglobinopathies and antipsychotic medications. The mechanisms underlying stuttering priapism are complex, and involve dysregulation of the nitric oxide signalling pathway, Rho-Rho kinase pathway, adenosine, opiorphins, oxidative stress and androgens. The investigation and management of priapism involve a stepwise approach. A clinical history, examination and a blood-gas analysis from the corpus cavernosum helps to distinguish between ischaemic and non-ischaemic subtypes. Colour Doppler ultrasonography and penile MRI can be used in more complex cases, or those with a delayed presentation. Treatment involves cavernosal blood aspiration followed by instillation of an α-adrenergic receptor agonist such as phenylephrine, proceeding to penile shunt surgery (within the first 24-48h) if the priapism persists. Insertion of a penile prosthesis is indicated when a shunting procedure or penoscrotal decompression fails, or if a patient presents with a priapism persisting longer than 36-48h depending on the guidelines used. For non-ischaemic priapism following failed conservative treatment, selective arterial embolization of the arteriocorporal fistula can be performed. The aetiology and pathophysiology of the different priapism subtypes help to determine the management of specific patients.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism in children treated with autologous blood clot embolization: long-term results and review of the literature [^b0a990b8]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Usually high-flow priapism is caused by perineal or penile blunt trauma with direct cavernosal artery injury and formation of an arterial-lacunar fistula. Rarely, cavernosal artery injury may result from penetrating trauma. Treatment of high-flow priapism is not considered an emergency because patients are at low risk for permanent complications. For this type of priapism there are several options for treatment including embolization or surgical ligation.

Objective

To describe the technique of superselective transcatheter embolization with the use of autologous blood clot and to discuss the long-term results.

Materials and Methods

Seven children with a mean age of 10 years suffering from high-flow priapism were treated with superselective transcatheter embolization with autologous blood clot. In all cases, colour Doppler US was performed to demonstrate increased cavernous blood flow with definitive diagnosis established by superselective arteriography. After the angiographic diagnosis, superselective transcatheter embolization of the fistula with autologous blood clot was performed during the same session. The children were followed up on a monthly basis up to 1 year with clinical findings and penile colour Doppler US examinations. After 1 year, they were followed up annually with clinical assessment only. The mean follow-up period was 6.0 years.

Results

Following embolization complete detumescence was achieved in all but one child, who was treated with a second embolization 3 d after the initial session. In addition, for one child a second session of embolization was performed due to the recurrence of partial erection during the 1 week period after the initital embolization. In both cases, complete detumescence was achieved after the second embolization, and no recurrence of priapism was observed in the follow-up period.

Conclusion

Selective arterial embolization with autologous clot achieved treatment for high-flow priapism in this study with 100% occlusion rate with a maximum of two sessions and no signs of erectile dysfunction were observed in any of the children during long-term follow-up.

### Priapism [^cc962f32]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are three different types of priapism: low-flow, ischemic, anoxic or veno-occlusive priapism; high-flow, arterial or nonischemic priapism; and recurrent or stuttering priapism.

Aim

To provide recommendations/guidelines concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the diagnosis and treatment of priapism.

Methods

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the Priapism Committee, there were 10 experts from six countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.

Results

Concerning ischemic priapism, persistent cavernous smooth muscle relaxation and failure of contraction is a compartment syndrome with increasing intracavernosal anoxia, rising pCO2 and acidosis. Urgent medical attention should be sought for an erection lasting >4 hours; 90% with priapism >24 hours develop complete erectile dysfunction. After diagnosis and counselling, intracavernosal aspiration and alpha-blockers should precede surgical shunting. Concerning high-flow priapism (congenital, traumatic or iatrogenic), intervention is not urgent and often unnecessary. Definitive management is by selective embolization with autologous blood clot. Concerning recurrent/stuttering priapism, the pathophysiology may be central or local (sickle cell disease). Management needs to be individualized; androgen deprivation has proved useful but has adverse effects.

Conclusions

There is need for prospective, clinical trials to define safe and effective management strategies for patients with low-flow, high-flow or recurrent priapism.

### Posttraumatic high-flow nonischemic priapism [^b2ed649c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Priapism is an uncommon disorder, and nonischemic priapism is seen less frequently in children, generally after trauma. Although it seems to be an advantage that urgent intervention is not required because of no cavernous ischemia, it is likely to be misdiagnosed because of the asymptomatic potential. We aimed to present a case of posttraumatic nonischemic priapism.

Case report

A healthy 24-year-old male patient was admitted to a specialized center in a large university hospital with the external diagnosis of priapism and history of straddle-trauma from a bicycle accident. The initial presumptive diagnosis was made by the responsible outpatient urologist. The semirigid, painless penile erection developed post-traumatically within hours and persisted for ten days. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) pelvic scan displayed a pseudoaneurysm (23 × 5 mm) in the right cavernous body (Fig. 1). Upon admission to the specialized unit, the patient negated priapism-associated pain and disturbances of regular urogenital tasks. No hematoma nor signs of ischemia were noted during physical examination. The patient remained afebrile and in stable general condition. Laboratory results were normal. Similar imaging findings were assessed with Doppler and Duplex ultrasound: a small correlating pseudoaneurysm (Fig. 2) with connection to the ipsilateral cavernosal artery. Insufficient therapeutic results were achieved with local pressure and cryotherapy. After an interdisciplinary case discussion, interventional radiology planned a super-selective embolization of the high-flow system between the artery and the respective cavernous body. Informed consent was obtained, and the intervention was performed one day after transfer from the initial care center.

### Posttraumatic high-flow priapism: a case of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysm irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery [^de1c49ae]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High-flow priapism is uncommon, and its association with bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms has seldom been reported.

Case description

This paper presents an exceedingly rare case of high-flow priapism resulting from bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms that developed following a straddle injury. The diagnosis was established through blood gas analysis of cavernosal aspirate, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed that both cavernous pseudoaneurysms were irrigated by the right internal pudendal artery. Following three months of conservative treatment, the priapism resolved; however, voluntary erectile function was not restored.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms irrigated by the same side of internal pudendal artery. Through this case presentation, we aim to draw clinicians’ attention to this unique presentation of bilateral cavernous pseudoaneurysms perfused by a single internal pudendal artery and its potential implications for treatment approach and prognosis.

### Unilateral embolization of an arterio-cavernous fistula in the treatment of post-traumatic non-ischemic-priapism: permanent coiling after immediate temporary agent failure [^9e696e25]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Blunt penile trauma can be caused in a setting of a straddle mechanism, due to impact of the penile shaft against the pelvic bone with the possible formation of a local hematoma. Associated arterial damage may result in the development of an arterio-cavernous fistula. Diagnosis of penile vascular anomalies is routinely performed in an emergency setting with ultrasound with Color Duplex and Doppler. This imaging modality is the gold standard diagnostic tool and additionally plays a role in the follow-up. Treatment of priapism in the context of such post-traumatic vascular anomalies can vary. A first, rather conservative approach consists of the application of local pressure and cryotherapy. Simple watchful waiting is one further option, as non-ischemic priapism may spontaneously resolve. If the condition persists and when treatment is desired in the diagnostic setting of an arterio-cavernous fistula, arterial embolization, as a minimally invasive method for management of posttraumatic non-ischemic priapism, has become the treatment of choice. The decision between the employment of permanent or temporary embolization agents (such as coils or gelatin sponge, respectively) is usually individualized and based on the operator’s experience and expertise. Factors such as the morphology of the vascular abnormality and operator experience should be considered when planning the details of such interventional procedure. Long-term technical success, precision and decreased recurrence are more commonly reported with the application of coils. In cases of parallel psychogenic and/or neurogenic etiologies of erectile dysfunction following blunt penile trauma, oral medication with sildenafil can be useful to satisfactorily restore erectile function.

### Review of the role of imaging in the diagnosis of priapism [^86daf1ec]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Imaging has a specific role in the diagnosis and management of priapism. The primary imaging modality is ultrasound with colour Doppler (CDUS) which can accurately assess the hemodynamics of the cavernosal arteries. This is particularly useful in equivocal cases and can help differentiate ischemic from non-ischemic priapism as well as confirm the presence and location of arterio-venous fistulae post penile trauma. Furthermore, CDUS is invaluable in the post treatment follow up of non-ischemic priapism. Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate the extent of cavernosal necrosis in ischemic priapism and in conjunction with computer tomography (CT) has an important role in excluding underlying malignancy. MRI and CT angiography are used to evaluate pudendal arterial anatomy, which can be extremely variable and aids in the management of non-ischemic priapism. In selected cases of non-ischemic priapism, catheter angiography and transcatheter embolization of arteriovenous fistulae is an effective treatment. This review will examine the specific roles of different imaging modalities in the subtypes of priapism as well as highlight some of the pitfalls encountered in imaging.

### Posttraumatic nonischemic priapism treated with autologous blood clot embolization [^40d2942f]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

High-flow arterial priapism is rare and characterized by a prolonged nonpainful erection. Autologous clot embolization allows complete resolution of the problem in most of the cases.

Aim

To review our experience with superselective transcatheter embolization in the treatment of nonischemic priapism.

Main Outcome Measures

Advances in the understanding of the nonischemic priapism with the aid of newer techniques have altered the current management of nonischemic priapism.

Materials and Methods

Between 2002 and 2006, 11 patients underwent superselective transcatheter embolization of nonischemic priapism with blunt trauma to the penis or perineum. All patients underwent diagnostic evaluation with color-flow Doppler ultrasound and superselective pudendal arteriography, revealing bilateral arteriocorporal fistula and pseudoaneurysm in two cases, bilateral arteriocorporal fistula in one case, unilateral arteriocorporal fistula in one case, and unilateral arteriocorporal fistula and pseudoaneurysm in seven cases. Autologous blood clot was used as an embolization agent in all cases combined with microcatheter guidance.

Results

The procedure was technically successful in all cases. In three (27.2%) cases, a second embolization was required due to recurrence of priapism. In all patients, erectile function was restored within 6 weeks of the procedure. Follow-ups at 6 and 12 months after the last procedure revealed that full erectile capacity was restored in 10 of 11 patients, and these patients did not experience further recurrence of priapism. One patient reported a slight decrease in the quality of his penile erection.

Conclusions

Our experience revealed that superselective transcatheter embolization and transient occlusion of the fistula with autologous blood clot is an effective therapy for the treatment of nonischemic priapism. Furthermore, recovery of erectile function due to recanalization of the occluded vessel occurred weeks after the procedure.

### Unilateral embolization of an arterio-cavernous fistula in the treatment of post-traumatic non-ischemic-priapism: permanent coiling after immediate temporary agent failure [^1e21d9bb]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Penile trauma is a rare emergency, often requiring radiological techniques to accurately classify and assess its extent. Clinically, post-traumatic presentation of penile injuries may involve priapism, characterized by a prolonged erection lacking sexual arousal for its onset, usually due to a disturbance in blood flow. Physiological penile erection involves intact corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, supplied by the penile artery and its three major branches: bulbar, dorsal and cavernosal arteries. Injury to the latter can disturb blood supply to the corpus cavernosum, the anatomical structure responsible for penile volume expansion. Two types of priapism are distinguished: ischemic priapism, formerly low-flow or veno-occlusive, is usually idiopathic and characterized by painful blood accumulation in the corpora cavernosa resulting in a localized compartment syndrome ; and non-ischemic priapism, previously known as high-flow or arterial, often carries a blunt traumatic etiology, as during coitus or straddle injury. Resulting vascular lesions via arterial laceration or damage to the intima with consequent thrombosis may lead to the development of an arterio-cavernous fistula. While the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction is complex, and several factors may simultaneously play a role (e.g. neurogenic, psychogenic, etc.), vascular injury is a major risk factor for long-term organic erectile dysfunction, especially if untreated. Diagnosis is routinely performed by ultrasound with Color Duplex and Doppler. Severity of erectile dysfunction can be scored according to the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the lower the value, the more severe the condition. An IIEF-value of 22–25 is physiological. Interventional radiological embolization techniques have gained importance in managing post-traumatic vascular pathologies, allowing a safe and effective treatment of arterio-cavernous fistulas.

### Arterial priapism and cycling: a new worrisome reality? [^6abe0223]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Arterial priapism is a rare condition caused by the traumatic formation of an arteriolacunar fistula. We report 2 cases of arterial priapism after cycling injuries. Both patients sustained a violent perineal trauma against the top tube on the bicycle. In both cases, penile detumescence was obtained by superselective arteriographic embolization of the fistula with gelatin sponge or microcoil. The fistula was monolateral in the first case and bilateral in the second. Cycling should be considered a possible risk factor for arterial priapism as it is for urethritis, prostatitis, hematuria, testicular torsion, scrotal and penile numbness, and erectile dysfunction.

Main Outcome Measures

Reduction of priapism and preservation of erectile function.

Results

Priapism is a persistent penile erection that continues hours beyond, or is unrelated to, sexual stimulation. Priapism requires prompt evaluation and usually requires emergency management. There are two types of priapism: (i) ischemic (veno-occlusive or low flow), which is found in 95% of cases, and (ii) nonischemic (arterial or high flow). Stuttering (intermittent) priapism is a recurrent form of ischemic priapism. To initiate appropriate management, the physician must determine whether the priapism is ischemic or nonischemic. Necessary diagnostic steps are an accurate history, physical examination, and cavernous blood gas analysis and/or color duplex ultrasonography of the corpora cavernosa. Management of ischemic priapism should achieve resolution as promptly as possible. Initial treatment is therapeutic aspiration with or without irrigation of the corpora. If this fails, intracavernous injection of sympathomimetic drugs is the next step. Surgical shunts should be performed if nonsurgical treatment has failed. The initial management of nonischemic priapism should be observation. Selective arterial embolization is recommended for the management of nonischemic priapism in patients who request treatment. The goal of management for a patient with recurrent (stuttering) priapism is prevention of future episodes.

Conclusion

Management of priapism has become increasingly successful as scientific understanding of the pathophysiology and molecular biology of priapism improves. The key to further success in the treatment of priapism is basic research of this uncommon but potentially devastating condition.

### Open, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of cardiac output- (...) [^0e42d2a2]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

National Emergency Laparotomy Audit Objectives To establish whether minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring to guide protocolised administration of intra- venous fluid during and for up to six hours after major emergency bowel surgery will increase the number of days alive and out of hospital within 90 days of randomisation. a particularly high burden of postoperative morbidity and mortality, with a 90-day postoperative mortality rate of 20% in those aged 50 and over. The critical need to improve the care of patients undergoing this procedure has been recognized by the establishment of a national audit of care and outcomes in this patient group and a number of national quality. It is accepted that intra-venous fluids given during and after surgery have an important effect on patient outcomes, in particular following major gastrointestinal surgery.

Yet they are commonly prescribed to subjective criteria leading to wide variation in clinical practice. One possible solution is the use of cardiac output monitoring to guide intra-venous fluid dosing as part of a haemodynamic therapy algorithm. This approach has been studied for many years and has been shown to modify inflammatory pathways, and improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation. A Cochrane review of this intervention was recently updated, incorporating the largest contemporary trial in this area to date. Complications were less frequent among patients treated according to a hemodynamic therapy algorithm. The intervention was associated with a reduced incidence of post-operative infection and a reduced duration of hospital stay.

There was a non-significant reduction in mortality at longest follow-up. Despite this suggestion of benefit in elective surgery, these findings are not generalisable to patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. Patients requiring emergency bowel surgery have. fundamental pathophysiological differences from elective patients. These include acute inflammation, sepsis, bleeding, and fluid disturbances which may be established before surgery even begins. They therefore have similarities with critically ill patients, in whom the evidence base for fluid resuscitation based on cardiac output monitoring is very uncertain. There is a lack of dedicated studies of this treatment. guided by cardiac output on the number of days spent alive and out of hospital by patients following major emergency bowel surgery.

Treatment

Each case was treated conservatively with perineal compression over the site of fistula. Three cases resolved with conservative treatment. Twenty-two cases underwent catheter angiography and embolization at a median time of 23 days (IQR 13–92) after onset of NiP. Supplying branches were selected and embolized with 0.5–1 ml of gelfoam slurry, or thrombin. Periprocedural ultrasound was used to confirm thrombosis of the AVF. In 13 cases, 2 mm microcoils (Hilal - Cook) were used to sacrifice a bleeding helicine, but not placed in the main cavernosal artery. Contralateral distal penile angiograms were performed to exclude collateral supply. See Fig. 1. Recurrence of NiP with recanalization of the AVF was detected in 10 cases (40%) at the 1 week follow-up scan, further embolization was then performed at a median of 44 days (IQR 6–55; σ 2 223) after initial treatment. 3 patients (12%) required a third embolization to achieve detumescence. All patients had returned to a flaccid state by a median time of 32 days (IQR 19–121; σ 2 30637). There were no recorded complications according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification.

### Therapeutic outcomes and analysis of Doppler findings in 25 patients with non-ischemic priapism [^1c7ec639]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this study: although all patients meeting our minimum criteria for imaging and clinical follow up were included, many were excluded, potentially biasing the group and reducing the size of the study population to a relatively small convenience sample. This study remains one of the largest series of NiP with long-term follow up. Due to the emergent nature of NiP it was not possible to formally test premorbid EF. Individuals were excluded if they did not report subjective premorbid normal EF. CDUS is a technically challenging technique with intraobserver variability and not all patients with ED proceeded to a pharmacologically stimulated CDUS as part of their ED workup. Those men with ED did not undergo further investigation for ED with for instance with cavernosography or nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity tests.

Thirty-six percent of men treated for NiP had ED at last follow up. Follow-up CDUS commonly shows a persisting low resistance waveform 1 week after successful treatment of NiP. In the majority of patients this resolves, but if it persists, a raised resting MV and EDV in the cavernosal arteries can be associated with ED and suggests ongoing arterio-venous connections. This finding can inform decisions on management including investigation with stimulated CDUS, cavernosography and consideration of further angiography and embolization.

Pelvic injury—endovascular role and indications for angiography/embolization: Angiography quickly became adopted as the gold standard for treatment of arterial injury caused by pelvic injury, and currently most high-volume trauma centers consider embolization for pelvic trauma to be first-line therapy and the standard of care over surgery. Indications for angiography with possible embolization currently include: 1) a pelvic ring fracture on plain radiography in a hemodynamically unstable patient after exclusion of intrathoracic and/or intraabdominal bleeding by imaging, ultrasound, or diagnostic peritoneal lavage; and 2) vascular injury or contrast agent extravasation on contrast-enhanced CT with supportive imaging findings such as large-volume pelvic hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, vasospasm, arterial stretch injury, or a vascular “cutoff” sign. The page also states there is currently no consensus whether to proceed directly to angiography in the hemodynamically stable patient with active contrast agent extravasation on CT.

### Superselective embolization for high-flow priapism refractory to medical and surgical treatments [^1ce7ffc0]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study aimed to report long-term outcome of superselective embolization in patients with high-flow priapism refractory to medical and surgical treatments.

Methods

From August 2011 until July 2016, 14 patients with high-flow priapism refractory to local treatments were treated and their charts were retrospective reviewed. Clinical evaluation, color Doppler ultrasonography, arteriography and selective embolization were performed. Follow up was performed in all patients. Fourteen men (18–63 years old) were enrolled, with priapism duration of 14 h to 28 days. Internal pudendal arteries or glutaea inferior arteriae were successfully embolized with gelatin sponge particles, polyvinyl alcohol particles or microcoils.

Results

Pseudoaneurysm in right femoral artery was found in one case after intervention. The follow-up 1 week later showed that 13 patients were in good condition, the priapism diminished 1–7 days (mean 3.2 ± 0.5 days) after intervention, and 1 patient received second intervention. Mean follow-up was (range 10.8–69.6) months. One patient had recurrent priapism months after embolization and had his penis surgically removed for severe necrosis.

Conclusions

Superselective embolization is safe and effective in high-flow priapism refractory local treatments, with a good long-term prognosis.

### Superselective embolization for high-flow priapism refractory to medical and surgical treatments [^26f185e8]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Priapism is characterized by a persistent penile erection (more than 4 h) continuing unrelated to sexual stimulation, including the common low-flow priapism and high-flow priapism. High-flow priapism is a rare condition, characterized by a prolonged and painless erection, which may permanently impair erectile function and should be treated timely to restore potency. A fundamental aim of priapism management is try to relieve penile ischemia/anoxia and to prevent erectile dysfunction (ED) to achieve maximal preservation of sexual health.Surgery is the traditional method for high-flow priapism, however, this invasive treatment is less efficacious and associated with higher rates of ED compared with arterial embolotherapy. Transarterial embolization is a useful alternative to surgery for high-flow priapism if local treatment fails. Early diagnosis of high-flow priapism and prompt intervention is essential to prevent future complications. In this study, we report long-term outcome of superselective embolization in 14 cases with high-flow priapism refractory to medical and surgical treatments.

### Long-term predictors of assisted erectile function after high-flow priapism: patient profile matters more than embolization technique [^c3cbb5ec]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

High-flow priapism (HFP) is a rare urological condition, often secondary to genitoperineal trauma, resulting in arterio-cavernosal fistulas. Superselective arterial embolization is the preferred treatment when conservative management fails, but long-term data on erectile function (EF) outcomes remain limited.

Aim

To evaluate long-term EF outcomes in patients with HFP undergoing embolization and to identify predictors of EF impairment at follow-up.

Methods

Data from 41 patients with HFP admitted to six tertiary referral centers (2002- 2024) were analyzed. Diagnosis was confirmed using penile Doppler ultrasound, blood gas analysis, and selective pudendal arteriography. Embolization was performed using absorbable or non-absorbable agents. EF was evaluated pre- and post-embolization using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and the Erection Hardness Score questionnaires. Logistic and linear regression models were used to assess predictors of EF at follow-up.

Outcomes

Primary outcome was long-term erectile function, including the need for pharmacological or device-assisted EF. Secondary outcomes included patient satisfaction and associations with clinical and procedural variables.

Results

Median (interquartile range) age was 35 (27-44) years, and the pre-embolization IIEF-5 was 25 (24-25). Non-absorbable embolic agents were used in 35 (85.4%) patients. Median follow-up was 44 (12-80) months. At follow-up, the median IIEF-5 score was 21 (18-24), with a median decrease of -4 (-6-1) points from baseline. Severe ED occurred in only 2.4% of patients; however, 46.3% had assisted EF (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, nutraceuticals, low-intensity shock wave therapy, or vacuum devices). Patients with assisted EF at follow up had higher baseline Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and lower IIEF-5 scores than those with unassisted EF (all P<0.03). Lower CCI, and higher baseline IIEF-emerged as predictors of IIEF-5 scores at follow-up, after accounting for age. Higher CCI was the only predictor of assisted EF at follow-up. No significant associations were found with embolization technique and EF.

Clinical Implications

Baseline EF and comorbidity burden may help identify patients at risk for EF worsening and assisted EF post-embolization. These findings can guide individualized counseling and follow-up strategies.

Strengths & Limitations

This is the largest real-life cohort evaluating EF after embolization for HFP, using validated questionnaires. Limitations include the retrospective design and potential recall bias.

Conclusion

Superselective embolization for HFP is highly effective with limited impact on EF at long term. Nonetheless, nearly half of patients required assisted EF at follow-up, with comorbidities and lower baseline EF as significant predictors. Long-term monitoring and individualized counseling are essential.

### Utility of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in penile trauma [^6694186e]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Cavernosal artery injury (Figs. 8, 9 and 10)

In both penetrating and blunt penile traumas, an injury to a cavernosal artery can occur. This leads to intra-cavernous bleeding, with the patient presenting with high-flow priapism, typically painless. As the venous outflow is preserved, there is a much lower risk of ischaemia. Ultrasound evaluation achieves a precise diagnosis and guides focal compression, embolisation or surgery if needed.

On US, there is usually a haematoma adjacent to the cavernosal artery. When a vascular injury is present, there is an abnormal contour in the B-mode images, with wall discontinuity and/or focal outpouching if there is a pseudoaneurysm. On colour Doppler mode the classic ‘yin-yang’ appearance may be found.

On CEUS, the haematoma will appear as a non-enhancing area. CEUS allows clear visualisation of the vascular lumen and demonstrates confidently active extravasation and the presence of pseudoaneurysms.

Fig. 8 
Penile haematoma with pseudoaneurysm. A 38-year-old man presented to the emergency department following a pedal bicycle accident with blunt trauma to the non-erect penis, with clinical high-flow priapism at presentation. Ultrasound was performed. In a sagittal plane in B mode (a) where an ill-defined area of mixed echogenicity (between arrowheads) in the right corpus cavernosum at the base of the penis, suspicious of haematoma is seen. The colour Doppler US (b) shows a deformity of a branch of the cavernosal artery (arrow) with turbulent flow in its interior, consistent with pseudoaneurysm. CEUS (c) confirms the presence of the non-enhancing haematoma (between arrowheads) and the pseudoaneurysm, which enhances avidly (thin arrow) in the arterial phase. A complementary MRI was performed (sagittal T1 pre-contrast (d), sagittal T1 FSE C+ (e)), showing an area of hyperenhancement of the right corpus cavernosum (arrowhead), compatible with the known haematoma. Within the haematoma, there is a hyperenhancing saccular area corresponding to the pseudoaneurysm (arrow). Note the higher spatial resolution of US compared to MRI in assessing the penis

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^dffc31bf]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA priapism—post‑shunt assessment and imaging: In refractory cases after shunting, subsequent intervention may be necessary, and the clinician must perform a confirmatory test to assess penile hemodynamic characteristics and extent of necrosis/fibrosis and should not base further surgical decisions based on exam alone. Corporal blood gas or imaging should be utilized following shunt procedure to differentiate persistent acute ischemic priapism from reactive hyperemia or conversion to NIP, and penile corporal blood gas is easily performed and should be utilized in patients when cavernosal oxygenation status post‑shunting must be established. This can help with decision making about proceeding to additional surgical procedures including placement of an immediate penile prosthesis. The role of imaging is a diagnostic intervention in acute ischemic priapism, and after a distal shunt, post‑procedural imaging can determine shunt patency by showing restoration of cavernosal arterial inflow.

Ultrasound Imaging findings of cavernous Pseudoaneurysm. A Sagittal images of the roots of the penile corpus cavernosum on each side show an anechoic area measuring approximately 1.0 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm on the right and 1.9 cm x 1.1 cm x 1.2 cm on the left. Visible traversal of the penile corpus cavernosum artery is seen within the anechoic area (white arrows). B Cross-sectional images of the bilateral corpora cavernosa show a vivid red and blue blood flow signal originating from the cavernous arteries and filling the anechoic lumen. C The pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound of the right arteriocavernosal fistula revealed an arterial spectrum with a peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 595 cm/s. D The pulsed-wave Doppler at the left arteriocavernosal fistula was also arterial in spectrum, with a PSV of 711 cm/s. R: right; L: left

After 3 months of treatment, the patient’s priapism resolved but voluntary erectile function was not restored. Penile enlargement during sexual arousal was accompanied by pain, potentially inhibiting further enlargement. Urologic examination revealed a flaccid penis with pain upon gentle squeezing in the proximal portion of the right corpus cavernosum. No other abnormalities were noted. Unfortunately, ultrasound images of the lesions were not obtained after 3 months of treatment.

### Therapeutic outcomes and analysis of Doppler findings in 25 patients with non-ischemic priapism [^48820b0f]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 40 consecutive cases of NiP were treated. Twenty-five met the inclusion criteria; 15 were excluded due to inadequate or unavailable pretreatment CDUS traces and/or incomplete follow-up CDUS. The median age was 28 year old (IQR 19–44; σ 2 168). All patients reported normal EF before the injury and with no reported comorbidities including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Perineal injuries were sustained whilst skateboarding (4 cases), cycling (10 cases), other physical activity (10 cases) and iatrogenic injury during routine urethroscopy (1 case).

### Imaging of penile traumas – therapeutic implications [^e925bab5]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Injury to the penis may result from penetrating or nonpenetrating trauma. Nonpenetrating injury to the erect penis can produce albugineal tear, intracavernous hematoma or extraalbugineal hematoma from rupture of the dorsal vessels. Nonpenetrating injury to the flaccid penis usually follows blunt perineal traumas producing extratunical or cavernosal haematomas, or cavernosal artery tear followed by high flow priapism. Differential diagnosis between albugineal tear and other penile injuries must be obtained as soon as possible, since early surgical repair of albugineal tear reduces significantly the rate of postraumatic curvature and fibrosis. Ultrasonography (US) is able to detect the exact site of the tear in most patients as an interruption of the thin echogenic line of the tunica albuginea. Other imaging techniques are rarely required in the clinical practice. Color Doppler US is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate patients with high flow priapism. Focal or diffuse cavernosal fibrosis can be identified with US as echogenic areas in the cavernosal bodies. Postraumatic erectile dysfunction can result from fibrotic changes, nerve and vascular impairment or both. Doppler evaluation of penile vasculature is required in young patients with postraumatic impotence before surgical revascularization procedures.

### Priapism. from priapus to the present time [^8e35a6d3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Advances in the pharmacotherapeutic options available to treat erectile dysfunction over the past decade have transformed the field of impotence. The initial foray into this field with intracavernous injections of papaverine rapidly expanded the number of men seeking attention for priapism, a previously rare clinical condition. The recent widespread use and acceptance of oral agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, with a reduced incidence of priapism has decreased the number of men at risk for injection-related prolonged erections. The use of recreational drugs (cocaine) and perineal trauma leading to presentations of priapism seem to be rising in incidence. The urologist remains the consultant-specialist ultimately responsible for these men and should be cognizant of the array of treatments described for this condition. Early determination of the state of corporal oxygenation is essential and will define the optimal management approach. A wide range of medical conditions and risk factors may be etiologic and should be elicited from the patient at the initial interview. Low-flow ischemic priapism requires a rapid resolution, often achieved through use of alpha-agonists orally or by direct injection into the penile circulation, whereas nonischemic priapism can be treated more conservatively. Research into this condition has only recently been initiated. Through greater understanding of the pathophysiology of priapism, the clinician may become armed with etiology-specific medical alternatives providing timely detumescence for men with prolonged erections.

### Sexual function after highly selective embolization of cavernous artery in patients with high flow priapism: long-term followup [^d74d127a]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We present 15 cases of high flow priapism treated by selective embolization and evaluate erectile function at long-term followup.

Materials and Methods

Between 1995 and 2001, 15 patients underwent highly selective embolization of the cavernous artery for high flow priapism. Trauma was reported by 12 of the 15 patients, and no etiologic causes were evident in the other 3. The fistula was unilateral in 13 patients and bilateral in 2. All patients underwent embolization during arteriography. Erectile function was determined using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) at followup after an average of 55 months (range 18 to 93).

Results

Postoperative color Doppler ultrasonography showed no recurrence in 11 patients (73%). Repeat pelvic angiography with selective embolization was required at 1 month postoperatively in 3 patients (20%). In 1 case (7%) 3 consecutive embolizations were not conclusive and a surgical operation was required. The IIEF results showed that sexual function was in the normal range in 80% of patients. Three patients (20%) reported a slight change in the quality of erection. Mean postoperative IIEF score was 26.3 (range 18 to 30).

Conclusions

Highly selective embolization of the fistula is an effective and safe treatment option for high flow priapism because it ensures a high level of preservation of pretreatment erectile function.

### Therapeutic outcomes and analysis of Doppler findings in 25 patients with non-ischemic priapism [^b7b7c899]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

All cases of NiP from a single tertiary andrology centre were retrospectively identified from electronic hospital records between January 2007 and December 2021. Diagnosis of NiP was made following a relevant clinical history of preceding trauma or iatrogenic injury to the corpora and with a corporal blood gas aspiration showing bright red blood and raised oxygen tension (pO2 > 90 mm Hg, pCO2 < 40 mm Hg, pH 7.40). Patients with a AVF caused by corporal decompression of ischemic priapism were not included in this study. The study sample size was a convenience sample due to the low incidence of NiP.

Unstimulated CDUS was conducted by a consultant uroradiologist within 48 h of presentation. The imaging diagnosis of NiP was made by presence of intracorporal AVF(s) and characteristic low resistance waveforms (low resistive index (RI), high peak systolic (PSV) typically >50 cm/s and end diastolic velocities (EDV) typically >20 cm/s and mean velocity (MV) > 6.5 cm/s in the affected cavernosal artery(s). Patients were counseled on the treatment options, and a conservative approach with compression and ice pack application was attempted for up to 2 weeks. If unsuccessful, catheter angiography and embolization was performed within 1 month of initial presentation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in Table 1.

Table 1 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study.

All diagnostic and follow up CDUS scans were carried out without the administration of pharcomological stimulants. A 12–18 MHz linear probe on an Acuson 500 (Siemens, Germany) was used. Waveforms were measured in the cavernosal arteries at the most proximal point in the crura; both left and right (and any accessory cavernosal arteries) were sampled. Measurement was carried out over at least three cardiac cycles according to good sonographic practice and in all cases, angle correction was applied. In cases of unilateral AVF, the trace from the cavernosal artery in the affected side was used. In cases of bilateral AVFs, the side with the highest velocity value was used for analysis.

### A rare cause of autoinflation after penile prosthesis insertion: case series and systematic review [^f1d0192a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2016, we reported the first case of high flow priapism and arteriocavernosal fistula caused by penile prosthesis insertion that mimicked device autoinflation.

Aim

To raise awareness amongst implanters, we describe further cases from our institution and perform a systematic review of the literature to understand the rarity of this phenomenon.

Methods

Patient demographics, management and outcomes were extracted retrospectively. A systematic search of the EMBASE, PubMed and PubMed Central libraries for studies reporting arteriocavernosal fistula mimicking autoinflation since 1946 was performed.

Outcomes

To identify and report all known cases of high flow priapism and arteriocavernosal fistula presenting as autoinflation of an inflatable penile prosthesis.

Results

Four patients in total (median age 56, range 46-60 years) were identified. Catastrophic bleeding (1.8L) occurred during revision surgery for presumed autoinflation in Patient 1 and subsequent ultrasound (US) confirmed a fistula which was embolized. Patient 2 redeveloped autoinflation following revision surgery. Ultrasound confirmed high flow priapism from an arteriocavernosal fistula. Patient 3 underwent penile magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate autoinflation and residual penile curvature. MRI showed a tumescent penis despite a deflated device and the fistula was embolized successfully. Patient 4 with sleep-related painful erections did not improve following insertion of penile prosthesis. Doppler US identified 2 fistulae that was embolized but with no resolution of symptoms. Subsequent embolization of both common penile arteries were done to control his symptoms. No other publications apart from the published abstract from 2016 reporting patient 1 was found.

Clinical Implications

If considered prior to revision surgery, the fistula can be managed safely by minimally invasive percutaneous angioembolisation avoiding surgery which can potentially be associated with significant complications.

Strengths and Limitations

The rarity of this phenomenon was supported by a systematic review. Our study however does present the findings from a small number of patients.

Conclusion

Damage to the cavernosal artery during inflatable penile prosthesis insertion can create an arteriocavernosal fistula that mimics autoinflation, leading to catastrophic intra-operative bleeding or unnecessary surgery.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^da7ff81e]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline—radiologic evaluation of priapism notes that penile duplex Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) is not the primary way to diagnose priapism, and imaging studies should not be incorporated into the acute evaluation and management of priapism in the emergency department by non-urologist specialists. In less clearly delineated cases, PDUS findings consistent with acute ischemic priapism include bilateral absence of flow through the cavernosal arteries, peak systolic flows <50 cm/sec, mean velocity <6.5 cm/sec, and diastolic reversal, whereas non-ischemic priapism (NIP) is associated with peak systolic velocities of >50 cm/sec. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data include that T2-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated 100% sensitivity in identifying non-viable corporal smooth muscle and which predicted future erectile dysfunction, but MRI likely does not have a role in the initial diagnostic and treatment phase of priapism.

### Therapeutic embolization of high-flow priapism 1 year follow up with color Doppler sonography [^0d23cb4e]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of color Doppler sonography (CDS) for the diagnosis of high-flow priapism and the treatment of cavernosal arterial fistula via super-selective arterial embolization.

Methods and Materials

We reviewed eight cases of high-flow priapism with cavernosal arterial fistula, from 2005 to 2011. All of the patients were diagnosed with a high-flow priapism and unilateral artery fistula via CDS. Conventional treatments for the eight cases were unsuccessful, and the patients were then treated through super-selective embolization. Diagnostic angiograms of the internal iliac artery showed a fistula on one side of the cavernosal artery, thus confirming the CDS images. We compared hemodynamic parameters including the peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity the resistance index of the pathological cavernosal artery and intracavernosal pressure in all patients before and after treatment using t-test. The efficacy of super-selective embolization and the erectile function of all patients were evaluated at a follow-up time of 12 months.

Results

All patients were successfully treated and angiography showed that the fistulas disappeared after treatment. Additionally significant differences were found in the peak systolic velocity, the end diastolic velocity, the resistance index and intracavernosal pressure between pre-treatment and post-treatment (P<0.05). At 5 days post-treatment, only one case relapses had occurred. Seven cases displayed restored erectile function and only one case exhibited erectile dysfunction.

Conclusion

Color Doppler sonography is a highly sensitive method for the examination of high-flow priapism, and super-selective embolization is a safe and effective treatment for cavernosal arterial fistula.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of high flow priapism [^fd5aec28]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Priapism can be categorized as low flow or high flow. Low flow priapism is a compartment syndrome and requires immediate treatment to avoid long-term ischemic damage. Alternatively, high flow priapism is not an emergent condition and can be managed as an outpatient. The diagnosis has traditionally been made via cavernosal blood gas analysis; however, this is painful and can cause iatrogenic harm.

Case Report

We present a case of high flow priapism whereby point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) identified the presence of pulsatile cavernosal arterial flow to confirm the diagnosis. This is the first case report in the emergency medicine literature to highlight the utility of POCUS in the diagnosis and management of high flow priapism. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Low flow priapism accounts for 95% of cases and is a urologic emergency requiring immediate invasive intervention. High flow priapism is much less common and does not require emergent management. While blood gas analysis can differentiate between high and low flow priapism, POCUS is a rapid, noninvasive, accurate diagnostic means to identify the presence or absence of cavernosal pulsatile arterial flow.

### Percutaneous direct puncture embolization with N-butyl-cyanoacrylate for high-flow priapism [^d5fb57b4]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many treatment options in high-flow priapism. Those mentioned most often are watchful waiting, Doppler-guided compression, endovascular highly selective embolization, and surgery. We present a case of high-flow priapism in a 57-year-old man treated by percutaneous direct puncture embolization of a post-traumatic left cavernosal arteriovenous fistula using N-butyl-cyanoacrylate. Erectile function was preserved during a 12-month follow-up. No patients with percutaneous direct puncture embolization for high-flow priapism have been reported previously. Percutaneous direct puncture embolization is a potentially useful and safe method for management of high-flow priapism.
