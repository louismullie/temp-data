## Question

Pasturellosis in cattle

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of pasteurellosis in cattle, including etiologic agents, pathogenesis, clinical syndromes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and public health implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the causative organisms and their taxonomy. Then, I should verify the pathogenesis and virulence factors, especially leukotoxin and epithelial invasion. Next, I will review the clinical syndromes in cattle and their economic impact. After that, I need to check diagnostic approaches, including culture, molecular testing, and genotyping. Then, I will examine treatment and antimicrobial stewardship. Finally, I should consider prevention, including vaccination, biosecurity, and One Health implications, and close with antimicrobial resistance and zoonotic considerations, making sure I cross-check each claim against the cited literature as I go [^1159fpgG] [^112wm46G].

> Let me first confirm the etiologic agents and nomenclature. Pasteurellosis in cattle is primarily due to Mannheimia haemolytica, with Pasteurella multocida as a secondary contributor; both are Gram-negative coccobacilli within the Pasteurellaceae family, and M. haemolytica is the principal bacterial pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease complex, which is also known as shipping fever [^1159fpgG] [^112wm46G]. Wait, I should verify the serotype distinctions because they matter for virulence: healthy cattle are commonly colonized by M. haemolytica serotype A2, whereas disease is typically caused by serotype A1, which exhibits greater pathogenicity and invasiveness in the respiratory tract [^1159fpgG] [^112ZFTpU].

> I will now examine pathogenesis and virulence mechanisms. M. haemolytica produces a ruminant-specific leukotoxin that binds the bovine CD18 subunit of β2-integrins, causing leukocyte activation, apoptosis, and cytolysis; this leukotoxin-mediated injury is central to the severe bronchofibrinous pneumonia seen in cattle, and inflammatory cytokines upregulate leukocyte integrins, amplifying leukotoxin cytotoxicity in vitro [^111hJVSn] [^112R3Qjj] [^116MJxPU]. Hold on, I should verify epithelial invasion claims: pathogenic A1 strains, but not commensal A2, invade and replicate within differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells, disrupting tight junctions and spreading laterally, which helps explain explosive proliferation in the upper respiratory tract before overt pneumonia [^112ZFTpU] [^111dqQ97]. Let me also consider P. multocida's role; it responds dynamically to host environments, upregulating nutrient acquisition and metabolic genes during infection, and can cause atypical septicemic presentations such as fibrinous peritonitis in calves, indicating diverse pathogenic potential beyond classic respiratory disease [^1149kDpz] [^1166twGH].

> Next, I should review the clinical syndromes in cattle. The predominant manifestation is bovine respiratory disease complex, characterized by fever, depression, nasal discharge, dyspnea, and anorexia, with peak incidence shortly after feedlot arrival; BRD is the most prevalent and costly cause of cattle mortality in the U.S., imposing annual economic losses exceeding one billion dollars [^1159fpgG] [^112wm46G]. Wait, let me verify the timing and triggers: transport stress, commingling, and adverse weather are key precipitants that increase shedding and disease expression, consistent with the multifactorial nature of BRD [^1159fpgG]. I should also note that P. multocida can cause hemorrhagic septicemia and, rarely, peritonitis in calves, underscoring the variability of pasteurellosis presentations in cattle [^1166twGH].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is comprehensive. Culture from deep nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, or postmortem lung tissue remains foundational, but turnaround is slow; whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used to rapidly identify BRD-associated pathogens and characterize antimicrobial resistance genotypes, though genotype–phenotype concordance varies and must be interpreted cautiously [^112wm46G] [^112wTRqv]. Hold on, I should verify the scope of WGS panels: contemporary studies commonly include M. haemolytica, P. multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis, reflecting the polymicrobial nature of BRD and the need for integrated molecular diagnostics [^112wm46G]. Let me reconsider serotyping utility: distinguishing A1 from A2 strains can support pathogenicity assessment, but routine clinical serotyping is not universally available, so molecular methods increasingly fill that gap [^1159fpgG].

> Now, I should review treatment and antimicrobial stewardship. Empiric therapy for BRD commonly uses antimicrobials active against Pasteurellaceae, but rising resistance necessitates susceptibility testing when feasible; WGS can flag resistance genes, yet discordance with phenotypic resistance means culture-based AST remains important for optimal therapy [^112wTRqv]. Wait, I need to check specific agents: macrolides have variable activity against P. multocida and should be used judiciously, whereas β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tetracyclines are among options depending on susceptibilities and regulatory constraints; stewardship frameworks emphasize minimizing prophylactic use and aligning therapy with diagnostic confirmation [^114gfxEA] [^112wTRqv]. I should double-check that lincomycin lacks reliable activity against Pasteurella spp., reinforcing the need to avoid agents with poor coverage in confirmed pasteurellosis [^111pPzFS] [^116J4F99].

> Next, I should review prevention and control strategies. Vaccination is widely used but efficacy is inconsistent; improved vaccines targeting conserved virulence factors and optimized adjuvants are needed, and research communities emphasize integrating innate immune insights and host–pathogen interaction data to design more protective, durable vaccines [^1159fpgG] [^114kgxsx]. Let me verify management measures: reducing stress, improving ventilation, and implementing arrival processing protocols reduce BRD incidence, while biosecurity and movement controls are critical in broader pasteurellosis control programs [^1159fpgG]. But wait, what about One Health? Pasteurellosis control sits within a One Health framework, where animal vaccination, safe food practices, and occupational health policies intersect to mitigate zoonotic and economic risks [^113EE2j8].

> I will now examine antimicrobial resistance trends and their implications. Multidrug resistance has been documented among Pasteurellaceae associated with BRD, and surveillance using WGS has expanded the catalog of resistance genes, though phenotype–genotype concordance is imperfect and warrants cautious interpretation in treatment decisions [^112wTRqv]. Hold on, I should verify whether specific resistance patterns are emerging: studies report variable concordance rates between predicted and observed resistance across antimicrobial classes, reinforcing the need for integrated genotypic and phenotypic surveillance to guide therapy and policy [^112wTRqv].

> Finally, I should consider zoonotic potential and public health. Pasteurella spp. are well-recognized zoonoses, typically presenting in humans as soft tissue infections after animal bites or scratches; severe invasive disease is rare but documented, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with animal exposure histories [^112u67RY] [^111wKTRN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought of citing a neonatal review to support zoonotic risk, but that pertains to vertical and animal-contact transmission in infants and does not directly inform occupational cattle exposure; I should correct that and rely on adult exposure data and IDSA guidance for animal bite management instead [^116r5vyS] [^112u67RY]. I need to ensure prevention messaging is clear: prompt wound care and appropriate empiric antibiotics with coverage for Pasteurella spp. are essential after animal bites or significant exposures, aligning with SSTI guidelines and antimicrobial stewardship principles [^111uLr8V] [^114gfxEA].

Pasteurellosis in cattle is a **bacterial respiratory disease** caused by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, with M. haemolytica serotype A1 as the **primary pathogen** [^1159fpgG]. It presents as **shipping fever** (BRD) with fever, nasal discharge, coughing, dyspnea, and anorexia, and can progress to fatal pneumonia, especially with stress or viral coinfections [^1159fpgG]. Diagnosis relies on clinical signs, necropsy, and culture or PCR; treatment requires early antibiotics (ceftiofur, tulathromycin, or florfenicol) and supportive care, though resistance is rising [^112wm46G]. Prevention centers on **vaccination**, stress reduction, and biosecurity; the disease causes major economic losses globally [^1159fpgG].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Primary pathogens**: Mannheimia haemolytica (serotype A1) and Pasteurella multocida are the main causes; M. haemolytica is most virulent due to leukotoxin [^1159fpgG].

- **Leukotoxin**: M. haemolytica leukotoxin binds bovine CD18, causing leukocyte lysis, inflammation, and lung damage [^111hJVSn] [^112R3Qjj].

- **Colonization and invasion**: Pathogens colonize the upper respiratory tract, proliferate after stress or viral infection, invade lungs, and cause bronchopneumonia [^1159fpgG] [^111dqQ97].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical signs include **fever, nasal discharge, coughing, dyspnea, anorexia, and depression** [^116krHW1]. Severe cases may develop **fibrinous pneumonia, pleuritis, and septicemia**, with high mortality if untreated [^113yaGiM].

---

## Risk factors

- **Stress**: Transport, weaning, weather extremes, and overcrowding increase risk [^1159fpgG].

- **Viral coinfections**: BHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V predispose to secondary bacterial infection [^notfound].

- **Age and immunity**: Young calves and immunocompromised animals are more susceptible [^115gKJ9S].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical signs**: Fever, nasal discharge, coughing, and dyspnea guide initial diagnosis [^116krHW1].

- **Necropsy**: Fibrinous pneumonia, pleuritis, and lung consolidation are characteristic [^113yaGiM].

- **Laboratory tests**: Culture, PCR, and serology confirm pathogens and differentiate from other respiratory diseases [^112wm46G].

---

## Treatment

- **Antibiotics**: Early use of ceftiofur, tulathromycin, or florfenicol is effective; resistance is increasing [^notfound].

- **Supportive care**: Fluids, anti-inflammatories, and oxygen therapy improve outcomes [^notfound].

- **Resistance**: Growing antimicrobial resistance complicates treatment and requires stewardship [^1139QFT5].

---

## Prevention and control

- **Vaccination**: Vaccines against M. haemolytica and P. multocida reduce incidence and severity [^notfound].

- **Biosecurity**: Quarantine, hygiene, and controlled animal movement limit spread [^notfound].

- **Stress management**: Minimizing stress and maintaining good nutrition reduce susceptibility [^notfound].

---

## Economic impact

Pasteurellosis causes major economic losses through **morbidity, mortality, reduced growth, treatment costs, and trade restrictions** [^notfound].

---

Pasteurellosis in cattle is a **significant respiratory disease** driven by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, with clinical severity shaped by stress and viral coinfections. Early diagnosis, targeted antibiotics, and prevention through vaccination and biosecurity are essential to limit its substantial economic impact [^1159fpgG].

Early detection of diseases by clinical diagnosis remains challenging, especially for unpredicted nonendemic diseases. BT displays a wide and nonspecific spectrum of clinical manifestations in ruminants, such as fever, hypersalivation, lameness, edema, and sudden death. BT disease severity in sheep and cattle overlaps with several other endemic infections, such as orf, dermatophilosis, haemonchosis, pasteurellosis, strawberry footrot, and photosensitization, which are relevant, differentially diagnosed endemic conditions in sheep. Malignant catarrhal fever and photosensitization can cause signs similar to BT in cattle. Awareness of BTV-like symptoms by veterinarians is also of great importance for other notifiable diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants, sheep and goat pox, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease, and should be notified to the official authorities when suspected.

### Neonatal pasteurellosis: a review of reported cases [^116r5vyS]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pasteurellosis is an uncommon infectious disease in humans mainly caused by Pasteurella multocida infection in neonates and has been rarely reported.

Objectives

To review the literature and address the mode of transmission, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, outcome and potential risk factors related to neonatal pasteurellosis.

Methods

A Medline all-languages database search for neonatal (birth-1 month) pasteurellosis cases after 1950 was conducted. Individual references from each publication were also reviewed to identify additional cases.

Results

Thirty-two cases were found, but detailed information was available for this review in only 25 cases. The median age was 14 days (range: birth-30 days). All were infected with P multocida. Animal exposure to cats and/or dogs was the major risk of infection: non-traumatic exposure in 11 (44%) cases, and traumatic exposure in 2 (8%) cases. Infections in 11 (44%) cases were classified as vertical transmission. The clinical features were most commonly bacteraemia with or without meningitis. The age at onset of 72 h or older was significantly associated with meningitis (≥ 72 h of age: 13/14 vs < 72 h of age: 3/11, p = 0.002). The most used antibiotics were beta-lactam with or without aminoglycoside or chloramphenicol. The overall mortality was 20% (5/25). The age at presentation of < 72 h, birth weight of < 2500 g, and vertical transmission were independently associated with death.

Conclusion

Pasteurellosis is a rare bacterial infection in neonates and should be considered in the cases of sepsis with history of exposure to domestic animal in either the patient or the mother.

### Contagious bovine and caprine pleuropneumonia: a research community's recommendations for the development of better vaccines [^114kgxsx]. NPJ Vaccines (2020). Medium credibility.

The characterization of the innate immune response is also paramount, as the innate immune response is likely to determine the outcome of infection or immunization by directing the type of adaptive immune response that ensues, and is also the first line of defence against the pathogen. It is self-evident that granulocytesand macrophagesinfiltrating the site of infection shape the outcome of disease and the pathogenicity. Therefore, their interaction with the pathogen and its components needs to be closely followed to generate a more complete picture of the mechanisms underlying the development of lesions initiated by either the pathogen or the host immune response. New and improved adjuvants and immune modulators are available that can increase the duration of immunity and direct the immune response towards more protective responses. These should be evaluated, using the data generated in the experiments described above to guide selection of the most appropriate candidate vaccines.

Prioritization of research efforts towards a novel prophylactic vaccine

Prioritization largely depends on the point of view of individual researchers, with microbiologists favouring characterization of the pathogen and immunologists favouring the characterization of the immune responses. However, a closer interaction between these two groups is needed to best tackle pathogens that kill our livestock in such large numbers. After rigorous scientific discussions, our suggested priority actions are shown in Table 1. We believe these approaches will guide development of better vaccines that can be used as tools in the control of these two important pathogens.

However, even the most efficacious vaccine does not alone imply its adoption and successful disease control. The Rinderpest eradication taught us that any vaccination campaign needs to involve many stakeholders such as epidemiologists and social scientists to develop and implement policies and strategies to achieve successful disease control.

### Partial failure of milk pasteurization as a risk for the transmission of Campylobacter from cattle to humans [^114JvBSA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cattle are the second most common source of human campylobacteriosis. However, routes to account for this scale of transmission have not been identified. In contrast to chicken, red meat is not heavily contaminated at point of sale. Although effective pasteurization prevents milk-borne infection, apparently sporadic infections may include undetected outbreaks from raw or perhaps incompletely pasteurized milk.

Methods

A rise in Campylobacter gastroenteritis in an isolated population was investigated using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), an epidemiological study, and environmental investigations.

Results

A single strain was identified in 20 cases, clearly distinguishable from other local strains and a reference population by WGS. A case-case analysis showed association of infection with the outbreak strain and milk from a single dairy (odds ratio, 8; Fisher exact test P value = .023). Despite temperature records indicating effective pasteurization, mechanical faults likely to lead to incomplete pasteurization of part of the milk were identified by further testing and examination of internal components of dairy equipment.

Conclusions

Here, milk distribution concentrated on a small area, including school-aged children with low background incidence of campylobacteriosis, facilitated outbreak identification. Low-level contamination of widely distributed milk would not produce as detectable an outbreak signal. Such hidden outbreaks may contribute to the substantial burden of apparently sporadic Campylobacter from cattle where transmission routes are not certain. The effective discrimination of outbreak isolates from a reference population using WGS shows that integrating these data and approaches into surveillance could support the detection as well as investigation of such outbreaks.

### Multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium infection from milk contaminated after pasteurization [^115poGES]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Pasteurization, or heat treatment, of milk is an important milestone in public health that contributed to dramatic declines in many infectious diseases. Despite the important public health gains achieved, outbreaks associated with pasteurized milk continue to occur. We describe a recent outbreak associated with pasteurized milk.

### Notes from the field: human Brucella abortus RB51 infections caused by consumption of unpasteurized domestic dairy products-United States, 2017–2019 [^112QGVra]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Since August 2017, CDC has confirmed three cases of brucellosis attributed to Brucella abortus cattle vaccine strain RB51 (RB51). Each case was associated with consumption of domestically acquired unpasteurized (raw) milk products. Patient symptoms varied and included fever, headache, overall malaise, and respiratory symptoms. In total, at least eight persons met the probable case definition of a clinically compatible illness epidemiologically linked to a shared contaminated source. In addition, hundreds of persons, from dozens of states, were potentially exposed to the contaminated raw milk products.

Consumption of raw milk products increases the risk for infection with pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Listeria, and Brucella spp. Raw milk–related disease outbreaks occur more often in states with legalized raw milk sales. Approximately 75% of U.S. states have laws allowing various types of raw milk sales.

Brucellosis, caused by Brucella spp. is primarily an animal disease; however, exposure to infected animals or raw milk products can cause human disease. In humans, brucellosis is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, including fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and sweats; miscarriage and other sequelae can occur. Human brucellosis is rare in the United States, with 80–120 cases reported annually; most of these are associated with Brucella exposures abroad (CDC, unpublished data, 2019). The rarity of human brucellosis in the United States is mainly attributable to pasteurization and the successful U.S. State-Federal Cattle Brucellosis Eradication Program. As a result of the program's focus on disease surveillance and cattle vaccination, B. abortus in livestock has been eliminated, except in limited areas where disease reintroduction from infected wildlife occurs.

### Mycobacterium bovis infection, United Kingdom [^1175y3rS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Agricultural workers may acquire the disease by inhaling cough spray from infected cattle. Typical pulmonary tuberculosis then develops, which is what we believe occurred here.

Despite a long history of cattle herd breakdowns on this farm, the family members were not screened until the human cases occurred. Early detection of the disease in the young man before it became infectious might have prevented transmission to his sister and avoided the need for chemoprophylaxis for her infant son. No guidelines were in force at the time. Those subsequently issued advocate screening of human contacts of disease only where pulmonary or udder lesions are detected in cattle. Since the early 1980s, reports of cattle herd breakdowns have steadily risen, with a more dramatic increase since 1990. The Southwest of England, the West Midlands, and South and West Wales have had recent increases in disease in cattle, and this trend is extending northward to include Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire. This incident represents the first documented probable spillover into the human population from animals since the disease's resurgence in cattle, and it suggests there may be a small risk for transmission to humans, even when the bovine case is reported as closed, 3 because of the presence of M. bovis in the cattle's respiratory tract.

### Multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium infection from milk contaminated after pasteurization [^115NNiV4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium infections occurred in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A case-control study implicated pasteurized milk from a dairy, and an inspection indicated the potential for contamination after pasteurization. Dairy cattle are the likely reservoir, and milk may be an important vehicle of Salmonella transmission to humans.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114J3Kjo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Yersinia enterocolitica — clinical presentations, exposures, and high-risk groups include nonbloody diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and a febrile pseudoappendicitis syndrome that can mimic appendicitis, with invasive yersiniosis in an adult possibly associated with mycotic aneurysms; foods associated include pork (eg, chitterlings) and dairy products; higher risk groups in the United States include young African American and Asian children, especially during winter months, as well as diabetics and those with chronic liver disease, malnutrition, or iron-overload states; higher rates among African American children have been attributable to cross-contamination within the home during preparation of chitterlings, and high incidence rates observed in the late 1990s have declined following preventive health campaigns focusing on avoidance of cross-contamination in the kitchen.

### Laboratory exposures to brucellae and implications for bioterrorism [^116q8CQY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Brucellosis is a zoonosis usually transmitted to humans by contact with infected animals and consumption of contaminated animal products. Because of compulsory pasteurization of milk products and strict control of the disease in dairy cattle, the incidence of brucellosis has steadily declined in most industrialized countries during the last 50 years. However, the disease remains among the most commonly recognized causes of laboratory-transmitted infections; 2% of all brucellosis cases are laboratory-acquired (,–).

### Species-and strain-specific differences in the phagocytosis of: insights from live-cell imaging [^113b8TVQ]. Infection and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

The genus Prototheca is an extremely unusual group of achlorophyllic, obligately heterotrophic algae. Six species have been identified as pathogens of vertebrates, including cattle and humans. In cattle, P. bovis is the main infectious pathogen and is associated with bovine mastitis. In contrast, human infections typically involve P. wickerhamii and are associated with a spectrum of varying clinical presentations. Prototheca spp. enter the host from the environment and are therefore likely to be initially recognized by cells of the innate immune system. However, little is known about the nature of the interaction between Prototheca spp. and host phagocytes. In the present study, we adopt a live-cell imaging approach to investigate these interactions over time. Using environmental and clinical strains, we show that P. bovis cells are readily internalized and processed by macrophages, whereas these immune cells struggle to internalize P. wickerhamii. Serum opsonization of P. wickerhamii only marginally improves phagocytosis, suggesting that this species (but not P. bovis) may have evolved mechanisms to evade phagocytosis. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of the kinases Syk or PI3K, which are both critical for innate immune signaling, drastically reduces the uptake of P. bovis. Finally, we show that genetic ablation of MyD88, a signaling adaptor critical for Toll-like receptor signaling, has little impact on uptake but significantly prolongs phagosome maturation once P. bovis is internalized. Together, our data suggest that these two pathogenic Prototheca spp. have very different host-pathogen interactions which have potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of human and animal disease.

### Pathogenic mannheimia haemolytica invades differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells [^1159fpgG]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

is a Gram-negative bacterium and is the primary bacterial species associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), a multifactorial condition of cattle involving poorly understood interactions between various bacterial and viral pathogens and the host. Bovine respiratory disease is responsible for significant economic losses (> $1 billion to $3 billion annually in the United States alone) to the livestock industries worldwide. Antibiotics play an important role in the control of BRD, but the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains is increasing, and there are serious public health concerns associated with the increased use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. Therefore, alternative, less extensively drug-dependent strategies are required to control disease. Vaccination is widely used for the prevention of BRD, but the efficacy of currently available vaccines is inconsistent, and improved vaccines are required. However, the development of improved vaccines and other control measures is hindered by our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BRD.

occurs naturally as a commensal in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of healthy cattle but, under circumstances which are poorly understood, is frequently associated with disease. The bacterium comprises 12 capsular serotypes. Healthy cattle are often colonized by commensal strains of serotype A2, but disease is almost always caused by pathogenic isolates of serotype A1. For reasons that are unclear but that are associated with crowding, stress, and/or viral infection, a sudden explosive proliferation occurs in the number of serotype A1 bacteria present in the URT of susceptible animals. The colonization of the mucosal surfaces leads to inhalation of bacterium-containing aerosol droplets into the lungs and predisposes the animals to the onset of pneumonic disease. Thus, pneumonia appears to be the consequence of two events — the first occurring in the URT and the second in the lungs.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114b2r6T]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

### Prevention and control of avian influenza virus: recent advances in diagnostic technologies and surveillance strategies [^115vPZ8G]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of AIV infection

Recognizing signs and symptoms is instrumental in the preliminary evaluation of AIV infection. However, clinical manifestations vary greatly, depending on the characteristics of the virus (such as the virulence and subtype) and of the infected subject (such as age, immune status, and any co-infections). AIV (typically HPAIV H5 viruses) infections in humans frequently present non-specific "flu-like symptoms" – typical of respiratory infections. However, uncommon signs and symptoms due to viral replication at unusual infection sites, present a challenge for accurate diagnosis. For example, the dairy workers infected with H5N1 from dairy cows developed conjunctivitis only. Physicians should, therefore, consider patients' history for any potential exposure include possible AIV infection, during initial differential diagnosis to recognize these uncommon clinical presentations. Likewise, veterinarians should be vigilant in the diagnosis of sick animals. Of note, the diagnosis of cattle infected with H5N1 was triggered by two cats having died after consumption of raw milk from infected dairy cows with atypical signs and symptoms.

### Serologic evidence of the geographic distribution of bacterial zoonotic agents in Kenya, 2007 [^112oYxN9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

National serological surveys can be leveraged to provide important information on burden of zoonotic pathogens to identify areas at risk and ultimately to measure impact of interventions. Evidence of positive antibody titers against B. anthracis and SFGR were common in Western Province, whereas positive antibody titers against Brucella spp. was common in North Eastern Province; positive TGR titer was less common across the country. Our findings suggest that some bacterial zoonotic diseases are widespread across the country and should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients in Kenya. This study maps the geographical distribution of bacterial zoonotic infections by province and indicates areas for targeted public health interventions in Kenya such as enhancing surveillance, encouraging hygienic slaughter practices, culling affected animals, and pasteurizing milk. Better appreciation of the disease burden of these diseases might lead to better diagnostic capacity and improved clinical recognition and case management. Introduction of rapid diagnostic tests might facilitate earlier detection of bacterial zoonotic diseases in the country.

### Performance evaluation of chatGPT in detecting diagnostic errors and their contributing factors: an analysis of 545 case reports of diagnostic errors [^1142HQU3]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Results

ChatGPT's assessment of the commonality of the final diagnosis and typicality of presentation

ChatGPT assessed that the final diagnosis was common in 120/544 (22.1%) and the presentation was typical in 251/544 (46.1%) of the cases. Overall, ChatGPT classified six cases (1.1%) into the typical presentation of common disease, 114 (21.0%) into the atypical presentation of common disease, 245 (45.0%) into the typical presentation of uncommon disease and 179 (32.9%) into the atypical presentation of uncommon disease group. The inter-rater agreement of human and ChatGPT was 0.46 (0.36–0.56) for the commonality of the final diagnosis, 0.08 (0.00–0.16) for the typicality of presentation and 0.13 (0.07–0.20) for the classification by commonality and typicality.

### Outer membrane protein A of bovine and ovine isolates of mannheimia haemolytica is surface exposed and contains host species-specific epitopes [^112iDfC3]. Infection and Immunity (2011). Low credibility.

Mannheimia haemolytica is the etiological agent of pneumonic pasteurellosis of cattle and sheep; two different OmpA subclasses, OmpA1 and OmpA2, are associated with bovine and ovine isolates, respectively. These proteins differ at the distal ends of four external loops, are involved in adherence, and are likely to play important roles in host adaptation. M. haemolytica is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule, and the degree of OmpA surface exposure is unknown. To investigate surface exposure and immune specificity of OmpA among bovine and ovine M. haemolytica isolates, recombinant proteins representing the transmembrane domain of OmpA from a bovine serotype A1 isolate (rOmpA1) and an ovine serotype A2 isolate (rOmpA2) were overexpressed, purified, and used to generate anti-rOmpA1 and anti-rOmpA2 antibodies, respectively. Immunogold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence techniques demonstrated that OmpA1 and OmpA2 are surface exposed, and are not masked by the polysaccharide capsule, in a selection of M. haemolytica isolates of various serotypes and grown under different growth conditions. To explore epitope specificity, anti-rOmpA1 and anti-rOmpA2 antibodies were cross-absorbed with the heterologous isolate to remove cross-reacting antibodies. These cross-absorbed antibodies were highly specific and recognized only the OmpA protein of the homologous isolate in Western blot assays. A wider examination of the binding specificities of these antibodies for M. haemolytica isolates representing different OmpA subclasses revealed that cross-absorbed anti-rOmpA1 antibodies recognized OmpA1-type proteins but not OmpA2-type proteins; conversely, cross-absorbed anti-rOmpA2 antibodies recognized OmpA2-type proteins but not OmpA1-type proteins. Our results demonstrate that OmpA1 and OmpA2 are surface exposed and could potentially bind to different receptors in cattle and sheep.

### Isolation of drug-resistant gallibacterium anatis from calves with unresponsive bronchopneumonia, Belgium [^1136JzTt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Like other Pasteurellaceae species, G. anatis most likely acts as an opportunistic bacterium, infecting an already damaged respiratory tract caused by co-infections with viruses or bacteria, as observed in poultry. Unfortunately, viral involvement in the reported outbreaks in our study cannot be confirmed because we did not perform any viral diagnostics. However, the combined observations we have made suggest that G. anatis can act as an opportunistic bacterium in a multifactorial disease complex rather than being a highly virulent pathogen that spreads clonally during a clinical outbreak. To what extent G. anatis isolated from cattle in our study can survive in the environment remains unknown.

A second major finding of our study is the multiresistant nature of the retrieved G. anatis isolates. All isolates obtained in the study demonstrated acquired resistance against 5–7 different antimicrobial classes, defining them as multidrug-resistant. Although the lack of species-specific clinical breakpoints precludes drawing firm conclusions, the clinical observation of unresponsiveness to antimicrobial treatment with various agents also supports this theory. Because antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated susceptibility for only cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or both in all isolates, the isolates can even be defined as extensively drug-resistant. Also, for G. anatis isolated from poultry, a high prevalence of multidrug resistance has been demonstrated. However, the isolates retrieved in our study also demonstrated acquired resistance against fluoroquinolones, ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, florfenicol, and gentamicin. Furthermore, the level and prevalence of multidrug resistance observed in the G. anatis isolates we analyzed surpasses previously described multidrug resistance in bovine Pasteurellaceae.

### One health intervention for the control and elimination of scrub typhus, anthrax, and brucellosis in southeast Asia: a systematic review [^113EE2j8]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

OH activities, targeting the different prevention levels of the zoonotic diseases, help forming proactive strategies to combat disease spread. Milk pasteurisation stands out as a fundamental preventive measure, particularly for diseases, like brucellosis, transmitted through contaminated dairy products. Additionally, the implementation of a "test and segregation" or "test-and-cull" approach for brucellosis infected animals can help prevent the spread of the disease within livestock populations. Though, contradictory opinions like, adequacy of common milk boiling practice instead of pasteurisation; questionable practicality and availability of segregation spaces in test-and-segregation approach for brucellosis-positive animals; and cultural and religious non-acceptance for the test-and-cull approach have been documented causing hindrance to optimal outcome.

The effectiveness of vaccination programmes for zoonotic diseases is underscored, since minimal number of diseases are preventable through vaccines, and these are restricted for the cattle only. However, challenges involving the cost and non-availability of vaccines, inaccessible remote areas persist in several Asian countries, highlighting the need for a sustainable strategy for logistic management. Also, tackling disease transmission from free-grazing animals, sharing communal water ponds, overcrowded shelters, unrestricted visits in smallholder backyard farms is another area that is to be approached recognising the actual root-cause.

### Pasteurella infections in south Korea and systematic review and meta-analysis of Pasteurella bacteremia [^117WbwF5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and Clinical Features of Pasteurella Infections

We included a total of 283 cases in the study, 70 from hospital patients with complete data and 213 cases from the main reference laboratory with basic information. We observed an increase in the number of infections caused by Pasteurella spp. from 2018 (n = 46) to 2022 (n = 72) (Figure 3); the increase was significant on the basis of the national population data extracted from the Korean Statistical Information Service (p = 0.012). The median number of cases per year was 55. The predominant species were P. multocida (68.9%, 195/283) and P. canis (25.4%, 72/283), both of which contributed to the increase in infections. The median age of patients with positive culture results was 52.0 years. The number of Pasteurella isolation samples was higher in women (66.4%, 188/283) than in men (33.6%, 95/283). We observed the most cases in patients in the 50‒59-year age group (Figure 3). The ratio of female to male patients was the highest (3.4:1) for patients 20‒29 years of age. Most patients had a history of companion animal exposure (88.6%, 62/70) (Appendix Table 6); half had history of dog exposure and 38.7% (24/62) cat exposure. The rate of polymicrobial infection was 25.7% (18/70). The detected isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Actinomyces spp. (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 1), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Dermabacter hominis (n = 1). The rate of hospitalization was 54.3% (38/70). We noted no significant differences in characteristics between inpatients and outpatients (Appendix Table 7). Among all the patients, most patients were mainly from Seoul (23.0%, 65/283), whereas those included in the reference laboratory study were predominantly from Gyeongsang-do (33.0%, 71/213) and Gyeonggi-do (17.4%, 37/213) (Appendix Figure 1). All patients, except for 3 outpatients, had received antimicrobial therapy. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and first-generation cephalosporins (Appendix Table 4).

### Epidemiology of Mycobacterium bovis disease in humans, the Netherlands, 1993–2007 [^114ZANNL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

The second age peak contains elderly native-born Dutch persons. This result is most likely a birth-cohort effect because these persons most probably had a late endogenous reactivation of latent M. bovis infection contracted in the era before pasteurization of milk was introduced and while M. bovis infection in livestock was still highly prevalent in the Netherlands. Spoligotyping of their isolates showed a single typical pattern, which is considered the old predominant cattle-endemic strain of the Netherlands. This epidemiologic trend has also been seen in other European countries, including Norway, Sweden, and Belgium.

Endogenous reactivation of M. bovis infections in elderly patients follows impairment of immunity from hematologic causes, immune modulation by medication (including anti–TNF-α treatment), other coexisting conditions, or immunosenescence. As the use of anti–TNF-α treatment rises, due to increasing indications of rheumatologic and gastrointestinal diseases, mycobacterial disease will likely become more common. Two of the patients we described had negative tuberculin skin test (for M. tuberculosis complex) and chest radiograph results and, therefore did not receive isoniazid prophylaxis before they received anti–TNF-α treatment. This result calls into question the efficacy of the screening protocol used in the Netherlands to evaluate patients before they receive anti–TNF-α treatment. Of note, reactivations of latent TB usually occur in the first 3–4 months of anti–TNF-α therapy, although in our 2 M. bovis patients, reactivation occurred after 1 year. This long-term asymptomatic reactivation of disease has been previously observed and raises questions involving the role of the bacteriologic virulence factor in the pace of the reactivations.

### No change in risk for antibiotic-resistant salmonellosis from beef, United States, 2002–2010 [^117VLyPG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Restricting antibiotic use in food production animals is a target for reducing antimicrobial drug-resistant infections in humans. We used US surveillance data to estimate the probability of antibiotic-resistant nontyphoidal salmonellosis per meal made with beef during 2002–2010. Applying data for nontyphoidal Salmonella in raised-without-antibiotics cattle, we tested the effect of removing antibiotic use from all beef cattle production. We found an average of 1.2 (95% credible interval 0.6–4.2) antibiotic-resistant nontyphoidal salmonellosis cases per 1 million beef meals made with beef initially contaminated with antibiotic-resistant nontyphoidal Salmonella at slaughter or retail and 0.031 (95% credible interval 0.00018–0.14) cases per 1 million meals irrespective of beef contamination status. Neither outcome showed sustained change except for increases in 2003 and 2009 (> 98% confidence) when larger or more outbreaks occurred. Switching all beef production to a raised-without-antibiotics system may not have a significant effect on antibiotic-resistant nontyphoidal salmonellosis (94.3% confidence).

### Notes from the field: human Brucella abortus RB51 infections caused by consumption of unpasteurized domestic dairy products-United States, 2017–2019 [^116KH6Q9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

RB51 is a live, attenuated vaccine that has been used to vaccinate cattle against B. abortus in the United States since 1996. Although rare, it is possible for cattle to shed RB51 in their milk, even when vaccine label recommendations are followed. Consuming this raw milk can cause human infections, which, unlike infections caused by field Brucella strains, do not stimulate an antibody response detectable by commercially available serological assays and can be missed by tests normally used for diagnosis. In addition, RB51 is resistant to rifampin, a first-line antibiotic used to treat human brucellosis. When evaluating patients whose symptoms are consistent with brucellosis, clinicians should consider RB51 infection and inquire about raw milk consumption as part of the patient's exposure history.

Several actions could be considered to reduce the risk for raw milk–related RB51 human infections. CDC recommends that public health and regulatory authorities continue supporting pasteurization and consider further restricting the sale and distribution of raw milk and raw milk products in their jurisdictions.* States might explore options such as the United States Animal Health Association's recommendations that state animal health officials and cattle industry representatives evaluate the need for the RB51 vaccine in areas where B. abortus is not endemic in wildlife. Modifying current RB51 vaccine labels to include information about possible shedding in milk could also improve awareness. Finally, veterinarians and dairy farm owners need to be aware that RB51 vaccination might pose a risk when given to cows whose milk is intended to be consumed unpasteurized.

### Clinically atypical cutaneous mycobacteriosis: a therapeutic challenge [^116wKCJd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium caprae, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, causes tuberculosis in humans and animals, but the incidence in humans is very low worldwide. Direct contact with animals and with unpasteurized dairy products is the most frequent source of contagion. Cutaneous tuberculosis supposes a diagnostic challenge due to its variety of clinical manifestations and the difficulty in demonstrating resistant acid-alcohol bacilli in histological samples. In cases of high suspicion, the initiation of antituberculosis treatment should be considered empirically. Combined therapeutic regimens are necessary to prevent long-term resistance and complications, although the duration of treatment has not been fully established.

### Monomeric expression of bovine beta2-integrin subunits reveals their role in mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin-induced biological effects [^111hJVSn]. Infection and Immunity (2007). Low credibility.

The ruminant-specific leukotoxin (Lkt) of Mannheimia haemolytica is the key virulence factor contributing to the pathogenesis of lung injury in bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. Previous studies by us and others indicate that M. haemolytica Lkt binds to CD18, the beta subunit of bovine beta(2)-integrins on leukocytes, and that the species specificity of Lkt-induced effects is resident in the beta subunit CD18 and not in the alpha subunit CD11. However, Lkt also binds to the CD11a subunit of LFA-1. Furthermore, antibodies specific for CD18 or CD11a inhibit signaling events leading to elevation of intracellular [Ca(2+)], tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic domain of CD18, and cytolysis of bovine leukocytes. These observations underscore the need for further investigation to identify the precise subunit of bovine LFA-1 utilized by M. haemolytica Lkt as the functional receptor. For this purpose, monomeric bovine CD18 and CD11a and heterodimeric LFA-1 were expressed in the HEK-293 cell line by transfection, and the resulting transfectants were tested for susceptibility to Lkt-induced effects. All three transfectants effectively bound Lkt. However, Lkt-induced cytolysis was observed only with transfectants expressing monomeric bovine CD18 or LFA-1. Furthermore, intracellular [Ca(2+)] elevation following exposure to Lkt, which is a marker for postbinding signaling leading to cellular activation, was seen only with transfectants expressing monomeric bovine CD18 or LFA-1. These results clearly indicate that the bovine CD18 subunit of beta(2)-integrins is the functional receptor for M. haemolytica Lkt.

### Vaccination of cattle with the N terminus of lppQ of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides results in type III immune complex disease upon experimental infection [^111eLJdp]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a serious respiratory disease of cattle characterized by coughing, fever, and respiratory distress and causing major economic losses, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Whereas CBPP has been controlled in a number of developed countries through a combination of coordinated surveillance, eradication of whole infected herds, and quarantine, these methods are not effective in developing countries due to geopolitical, economic, and cultural considerations. Vaccination is therefore considered the most appropriate control measure for CBPP in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the most widely deployed vaccine against CBPP in sub-Saharan Africa, as recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), is the live attenuatedsubsp.vaccine strain T1/44, which induces only short-lived immunity and causes severe postvaccine skin lesions in a proportion of vaccinates. In addition, there is evidence that that CBPP-associated lung damage has a significant immunological component. Development of an improved vaccine for CBPP therefore requires careful evaluation of antigen candidates used for a vaccine and exclusion of those components that induce enhancement of the disease.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113QE2RB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL TEACHING POINTS

Human brucellosis is a very common illness worldwide. Four brucella species — melitensis, suis, abortus and canis — cause the majority of human illness, with B. melitensis being the most common.
Brucellosis is generally transmitted by direct contact with infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats or pigs) or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The incubation period is days to months.
Though brucellosis can involve any organ system, it usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, including undulating fevers, night sweats, malaise, weight loss and arthralgias. It can also present with focal brucellosis syndromes, including meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis or epididymoorchitis.
Granulomatous hepatitis is caused by infections (e.g. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, Q fever, brucellosis, syphilis, cryptococcosis, leprosy), drugs, malignancy (e.g. lymphomas, renal cell carcinoma) or autoimmune diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, primary biliary cirrhosis). Up to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic.
The social history is often a key discriminating feature in febrile illnesses, particularly for patients who travel outside of industrialized areas. They are often exposed to infections that are not routinely considered.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial strains and growth conditions.

Two keyreference strains, PH2 and PH202, were used in this study. Isolate PH2 is of serotype A1 and was isolated from the lungs of a confirmed case of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis, whereas isolate PH202 is of serotype A2 and was recovered from the nasopharynx of a clinically healthy calf on a disease-free farm. The two isolates were characterized in previous comparative studies of. The bacterial isolates were stored at −80°C in 50% (vol/vol) glycerol–brain heart infusion broth (BHIB; Oxoid) and were subcultured on brain heart infusion agar (Oxoid) containing 5% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep's blood (blood agar) overnight at 37°C. Broth cultures were prepared by inoculation of 25-ml volumes of BHIB from overnight growth on blood agar and incubation at 37°C and 120 rpm.

### Whole-genome sequencing and concordance between antimicrobial susceptibility genotypes and phenotypes of bacterial isolates associated with bovine respiratory disease [^112wm46G]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Historically, bacterial pathogens were identified by biochemical, antigen, or PCR-based methods, with results taking from days to weeks. Culture-independent diagnostic testing (CIDT), typically used to identify slow-growing agents or those that cannot be cultured in vitro, is gaining attention due to the availability of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. WGS can reveal a pathogen's identity and uncover other clinically useful information typically garnered through multiple diagnostic tests.

Employment of WGS for pathogen identification in Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Escherichia coli outbreaks demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, but highlighted significant limitations due to the paucity of published pathogen genome sequences. It was recognized that broad sampling and establishing a global genomic database from isolates would be required to understand the genetic diversity and distribution of traits within a pathogen population.

CIDT could be useful in characterizing pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex, the most prevalent and costly cause of mortality for cattle in the United States. Several bacterial pathogens are associated with BRD, with Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida being the most common. Complete bacterial genomes are available for two strains of H. somni, five of M. bovis, 10 of M. haemolytica, and 11 of P. multocida (Table 1).

Table 1
Known reference sequences for the species sequenced in this study

It is important to consider antimicrobial resistance and the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) in treatment decisions associated with common diseases such as BRD. Understanding the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in BRD pathogens in healthy cattle, as well as treated and untreated sick cattle, is crucial to understanding the role of resistance in BRD treatment failure. In addition, the increasing use of WGS in antimicrobial resistance surveillance necessitates a better understanding of the degree of concordance between phenotypic susceptibility and resistance genotype.

The primary objective of this study was to perform WGS on bacterial isolates collected from untreated BRD-affected beef and dairy cattle, and unaffected dairy cattle, to contribute additional bacterial genome sequences that could be used for CIDT in the future. Secondary study objectives were to perform bioinformatic analyses and susceptibility testing to analyze concordance between phenotypic susceptibility and resistance genotype. Identification of distinguishing genomic characteristics, such as ARG, of different strains of the major BRD pathogens may facilitate a better understanding of these pathogens and their host interactions with the goal of identifying improved treatment methods specific to the host species, ARG genotype, and pathogen combination.

### Multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium infection from milk contaminated after pasteurization [^11229Jp7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Table
Review of pasteurized milk outbreaks in the United States, 1960–2000

The outbreak we report led to immediate changes in dairy plant X. The plant hired an outside consultant and addressed FDA's immediate concerns. In addition, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture began to integrate plant employee training with routine inspections. And finally, as routine inspection regimens did not prevent the outbreak, the findings from this investigation prompted FDA to move up its scheduled review of the state milk regulatory program. Although the results of this review are not available to federal authorities or the public, Pennsylvania's milk control program now satisfies all of the FDA criteria for certification.

Current milk standards are designed largely to safeguard against a failure or breakdown in the process of pasteurization. Our review of milk-borne outbreaks suggests that inadequate pasteurization is a relatively uncommon event compared to contamination after pasteurization. Additional regulatory emphasis on post pasteurization monitoring, such as coliform and standard plate count, may be needed for adequate protection.

### Rapidly growing bullous plaque on the hand [^114MNwbq]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. SCC — Incorrect. SCC most commonly presents on sun-damaged skin as an erythematous hyperkeratotic papulonodule, but the clinical presentation can be variable. Histologically, SCC displays overlying parakeratosis, atypical keratinocytes invading the dermis.
B. Ecthyma contagiosum (orf) — Incorrect. The clinical history (cattle farmer) of this case does not match that of orf. Orf is caused by a different virus in the Poxviridae family of viruses than milker's nodules and is transmitted by direct contact with infected sheep and goats. Milker's nodules are associated with cattle, although the clinical and histologic presentation of the 2 viruses is identical. The collective term for these viruses is "farmyard pox".
C. Cutaneous anthrax — Incorrect. Transmission of anthrax from Bacillus anthracis is mainly through contact with infected animals (wild and domestic) or contaminated animal products (leather, wool, or meat). The skin lesions are typically located on the arms, face, and neck and consist of a nontender bulla or ulcer surrounded by erythema that develops into a necrotic plaque.
D. Herpetic whitlow — Incorrect. Herpetic whitlow is caused from an infection with herpes simplex virus on the digits. It presents as recurrent local erythema, edema, and tender grouped vesiculopustules progressing to erosions. The diagnosis can be made clinically but additional testing is definitive.
E. Milker's nodule — Correct. This zoonotic dermatosis is caused by a parapox virus transmitted from infected lesions on dairy cattle to humans via direct contact. It is most commonly observed in young people who have recently started milking cattle or in veterinary students. The infection in cattle is usually mild and characterized by papules in the muzzle area that can be difficult to see. This is more common than cowpox, which is caused by a member of Orthopoxvirus and is endemic in wild rodents. The lesions typically develop through different clinical stages similar to orf. At the inoculation site, a red-blue papule develops, which quickly progresses into a pustule or bullae with central umbilication and crusting. The lesion is typically tender and it is associated with mild fever and malaise.

### Inflammatory cytokines enhance the interaction of mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin with bovine peripheral blood neutrophils in vitro [^116MJxPU]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica A1 produces several virulence factors that play an important role in the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. Foremost among these is a leukotoxin (LKT) that specifically kills ruminant leukocytes. Recent evidence suggests that M. haemolytica LKT binding to bovine leukocytes is mediated by the beta(2)-integrin CD11a/CD18 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 [LFA-1]), which subsequently induces activation and cytolysis of these cells. Inflammatory cytokines, which are released during viral and bacterial infection, are reported to increase LFA-1 expression and conformational activation. We investigated the effects of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) on the interaction of M. haemolytica LKT with bovine peripheral blood neutrophils (PMNs). In this study we demonstrated, by flow cytometry, that bovine PMNs increased their binding to an anti-bovine LFA-1 monoclonal antibody (BAT75A) following in vitro incubation with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, or IFN-gamma. Incubation with cytokines also increased CD18 expression, as assessed by real-time PCR and by Western blotting. Increased LFA-1 expression by PMNs exposed to cytokines was associated with increased LKT binding and cytotoxicity. The latter represented, at least in part, enhanced PMN apoptosis, as assessed by propidium iodine staining and caspase-3 activation. The results of this study suggest that inflammatory cytokines may play an important role in enhancing the biological response of bovine PMNs to M. haemolytica LKT.

### Risk factors for human brucellosis in Northern tanzania [^111crqfs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Little is known about the epidemiology of human brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa. This hampers prevention and control efforts at the individual and population levels. To evaluate risk factors for brucellosis in northern Tanzania, we conducted a study of patients presenting with fever to two hospitals in Moshi, Tanzania. Serum taken at enrollment and at 4–6 week follow-up was tested by Brucella microagglutination test. Among participants with a clinically compatible illness, confirmed brucellosis cases were defined as having a ≥ 4-fold rise in agglutination titer between paired sera or a blood culture positive for Brucella spp., and probable brucellosis cases were defined as having a single reciprocal titer ≥ 160. Controls had reciprocal titers < 20 in paired sera. We collected demographic and clinical information and administered a risk factor questionnaire. Of 562 participants in the analysis, 50 (8.9%) had confirmed or probable brucellosis. Multivariable analysis showed that risk factors for brucellosis included assisting goat or sheep births (Odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 24.6) and having contact with cattle (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.4). Consuming boiled or pasteurized dairy products was protective against brucellosis (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02, 0.93). No participants received a clinical diagnosis of brucellosis from their healthcare providers. The under-recognition of brucellosis by healthcare workers could be addressed with clinician education and better access to brucellosis diagnostic tests. Interventions focused on protecting livestock keepers, especially those who assist goat or sheep births, are needed.

### Coxiella burnetii pneumonia [^112tVo2L]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

This report reviews the pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestation of infections due to Coxiella burnetii. Q fever, a zoonosis, is due to infection with C. burnetii. This spore-forming microorganism is a small gram-negative coccobacillus that is an obligate intracellular parasite. The most common animal reservoirs are goats, cattle, sheep, cats, and occasionally dogs. The organism reaches high concentrations in the placenta of infected animals. Aerosolisation occurs at the time of parturition and infection follows inhalation of this aerosol. There are three distinct clinical syndromes of the acute form of the illness: nonspecific febrile illness, pneumonia, and hepatitis. The chronic form of Q fever is almost always endocarditis, but occasionally it is manifest as hepatitis, osteomyelitis or endovascular infection. The pneumonic form of the illness can range from very mild-to-severe pneumonia requiring assisted ventilation. Multiple round opacities are a common finding on chest radiography. Treatment with doxycycline or a fluoroquinolone is preferred. Susceptibility to macrolides is variable. In conclusion, Coxiella burnetii pneumonia should be considered when there is a suitable exposure history and when outbreaks of a pneumonic illness are being investigated.

### Q fever pneumonia [^111meNZE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Q fever is a disease found in both humans and animals, caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The epidemiology of Q fever is that of the animal reservoirs of the infection including both direct and indirect contact and use of a variety of products from such animals as cattle, sheep, and goats. Pneumonia is the major manifestation of Q fever in some countries. It is mild to moderate in severity, and mortality is unusual. It can occur as sporadic or outbreak cases.

### Isolation of drug-resistant gallibacterium anatis from calves with unresponsive bronchopneumonia, Belgium [^111DgSph]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Infectious bronchopneumonia has a major economic impact, causing high morbidity and mortality rates in cattle production systems worldwide. Furthermore, it is the main indication for antimicrobial use in calves and youngstock, often resulting in acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bovine respiratory pathogens. Bacterial pathogens commonly involved in bronchopneumonia in cattle are Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, and Pasteurella multocida.

Gallibacterium anatis, a gram-negative coccobacillus within the family Pasteurellaceae, is historically considered an opportunistic pathogen of intensively reared poultry and domestic birds, where it is mainly isolated from the upper respiratory and lower genital tracts. G. anatis has emerged as a multidrug-resistant pathogen in poultry, mainly causing salpingitis, resulting in decreased egg production and increased mortality rates but also peritonitis, epididymitis, and respiratory tract lesions. In humans, G. anatis has been occasionally associated with chronic bronchitis, lung abscesses, bacteremia, and death.

G. anatis has rarely been isolated in Belgium, from bovine feces or from unknown sources, but has not, to the authors' knowledge, been reported from nasopharyngeal and tracheal bacterial communities of healthy cattle or cattle with bacterial bronchopneumonia. Therefore, whether G. anatis plays a role in the bovine respiratory disease complex as a facultative pathogenic bacterium remains unclear. Our study reports the detection of multiple independent G. anatis isolates from cattle with unresponsive infectious bronchopneumonia; our findings are supported by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize AMR and genetic relatedness.

### How does Pasteurella multocida respond to the host environment? [^1149kDpz]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Pasteurella multocida is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen, which causes diseases of economic importance in a wide range of animal species. The response of P. multocida to the host environment has been analysed at the transcription level, using DNA microarrays, and at the protein-expression level, using proteomics techniques. Furthermore, a growing number of P. multocida-directed mutants have been assessed for their ability to cause disease. Although technical impediments mean that it is currently difficult to analyse bacterial responses at the earliest stages of infection, it is clear that during later stages of infection the bacteria encounter host niches that require them to modify the expression of genes involved in central energy metabolism and in the uptake of various nutrients such as iron and amino acids. Furthermore, in vitro experiments have defined the varying bacterial responses to low iron and to different iron sources, including haemoglobin and transferrin. To date, most P. multocida genes shown to be upregulated during infection are involved in nutrient acquisition and metabolic processes, indicating that true virulence genes might be constitutively expressed, upregulated only during initial stages of infection or upregulated at levels below current detection limits.

### Modulation of the immune system and the response against pathogens with bovine colostrum concentrates [^115oos2d]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

The growth, development and health conditions for children living under deprived conditions in developing countries are so adverse that immediate public health measures to reduce morbidity and improve nutrition are urgently needed. Preventing and shortening the course of diarrhoeal episodes, eliminating protozoal colonization, and balancing intestinal microflora would all contribute to these goals. The consumption by humans of part of the colostrum produced when a dairy animal gives birth is an established tradition in many traditional societies. Recent advances in food technology in industrial dairying allow for continuous availability of stabilized bovine colostrum concentrate, both natural and hyperimmunized against specific human pathogens. This is safe for the calves of the producers themselves, for laboratory animals, and generally for humans, with the caveat of the milk-allergic. Moreover, substantial amounts of orally ingested bovine colostrum concentrate survive their passage through the stomach to remain intact and active in the lower reaches of the bowel. Studies in animals, human volunteers and naturally infected humans have demonstrated a therapeutic efficacy of oral bovine colostrum with certain infections. Similarly, attempts to prevent gastrointestinal infections in animals, exposed volunteers and at-risk populations have met with limited success with specific pathogens. It is time to begin to assess the feasibility and potential effectiveness and efficiency of employing seasonal or chronic bovine colostrum feeding in populations of deprived infantile populations to reduce the rates of recurrent gastroenteritis and decrease immunostimulation to improve vitality and nutritional status in early life.

Previously, we identified bovine CD18 as the receptor for leukotoxin secreted by Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica. In this study, we constructed bovine-murine CD18 chimeras to locate the leukotoxin binding domain on CD18. Leukotoxin specifically lysed transfectants expressing bovine CD18 fragment encompassing amino acids 1 to 291, indicating that leukotoxin binding domain lies within amino acids 1 to 291 of bovine CD18.

### Wind in November, Q fever in December [^111Sxynw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacteria which lives in the phagolysosomes of the host cell. The main characteristic of Q fever is its clinical polymorphism. Acute cases, which are symptomatic in less than 50%, generally manifest as an insolated fever or a flulike syndrome that may be accompanied by granulomatous hepatitis, pneumonia, or meningoencephalitis. Cases with febrile eruptions, myocarditis, and pericarditis have also been reported; the various clinical manifestations may depend on host factors. In chronic Q fever, endocarditis is the primary sign, although osteomyelitis, infections of vascular grafts or aneurisms, and pregnancy complications have also been reported. Thus, a serologic confirmation is required for the diagnosis of Q fever.

Throughout the world, the most common reservoirs of C. burnetii are cattle, sheep, and goats; the bacterium is found in urine, feces, milk, and birth products of infected animals. Also, infected cats, rabbits, and dogs can transmit C. burnetii to people. Human infections mainly occur after persons inhale contaminated aerosols and, rarely, after they ingest unpasteurized milk or cheese.

Milker's nodules (pseudocowpox) are harmless skin lesions most commonly seen in persons whose occupation regularly brings them into close contact with cattle. They are caused by the paravaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family. Awareness of their clinical and histopathologic features is important, especially with today's heightened awareness of the threat of biologic warfare, to distinguish them from more worrisome entities such as tularemia and anthrax.

### Epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype dublin infections among humans, United States, 1968–2013 [^114xPQUS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Salmonella enterica serotype Dublin is a cattle-adapted bacterium that typically causes bloodstream infections in humans. To summarize demographic, clinical, and antimicrobial drug resistance characteristics of human infections with this organism in the United States, we analyzed data for 1968–2013 from 5 US surveillance systems. During this period, the incidence rate for infection with Salmonella Dublin increased more than that for infection with other Salmonella. Data from 1 system (FoodNet) showed that a higher percentage of persons with Salmonella Dublin infection were hospitalized and died during 2005–2013 (78% hospitalized, 4.2% died) than during 1996–2004 (68% hospitalized, 2.7% died). Susceptibility data showed that a higher percentage of isolates were resistant to > 7 classes of antimicrobial drugs during 2005–2013 (50.8%) than during 1996–2004 (2.4%).

### In vivo-expressed genes of Pasteurella multocida [^111XBBro]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Pasteurella multocida is the causative agent of infectious diseases of economic importance such as fowl cholera, bovine hemorrhagic septicemia, and porcine atrophic rhinitis. However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and determinants that P. multocida requires for virulence and pathogenicity is still limited. To address this issue, we developed a genetic expression system, based on the in vivo expression technology approach first described by Mahan et al. (Science 259:686–688, 1993), to identify in vivo-expressed genes of P. multocida. Numerous genes, such as those encoding outer membrane lipoproteins, metabolic and biosynthetic enzymes, and a number of hypothetical proteins, were identified. These may prove to be useful targets for attenuating mutation and/or warrant further investigation for their roles in immunity and/or pathogenesis.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for water disinfection for wilderness, international travel, and austere situations [^112zks2W]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Wilderness settings — risk factors for waterborne infection emphasize upstream activity and CDC precautions: Even in developed countries, regular waterborne disease outbreaks indicate that the microbiologic quality of the water, especially surface water, is not ensured, and public health agencies regularly report outbreaks associated with backcountry, parks, and campground water systems. The environment and activity upstream from the travelers' surface water source defines the risk; side streams draining springs, snowmelt, and glaciers where there is no human or animal activity are lower risk, whereas upstream usage by humans, farm animals, or wildlife pose a major risk. Cattle excrete pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella and have been found to be the major animal species contributing to waterborne disease in North America. Because it is very difficult to exclude animal and human activity in the watershed, the Centers for Disease Control recommend treating surface water before ingestion as a precaution to protect health.

### Epidemiology of Salmonella enterica serotype dublin infections among humans, United States, 1968–2013 [^1139QFT5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Salmonella Dublin is a cattle-adapted Salmonella serotype that causes severe and antimicrobial drug–resistant infections in humans and cattle, and its incidence is on the rise. Reducing Salmonella Dublin carriage by cattle could benefit animal and human health. Unlike most other Salmonella infections in food animals, Salmonella Dublin can cause high mortality rates, particularly among calves, and heavy economic burdens for producers. It is well established that use of antimicrobial agents is a major driving force for the global surge in antimicrobial resistance. Food animal management practices, including veterinary use of antimicrobial drugs, may be contributing to the increasing resistance in Salmonella Dublin and to Salmonella Dublin–associated illness and death among humans. Therefore, careful evaluation of management practices and judicious use of antimicrobial drugs in cattle is critical for the control of antimicrobial drug–resistant Salmonella Dublin infections in cattle and humans. The 2016 FDA Veterinary Feed Directive aims to eliminate the use for food production purposes (i.e.g.rowth promotion and feed efficiency) of antimicrobial drugs that are considered medically important in humans and seeks to bring all remaining therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents in feed and water under the oversight of licensed veterinarians. Agricultural and public health authorities will need to engage in ongoing, meaningful collaborations to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use in food-producing animals to protect human and animal health.

### Patients with overlapping diagnoses of asthma and COPD: is livestock exposure a risk factor for comorbidity and coexisting symptoms and infections? [^112PE4Rx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A plausible biological mechanism to explain the significant association observed between presence of goats and anxiety is unknown. Nevertheless, people who live in close proximity of goat farms, seem to have a more negative attitude towards farming, which might be related to the Q-fever outbreak in the study area several years prior to the study. Concerns regarding the health effects of environmental exposures as well as perceived exposure are well-documented determinants of various clusters of "non-specific" symptoms, but this is highly unlikely for GP-diagnosed disorders or infections such as pneumonia.

For some health outcomes we could verify the risk of living nearby livestock farms. Although it is yet unclear which environmental agents could be responsible for the observed associations, it was recently shown that livestock farms are a source of endotoxins in the areas included in the present study. Moreover, the proxies of livestock exposure that we used were significantly associated with measured endotoxin concentrations. Despite our focus on risk, interestingly enough, a lower prevalence of comorbid conditions was often observed in the control area, and in some cases, in relation to exposure proxies in the study area. Currently the mechanisms of how exposure and other factors interact and develop across time are not well-understood. The analysis described in this article contributes to this lacuna, but further research into these mechanisms is needed to determine which risk mitigation interventions are recommended from a public health perspective.

### Application of four genotyping methods to Mycoplasma bovis isolates derived from Western Canadian feedlot cattle [^116krHW1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample collection.

A series of cross-sectional studies, spanning the years 2006 to 2018, provided 129isolates, which were recovered from the nasopharynges, lungs, and joints of feedlot cattle, as described previously. Five isolates were recovered from cattle imported from Idaho, USA, while all others were from cattle resident in western Canada. The deep nasopharyngeal (DNP) swabs were obtained from healthy and morbid cattle. Each animal's health status was determined by the timing of the disease and the presentation of clinical signs. BRD is the most common disease of feedlot cattle, and cases peak within 21 days after arrival at the feedlot. Thus, a putative BRD diagnosis was based on the timing of the disease and a constellation of the clinical signs consistent with this disease (i.e. fever, depression, nasal discharge, dyspnea). Health status was determined by trained feedlot personnel. The DNP swabs from live cattle were obtained in accordance with Animal Use Protocols (no. 20070023 and 20170021) approved by the University of Saskatchewan's Animal Research Ethics Board and Lethbridge Research Centre's Animal Care Committee (no. 1641). Lung and joint samples were obtained at the time of postmortem examination from cattle with gross pathological findings consistent with caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia and, in some instances, concurrent septic arthritis.

### Q fever in Southern California: 11 patient cases from a community-based organization [^1168AZPA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Summary of demographic and clinical features of Q fever cases

Of significant interest, our findings revealed that a greater proportion of cases (nine) occurred between 2018 and 2019, which is of unclear etiology. Symptom onset was most frequent during the spring (three) and summer (five), with a peak in August (three). In addition, exposure to goats and cattle was the predominant risk factor for infection in our patients than exposure to rodents, dogs, cats, and sheep as reported in other studies in southern California. We identified two female patients with Q fever as compared with none by Akamine et al. Another distinctive finding from other studies is almost half of our patients were diabetic (five) and of Hispanic/Latino (five) descent.

Our cases highlight that Q fever may be a bigger threat than previously thought in Riverside and San Bernardino counties of southern California. Our findings may also provide early evidence for an increasing trend of infection in this region. Health-care professionals should be vigilant in screening for infection in patients particularly presenting with a febrile illness associated with transaminitis, leukocytosis, pneumonia, and exposure to goats and cattle. We agree with the authors' recommendation for early infectious diseases consultation to expedite diagnosis and treatment that may improve outcomes and potentially prevent complications of the infection. Further studies with larger cohorts involving multiple health-care institutions in southern California are warranted to confirm our observations for greater public health awareness.

### Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws-United States, 1993–2006 [^113M49Bz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Although pasteurization eliminates pathogens and consumption of nonpasteurized dairy products is uncommon, dairy-associated disease outbreaks continue to occur. To determine the association of outbreaks caused by nonpasteurized dairy products with state laws regarding sale of these products, we reviewed dairy-associated outbreaks during 1993–2006. We found 121 outbreaks for which the product's pasteurization status was known; among these, 73 (60%) involved nonpasteurized products and resulted in 1,571 cases, 202 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths. A total of 55 (75%) outbreaks occurred in 21 states that permitted sale of nonpasteurized products; incidence of nonpasteurized product-associated outbreaks was higher in these states. Nonpasteurized products caused a disproportionate number (≈150× greater/unit of product consumed) of outbreaks and outbreak-associated illnesses and also disproportionately affected persons < 20 years of age. States that restricted sale of nonpasteurized products had fewer outbreaks and illnesses; stronger restrictions and enforcement should be considered.

### Pathogenic mannheimia haemolytica invades differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells [^111dqQ97]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

On the basis of the observations described above, we propose a model for the invasion of differentiated BBECs by serotype A1(Fig. 8). After initial adherence to the epithelial cell surface (i), bacteria are taken up by nonciliated epithelial cells via an endocytotic-type mechanism (ii). Rapid bacterial replication (iii) subsequently occurs within endosomes present in the cytoplasm of infected epithelial cells, and these likely fuse with the lateral membranes releasing bacteria into the paracellular spaces (iv). Bacteria are taken up laterally by adjacent epithelial cells (v), and further replication within the paracellular spaces (vi) and in secondarily infected cells (vii) occurs. These events very quickly lead to disruption of tight junctions, rupture and death of epithelial cells, and the release of large numbers of bacteria onto the epithelial surface (viii). Thus, the initial uptake of a relatively small number of bacteria leads to their rapid replication and spread to adjacent cells, resulting in the observed formation of foci of infection and destruction of the epithelial cell layer. The rapid replication and release of large numbers of bacteria onto the epithelial surface, as proposed in this model, provide a potential mechanism which might explain the explosive proliferation of serotype A1that occurs in the URT of cattle prior to the onset of disease. Although in vivo evidence for invasion of respiratory airway epithelium byis lacking, it is noteworthy that descriptions of the pathology and histopathology of BRD focus almost exclusively on lesions of the lungs. In addition, experimental challenge studies involvingtypically involve intratracheal inoculation of bacteria and subsequent assessment that again focuses on changes in lung pathology. This challenge method does not replicate natural infection, and host-pathogen interactions involving airway epithelia of the trachea and upper respiratory tract are completely bypassed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111uLr8V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infected animal bite–related wounds — treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Foot-and-mouth disease in Asia [^116k6qGo]. Virus Research (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 FMDV and concurrent infection

There has been limited direct research on the interaction of FMDV with other pathogenic or commensal organisms, despite the importance of bacterial superinfection to the outcome of the disease; nor has there been much research upon the effects of co-infection with multiple serotypes. FMDV typically does not cause fatalities in adult animals; however, it leaves infected animals severely immunosuppressed, leading to secondary bacterial complications, primarily due to Pasteurella multocida. Thus FMDV infection in combination with P. multocida was found to be 2.66 times more prevalent than FMDV infection alone; and for example, there have been several reports from India of concurrent outbreaks of FMD and hemorrhagic septicemia since 2013 and in Bangladesh, firstly documented in the current year, 2024. Co-infections with multiple serotypes Asia 1 and O and O and A were recorded in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Distinct cardiac lesions and high mortality rates in adult cattle caused by Mannheimia hemolytica infection have also been observed during multiple FMD outbreaks in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A recent study in China found 23 viruses in FMDV carrier bovidae, with the most common infections being FMDV, bovine orthopneumovirus, and Choristoneura fumiferana granulovirus. Surprisingly, porcine circovirus type 2 and pepper mild mottle virus were also found.

### Comparative pathogenesis of bovine and porcine respiratory coronaviruses in the animal host species and SARS-CoV-2 in humans [^1165fPy9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discovery of bats with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (CoVs) raised the specter of potential future outbreaks of zoonotic SARS-CoV-like disease in humans, which largely went unheeded. Nevertheless, the novel SARS-CoV-2 of bat ancestral origin emerged to infect humans in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and then became a global pandemic. Less than 5months after its emergence, millions of people worldwide have been infected asymptomatically or symptomatically and at least 360,000 have died. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in severely affected patients includes atypical pneumonia characterized by a dry cough, persistent fever, and progressive dyspnea and hypoxia, sometimes accompanied by diarrhea and often followed by multiple organ failure, especially of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In this minireview, we focus on two endemic respiratory CoV infections of livestock: bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Both animal respiratory CoVs share some common features with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. BCoV has a broad host range including wild ruminants and a zoonotic potential. BCoV also has a dual tropism for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. These aspects, their interspecies transmission, and certain factors that impact disease severity in cattle parallel related facets of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in humans. PRCV has a tissue tropism for the upper and lower respiratory tracts and a cellular tropism for type 1 and 2 pneumocytes in lung but is generally a mild infection unless complicated by other exacerbating factors, such as bacterial or viral coinfections and immunosuppression (corticosteroids).

INTRODUCTION

is associated with a plethora of diseases in cattle. Reviews on this subject commonly emphasize its role in chronic pneumonia, mastitis, and arthritis. While the incidence ofmastitis in Canada is relatively low, it is considered an emerging disease of dairy cattle. The incursion ofinto New Zealand and that country's considerable efforts to eradicate this organism underscore its potential to cause significant economic losses to the dairy industry. In the feedlot industry, is associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and chronic pneumonia and polyarthritis syndrome (CPPS). However, its role in the pathogenesis of BRD has been equivocal. In the early 1990s, it was hypothesized thatwas unlikely to be a primary pathogen but potentiated the pathogenesis of other bacterial BRD agents. It is now considered a primary pathogen of pneumonia in preweaned calves and an opportunistic pathogen of BRD in feedlot cattle. Cattle are frequently asymptomatic carriers; the organism is recovered from the nasal passages of healthy cattle. It is hypothesized that stressors such as transport, commingling, and adverse climatic conditions trigger a stress response, resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids that may impair the immune response, allowing for increased bacterial shedding and clinical disease.

### Pathogenic mannheimia haemolytica invades differentiated bovine airway epithelial cells [^112ZFTpU]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we hypothesized that serotype A1 and A2 strains ofinteract with and stimulate differentiated BBECs in different ways. In particular, since various bacterial pathogens of the human respiratory tract are known to invade human AECs, we wished to explore the possibility that serotype A1invades bovine AECs. Here, we demonstrated that pathogenic serotype A1, but not commensal serotype A2, invades and replicates within bovine AECs. Importantly, the discovery of this invasion process provides a possible explanation for the explosive proliferation of serotype A1 bacteria that occurs in the bovine URT before the onset of pneumonic disease and thereby opens avenues for the development of new disease intervention strategies.

### Enhanced expression of interleukin-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 in ileal tissues of cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [^112U11CV]. Infection and Immunity (2003). Low credibility.

Infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is associated with high levels of morbidity, decreased production, and early culling in dairy cattle. Clinical symptoms of Johne's disease include persistent diarrhea, inappetence, and resultant weight loss due to chronic inflammation of the small intestine. Although the presence or absence of intestinal lesions cannot be used as a definitive indicator of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection, most infected cattle exhibit significant changes to intestinal mucosa, with the focus of pathology surrounding the ileal cecal junction. Typical pathology of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection includes inflammation, thickening of the lumenal wall, and hyperplasia in draining lymph nodes. To further understand the pathology of Johne's disease, we compared the gene expression profiles of ileal tissues from Johne's disease-positive (n = 6), and Johne's disease-negative (n = 5) Holstein cattle. Gene expression profiles were compared with a bovine total leukocyte (BOTL-3) cDNA microarray. Genes that were expressed at significantly higher levels (> 1.5-fold; P < 0.05) in tissues from Johne's disease-infected animals relative to noninfected animals included those encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAF1), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), MCP-2, N-cadherin, and beta1 integrin (CD29). Dramatic upregulation of IL-1alpha (21.5-fold) and TRAF1 (27.5-fold) gene expression in tissues of Johne's disease-positive cows relative to tissues from control cows was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Western blot analysis confirmed that IL-1alpha and TRAF1 mRNA levels resulted in increased protein expression in tissues of Johne's disease-positive cattle relative to tissues from control cattle. High levels of IL-1alpha can produce symptoms similar to those found in clinical Johne's disease. Taken together, the data presented in this report suggest that many outward symptoms of Johne's disease may be due to IL-1alpha toxicity. In addition, enhanced levels of TRAF1 could result in cells within the lesions of Johne's disease-positive cattle that are highly resistant to TNF-alpha-induced signaling.

The report purposefully omits certain bacterial pathogens and intracellular bacteria, and future directions for research and model development include the following three goals: the first is advancing model development for human-relevant insights, the second is a focus on mechanistic studies that are unfeasible in humans, and finally, the third is the establishment of a preclinical assessment network.

### Q fever in Southern California: a case series of 20 patients from a VA medical center [^115zAkrb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Coxiella burnetii is the obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria responsible for query fever (Q fever), which is known to cause acute and chronic infection in humans. The clinical manifestations of acute and chronic infection are often nonspecific and can be widely variable, which makes establishing the diagnosis challenging. Acute infection, although often nonspecific or even asymptomatic, can present with fever, myalgia, headache, or gastrointestinal symptoms, and chronic infection can range from granulomatous hepatitis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia to endocarditis. Transmission is predominantly from direct contact with infected animals or their birth products, although multiple modes of transmission have been described in humans, including inhalation of contaminated wind-borne material from infected livestock and ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products. – There have even been reports of sexual transmission of Q fever. The reservoirs for Q fever are thought to include both wild and domestic animals spanning many different species and may also include arthropods. However, most patients diagnosed with Q fever do not report any exposure to the known risk factors.

Query fever was first described in 1935 in Queensland, Australia, and has since been reported in almost every country. Twelve years later, Frank Young described the first reported case of Q fever in Los Angeles County, where the dairy industry was flourishing and geographically concentrated. Subsequent studies conducted in southern California in the 1940s and 1950s, to better characterize the disease and its endemicity, associated Q fever with exposure to domestic livestock, mostly sheep, goats, and cattle. These studies reported that the largest number of serologically positive animals were from southern California, as compared with northern California, and suggested sheep and goats were primarily responsible for harboring the disease in the north, whereas cattle were predominantly responsible in the south. Not many studies on Q fever in southern California have been conducted recently, and to our knowledge, the most recent study was published in 2006 by Cone et al.who described six cases of Q fever which presented over 32 years in the southern California desert.

We describe the clinical presentation, geographic distribution, and risk factors of 20 patients diagnosed with Q fever at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Loma Linda Healthcare System from 2000 to 2016.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^1113EffU]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Occupational health — pathogen-specific management in laboratory and animal settings includes maintaining a registry of pathogens in use and awareness that laboratory exposures may entail greater inoculum and different clinical presentations than naturally acquired infections. Select agents are defined as biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health, and possession and handling of these pathogens are strictly regulated by federal law (Bioterrorism Preparedness Act). Nonhuman primates, particularly macaque species, can be asymptomatic carriers of B virus, a herpesvirus with > 70% mortality in untreated humans, and all macaque exposure incidents should have targeted training, decontamination, and treatment protocols meeting national guidelines. Rabies researchers/staff dealing with wild or feral animals should have pre-exposure immunization and sero-monitoring, poxvirus researchers should be offered Vaccinia vaccination as well as counseling specific to poxvirus risk factors such as atopic dermatitis, and bite injuries from cats, dogs, primates, and large mammals should receive prophylactic antibiotics in many cases. Q fever, carried by cattle, sheep, and goats, is notable for infection after very small inoculums; exposed staff should be closely monitored for early treatment to prevent endocarditis and other sequelae. Toxoplasmosis is extremely dangerous to pregnant and immune-compromised patients; post-exposure prophylaxis regimens are available but toxic, and serial serologic monitoring may be useful for management decisions.

### Vaccination of cattle with the N terminus of lppQ of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides results in type III immune complex disease upon experimental infection [^113BAJ8w]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a serious respiratory disease of cattle caused bysubsp. Current vaccines against CBPP induce short-lived immunity and can cause severe postvaccine reactions. Previous studies have identified the N terminus of the transmembrane lipoprotein Q (LppQ-N′) ofsubsp.as the major antigen and a possible virulence factor. We therefore immunized cattle with purified recombinant LppQ-N′ formulated in Freund's adjuvant and challenged them withsubsp. Vaccinated animals showed a strong seroconversion to LppQ, but they exhibited significantly enhanced postchallenge glomerulonephritis compared to the placebo group (P = 0.021). Glomerulonephritis was characterized by features that suggested the development of antigen-antibody immune complexes. Clinical signs and gross pathological scores did not significantly differ between vaccinated and placebo groups. These findings reveal for the first time the pathogenesis of enhanced disease as a result of antibodies against LppQ during challenge and also argue against inclusion of LppQ-N′ in a future subunit vaccine for CBPP.

### Whole-genome sequencing and concordance between antimicrobial susceptibility genotypes and phenotypes of bacterial isolates associated with bovine respiratory disease [^112wTRqv]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Extended laboratory culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing timelines hinder rapid species identification and susceptibility profiling of bacterial pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease, the most prevalent cause of cattle mortality in the United States. Whole-genome sequencing offers a culture-independent alternative to current bacterial identification methods, but requires a library of bacterial reference genomes for comparison. To contribute new bacterial genome assemblies and evaluate genetic diversity and variation in antimicrobial resistance genotypes, whole-genome sequencing was performed on bovine respiratory disease–associated bacterial isolates (Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida) from dairy and beef cattle. One hundred genomically distinct assemblies were added to the NCBI database, doubling the available genomic sequences for these four species. Computer-based methods identified 11 predicted antimicrobial resistance genes in three species, with none being detected in M. bovis. While computer-based analysis can identify antibiotic resistance genes within whole-genome sequences (genotype), it may not predict the actual antimicrobial resistance observed in a living organism (phenotype). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 64 H. somni, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida isolates had an overall concordance rate between genotype and phenotypic resistance to the associated class of antimicrobials of 72.7% (P < 0.001), showing substantial discordance. Concordance rates varied greatly among different antimicrobial, antibiotic resistance gene, and bacterial species combinations. This suggests that antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes are needed to complement genomically predicted antibiotic resistance gene genotypes to better understand how the presence of antibiotic resistance genes within a given bacterial species could potentially impact optimal bovine respiratory disease treatment and morbidity/mortality outcomes.

### An update on the Streptococcus bovis group: classification, identification, and disease associations [^112dAsvc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The Streptococcus bovis group has undergone significant taxonomic changes over the past 2 decades with the advent of new identification methods with higher discriminatory power. Although the current classification system is not yet embraced by all researchers in the field and debate remains over the performance of molecular techniques for identification to the species level within the group, important disease associations for several members of the group have been clarified. Here, we provide a brief overview of the history of the S. bovis group, an outline of the currently accepted classification scheme, a review of associated clinical syndromes, and a summary of the performance and diagnostic accuracy of currently available identification methods.

### Biomarkers for detecting resilience against mycobacterial disease in animals [^115qzp4q]. Infection and Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

Paratuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis are two mycobacterial diseases of ruminants which have a considerable impact on livestock health, welfare, and production. These are chronic "iceberg" diseases which take years to manifest and in which many subclinical cases remain undetected. Suggested biomarkers to detect infected or diseased animals are numerous and include cytokines, peptides, and expression of specific genes; however, these do not provide a strong correlation to disease. Despite these advances, disease detection still relies heavily on dated methods such as detection of pathogen shedding, skin tests, or serology. Here we review the evidence for suitable biomarkers and their mechanisms of action, with a focus on identifying animals that are resilient to disease. A better understanding of these factors will help establish new strategies to control the spread of these diseases.

### Global multilocus sequence typing analysis of Mycoplasma bovis isolates reveals two main population clusters [^117XZ3AE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma bovis is a major bovine pathogen associated with bovine respiratory disease complex and is responsible for substantial economic losses worldwide. M. bovis is also associated with other clinical presentations in cattle, including mastitis, otitis, arthritis, and reproductive disorders. To gain a better understanding of the genetic diversity of this pathogen, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme was developed and applied to the characterization of 137 M. bovis isolates from diverse geographical origins, obtained from healthy or clinically infected cattle. After in silico analysis, a final set of 7 housekeeping genes was selected (dnaA, metS, recA, tufA, atpA, rpoD, and tkt). MLST analysis demonstrated the presence of 35 different sequence types (STs) distributed in two main clonal complexes (CCs), defined at the double-locus variant level, namely, CC1, which included most of the British and German isolates, and CC2, which was a more heterogeneous and geographically distant group of isolates, including European, Asian, and Australian samples. Index of association analysis confirmed the clonal nature of the investigated M. bovis population, based on MLST data. This scheme has demonstrated high discriminatory power, with the analysis showing the presence of genetically distant and divergent clusters of isolates predominantly associated with geographical origins.

Twelve cases of Mycobacterium bovis subsp. caprae infection have occurred in four humans, three cattle, and five red deer in western Austria since 1994. DNA-fingerprinting of the isolates suggested transmission in and between these species over several years. Contact with cattle, but not with goats, was found to be associated with three of four human cases.

Diagnostics — outbreak and public health coordination: A broader set of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents should be considered regardless of the presence of fever, bloody or mucoid stools, or other markers of more severe illness in the context of a possible outbreak of diarrheal illness. Selection of agents for testing should be based on a combination of host and epidemiologic risk factors and ideally in coordination with public health authorities.

### Contagious bovine and caprine pleuropneumonia: a research community's recommendations for the development of better vaccines [^113aZtUa]. NPJ Vaccines (2020). Medium credibility.

The limitations of the current CBPP and CCPP vaccines have led to a search for better vaccines. A lapinized vaccine based on the passaged strain Ben-1 has been used during the eradication of CBPP in China in the framework of a comprehensive eradication program. This vaccine is reported to provide 95–100% protection over 2 years, which is superior to other mycoplasma vaccines and most commercial ruminant vaccines. However the method used for its production, intraperitoneal inoculation of sheep, is unacceptable under current animal welfare standards.

An experimental vaccine batch based on the lapinized strain but produced in culture media was compared with the commercial T1/44 vaccine in an in vivo trial on African cattle breeds, but its protective capacity was not superior to the commercial T1/44. One of the key learnings of eradication of CBPP in China is that the lapinized and its sheep-adapted vaccine were paramount for the establishment of immunity zones around enzootic regions besides the other undoubtedly important control measures such as movement control as well as detection and slaughter.

Recently, using a reverse vaccinology approach researchers identified several candidate vaccine antigens that conferred protective immune responses to experimental CBPP challenge. Further work has been ongoing to optimize the vaccine (scale up, duration of immunity, field testing, and comparison with T1/44 vaccine) with commercial acceptance in mind.

Any new vaccine should be tested under different field conditions and different control strategies identified using epidemiological models and previous local experience if available, to guide and inform national and regional control policy makers. An additional consideration is the uptake of livestock vaccines by smallholder farmers and marginalized populations which may require different strategies depending on factors such as the type of disease to be tackled, the value of the livestock species, the market size, profitability as well as the support of national and regional vaccine manufacturers among others. Vaccine adoption is influenced by availability of, access to and demand for vaccines. Global and national vaccine campaigns differ from market-driven approaches. The different strategies to increase adoption of animal vaccines by smallholder farmers especially in low and middle-income countries have been very capably reviewed recentlyand, as mentioned for implementation of control strategies, will not be further discussed.

### Isolation of drug-resistant gallibacterium anatis from calves with unresponsive bronchopneumonia, Belgium [^117PbvME]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Gallibacterium anatis is an opportunistic pathogen, previously associated with deaths in poultry, domestic birds, and occasionally humans. We obtained G. anatis isolates from bronchoalveolar lavage samples of 10 calves with bronchopneumonia unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. Collected isolates were multidrug-resistant to extensively drug-resistant, exhibiting resistance against 5–7 classes of antimicrobial drugs. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 24 different antimicrobial-resistance determinants, including genes not previously described in the Gallibacterium genus or even the Pasteurellaceae family, such as aadA23, bla CARB-8, tet(Y), and qnrD1. Some resistance genes were closely linked in resistance gene cassettes with either transposases in close proximity or situated on putative mobile elements or predicted plasmids. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed large genetic variation between the G. anatis isolates, including isolates retrieved from the same farm. G. anatis might play a hitherto unrecognized role as a respiratory pathogen and resistance gene reservoir in cattle and has unknown zoonotic potential.

### Vaccination of cattle with the N terminus of lppQ of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides results in type III immune complex disease upon experimental infection [^111WFTkB]. Infection and Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of lesions in the kidneys is typically observed in a proportion of cattle infected with CBPP and has been reported in both field and experimental infections. Kidney lesions were also observed in 88 (12.2%) of 716 cattle killed after an outbreak of CBPP in 61 herds between 1990 and 1991 in Lombardy, Italy. Although no attempt was made to isolate livesubsp.from kidneys in the present study, previous isolation of viablesubsp.from kidneys has been achieved. In two of these studies, the presence of viablesubsp.in the kidney was frequently associated with kidney spots. Additionally, it has been demonstrated thatsubsp.antigen can be detected in the kidney, even after the clearance of viablesubsp. In a study by Grieco et al. immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence ofsubsp.antigen in the kidneys of 84.4% of cattle with kidney lesions, with some lesions being surrounded by dense lymphoinflammatory infiltrates. The current data on vasculitis secondary to CBPP infection and vaccination suggest that the renal necrosis has an ischemic basis.

The reaction in the renal cortex is consistent with deposition of antigen-antibody complexes followed by recruitment of proinflammatory cells to affected areas. The thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and the formation of adhesions to the Bowman's capsule are consistent with immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. The pathogenesis of this condition involves penetration of immune complexes across the vascular endothelium but not the basement membrane, resulting in deposition on the endothelial surface. Alternatively, immune complexes may accumulate in the mesangial region of the glomeruli and manifest grossly as thickening of the mesangial basement membrane. Further support for immune complex deposition is given by Grieco et al. who, in acute CBPP infections, observed antigen in the glomeruli as forming a curvilinear pattern in the capillary tuft when immunolabeled. This pattern is consistent with immune complex deposition. The lymphocytic aggregates observed in the present case were also observed by Grieco et al. and may arise from the ability of the tubular epithelial cells to act as antigen-presenting cells since they can express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on their surfaces.

### Potential involvement of gelatinases and their inhibitors in mannheimia haemolytica pneumonia in cattle [^113yaGiM]. Infection and Immunity (2004). Low credibility.

Mannheimia haemolytica infection of the lower respiratory tract of cattle results in a bronchofibrinous pneumonia characterized by massive cellular influx and lung tissue remodeling and scarring. Since altered levels of gelatinases and their inhibitors have been detected in a variety of inflammatory conditions and are associated with tissue remodeling, we examined the presence of gelatinases in lesional and nonlesional lung tissue obtained from calves experimentally infected with M. haemolytica. Lesional tissue had elevated levels of progelatinase A and B and active gelatinase A and B when compared with nonlesional tissue obtained from the same lung lobe. In vitro, M. haemolytica products stimulated production of gelatinase B, but not its activation, by bovine monocytes. Alveolar macrophages showed constitutive production of gelatinase B but no change in response to M. haemolytica products. Bovine neutrophils exposed to M. haemolytica products also released gelatinase B, and there was a significant increase in the activated form of this enzyme. These effects were virtually identical when recombinant O-sialoglycoprotease was used to stimulate these cells. M. haemolytica products also enhanced the expression by bovine monocytes and alveolar macrophages of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Our results provide evidence that matrix metalloproteinases are activated in lung lesions from cattle with shipping fever and that M. haemolytica virulence products induce production, release, and especially activation of gelatinase B by bovine inflammatory cells in vitro.

### Prevention… [^115n7Ayj]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Overview Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a family of bacteria called Brucella. You can get the disease when you come in contact with infected animals or animal products contaminated with the bacteria. Animals that most commonly get brucellosis include cats, dogs, sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hogs, among others. People can get brucellosis by:

- Eating undercooked meat such as sheep, cow, goat, or camel.
- Eating undercooked game meat such as bison, elk, caribou, moose, and wild hog.
- Consuming unpasteurized milk or other dairy products made from contaminated milk.
- Breathing in the bacteria that cause brucellosis.

Prevention Eating or drinking infected animal products The best way to prevent brucellosis infection is to be sure you don't eat or drink:

- Undercooked meat
- Unpasteurized dairy products, including milk, cheese, and ice cream Pasteurization is the heating process used to destroy harmful bacteria that may make milk and milk products unsafe to eat or drink. If you are not sure whether a dairy product is pasteurized, don't eat or drink it. Hunters and those who work with animals People who work with animal tissues and body fluids, including animal caretakers, hunters, butchers, and animal herdsman, are at higher risk of brucellosis infection. If you work with animal tissues, protect yourself by wearing:

### Causes… [^111iVk9F]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Causes Brucellosis in people is mostly caused by four species of Brucella bacteria. Most people get it through close contact with infected animals, often cows, pigs, feral swine, or dogs, or through consumption of contaminated animal products, including uncooked meat and raw milk products. Due to the long incubation period for Brucella, cases often don't have symptoms until weeks or months after exposure.
- A strain of B. abortuscalled RB51 is found in the Brucellalivestock vaccine and rarely causes human infection. Cases that occur are most often associated with veterinary needle-stick exposures while vaccinating cattle. RB51 also passes into cow milk and can cause illness associated with consumption of raw milk products. B. suisinfections account for 25–30% of brucellosis cases and are mostly diagnosed in people who hunt feral swine and contract it from butchering the carcass. Dogs also can contract brucellosis from feral swine and spread the infection to their owners.

B. canisis the least common species found in people. It's transmitted by dogs around the world and generally causes mild illness in people when cases occur.
- Did you recently consume raw milk or milk products.
- Do you work in a slaughterhouse or meat-packing environment.
- Have you recently traveled overseas and did you eat unpasteurized milk products.
- Have you had contact with moose, elk, caribou, bison or wild hogs.
- Have you assisted animals that were giving birth. Brucellaspecies: B. abortus, B. melitensis, or B. s uis.
- Some labs can also conduct culture tests on cerebrospinal fluid, purulent discharge, or joint fluid.
- Infection with B. canis and BrucellaRB51 cannot be detected through serology testing, so labs will have to confirm the infection by these Brucellaewith a culture.

### Pasteurella infections of the head and neck… [^111wKTRN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Infections caused by Pasteurella occur most frequently after domestic animal bites or scratches and in individuals with agricultural or veterinary contact with animals. A serious Pasteurella infection developed in an agricultural worker following tumor extirpation of a head and neck neoplasm. Review of Pasteurella infections in humans disclosed that 31 of 446 reported infections involved head and neck structures. The most serious of these involved the adjacent central nervous system. Surgical drainage combined with parenteral penicillin remains the treatment of choice in these infections. Aminoglycosides are not effective in treating this organism.
