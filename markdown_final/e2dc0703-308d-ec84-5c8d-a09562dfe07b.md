## Question

Calf pain treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calf pain treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the likely etiologies of calf pain. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including red flags and when to image. Next, I will examine treatment by etiology, starting with musculoskeletal causes like Achilles tendinopathy and muscle strains, then vascular causes such as PAD and venous disease, and finally neurologic and other causes. After that, I should integrate general principles and a practical algorithm, and close with a concise, prioritized summary that aligns with the evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the etiologic framework, because treatment hinges on cause. Calf pain commonly arises from musculoskeletal sources (Achilles tendinopathy, gastrocnemius/soleus strains, plantar fasciitis with referred calf pain), vascular sources (intermittent claudication from PAD, venous insufficiency/edema, isolated calf DVT), neurologic sources (radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication), and less common entities like Baker's cyst rupture, compartment syndrome, or vasculitis, so I need to keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^116MZk4o] [^115RyK6S] [^115joPzm].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatments. I should screen for red flags such as acute swelling with erythema (DVT), severe pain with pallor or paresthesias (compartment syndrome), or systemic features (vasculitis), and I should confirm that exertional calf pain relieved within 10 minutes of rest points toward PAD claudication, whereas pain not relieved quickly or positional suggests other etiologies; if DVT is suspected, duplex ultrasound is first-line, and if PAD is suspected, ABI is the initial noninvasive test, with imaging reserved for equivocal cases or when alternative pathology is suspected [^116MZk4o] [^115RyK6S] [^115SJm5Q].

> I will now examine Achilles tendinopathy, since it is a frequent cause of posterior calf pain. Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence for eccentric loading. Multiple high-quality sources support progressive calf muscle strengthening as first-line for at least 12 weeks, with heavy eccentric training showing benefit over natural history and traditional physiotherapy, though comparative effectiveness among active treatments is uncertain and many trials have risk of bias; importantly, adding autologous blood injections to eccentric training confers no additional benefit, and heel lifts may offer short-term symptom relief but evidence is mixed and not clearly superior to exercise alone [^115zv7uu] [^113cdthZ] [^116nBpnL] [^115RvukS].

> Let me consider calf muscle strains next. I should confirm that most acute strains are managed conservatively with relative rest, ice, compression, elevation, and progressive loading once pain allows; recurrence is common in athletes, so I need to ensure adequate strength, flexibility, and gradual load progression before return to sport, and I should remember that poor association between tendon structure and symptoms means imaging is not routinely needed unless rupture is suspected or recovery is atypical [^112CxNGu] [^111F9kQS].

> For plantar fasciitis with referred calf pain, I need to check whether calf stretching is actually helpful. Guidelines endorse gastrocnemius-soleus stretching as part of a multimodal plan for short-term pain relief, and combining stretching with manual therapy or instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization can improve outcomes; however, I should not overstate stretching as a standalone cure, and I should tailor the program to symptom provocation and function [^11275PpB] [^114G3iD7] [^112tW9gP].

> Now, intermittent claudication from PAD. I should double-check that supervised exercise therapy is the cornerstone and improves pain-free and maximal walking distance by clinically meaningful margins; high-quality evidence shows roughly 80–120 meter gains versus usual care, with benefits persisting up to two years, and guidelines prioritize supervised treadmill or structured walking programs alongside cardiovascular risk reduction and antiplatelet therapy; medications like cilostazol have modest effects and should be reserved for refractory cases, and revascularization is reserved for severe disability or failure of conservative therapy [^111g1E77] [^116MZk4o] [^115joPzm] [^117MhAJ5].

> But wait, what if the calf pain is venous in origin. I should confirm that compression therapy is first-line for symptomatic chronic venous disease and venous leg ulcers, with emerging evidence that customized graduated stockings improve comfort and adherence compared with standard stockings; for venous leg ulcers, adding progressive resistance and aerobic exercise to compression may accelerate healing, and I need to counsel on calf muscle activation to enhance the venous pump [^114SKmqt] [^111bmACw] [^113K7GQY].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to isolated calf DVT. Management remains controversial, with risks of proximal propagation and PE balanced against bleeding; many clinicians anticoagulate for about 3 months in symptomatic or unprovoked cases, whereas low-risk patients with transient risk factors may be managed with surveillance in select settings; I need to ensure shared decision-making and align with local protocols and patient risk profiles [^112VPqMj] [^116Pz2hF] [^114abi5Y].

> For neurogenic claudication from lumbar spinal stenosis, I need to ensure I differentiate it from vascular claudication. The shopping cart sign, symptoms above the knees, and relief with lumbar flexion support the diagnosis, and epidural steroid injections can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in selected patients; I should confirm that imaging correlates poorly with symptoms, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^114dCzf4] [^115joPzm].

> Let me reconsider other causes briefly. Baker's cyst rupture can mimic DVT and presents with acute calf pain and swelling; ultrasound helps distinguish this and guides conservative management. Compartment syndrome requires urgent evaluation and fasciotomy if confirmed. Vasculitis restricted to the lower limbs is rare but responds to corticosteroids, often with relapses necessitating immunosuppression. And in older adults with nonspecific calf pain, home-based foot NMES may improve symptoms and function by enhancing calf muscle pump and strength, though evidence is preliminary [^115SJm5Q] [^116SeGib] [^115r8NMS] [^1127G9HE].

> Next, I should review general principles that cut across etiologies. I need to ensure patient education on the condition, prognosis, and activity modification; use a graded, load-based approach rather than strict rest; prioritize function and quality of life outcomes; and escalate care only after an adequate trial of foundational therapy, typically 12 weeks for tendinopathy and 3 months for PAD exercise before considering injections or procedures; I should also remember that most active treatments outperform wait-and-see, but comparative effectiveness among active options is often uncertain, so shared decision-making is essential [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu] [^113cdthZ] [^116MZk4o].

> I should double-check that my practical algorithm aligns with evidence. Start with history and exam to classify likely etiology, screen for red flags, and obtain targeted testing such as ABI for exertional calf pain or duplex for swelling; initiate etiology-specific first-line therapy such as progressive calf strengthening for tendinopathy, supervised walking for claudication, compression for venous disease, and conservative care for strains; reassess at 6–12 weeks and escalate only if inadequate response; throughout, emphasize education, load management, and functional goals to sustain engagement and outcomes [^116MZk4o] [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear and prioritized. For musculoskeletal calf pain, progressive calf strengthening and load management are foundational, with adjuncts like manual therapy or heel lifts as indicated; for vascular claudication, supervised exercise plus risk factor modification is first-line; for venous disease, compression and activation of the calf pump are key; and for neurologic mimics, accurate differentiation guides targeted interventions; across all causes, avoid passive care, set expectations, and use shared decision-making to match treatment to patient goals and tolerance [^116nqoCZ] [^111g1E77] [^114SKmqt] [^114dCzf4].

Calf pain treatment depends on the cause, but **eccentric calf strengthening** is the most effective first-line therapy for Achilles tendinopathy [^116nqoCZ], with **supervised exercise** the cornerstone for intermittent claudication [^111g1E77] [^116MZk4o]. For acute muscle strains, use RICE, early gentle movement, and progressive loading [^112CxNGu]; for chronic venous insufficiency, use compression and calf activation [^114SKmqt] [^113K7GQY]; and for nocturnal cramps, consider baclofen or gabapentin if persistent [^notfound]. Always tailor treatment to the cause, escalate care if no improvement in 6–12 weeks, and use shared decision-making for invasive options [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

## Musculoskeletal causes

### Achilles tendinopathy

- **First-line treatment**: Progressive calf muscle strengthening (eccentric or heavy-slow resistance) for at least 12 weeks [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].
- **Adjuncts**: Heel lifts, manual therapy, and load management can help symptoms [^115RvukS] [^111xvmUo].
- **Injections**: Avoid corticosteroids; consider PRP or sclerosing only if basic care fails [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

---

### Calf muscle strains

- **Acute phase**: Rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) and NSAIDs for pain [^notfound].
- **Subacute phase**: Gentle movement and progressive loading to restore function [^notfound].
- **Prevention**: Eccentric strengthening and neuromuscular training reduce recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Vascular causes

### Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication

- **First-line treatment**: Supervised exercise therapy (SET) improves walking distance and quality of life [^111g1E77] [^116MZk4o].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Cilostazol or pentoxifylline can be added if exercise is insufficient [^116NYrdJ] [^111b8EdT].
- **Revascularization**: Reserve for severe symptoms despite conservative care [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

---

### Chronic venous insufficiency

Compression therapy with **graduated stockings** reduces pain, edema, and improves quality of life [^114SKmqt]. Calf muscle activation through regular walking or exercise enhances the calf pump and symptom relief [^113K7GQY].

---

## Neurological causes

### Nocturnal calf cramps

- **First-line**: Stretching and hydration; quinine is no longer recommended due to safety concerns.
- **Pharmacologic options**: Baclofen or gabapentin can reduce frequency and severity [^114Q7dFs].
- **Underlying conditions**: Treat neuropathies or electrolyte disturbances as indicated.

---

## General principles and emerging therapies

- **Patient education**: Explain the condition, prognosis, and load management [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].
- **Progression**: Gradually increase load based on pain and function, not imaging [^113MsAs4].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Use physical therapy, pain management, and vascular or orthopedic input as needed [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].
- **Emerging therapies**: Shockwave therapy and NMES show promise but need more evidence [^112wNBiL] [^1127G9HE].

## Treatment algorithm

| **Cause** | **First-line treatment** | **Second-line treatment** | **Advanced interventions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Achilles tendinopathy | Eccentric strengthening | Heel lifts, manual therapy | PRP, surgery |
| Calf strain | RICE, progressive loading | Physical therapy | Surgery (rare) |
| PAD | Supervised exercise | Cilostazol, pentoxifylline | Revascularization |
| Venous insufficiency | Compression, calf activation | Elevated limb care | Surgery (rare) |
| Nocturnal cramps | Stretching, hydration | Baclofen, gabapentin | None |

Eccentric calf strengthening is the **most effective first-line therapy** for Achilles tendinopathy [^116nqoCZ] [^111LUviR], and supervised exercise is the cornerstone for intermittent claudication [^111g1E77] [^116MZk4o]. For acute muscle strains, use RICE, early gentle movement, and progressive loading; for chronic venous insufficiency, use compression and calf activation; and for nocturnal cramps, consider baclofen or gabapentin if persistent [^114Q7dFs]. Always tailor treatment to the cause, escalate care if no improvement in 6–12 weeks, and use shared decision-making for invasive options [^116nqoCZ] [^115zv7uu].

## References

### Efficacy of heavy eccentric calf training for treating mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LUviR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of heavy eccentric calf training (HECT) in comparison with natural history, traditional physiotherapy, sham interventions or other exercise interventions for improvements in pain and function in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines.

Data Sources

PUBMED, CINAHL (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) were searched from inception until 24 September 2018.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing HECT to natural history, sham exercise, traditional physiotherapy and other exercise interventions were included. Primary outcome assessing pain and function was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles.

Results

Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. This review suggests HECT may be superior to both natural history, mean difference (MD) (95%CI) of 20.6 (11.7 to 29.5, one study) and traditional physiotherapy, MD (95%CI) of 17.70 (3.75 to 31.66, two studies). Following removal of one study, at high risk of bias, due to pre-planned sensitivity analysis, this review suggests HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions, MD (95%CI) of -5.65 (-10.51 to -0.79, three studies). However, this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant.

Conclusion

Current evidence suggests that HECT may be superior to natural history and traditional physiotherapy while HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions. However, due to methodological limitations, small sample size and a lack of data we are unable to be confident in the results of the estimate of the effect, as the true effect is likely to be substantially different.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^113cdthZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our living NMA of 29 RCTs on Achilles tendinopathy included 42 different treatments. No trials were at low risk of bias, most had only short follow-up, and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, active treatments seem superior to wait-and-see at 3-month follow-up. There was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at 3-month and 12-month follow-up. Calf-muscle exercise therapy is easy to prescribe in practice, is widely available, and is regarded as safe and cheap. Consequently, clinicians should consider starting this as initial treatment.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition where one in four patients still has symptoms after 10 years.
Achilles tendinopathy can be disabling and impacts on quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, which represents high healthcare consumption.
The comparative effectiveness of treatments for Achilles tendinopathy is currently unknown.

What are the new findings

In our living network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of patients with Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments were found to be superior to it.
Given the large uncertainty in comparative estimates and risk of bias in the studies, no specific treatment can be recommended over another.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^116nqoCZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Achilles tendinopathy is a common sporting injury that can result in reduced quality of life and is notorious for its long-lasting symptoms. The Dutch Association for Sports Medicine initiated this new multidisciplinary clinical guideline on Achilles tendinopathy. We followed the standard national comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process. Using patient focus group interviews and a national online survey, we identified current barriers for patients with Achilles tendinopathy. The following domains were deemed important: primary prevention strategies, diagnosis, the role of imaging, effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical treatment options, the prognosis and prevention of a recurrence. Standardised scientific approaches were used, including a systematic search, selection of publication, data extraction, assessing risk of bias and appraising the certainty of evidence. This information was combined with other important considerations, including patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation.

Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations. All the national associations involved approved the guideline in October 2020.

This guideline provides recommendations on primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prevention of recurrence. It is essential for all involved (para)medical professionals who provide care for this patient group to be aware of knowledge in these different domains. By translating and sharing the guideline, our ultimate aim is to improve healthcare for patients with Achilles tendinopathy across the world.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition that impacts on sports participation and quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, resulting in high healthcare consumption.
There is inconclusive evidence on risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy.

What are the new findings

Each module contains recommendations for clinical practice — the most important are:
Diagnosis: establish the diagnosis 'Achilles tendinopathy' when the following four clinical diagnostic criteria are all present: localised symptoms, symptoms related to (sports) activity, localised thickening and presence of pain on palpation.
Treatment: consider including the following three aspects in basic management for at least 12 weeks: patient education, load management and calf muscle exercise therapy.
Treatment: consider additional therapies in cases of non-response to adequately performed basic management. Be cautious with using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or local corticosteroid injections. Consider surgery only if more than six months of basic management and additional therapies do not improve symptoms.

### Exercise for intermittent claudication [^112Ey3Bs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other more invasive therapies for leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication (IC)). This is an update of a review first published in 1998.

Objectives

The prime objective of this review was to determine whether an exercise programme in people with intermittent claudication was effective in alleviating symptoms and increasing walking treadmill distances and walking times. Secondary objectives were to determine whether exercise was effective in preventing deterioration of underlying disease, reducing cardiovascular events and improving quality of life.

Search Methods

For this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of an exercise regimen versus control or versus medical therapy in people with IC due to peripheral arterial disease. Any exercise programme or regimen used in the treatment of intermittent claudication was included, such as walking, skipping and running. Inclusion of trials was not affected by the duration, frequency or intensity of the exercise programme. Outcome measures collected included treadmill walking distance (time to onset of pain or pain-free walking distance and maximum walking time or maximal walking distance), ankle brachial index (ABI), quality of life, morbidity or amputation; if none of these were reported the trial was not included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Eleven additional studies were included in this update making a total of 30 trials which met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 1816 participants with stable leg pain. The follow-up period ranged from two weeks to two years. The types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; generally supervised sessions were at least twice a week. Most trials used a treadmill walking test for one of the outcome measures. Quality of the included trials was moderate, mainly due to an absence of relevant information. The majority of trials were small with 20 to 49 participants. Twenty trials compared exercise with usual care or placebo, the remainder of the trials compared exercise to medication (pentoxifylline, iloprost, antiplatelet agents and vitamin E) or pneumatic calf compression; people with various medical conditions or other pre-existing limitations to their exercise capacity were generally excluded. Overall, when taking the first time point reported in each of the studies, exercise significantly improved maximal walking time when compared with usual care or placebo: mean difference (MD) 4.51 minutes (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.11 to 5.92) with an overall improvement in walking ability of approximately 50% to 200%. Walking distances were also significantly improved: pain-free walking distance MD 82.29 metres (95% CI 71.86 to 92.72) and maximum walking distance MD 108.99 metres (95% CI 38.20 to 179.78). Improvements were seen for up to two years, and subgroup analyses were performed at three, six and 12 months where possible. Exercise did not improve the ABI (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.09). The effect of exercise, when compared with placebo or usual care, was inconclusive on mortality, amputation and peak exercise calf blood flow due to limited data. No data were given on non-fatal cardiovascular events. Quality of life measured using the Short Form (SF)-36 was reported at three and six months. At three months, physical function, vitality and role physical all significantly improved with exercise, however this was a limited finding as this measure was only reported in two trials. At six months five trials reported outcomes of a significantly improved physical summary score and mental summary score secondary to exercise. Only two trials reported improvements in other domains, physical function and general health. Evidence was generally limited for exercise compared with antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E and pneumatic foot and calf compression due to small numbers of trials and participants.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise programmes are of significant benefit compared with placebo or usual care in improving walking time and distance in people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for exercise intervention.

### Does botulinum neurotoxin A make walking easier in children with cerebral palsy? A randomized clinical trial [^1162DgZo]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The main objective of this trial was to investigate whether one treatment with BoNT‐A into the calf muscles would make walking easier in children and adolescents with CP during the following 6 months. The primary outcome was gross energy cost. Secondary outcomes were walking capacity, daily activity, perceived performance, satisfaction related to mobility tasks, and calf pain. We hypothesized that injecting BoNT‐A into the calf muscles would reduce energy cost during walking, improve walking capacity, increase habitual physical activity, improve perceived performance and satisfaction related to mobility tasks, and reduce pain.

### Botulinum toxin a does not decrease calf pain or improve ROM during limb lengthening: a randomized trial [^114krrvf]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During lower limb lengthening, distraction-induced muscle pain and surrounding joint contractures are frustrating complications for which few effective treatments are available.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated Botulinum Toxin Type A (BtX-A) injection in the calf muscles during human tibial distraction osteogenesis. We hypothesized that it may decrease calf pain and increase ROM of the surrounding joints by reducing muscle stiffness.

Methods

Between April 2010 and January 2011, we evaluated 36 patients undergoing bilateral tibia lengthening who met prespecified inclusion criteria. All patients underwent stature lengthening with lengthening over a nail or lengthening and then nailing. BtX-A (200 IU) was injected at the calf muscle only in one leg for each patient and the same amount of sterile normal saline was injected into the other leg as a control. Selection of the leg receiving the toxin was randomized. Clinical evaluation included a VAS score for calf pain and measurement of ROM of the knees and ankles and calf circumference, with evaluations performed in a double-blinded manner. Side-to-side differences were analyzed until the end of consolidation phase. Minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 30 months; range, 24–39 months). The distraction rate and the final length gain were similar in the treated and control limbs. A priori power analysis suggested that 34 legs were required to achieve statistical significance of 0.05 with 80% of power to detect a 50% difference in treatment effect between treatment and control groups.

Results

There were no differences in calf pain, knee and ankle ROM, and maximal calf circumferences between the two legs at each time point.

Conclusions

Local injection of 200 IU BtX-A at the human calf muscle does not appear to reduce calf pain or help enhance ROM of the knee and ankle during tibial lengthening. However, the small sample size provided sufficient power to detect only relatively large clinical effects; future, larger trials will be needed to determine whether smaller differences are present.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, therapeutic study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### An applied study of ulinastatin in pain management after hip replacement: impact on opioid use [^111y4Vmu]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison of Adverse Events Between Treatment Groups

Our analysis revealed a notable difference in the incidence and severity of adverse events between the ulinastatin and standard treatment groups. The ulinastatin group exhibited a lower rate of adverse events (3.6%) compared to the standard treatment group (10%). This suggests that ulinastatin may have a safer profile with respect to the incidence of adverse effects. The adverse events observed in the ulinastatin group, specifically calf swelling leading to tension pain, were significantly less severe compared to those in the standard treatment group, which included serious adverse events like joint dislocation and high fever unrelated to postoperative analgesia. These findings highlight a potential advantage of ulinastatin in minimizing the risk of severe complications associated with surgical interventions.

The nature of the adverse events associated with ulinastatin, particularly the calf swelling resulting in increased pain and subsequent higher analgesic consumption, raises questions about whether these effects are dose-dependent or if they might be mitigated through other therapeutic strategies. The calf swelling described as tension pain suggests a possible mechanical or procedural origin rather than a pharmacological response, indicating that dosage adjustment may not necessarily prevent such outcomes. However, a lower or adjusted dose could potentially reduce the severity or frequency of these symptoms if they are indeed dose-responsive.

To better manage and possibly prevent the escalation of such adverse effects, additional interventions may be required. This could include more stringent monitoring for early signs of calf swelling and proactive management of pain post-surgery. Implementing routine checks and early intervention protocols may help in managing these symptoms more effectively and preventing the increased consumption of analgesics.

Given these observations, future clinical trials should aim to establish a comprehensive understanding of the dose-response relationship and evaluate the effectiveness of additional preventive measures. Such studies could significantly enhance the therapeutic application of ulinastatin, ensuring both efficacy in surgical settings and minimization of adverse effects.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^115HyTud]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this living systematic review and NMA, none of the trials were at low risk of bias, and all evaluated treatments had large uncertainty in the estimates. From a myriad of treatments for midportion Achilles tendinopathy, active treatment classes seem to have clinically meaningful benefits (mean difference exceeded VISA-A MID of 15 points) at 3 months compared with wait-and-see. For two classes (acupuncture therapy, and shockwave therapy combined with exercise therapy), the credible intervals exceeded the MID of 15 points. However, these results were based on two small trials (64 and 68 included patients, respectively) at high risk of bias. There were no estimates for effectiveness of wait-and-see at 12 months. The effectiveness of most active treatments in the long term is uncertain. At 12 months, there was no difference between exercise therapy, injection therapies and combined therapies.

Clinical implications

Based on the findings in this study, we advise against recommending wait-and-see therapy as a treatment strategy. Active treatments had overlapping comparative effects, leaving uncertainty about which treatment is best for Achilles tendinopathy. Shared decision-making plays an important role in managing Achilles tendinopathy. Safety profile, treatment availability and costs should be considered in this clinical decision-making process. Calf-muscle exercise therapy is easy to prescribe because it is easy to instruct, can be cheap, is available everywhere and has a low risk of harm.

The preinjury activity level could play an important role in the response to treatments such as exercise therapy as this will possibly influence the load that can be applied to the tendon. There is currently no tool available to distinguish sedentary from athletic patients, and people define this differently. When a patient is considered to be sedentary, the VISA-A score could be less sensitive to changes as 40% of the score can be obtained from sporting activities. Therefore, a novel modified version of the existing VISA-A questionnaire is currently being developed to evaluate treatment response in sedentary individuals. In two trials, lower baseline VISA-A score was associated with a greater increase in VISA-A score. This is most likely explained by regression to the mean (outliers will tend to move towards the mean score). Furthermore, physical activity level was not a prognostic factor for change in VISA-A score in the trials that attempted to measure physical activity. More research is needed to determine whether athletic and sedentary patients should be considered separate patient groups.

### A feasibility double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of extracorporeal shockwave therapy as a novel treatment for intermittent claudication [^112wNBiL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intermittent claudication is the most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease. Previous research has suggested that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may induce angiogenesis in treated tissue. The objective of this feasibility pilot trial was to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ESWT as a novel treatment.

Methods

Patients with unilateral claudication were randomized to receive ESWT or sham treatment to the calf muscle three times per week for 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and maximum walking distance (MWD). Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability of ESWT treatment, ankle-brachial index before and after exercise, and quality of life assessed using generic (36-Item Short Form Health Survey, EuroQol-5 Dimension 3-Level) and disease-specific (Vascular Quality of Life) instruments. Participants were assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and attendance rates for treatment and follow-up.

Results

Thirty patients were recruited in total. Statistically significant (P < .05) improvements at all time points were observed in the active treatment group for both MWD and PFWD compared with the sham treatment group. PFWD improved by 276% in the active group and MWD improved by 167% in the active group at 12 weeks after treatment. There were no immediate or delayed treatment safety concerns or documented adverse effects of treatment with ESWT in this trial.

Conclusions

ESWT is safe and well tolerated when it is applied to the calf and demonstrated significant improvements in walking distances. Current conservative management of intermittent claudication includes supervised exercise. The early results with ESWT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option show great potential. The mechanism of action, durability of the clinical effect, and cost-effectiveness of ESWT for claudication require further investigation.

### Exercise training and revascularization in the management of symptomatic peripheral artery disease [^117MhAJ5]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, affecting more than 200 million individuals worldwide. PAD is associated with functional limitations, significant morbidity, and increased risks of cardiac and limb ischemic events. The clinical presentation ranges from classically described intermittent claudication, which is pain in the calves on walking that is relieved within 10 min of rest, to atypical exertional leg symptoms that are also associated with an exercise limitation and reduced quality of life.

Given the reduced functional capacity in patients with claudication, therapy is aimed at improving functional status and quality of life. Although PAD-specific pharmacologic therapies, such as pentoxifylline 400 mg oral twice daily and cilostazol 200 mg oral twice daily, have been developed, these drugs have minimal or variable efficacy in PAD. As a result, on a background of cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle counseling, aerobic exercise therapy (ET) and lower extremity revascularization (LER) are the preferred management strategies in clinical practice and are strongly recommended by current guidelines. Despite numerous studies examining these treatment modalities, it remains unclear which treatment, if any, should be favored in a typical patient with claudication. The goal of this structured review is to improve the clinician's understanding of the effectiveness of these preferred management interventions in this highly prevalent and limiting disorder and to highlight areas for future research endeavors.

### Topical capsaicin for pain management: therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of the new high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch [^117FM3mB]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Fig 4
The site of action of topical capsaicin is in the skin, and pain relief is not mediated by transdermal systemic delivery. Owing to near insolubility in water, capsaicin is not readily absorbed into the microvasculature. When cutaneous nociceptors are hypersensitive and sometimes spontaneously active, localized defunctionalization of capsaicin-responsive nerve fibre terminals in the epidermis and dermis can reduce the afferent barrage which may drive pain syndromes. Inset shows how mitochondrial dysfunction leads to nerve terminal retraction.

Fig 5
Topical capsaicin treatment leads to a reversible loss of ENFs. Human leg (calf) skin biopsies pre-capsaicin treatment (baseline;, PGP 9.5;, TRPV1), 1 day post (, PGP 9.5;, TRPV1), and 54 days post (, PGP 9.5;, TRPV1) capsaicin treatment. Biopsies were immunostained with antibodies to structural nerve marker PGP 9.5, and heat and capsaicin receptor TRPV1. There was a marked loss of ENFs and sub-ENFs after capsaicin treatment for 3 days (day 1 biopsy), with regeneration of a majority of ENFs by day 54. Magnification ×40.

### Effects of wearable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on fibromyalgia: a randomized controlled trial [^116LrWXg]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Wearable TENS is an emerging category of non-invasive neuromodulation where the device is designed for placement directly on the body, typically at a fixed location such as the upper calf or arm. These devices may incorporate automated stimulation control and sensors to adaptively modulate stimulation and track objective outcomes. Some wearable devices are designed for extended wear, including during sleep, which addresses a key limitation of traditional TENS. Wearable TENS devices have been evaluated in chronic lower extremity pain, chronic low back pain, chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), migraine, and essential tremorwith generally encouraging results. Wearable TENS has not been evaluated for management of fibromyalgia.

The present RCT compared 3-months of at-home treatment with an active or sham wearable TENS device located on the upper calf in individuals with fibromyalgia. The upper calf location enables stimulation of sensory dermatomes S2 through L4 with a circumferential electrode. These dermatomes are typically targeted when treating lower extremity and low back pain, which are common in fibromyalgia. The primary hypothesis was that active treatment would produce greater improvements in pain, somatic symptoms, and functional impairment compared to sham treatment. A second hypothesis was that subjects with the greatest relative baseline pain sensitivity by QST would exhibit the largest treatment effects. This hypothesis was based on the proposition that analgesic treatments that target sensitized central neurons, such as TENS, may be most effective in chronic pain characterized by hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Model-based statistical analyses were employed to maximize power to detect treatment effects in the presence of low to moderate effect sizes characteristic of fibromyalgia.

### Use of baclofen as a treatment for nocturnal calf cramps in individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis: a prospective randomized study [^114Q7dFs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of baclofen and gabapentin in reducing leg pain from nocturnal calf cramps in lumbar spinal stenosis patients.

Design

In a randomized clinical trial, the patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who commonly experienced nocturnal calf cramps were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either the baclofen or gabapentin group. Overall leg pain intensity, nocturnal calf cramp frequency and severity, sleep disturbances and functional disability were assessed at baseline and after 4 and 12 wks.

Results

Thirty-six patients completed the 3-mo study. Both gabapentin and baclofen groups showed a significant reduction in overall leg pain, calf cramp frequency and intensity, and insomnia severity index scores from baseline to the endpoint. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptom reduction at different time points. The baclofen group also demonstrated a significant decrease in Oswestry Disability Index scores (P < 0.001), while the gabapentin group did not (P = 0.344). No adverse effects were reported in either group.

Conclusions

Baclofen seems to be as effective and as safe as gabapentin in treating nocturnal calf cramps in lumbar spinal stenosis patients and even shows superiority in enhancing functional outcomes.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^115zv7uu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Advise active treatment.

Treatment should be provided by a healthcare provider who is sufficiently qualified (medical or paramedical healthcare provider).

Discuss the initial active treatment options together with the patient. Start treatment of midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy with:

Patient education: Explanation about the condition. Explanation about the prognosis. Pain education and addressing psychological factors.
Loading advice: Temporary cessation of pain provoking (sports) activities. Temporary replacement of provocative (sports) activities with non-provocative (sports) activities. Gradual increase of the load of (sports) activities. Use a pain scale to monitor the level of complaints related to (sports) activities and adjust these activities based on the pain scale.

Progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises for at least 12 weeks (figure 3). The form of exercise therapy should be suitable for the individual patient. Consider the role of: motivation, time constraints, pain monitoring and availability of facilities and resources. For insertional Achilles tendinopathy, consider initially performing exercises on a flat surface.

After 3 months of patient education, structural exercise therapy and following loading advice, if there is still no improvement discuss additional treatment options. Discuss the uncertainty surrounding of the additional effect and the advantages and disadvantages of any additional treatment. The best treatment option can then be decided together with the patient.

The following additional treatment options can be considered in case of insufficient effectiveness of patient education and loading advice in combination with continued exercise therapy:

Extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
Other passive modalities (the use of a night splint, inlays, use of collagen supplements, application of ultrasound and friction massages, laser therapy and light therapy).
Injection therapies (injections with polidocanol, lidocaine, autologous blood, platelet-rich plasma, stromal vascular fraction, hyaluronic acid, prolotherapy or high-volume injection) and acupuncture (or intratendinous needling).

Be cautious with the following additional treatment options:

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Corticosteroid injections.

Figure 3
Proposed flow chart for designing the progressive calf muscle strengthening exercises (gastrocnemius and soleus muscles) and plyometric exercises. The degree of pain (measured by a Visual Analogue Scale or Numeric Rating Scale) during and after the exercises and the muscle fatigue are leading for the speed of the progression. Note that for insertional Achilles tendinopathy, exercises are initially advised on a flat surface.

### Should we be looking for and treating isolated calf vein thrombosis? [^112VPqMj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Management of isolated calf deep vein thrombosis is an area of significant international debate and variable clinical practice. Both therapeutic anticoagulation and conservative management carry risk. As clinical care of suspected and confirmed venous thromboembolic disease increasingly becomes the remit of emergency medicine, complex decisions are left to practising clinicians at the front door. We aim to provide a contemporary overview of recent evidence on this topic and associated challenges facing clinicians. Given the lack of high-level evidence, we present this work as a narrative review, based on structured literature review and expert opinion. A decision to manage calf thrombosis is principally dependent on the risk of complications without treatment balanced against the risks of therapeutic anticoagulation. Estimates of the former risks taken from systematic review, meta-analysis, observational cohort and recent pilot trial evidence include proximal propagation 7%-10%, pulmonary embolism 2%-3% and death < 1%. Fatal bleeding with therapeutic anticoagulation stands at < 0.5%, and major bleeding at approximately 2%. Estimates of haemorrhagic risk are based on robust data from large prospective management studies of venous thromboembolic disease; the risks of untreated calf deep vein thrombosis are based on small cohorts and therefore less exact. Pending further trial evidence, these risks should be discussed with patients openly, in the context of personal preference and shared decision-making. Anticoagulation may maximally benefit those patients with extensive and/or symptomatic disease or those with higher risk for complication (unprovoked, cancer-associated or pregnancy).

### Plantar fasciitis… [^11395oq2]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of foot and heel pain. The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot. It is attached to the heel bone and connects to each of the toes, and it provides strength and support to the arch of the foot. Plantar fasciitis occurs when this band of tissue gets strained or irritated. Symptoms Plantar fasciitis most often causes pain in the heel or in the arch of the foot. The pain is usually most noticeable when first standing up and walking or after walking, running, or standing for long periods. The pain is usually sharp at first, and it may decrease or become duller after light activity. One or both feet may be affected. Diagnosis Plantar fasciitis is diagnosed based on a medical history and physical examination performed by a health care practitioner.

The examiner may press on the bottom of the foot to confirm that the pain is coming from the plantar fascia. Imaging studies or other tests are not needed to make the diagnosis, but they are sometimes used to rule out other causes of foot pain such as a broken bone or nerve injury. Treatment Simple measures can often be taken to lessen the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. If a clear trigger — such as a sudden increase in high-impact exercise — can be identified, then decreasing the amount of physical activity may be helpful. Daily stretching of the plantar fascia and the calf muscles should be performed, and ice can be applied to the affected area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time 2 to 3 times per day. Wearing shoes with good arch supports can also improve symptoms, and taping the bottom of the feet or using shoe inserts called orthotics are other ways to provide additional foot support. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen may provide short-term relief.

If pain persists, steroid injections may be given into the foot to reduce the pain. Although most people experience improvement or resolution of symptoms over time, surgery may be considered in rare cases if the pain does not improve after several months of conservative treatments.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^115RyK6S]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

### Perceived versus objective change in walking ability in peripheral artery disease: results from 3 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy [^114PckRU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Mean change in 6‐minute walk distance corresponding to participant‐perceived change in walking ability.

The number of participants in the exercise and control groups reporting specific changes in walking ability (scale:‐2 to +2, +2 = best) is as follows: Exercise group: −2: n = 24, −1: n = 81, no change: n = 188, +1: n = 144; +2: n = 89; Control group: −2: n = 33; −1: n = 107; no change: n = 185; +1: n = 121; +2: n = 54.

Of 159 participants who reported no change between baseline and follow‐up in the degree to which pain, aching, or cramps in the calf or buttock made walking difficult, those randomized to exercise had significantly greater improvement in 6‐minute walk distance compared with those randomized to control (+33.9 versus −7.5 m, P < 0.001) (Figure 2). Among the 87 participants who reported worsening in pain, aching, or cramps in the calf or buttock during walking, those randomized to exercise had significantly greater improvement in 6‐minute walk distance compared with those randomized to control (+28.9 versus −12.5 m, P = 0.003) (Figure 2). Similarly, those randomized to exercise significantly improved 6‐minute walk distance compared with control, even while reporting no change or worsening in the degree to which thigh symptoms worsened walking ability (Figure 2).

Figure 2
Mean change in 6‐minute walk distance according to participant‐reported change in (A) calf symptoms and (B) pain or aching in thighs.

In sensitivity analyses, results did not substantially change when the 10 participants (2%) who used a cane for the 6‐minute walk at baseline or follow‐up were excluded from analyses (Table S1). Results did not substantially change when the 25 participants (6%) who were asymptomatic at baseline were excluded from analyses (Table S2).

### Sensor-based gait training to reduce contact time for runners with exercise-related lower leg pain: a randomised controlled trial [^115fnTZR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower limb injuries constitute up to 50% running-related injuries, and recent literature has advocated using 'exercise-related lower leg pain' as the preferred nomenclature when other injuries can be ruled out with clinical examinations. Given the burden exercise-related lower leg pain imposes on runners, recent research has assessed contributing factors to injury development to guide interventions. However, the only recommended care for runners with exercise-related lower leg pain is to perform calf stretching. Rehabilitation is often included in clinical practice and should be considered for exercise-related lower leg pain management, especially as recent work has identified hip and ankle muscle weakness among these patients. Previous research that incorporated a strengthening programme for injured runners successfully reduced patients' pain and improved patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). These studies may be used as a framework for developing interventions for runners with exercise-related lower leg pain.

### Additive effect of therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of plantar fasciitis: a randomized controlled trial [^113TN3fU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar fasciitis is the chief cause of pain in the plantar surface of the heel. Therapeutic ultrasound is one of the most common conservative treatment modalities used by physical therapists worldwide, despite scarce evidence of its efficacy in treating plantar fasciitis.

Objective

To evaluate the additive effect of therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of plantar fasciitis in terms of pain, function, and quality of life.

Methods

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 54 patients with plantar fasciitis, aged 24 to 80 years, who met the inclusion criteria were randomized into an active intervention and a control group. Individuals in the active intervention group were treated with self-performed stretching of the plantar fascia and calf muscles and with therapeutic ultrasound. Individuals in the control group were treated with the same stretching exercises and sham ultrasound. Both groups received 8 treatments, twice weekly. Outcome measures included a numeric pain-rating scale, the computerized adaptive test for the foot and ankle, and an algometric test.

Results

Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in all outcome measures (P < .001, both groups). At the completion of the study, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups in any of the outcomes.

Conclusion

The addition of therapeutic ultrasound did not improve the efficacy of conservative treatment for plantar fasciitis. Therefore, the authors recommend excluding therapeutic ultrasound from the treatment of plantar fasciitis and agree with results of previous studies that stretching may be an effective treatment for healing plantar fasciitis.

### Exercise parameters to consider for achilles tendinopathy: a modified Delphi study with international experts [^113CLEcA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Achilles tendinopathy (AT), defined as a 'persistent Achilles tendon pain and loss of function related to mechanical loading', is a relatively common pathology among athletes, but can also occur in a more sedentary population. About 6% of the general population will experience AT at least once in their lifetime, while the incidence rate rises to 24% among elite athletes and to 52% among middle- and long-distance runners. Despite the evolution of treatments, AT remains difficult to manage, with recurrence rates of 23%–43% following rehabilitationand persistent symptoms in up to 60% of patients after 5 years. The natural history of AT is still not fully understood, its pathophysiology is complex and the risk factors are numerous, which makes it difficult to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy. Primary AT management typically involves education, advice and exercises that gradually increase tendon load. These exercises are the cornerstone of rehabilitationand aim to stimulate tendon remodelling, to reduce pain and to improve calf muscle endurance and strength, as well as lower leg function. Thereby, several progressive loading protocols focusing mainly on exercises involving heel raises have been developed, evolving from Stanish and Curwin programmeto Alfredson's eccentric exercises, Silbernagel's combined approachand Heavy-Slow Resistance protocol. Although most of these exercise-based programmes have shown efficacy in improving patients' symptoms, a recent systematic review failed to show clear improvement in muscle structure or function after completing exercise rehabilitation. Even though the impact of exercises is not limited to the modification of muscular properties, this highlights the necessity to refine tendon loading protocols to optimise their effectiveness.

### Patients with persistent pain after breast cancer surgery show both delayed and enhanced cortical stimulus processing [^113XQEtB]. Journal of Pain Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Women who undergo breast cancer surgery have a high risk of developing persistent pain. We investigated brain processing of painful stimuli using electroencephalograms (EEG) to identify event-related potentials (ERPs) in patients with persistent pain after breast cancer treatment.

Methods

Nineteen patients (eight women with persistent pain, eleven without persistent pain), who were surgically treated more than 1 year previously for breast cancer (mastectomy, lumpectomy, and axillary lymph node dissection) and/or had chemoradiotherapy, were recruited and compared with eleven healthy female volunteers. A block of 20 painful electrical stimuli was applied to the calf, somatopically remote from the initially injured or painful area. Simultaneously an EEG was recorded, and a visual analog scale (VAS) pain rating obtained.

Results

In comparison with healthy volunteers, breast cancer treatment without persistent pain is associated with accelerated stimulus processing (reduced P260 latency) and shows a tendency to be less intense (lower P260 amplitude). In comparison to patients without persistent pain, persistent pain after breast cancer treatment is associated with stimulus processing that is both delayed (ie, increased latency of the ERP positivity between 250–310 ms [P260]), and enhanced (ie, enhanced P260 amplitude).

Conclusion

These results show that treatment and persistent pain have opposite effects on cortical responsiveness.

### Benefits of home-based foot neuromuscular electrical stimulation on self-reported function, leg pain and other leg symptoms among community-dwelling older adults: a sham-controlled randomised clinical trial [^1127G9HE]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

'Healthy ageing' is vital as the world population is becoming older. As life expectancy increases an active lifestyle is key to maintaining functional ability and to promote healthy ageing, thereby minimising the impact on quality of life (QoL). Lower leg symptoms such as pain and cramps, and sensations of tired, aching, and heavy feeling legs are common in older adults and can significantly impact on their functional QoL. It is often difficult to associate the causes of such symptoms to a specific diagnosis, especially when multiple comorbidities relating to different medical conditions are present. Functional limitations due to ageing, a sedentary lifestyle or underlying comorbidities (e.g. peripheral vascular disease (PVD)) can perpetuate a 'vicious circle' leading to a more sedentary life, increased leg symptoms and a further decline in function.

Reduced lower leg muscle strength is a predictor of disability among older adults. Alongside poor blood flow, due to deterioration of the calf muscle pump, weakness in the legs is a common problem seen among older adults. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a widely used modality for muscle strengthening and functional rehabilitation across various clinical populations, with a significant body of supporting literature. Additionally, NMES treatment can boost blood circulation in asymptomatic people, as well as in those with underlying circulatory deficits. Instead of delivering through the conventional body pads, when NMES is applied as a novel 'foot NMES' via the plantar surface, the induced muscle contractions activate the musculovenous pump thus stimulating blood flow during treatment. Whilst improved blood flow helps maintain leg circulatory health, muscle contractions can help improve strength and mobility, demonstrating clinical benefits in patients with PVDs such as chronic venous disease (CVD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by relieving symptoms, and improving functional QoL.

There is a paucity of research investigating the effects of home-based foot NMES on leg pain and other leg symptoms, and the functional QoL among community-dwelling older adults. Contemporary research lacks sham-controlled studies and are focused mainly on clinician delivered NMES with various patient groups despite home-based care becoming increasingly important for reducing the pressures on healthcare providers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an eight-week foot NMES treatment program administered at home using two different Revitive ® devices on older adults with leg pain and/or leg symptoms and to compare them to a Sham. The study protocol has been published.

### The effect of topical arnica on muscle pain [^115eCm3w]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The herb Arnica montana, in topical formulations, has been reputed to decrease bruising and muscle pain. This claim has been inadequately and incompletely addressed.

Objective

To determine whether topical A. montana cream could decrease subjective leg pain following calf raises. Secondary outcomes were effects on ankle range of motion and muscle tenderness.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 53 subjects. Active range of motion was measured in both ankles, and then a series of calf-raises were completed according to a standardized protocol. Each participant received 2 tubes of cream, 1 with active arnica and 1 with placebo. The creams were applied to the lower legs immediately after the exercise, and again at 24 and 48 hours postexercise according to the "RIGHT" or "LEFT" labels. At 48 hours postexercise, subjects had their ankle range of motion and muscle tenderness measured. Subjects used the analog scale to rate pain in each leg at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours.

Results

No significant differences in pain scores were seen before exercise (arnica: 0.07 vs placebo: 0.09, p = 0.32). Pain scores on legs treated with arnica were higher than scores on those receiving placebo 24 hours after exercise (3.04 vs 2.36, respectively; p < 0.005). Pain scores on day 3 (arnica: 3.44 vs placebo: 3.20, p = 0.66) and day 4 (arnica: 2.36 vs placebo: 2.31, p = 0.62) were not significantly different. There was no difference in muscle tenderness (arnica: 1.05 vs placebo: 1.05, p = 1.0). Ankle range of motion did not differ significantly on either day 1 (arnica: 64.70 degrees vs placebo: 66.15, p = 0.352 or day 3 (arnica: 63.32 degrees vs placebo: 65.94, p = 0.058).

Conclusions

Rather than decreasing leg pain, arnica was found to increase leg pain 24 hours after eccentric calf exercises. This effect did not extend to the 48-hour measurement.

Low back pain (LBP) — diagnosis — In most developed populations, the vast majority of LBP cases have no identifiable pathological abnormality (estimated at over 95%), and pain that is solely or mostly traveling in a posterior thigh and calf generally, but not always, signifies radiculopathy, particularly when the radicular pain in the extremity substantially exceeds back pain or is the sole symptom.

### Efficacy of heel lifts versus calf muscle eccentric exercise for mid-portion achilles tendinopathy (HEALTHY): a randomised trial [^115RvukS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of in-shoe heel lifts to calf muscle eccentric exercise in reducing pain and improving function in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

This was a parallel-group randomised superiority trial at a single centre (La Trobe University Health Sciences Clinic, Discipline of Podiatry, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). One hundred participants (52 women and 48 men, mean age 45.9, SD 9.4 years) with clinically diagnosed and ultrasonographically confirmed mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy were randomly allocated to either a (1) heel lifts (n = 50) or (2) eccentric exercise (n = 50) group. The primary outcome measure was the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire at 12 weeks. Differences between groups were analysed using intention to treat with analysis of covariance.

Results

There was 80% follow-up of participants (n = 40 per group) at 12 weeks. The mean VISA-A score improved by 26.0 points (95%CI 19.6 to 32.4) in the heel lifts group and by 17.4 points (95%CI 9.5 to 25.3) in the eccentric exercise group. On average, there was a between-group difference in favour of the heel lifts for the VISA-A (adjusted mean difference 9.6, 95%CI 1.8 to 17.4, p = 0.016), which approximated, but did not meet our predetermined minimum important difference of 10 points.

Conclusion

In adults with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, heel lifts were more effective than calf muscle eccentric exercise in reducing pain and improving function at 12 weeks. However, there is uncertainty in the estimate of effect for this outcome and patients may not experience a clinically worthwhile difference between interventions.

Online supplemental file 1 includes the short-term, medium-term and long-term results for each trial included in the analysis; a summary of those studies with evidence against efficacy and forest plots for the effectiveness of foot orthoses and ESWT.

Table 1
Efficacy and strength of evidence for interventions considered for primary and secondary proof of efficacy in the form of an 'evidence and gap map'

Of the 51 trials included in the review, 8 RCTs of 9 interventions could be considered for primary proof of efficacy. The nine interventions included radial ESWT, focused ESWT, custom foot orthoses, prefabricated foot orthoses, dry needling, magnetised insoles, calf stretching, foot tapingand wheatgrass cream. One trial that compared radial ESWT with plantar fascia stretching was considered for secondary proof of efficacy.

Moderate evidence was found for the efficacy of focused ESWT for overall pain (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61); strong evidence for first step pain (OR: 1.89, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.04)in the short term and moderate evidence of effect for function in the short term (SMD: 0.36, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61). No, or minimal side effects were reported in each study, however the procedure was noted to be unpleasant for patients in both study reports and semi-structured interviews.

Significant and positive effects for pain in the short term were revealed for radial ESWT from two papers reporting significant between-group differences, although pooling showed a large effect size with wide CIs that crossed the line of no effect (SMD: 1.64, 95% CI −1.06 to 4.33). Moderate evidence of efficacy was also revealed for first step pain in the long term (OR: 1.78, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.96). Adverse events were reported as being minimal in each included study. Of note is that one high-quality study found use of radial ESWT without local anaesthetic to be superior to ESWT with prior application of injected local anaesthetic. The systematic review findings were consistent with the opinions of experts who described the positive effect of ESWT:

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^112CxNGu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This statement is divided into four sections: (1) hamstring, (2) adductor, (3) rectus femoris/quadriceps and (4) calf muscle strain injuries, and it includes three domains in each section: (1) diagnosis, (2) prevention and (3) treatment. We did not include studies solely reporting on non-acute problems, and/or clear traumatic injuries such as total muscle ruptures, avulsion injuries and muscle contusions. A systematic search was employed to identify literature for the three domains in each section, with inclusion of studies based on the highest level of available evidence. Data were synthesised and the quality of evidence were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group.

Search

Twelve systematic searches covering diagnosis, prevention and treatment for each of the four sections (1: hamstring, 2: adductor, 3: rectus femoris/quadriceps and 4: calf) were conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), CENTRAL and Embase (via Ovid) during July 2018 and updated in September 2019. No restrictions were applied concerning year of publication, however, only publications in English were included. We searched individual text words in title and abstract supplemented with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We combined anatomical region of interest (eg, 'Groin (MeSH)' OR 'adductor' OR 'groin') AND type of injury (eg, 'Athletic Injury (MeSH)' OR 'Strains and Sprains (MeSH)' OR 'strain' OR 'injur' OR 're-injur' OR 'reinjur') AND outcome for diagnosis and treatment domains (eg, 'Diagnosis (MeSH)' OR 'exam' and 'Return To Sport' OR 'full training', respectively) or intervention for prevention domains (eg, 'Primary Prevention (MeSHs)' OR 'Reduc'). If studies from one search was deemed relevant for one of the other 11 searches, the study was included as literature identified from other sources. In addition, reference lists of the included trials and relevant systematic reviews were scanned for relevant references. A flow chart of searches (see online supplementary file 1) and the complete search strategy for all searches and databases (see online supplementary file 2) is available as supplementary.

### Effectiveness of myofascial trigger point manual therapy combined with a self-stretching protocol for the management of plantar heel pain: a randomized controlled trial [^116rpHr5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized controlled clinical trial.

Objective

To investigate the effects of trigger point (TrP) manual therapy combined with a self-stretching program for the management of patients with plantar heel pain.

Background

Previous studies have reported that stretching of the calf musculature and the plantar fascia are effective management strategies for plantar heel pain. However, it is not known if the inclusion of soft tissue therapy can further improve the outcomes in this population.

Methods

Sixty patients, 15 men and 45 women (mean ± SD age, 44 ± 10 years) with a clinical diagnosis of plantar heel pain were randomly divided into 2 groups: a self-stretching (Str) group who received a stretching protocol, and a self-stretching and soft tissue TrP manual therapy (Str-ST) group who received TrP manual interventions (TrP pressure release and neuromuscular approach) in addition to the same self-stretching protocol. The primary outcomes were physical function and bodily pain domains of the quality of life SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed over the affected gastrocnemii and soleus muscles, and over the calcaneus, by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation. Outcomes of interest were captured at baseline and at a 1-month follow-up (end of treatment period). Mixed-model ANOVAs were used to examine the effects of the interventions on each outcome, with group as the between-subjects variable and time as the within-subjects variable. The primary analysis was the group-by-time interaction.

Results

The 2 × 2 mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for the main outcomes of the study: physical function (P = 0.001) and bodily pain (P = 0.005); patients receiving a combination of self-stretching and TrP tissue intervention experienced a greater improvement in physical function and a greater reduction in pain, as compared to those receiving the self-stretching protocol. The mixed ANOVA also revealed significant group-by-time interactions for changes in PPT over the gastrocnemii and soleus muscles, and the calcaneus (all P < .001). Patients receiving a combination of self-stretching and TrP tissue intervention showed a greater improvement in PPT, as compared to those who received only the self-stretching protocol.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that the addition of TrP manual therapies to a self-stretching protocol resulted in superior short-term outcomes as compared to a self-stretching program alone in the treatment of patients with plantar heel pain.

Level Of Evidence

Therapy, level 1b.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^11275PpB]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Stretching — operational definitions and prior recommendation: Gastrocnemius/soleus stretching involves stretching posterior calf structures, including gastrocnemius, soleus, Achilles tendon, and related structures, and may be performed by the patient in weight-bearing or non–weight-bearing positions; plantar fascia stretching is intended to localize the stretch to the plantar fascia and is performed in weight-bearing or non–weight-bearing positions by applying pressure to the metatarsal heads while the toes are stretched into dorsiflexion, with the ankle in neutral or dorsiflexion; clinicians should use plantar fascia-specific and gastrocnemius/soleus stretching to provide short term (1 week to 4 months) pain relief for heel pain/plantar fasciitis, and heel pads may be used to increase the benefits of stretching.

### Ultrasonographic findings of the various diseases presenting as calf pain [^114VLyqK]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

There are various causes of calf pain. The differential diagnoses affecting the lower leg include cystic lesions, trauma-related lesions, infection or inflammation, vascular lesions, neoplasms, and miscellaneous entities. Ultrasound (US) provide detailed anatomical information of the calf structures, and it offers the ability to confirm, other calf abnormalities, particularly when deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is ruled out. The purpose of this article is to review the causes of a painful calf presenting as DVT and incidental findings found as part of the work-up of DVT, and to provide a broad overview of US findings and clinical features of these pathologies.

### Role of nutrition in the management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain [^1144KSnm]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia: Prevention, Early Diagnosis, Less Severity

Prevention and treatment of sarcopenia could lead to a positive impact on CMP symptoms. Reducing muscle mass may cause more prolonged pain, leading to further reductions in activity and, therefore, sustained pain, creating a vicious cycle. In this context, several diagnostic scales for sarcopenia are available and should be considered for the early diagnosis of CMP patients. In this regard, a recent study by Tsuji et al has shown that both SARC-F and SARC-CalF demonstrated moderate diagnostic capabilities in a CMP population.SARC-CalF, however, exhibited higher diagnostic power compared to SARC-F. Moreover, both SARC-F and SARC-CalF scores correlated with Psychotic Depression Assessment Scale (PDAS) scores, signifying pain-related disability. This suggests that they can serve as screening tools for sarcopenia and also as simple tools to assess disability in patients with CMP. Another recent study by Tsuji and collaborators found that the phase angle may be a valid discriminator of sarcopenia in patients with CMP. They even indicated established cutoff points that clinicians can follow. In this study, the phase angle showcased high accuracy in differentiating sarcopenia in men and moderate accuracy in both genders and women. Moreover, although data has not been published yet for CMP patients, other instruments to identify sarcopenia can be used, including the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis, and those proposed by the European Working Group for Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), or the International Working Group on Sarcopenia (IWGS).

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^116nP1KK]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — stretching: Stretching has anecdotally been recommended for this condition, yet little evidence supports stretching to prevent or as an effective intervention; only 1 study examined stretching as an isolated intervention. In that trial, forty-five subjects with Achilles tendon pain of at least 3 months' duration were randomly assigned to either an eccentric loading program or a calf-stretching program, performed over a 12-week period, with follow-up at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 52 weeks. The authors reported that 38 of the 45 randomized subjects were followed for at least 3 months, with 21 and 23 tendons evaluated at 3 and 12 months in the eccentric group and 24 and 19 tendons evaluated at 3 and 12 months in the stretching group. Both groups gradually improved, with no differences noted between groups, and because there was no control group it is unclear whether improvements were due to the intervention, the passage of time, or a combination of both.

### Can claudication be improved with medication? [^111b8EdT]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Intermittent claudication is a common disabling condition that affects approximately 5% to 15% of patients with atherosclerotic disease. Recommended treatment involves lifestyle modification and physical conditioning through the adoption of a regular exercise program. These methods of treatment often have been unsuccessful in the past because of noncompliance, in large part related to the relatively minor degree of improvement experienced by the patient. However, some recent trials have resulted in greater relative improvements in both pain-free and maximal walking distances in some patients treated with medication. Surgical and endovascular options offer greater degrees of improvement but also greater morbidity and should be reserved as treatment for severe claudication. The efficacies, as well as common adverse reactions associated with current medications used to treat patients with intermittent claudication are reviewed.

### The case for early detection and integrated intervention in patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication [^116NYrdJ]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is defined as atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and arteries of the lower extremities. The most frequent manifestations of ischemia occur in the lower extremity arteries, with intermittent claudication as the most common symptom. Intermittent claudication, which is characterized by temporary pain brought on by muscle exertion, is usually experienced in the calf muscles and typically subsides with rest. The atherosclerotic nature of PAD/intermittent claudication makes it an important predictor of risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, as well as limb loss. Thus, active screening and early diagnosis of PAD/intermittent claudication, in addition to aggressive management that incorporates risk factor modification, exercise therapy, platelet inhibition and other appropriate pharmacotherapy, and potential lifestyle changes, play important roles in overall patient management. Pharmacotherapy with cilostazol has been shown to improve maximal and pain-free walking distances. Uncontrolled and severely debilitating intermittent claudication may require revascularization.

### Exercise training for intermittent claudication: a narrative review and summary of guidelines for practitioners [^113ED3xo]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Lower-limb peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in which the arteries that carry blood to the legs and feet become hardened, narrowed and/or obstructed by the build-up of atheroma.PAD is a common problem thought to affect over 200 million people worldwide. The total disease prevalence is approximately 13% of adults > 50 years old, with major risk factors including smoking, diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

The most classic symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC). This is ischaemic muscle pain that usually presents in the calves (but can include the thighs or buttocks), is precipitated by exertion and relieved with rest (figure 1). This pain is thought to be due to a mismatch between the oxygen demand (of the working muscle) and an inadequate blood supply (due to the narrowed arterial pathway).

Figure 1
Intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease. Reproduced from Morlet et alwith permission from BMJ Publishing Group Ltd. Note: Iliac or femoral artery disease can cause symptoms at multiple distal muscle sites.

Although PAD is progressive (in the pathological sense), the clinical course is relatively stable. However, patients with PAD have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease and are at greater risk of major cardiovascular events. Another major issue for many patients is the severe decline in functional capacity (V̇O 2Peak) which are comparable to patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The reduction in functional capacity is commonly caused by a decline in walking capacity, which may be up to less than 50% of healthy aged-matched controls. Factors influencing the walking distance or speed at which symptoms occur are multifactorial and include the site and severity of disease, walking pace, terrain, incline and footwear. These physical constraints in turn have negative connotations on patient's mental health and there are strong associations with depression, poor quality of life (QoL) and further avoidance of physical activity. This cycle of activity avoidance only leads to worsening functional ability and there is some evidence to suggest it also leads to an elevated mortality risk independent of disease severity and age.

### Sonographic assessment of musculoskeletal causes of calf pain and swelling [^115SJm5Q]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Calf pain or swelling is a common presentation to the emergency department. The differential diagnoses are wide. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is often the first diagnosis to be excluded given its potentially fatal complications. Musculoskeletal causes of calf pain or swelling such as Baker's cyst, muscle or tendon tear, soft tissue infection, and inflammation are not uncommon and can often be confidently diagnosed with ultrasonography (US). Familiarity with these conditions and the sonographic findings would be useful in making timely and correct diagnosis.

### A prospective randomized trial comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute achilles tendon ruptures [^115HMnNY]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures for active patients is under debate.

Purpose

To compare clinical outcomes and calf muscle strength recovery after the nonsurgical treatment and open surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures with identical accelerated rehabilitation programs.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

From 2009 to 2013, a total of 60 patients with an acute Achilles tendon rupture were randomized to surgery or nonsurgical treatment. Nonsurgical treatment included first a week of cast immobilization, followed by a functional orthosis for 6 weeks, allowing full weightbearing after week 1 and active plantar flexion after week 5. Surgery was simple end-to-end open repair, and postoperative treatment was identical to nonsurgical treatment. Outcome measures included the Leppilahti Achilles tendon performance score, isokinetic calf muscle strength, and RAND 36-Item Health Survey at 18-month follow-up.

Results

At 18-month follow-up, the mean Leppilahti score was 79.5 and 75.7 for the surgically and nonsurgically treated groups, respectively (mean difference, 3.8; 95% CI, -1.9 to 9.5; P = 0.19). Angle-specific peak torque results of affected legs showed that surgery resulted in faster and better recovery of calf muscle strength over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint: at 6 months, the difference varied from 16% to 24% (P = 0.016), favoring the surgically treated group, whereas at 18 months, surgically treated patients had 10% to 18% greater strength results (P = 0.037). At 18 months, a 14% difference in the peak torque of the affected leg favored the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group (mean peak torque, 110.3 vs 96.5 N·m, respectively; mean difference, 13.6 N·m; 95% CI, 2.0–25.1 N·m; P = 0.022). The RAND 36-Item Health Survey indicated better results in the domains of physical functioning (P = 0.006) and bodily pain (P = 0.037) for surgically treated patients.

Conclusion

Surgical and nonsurgical treatments of acute Achilles tendon ruptures have similar results in terms of the Achilles tendon performance score, but surgery restores calf muscle strength earlier over the entire range of motion of the ankle joint, with a 10% to 18% strength difference favoring surgery at 18 months. Surgery may also result in better health-related quality of life in the domains of physical functioning and bodily pain compared with nonsurgical treatment.

### US of acute tendon tears [^113gdjqA]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

US is an effective tool for appraising acute tendon injury, allowing rapid evaluation of symptoms at bedside and paving the way for prompt diagnosis and treatment selection. It offers three main advantages in the acute or emergent setting. First, it is more sensitive and specific than physical examination. This is beneficial in tendons such as the distal triceps wherein incomplete and complete tears may manifest with similar clinical presentations. Tendon injury may also be clinically innocuous because bruising or a palpable defect is not always present and swelling may mask palpation of the tendon gap. Second, US provides important descriptors that may affect treatment selection, such as injury site, injury extent, and length of retraction. Pectoralis major tears at the tendon or musculotendinous junction warrant operative referral and are readily illustrated at US. A torn distal biceps tendon with significant retraction may require additional graft augmentation rather than reattachment to the insertion alone. Soleus and gastrocnemius strains may mimic each other clinically. Although both are managed conservatively, distinction between the two facilitates formulation of a specific rehabilitation regimen. Finally, US can narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out mimics of musculoskeletal abnormalities. Nonmusculoskeletal conditions, such as deep venous thrombosis and a ruptured Baker cyst, can manifest with the same clinical presentation as acute calf injuries and must be considered in a patient presenting with sudden calf, posterior leg, or ankle pain. The authors review the anatomic features, US techniques, and imaging findings of acute tendon injuries to aid in meaningful reporting and timely treatment selection. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Chronic transcutaneous electrical stimulation of calf muscles improves functional capacity without inducing systemic inflammation in claudicants [^116aijjm]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether electrical stimulation of ischaemic calf muscles in claudicants causes a systemic inflammatory response and to evaluate effects of its chronic application on muscle function and walking ability.

Design

Prospective randomised controlled trial of calf muscle stimulation.

Materials and Methods

Stable claudicants were randomised to receive either active chronic low frequency (6 Hz) motor stimulation (n = 15) or, as a control treatment, submotor transcutaneous electrical nerve (TENS) stimulation (n = 15) of calf muscles in one leg, 3 x 20 min per day for four weeks. Leucocyte activation was quantified by changes in cell morphology, vascular permeability by urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), calf muscle function by isometric twitch contractions and walking ability by treadmill performance pre- and post-intervention.

Results

Acute active muscle stimulation activated leucocytes less (28% increase) than a standard treadmill test (81% increase) and did not increase ACR. Chronic calf muscle stimulation significantly increased pain-free walking distance by 35 m (95% CI 17, 52, P < 0.001) and maximum walking distance by 39 m (95% CI 7, 70, P < 0.05) while control treatment had no effect. Active stimulation prevented fatigue of calf muscles during isometric electrically evoked contractions by abolishing the slowing of relaxation that was responsible for loss of force.

Conclusions

Chronic electrical muscle stimulation is an effective treatment for alleviating intermittent claudication which, by targeted activation of a small muscle mass, does not engender a significant systemic inflammatory response.

### Perceived versus objective change in walking ability in peripheral artery disease: results from 3 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy [^112hW8Ty]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Among 404 people with PAD in 3 randomized clinical trials, exercise significantly improved 6‐minute walk distance compared with the control group by 39.8 m, consistent with a large clinically meaningful change. However, exercise had a less potent effect on patient‐reported walking ability. Of 205 participants with PAD randomized to exercise, 149 (73%) improved their 6‐minute walk distance at 6‐month follow‐up, but only 602 (42%) of questionnaire responses indicated improved walking ability over the same period, only 92 participants (45%) perceived improvement in difficulty walking because of calf or buttock pain or aching, and only 78 participants (38%) perceived improvement in difficulty walking because of thigh discomfort. Furthermore, among all participants in the exercise and control groups who reported no change in ability to walk at 6‐month follow‐up for 1 or more distances, those randomized to exercise actually improved their 6‐minute walk by a mean of 26.8 m while those randomized to control simultaneously declined by 6.5 m. Among those who reported greater walking difficulty at 6‐month follow‐up than at baseline because of calf or buttock pain or aching, those randomized to exercise nonetheless improved 6‐minute walk by 28.9 m while those randomized to the control group declined by 12.5 m. A previous study showed that a small meaningful change in 6‐minute walk distance was 8 m and a large meaningful change was 20 m.

### Rapid foot and calf compression increases walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication: results of a randomized study [^114BffcG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of our pilot study was to determine the usefulness of rapid, high-pressure, intermittent pneumatic calf and foot compression (IPCFC) in patients with stable intermittent claudication, with reference to the end points of improvement in initial claudication distance (ICD) (distance at which patient feels pain or discomfort in the legs), and improvement in absolute claudication distance (ACD) (distance at which patient stops walking because the pain or discomfort becomes severe).

Methods

Thirty male patients presenting with stable, intermittent claudication (ACD between 50 and 150 meters on treadmill testing at 3.8 km/h, 10 degrees gradient) were recruited into this pilot study from a single center. Fifteen patients were randomized to treatment with IPCFC (applied for 1 hour twice daily in the sitting position) and were also advised to have daily exercise, and 15 patients served as controls, who were advised exercise alone. All patients received aspirin and had resting and postexercise ankle/brachial index (ABI) measured at enrollment along with ICD and ACD on treadmill testing (3.8 km/h, 10 degrees gradient). The mean age, baseline ICD, and ACD of the treatment and control groups were 70.4 ± 7 years and 70.7 ± 9 years, 55.8 ± 15 meters and 68.4 ± 17 meters, and 86.7 ± 19 meters and 103.9 ± 27 meters, respectively. Both groups were equally matched for risk factors, including smoking, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. IPCFC was applied. The study protocol included follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months with the ABI, ICD and ACD being measured at every visit.

Results

The percent change from baseline for ICD and ACD for each patient visit and the mean ± standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), and median were calculated for the control and treatment groups. The percent change from baseline measurements (mean ± SD) for ICD and ACD in the control group at 4, 6, and 12 months were 2.2 ± 18 and 2.3 ± 18, 2.9 ± 17 and 5.2 ± 20, and 3.6 ± 18 and 5.8 ± 20, respectively. In contrast, the changes in ICD and ACD at 4, 6, and 12 months in the treatment group were 137.1 ± 128 (P < .01) and 84.3 ± 82 (P < .01), 140.6 ± 127 (P < .01) and 96.4 ± 106 (P = 0.01), and 150.8 ± 124 (P < 0.01) and 101.2 ± 104 (P < 0.01), respectively. Although the ABI showed a slight increase in the treatment group, these differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

The results of this pilot study show that IPCFC improves walking distance in patients with stable intermittent claudication. A significant increase in ICD and ACD was seen at 4 and 6 months of treatment, respectively, and the improvement was sustained at 1 year. The combination of IPCFC with other treatment such as risk-factor modification and daily exercise may prove useful in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. It may be a useful first line of therapy in patients with disabling claudication who are unfit for major reconstructive surgery. Improved walking on long-term follow-up and experience from different centers may establish a role for this treatment modality in the future.

### New regimen for eccentric calf-muscle training in patients with chronic insertional achilles tendinopathy: results of a pilot study [^112uDtYH]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy is seen in both physically active and non-active individuals. Painful eccentric training, where the patients load the Achilles tendon into full dorsiflexion, has shown good results in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinosis. However, only 32% of patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy had good clinical results with that type of eccentric training regimen.

Aim

To investigate whether a new model of painful eccentric training had an effect on chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy.

Patients and Methods

27 patients (12 men, 15 women, mean age 53 years) with a total of 34 painful Achilles tendons with a long duration of pain (mean 26 months), diagnosed as insertional Achilles tendinopathy, were included. The patients performed a new model of painful eccentric training regimen without loading into dorsiflexion. This was done as 3x15 reps, twice a day, 7 days/week, for 12 weeks. Pain during Achilles-tendon-loading activity (VAS) and patient's satisfaction (back to previous activity) were evaluated.

Results

At follow-up (mean 4 months) 18 patients (67%, 23/34 tendons) were satisfied and back to their previous tendon-loading activity. Their mean VAS had decreased from 69.9 (SD 18.9) to 21 (SD 20.6) (p < 0.001). Nine patients (11 tendons) were not satisfied with the treatment, although their VAS was significantly reduced from 77.5 (8.6) to 58.1 (14.8) (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

In this short-term pilot study this new model of painful eccentric calf-muscle training showed promising clinical results in 67% of the patients.

### What is a recurrence? The onset, frequency and time loss impact of recurrent calf muscle strain injuries in elite male Australian football players over a decade [^114sBTSZ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

The criteria used to define a recurrence impact key outcomes associated with recurrent calf muscle strain injuries. Depending on the definition, up to 1-in-5 cases are recurrent, and almost two-thirds may fall ≤ 6 months. Information about subsequent injuries may help guide practitioners in a range of settings in management and prevention, including recognising the significant impact when rehabilitation fails early. It should also be acknowledged that even with recommended IOC terminology becoming available, the threshold that represents a reportable injury before full recovery is not always straightforward. On opposing ends of the spectrum are 'exacerbations' that completely halt rehabilitation and require the process to begin from 'square one' vs scenarios where progress plateaus temporarily due to mild symptoms — but an athlete's prognosis remains largely unaltered. Not recording these presentations has been reported as a limitation of previously conducted prospective muscle injury research focusing on recurrences. Further nuance may exist within current recommendations, and considering these subsequent injuries in reporting adds value to understanding the aetiology of recurrence and improving management.

### Ankle-foot orthoses for improving walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders [^115qPbFW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Calf muscle weakness is a common symptom in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders that lead to walking problems like instability and increased walking effort. The mainstay of treatment to improve walking in this population is the provision of ankle-foot-orthoses (AFOs). Since we are not aware of an up-to-date and complete overview of the effects of AFOs used for calf muscle weakness in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, we reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of AFOs to improve walking in this patient group, in order to support clinical decision-making.

Objectives

To review the evidence for the effects of ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) for improving walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders.

Search Methods

On 10 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including randomised cross-over studies and quasi-RCTs, and non-randomised studies (NRSs) that examined the effects of AFO interventions compared with shoes-only walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We summarised findings for the primary outcome (objectively measured walking effort, assessed as walking energy cost) and secondary outcomes (perceived walking effort, physical mobility, gait parameters, AFO use, satisfaction with the AFO, and adverse events). We grouped results according to the type of AFO material and synthesised them in meta-analysis where possible. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included four randomised cross-over studies and six NRSs with 186 participants in total (the smallest study had 8 participants and the largest had 37). All studies were designed as self-controlled studies and examined the effects of custom-made and/or prefabricated AFOs. The AFOs were made of carbon (5 studies), polypropylene (5 studies), silicone (1 study), metal (1 study), elastic materials (2 studies), or leather combined with other materials (1 study). Outcome measures with AFOs were assessed during a single session (in some studies, people already used the study AFO in daily life), when the AFO was delivered, or at three-week or three-month follow-up. We judged one study to be at moderate risk of bias, and nine studies to be at high or serious risk of bias, primarily due to bias arising from period and carryover effects, selection bias, the inability to blind participants and assessors, missing data, and selective reporting. We found that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (mean difference (MD) -0.86 J/kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.33 to -0.39; 2 studies, 45 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may increase walking speed (MD 0.19 m/s, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.27; 4 studies, 71 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to shoes-only walking. We found that leather AFOs may increase walking speed (MD 0.25 m/s, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43; 1 study, 11 participants; low-certainty evidence). Little or no effect on walking speed was found with polypropylene AFOs (MD 0.00 m/s, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.11; 2 studies, 25 participants; low-certainty evidence) and elastic AFOs (MD 0.03 m/s, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.18; 1 study, 14 participants; low-certainty evidence). Carbon AFOs may also enhance satisfaction while walking (1 study, 16 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were unable to draw conclusions about perceived walking effort (one study, 8 participants), balance (two studies, 21 participants), and AFO use (two studies, 51 participants), as the evidence is very uncertain. Finally, two studies (45 participants) reported on adverse events (low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence for ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) to improve walking in adults with calf muscle weakness comes from a limited number of small studies with heterogeneity in intervention characteristics and outcome assessment, and is of low to very low certainty. The evidence suggests that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (effort), increase walking speed, and enhance satisfaction, and leather AFOs may increase walking speed, while polypropylene and elastic AFOs may make little or no difference to walking speed. We are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of AFOs on perceived walking effort, balance, and use. Nor can we draw conclusions about adverse effects of using AFOs. The variety in the findings for AFOs made of different materials suggests further investigation is warranted to explore how different AFO materials impact walking improvement in people with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders.

### Superior short-term results with eccentric calf muscle training compared to concentric training in a randomized prospective multicenter study on patients with chronic achilles tendinosis [^111fbWPB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2001). Low credibility.

In a previous uncontrolled pilot study we demonstrated very good clinical results with eccentric calf muscle training on patients with painful chronic Achilles tendinosis located at the 2–6 cm level in the tendon. In the present prospective multicenter study (Sundsvall and Umeå) patients with painful chronic Achilles tendinosis at the 2–6 cm level in the tendon were randomized to treatment with either an eccentric or a concentric training regimen for the calf muscles. The study included 44 patients, with 22 patients (12 men, 10 women; mean age 48 years) in each treatment group. The amount of pain during activity (jogging or walking) was recorded by the patients on a visual analogue scale, and patient satisfaction was assessed before and after treatment. The patients were instructed to perform their eccentric or concentric training regimen on a daily basis for 12 weeks. In both types of treatment regimen the patients were told to do their exercises despite experiencing pain or discomfort in the tendon during exercise. The results showed that after the eccentric training regimen 82% of the patients (18/22) were satisfied and had resumed their previous activity level (before injury), compared to 36% of the patients (8/22) who were treated with the concentric training regimen. The results after treatment with eccentric training was significantly better (P < 0.002) than after concentric training. The good clinical results previously demonstrated in the pilot study with eccentric calf muscle training on patients with chronic Achilles tendinosis, were thus reproduced in this multicenter, showing superior results to treatment with concentric training.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids… [^115UsGuX]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 and includes recommendations for managing acute, subacute, and chronic pain. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations.

This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death. Introduction Background Pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care in the United States. An important aim of pain management is the provision of person-centered care built on trust between patients and clinicians. Such care includes appropriate evaluation to identify potentially reversible causes of pain and establish a diagnosis and measurable treatment outcomes that focus on optimizing function and quality of life.

To achieve this aim, it is important that clinicians consider the full range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for pain care, and that health systems, payers, and governmental programs and entities make the full spectrum of evidence-based treatments accessible to patients with pain and their treating clinicians. Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012 and pain related to procedures.

In 2020, several of these indications were prioritized by an ad hoc committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease — alternative diagnoses for leg pain or claudication with normal physiological testing (Not PAD-Related) are enumerated with characteristic patterns. Symptomatic Baker's cyst is "Behind knee, down calf", has "Swelling, tenderness", occurs "With exercise", is "Also present at rest", and is "Not intermittent". Venous claudication involves the "Entire leg, worse in calf", with "Tight, bursting pain" "After walking" that "Subsides slowly", relief "speeded by elevation", and a "History of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis; edema; signs of venous stasis". Chronic compartment syndrome affects the "Calf muscles" with "Tight, bursting pain" "After much exercise (jogging)", that "Subsides very slowly", with "Relief with rest", and occurs in "Typically heavy muscled athletes". Spinal stenosis presents in "Often bilateral buttocks, posterior leg" with "Pain and weakness", may "mimic claudication", has "Variable relief but can take a long time to recover", improves with "Relief by lumbar spine flexion", and is "Worse with standing and extending spine". Nerve root compression pain "Radiates down leg", is "Sharp lancinating pain", is "Induced by sitting, standing, or walking", is "Often present at rest", "Improved by change in position", with a "History of back problems; worse with sitting; relief when supine or sitting". Hip arthritis produces "Aching discomfort" in the "Lateral hip, thigh" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and is "Improved when not weight bearing", with "history of degenerative arthritis". Foot/ankle arthritis causes "Aching pain" in the "Ankle, foot, arch" "After variable degree of exercise", is "Not quickly relieved", and "May be relieved by not weight bearing", with symptoms that "may be related to activity level or present at rest".

### Running retraining to treat lower limb injuries: a mixed-methods study of current evidence synthesised with expert opinion [^114DbDCY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Importance

Running-related injuries are highly prevalent.

Objective

Synthesise published evidence with international expert opinion on the use of running retraining when treating lower limb injuries.

Design

Mixed methods.

Methods

A systematic review of clinical and biomechanical findings related to running retraining interventions were synthesised and combined with semistructured interviews with 16 international experts covering clinical reasoning related to the implementation of running retraining.

Results

Limited evidence supports the effectiveness of transition from rearfoot to forefoot or midfoot strike and increase step rate or altering proximal mechanics in individuals with anterior exertional lower leg pain; and visual and verbal feedback to reduce hip adduction in females with patellofemoral pain. Despite the paucity of clinical evidence, experts recommended running retraining for: iliotibial band syndrome; plantar fasciopathy (fasciitis); Achilles, patellar, proximal hamstring and gluteal tendinopathy; calf pain; and medial tibial stress syndrome. Tailoring approaches to each injury and individual was recommended to optimise outcomes. Substantial evidence exists for the immediate biomechanical effects of running retraining interventions (46 studies), including evaluation of step rate and strike pattern manipulation, strategies to alter proximal kinematics and cues to reduce impact loading variables.

Summary and Relevance

Our synthesis of published evidence related to clinical outcomes and biomechanical effects with expert opinion indicates running retraining warrants consideration in the treatment of lower limb injuries in clinical practice.

### Gout, have we MET before? No, not like this [^117PEfWf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

Extra-articular symptoms could be the first manifestation of gouty arthritis (GA); polyarticular GA can mimic an infectious arthritis; infection can complicate GA.

Case

A 66-year-old male with a history of gout presented with high fever and excruciating bilateral calf pain for 1 day. Examination revealed chronic knee effusions; range of motion in both knees was limited by calf pain. Joint aspiration showed negatively birefringent intracellular crystals and normal gram stain.

Hospital Course

While receiving empiric antibiotics fever continued and he developed bilateral knee, right ankle, and shoulder pain. After demonstration of urate crystals and exclusion of infection, antibiotics were discontinued and steroids initiated. Fever, calf pain, and polyarthritis quickly resolved.

Discussion

Polyarticular gouty attack is an uncommon presentation of gout, and can mimic several other conditions. An exceptional presentation of this entity is excruciating calf pain, probably caused by tenosynovitis or referred pain preceding an acute polyarticular gouty attack.

### Vasculitis restricted to the lower limbs: a clinical and histopathological study [^115r8NMS]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Rare cases of vasculitis restricted to the lower limbs have been reported, but the characteristics, outcome and response to treatment of this entity are not well known.

Objective

To describe the clinical, complementary examinations and response to treatment of this rare entity in the first retrospective series, and to compare data with historical pooled cases.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of all biopsy-proven cases observed over a 10-year period in four French tertiary medical units. Diagnosis of vasculitis restricted to the lower limb required the absence of any clinical symptom and complementary test finding, suggesting major extramuscular visceral involvement.

Results

11 patients were included. Vasculitis restricted to the lower limb was associated with disabling muscle pain of the calves. Fever was present in 50% of cases; ankle arthralgia in 50% and skin involvement in 40%. MRI was the cornerstone of the diagnosis, showing hyperintense signal in T2 weight and in T1 weight after gadolinium injection. MRI findings correlated well with clinical outcome and were useful in guiding biopsy. Muscle biopsy was consistent with a polyarteritis nodosa-type vasculitis in only 40% cases, whereas a leucocytoclastic vasculitis was seen for all other cases. Treatment with corticosteroids was effective in all cases, but there were relapses requiring immunosuppressive agents in 54% of cases.

Conclusion

Vasculitis of the calf muscles must be considered for patients with calf pain and with a biological inflammatory syndrome.

### Impact of autologous blood injections in treatment of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy: double blind randomised controlled trial [^116nBpnL]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the effectiveness of two peritendinous autologous blood injections in addition to a standardised eccentric calf strengthening programme in improving pain and function in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

Design Single centre, participant and single assessor blinded, parallel group, randomised, controlled trial.

Setting Single sports medicine clinic in New Zealand.

Participants 53 adults (mean age 49, 53% men) with symptoms of unilateral mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy for at least three months. Participants were excluded if they had a history of previous Achilles tendon rupture or surgery or had undergone previous adjuvant treatments such as injectable therapies, glyceryl trinitrate patches, or extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

Interventions All participants underwent two unguided peritendinous injections one month apart with a standardised protocol. The treatment group had 3 mL of their own whole blood injected while the control group had no substance injected (needling only). Participants in both groups carried out a standardised and monitored 12 week eccentric calf training programme. Follow-up was at one, two, three and six months.

Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was the change in symptoms and function from baseline to six months with the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score. Secondary outcomes were the participant's perceived rehabilitation and their ability to return to sport.

Results 26 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 27 to the control group. In total, 50 (94%) completed the six month study, with 25 in each group. Clear and clinically worthwhile improvements in the VISA-A score were evident at six months in both the treatment (change in score 18.7, 95% confidence interval 12.3 to 25.1) and control (19.9, 13.6 to 26.2) groups. The overall effect of treatment was not significant (P = 0.689) and the 95% confidence intervals at all points precluded clinically meaningful benefit or harm. There was no significant difference between groups in secondary outcomes or in the levels of compliance with the eccentric calf strengthening programme. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusion The administration of two unguided peritendinous autologous blood injections one month apart, in addition to a standardised eccentric training programme, provides no additional benefit in the treatment of mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.

### Chronic achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training [^115F1gJA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Injuries involving the Achilles tendon and manifested as chronic tendon pain are common, especially among recreational athletes. In a pilot study on a small group of patients with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, eccentric calf-muscle training was shown to give good clinical results. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate if the previously achieved good clinical results could be reproduced in a larger group of patients, and also to investigate the effects of eccentric calf-muscle training in patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain. Seventy-eight consecutive patients, having chronic painful Achilles tendinosis at the mid-portion (2–6 cm level) in a total of 101 tendons (55 unilateral and 23 bilateral), and thirty consecutive patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain in 31 tendons (29 unilateral and one bilateral) were treated with eccentric calf-muscle training for 12 weeks. Most patients were recreational athletes. Evaluation of the amount of tendon pain during activity was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS), before and after treatment. In 90 of the 101 Achilles tendons (89%) with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, treatment was satisfactory and the patients were back on their pre-injury activity level after the 12-week training regimen. In these patients, the amount of pain during activity, registered on the VAS-scale (mean ± SD), decreased significantly from 66.8 ± 19.4 to 10.2 ± 13.7. On the contrary, in only ten of the tendons (32%) with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain was treatment satisfactory, with a significant decrease on the VAS-scale (mean ± SD), from 68.3 ± 7.0 to 13.3 ± 13.2. Our conclusion is that treatment with eccentric calf-muscle training produced good clinical results in patients with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, but not in patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendon pain.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^115cBtEZ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — dry needling: Clinicians may use combined therapy of dry needling with injection under ultrasound guidance and eccentric exercise to decrease pain for individuals with symptoms greater than 3 months and increased tendon thickness, and clinicians may use intramuscular dry needling to treat calf-related muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in those with more acute symptoms and/or in those who do not tolerate a progressive loading program. In an RCT, individuals were assigned to either intramuscular stimulation (n = 25), sham intramuscular stimulation (n = 19), or exercise only (n = 8); all groups received a standardized 12-week progressive eccentric exercise program, and there were no differences in improvement in the VISA-A between any of the groups at weeks 6, 12, 26, or 52. One small RCT found that there was no additional benefit of adding intramuscular dry needling, with or without stimulation, to tendon loading exercise; no severe harms were reported, most participants experienced a deep ache and/or muscle contraction with needle insertion, and occasionally minor bruising was associated with dry needling. There is a need to determine the efficacy of dry needling in conjunction with other modalities or as a stand-alone treatment, and dry needling may have a place in improving pain and range of motion, particularly in those with more acute symptoms, myofascial trigger points in the calf, and/or those who do not tolerate a progressive loading program.

### An applied study of ulinastatin in pain management after hip replacement: impact on opioid use [^116MkYJp]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary Outcomes: Pain Scores and Adverse Events

Seventy-two hours post-surgery, the average pain score for the control group stood at 1.6 (95% CI, 1.28–1.92), whereas the experimental group registered a score of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.61–2.07; P = 0.211). This difference in pain scores did not surpass the preestablished minimum clinically significant difference of one point. Figure 3 presents the VAS scores for mean resting pain across both groups over a span of 72 h. Upon discharge, most patients from both the standard treatment and ulinastatin groups expressed satisfaction with their pain management, with no noteworthy differences between the groups. The odds ratio for dissatisfaction in the standard treatment group was 1.058 (95% CI, 0.62–1.82; P > 0.05). During the 72-hour observation period, six adverse events were documented: four occurred in the standard treatment group (10%) and two in the ulinastatin group (3.6%). In the standard treatment cohort, four serious adverse events were reported, including joint dislocation and a high fever not related to postoperative pain management. The investigative commission attributed two of these serious events (joint dislocations) directly to the surgical procedures rather than to the medications administered during the trial. In contrast, the two adverse events noted in the ulinastatin group involved calf swelling, which the committee identified as tension pain. This condition exacerbated the patients' pain and led to an increase in the use of pain relievers. Within the standard treatment group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions included drowsiness in 15 patients (37.5%), gastrointestinal discomfort in 13 (32.5%), and dizziness in 4 (10%). In contrast, the ulinastatin group reported gastrointestinal discomfort in 5 patients (8.9%), drowsiness in 2 patients (3.6%), and dizziness in 1 patient (1.9%).

### A randomized controlled trial of standard vs customized graduated elastic compression stockings in patients with chronic venous disease [^114SKmqt]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial
- **Key Findings**: In 79 patients, customized gradient compression stockings (c-GECSs) demonstrated higher quality of life scores and longer wearing durations compared with standard graduated elastic compression stockings (s-GECSs). In addition, c-GECSs demonstrated higher interface pressure than s-GECS at 6 months.
- **Take Home Message**: The c-GECSs demonstrate potential advantages over s-GECSs in terms of enhanced comfort, improved compliance, and better maintenance of pressure.

Elastic compression stockings (ECSs) can effectively relieve symptoms of chronic venous disease (CVD), including pain, heaviness, cramps, and edema. Current guidelines recommend the use of ECSs to decrease venous symptoms for patients with symptomatic CVD. However, many patients complain that ECSs are too tight and uncomfortable. Other than the pressure exerted by ECSs, some individuals report that standard ECSs do not fit properly owing to variations in leg shape, calf and ankle size, and distribution of body fat.

Customized graduated ECSs (c-GECSs) based on parametric modeling of human calves of different sizes were recently evaluated in vitro. However, discrepancies between the theoretical pressure profile indicated by the manufacturers and variations in leg size among actual patients have been reported. Patient compliance remains a crucial concern when using ECSs in clinical practice. Hence, alternative measures are needed to improve patient compliance to ensure the efficacy of ECSs.

The aim of this study was to compare standard GECSs (s-GECSs) with c-GECSs in terms of quality of life (QOL), effectiveness for treatment of CVD-related venous edema, and pressure maintenance. We hypothesized that c-GECSs would be superior in all outcome aspects compared with s-GECSs in this population.

### Calf muscle therapy for achilles tendinosis… [^11457vC6]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

to the editor: The most important message from the article, "Common Conditions of the Achilles Tendon, " 1 was conservative therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice, rest, stretching, increased warm-up, and heel lifts. Based on the current literature, heavy eccentric calf muscle training should be given greater consideration as the preferred therapy. The authors 1 mention that "one study 2 showed that calf muscle training is associated with a faster recovery time. " The referenced study 2 of treatment of chronic Achilles tendinosis compared heavy-load eccentric calf muscle training with standard conservative therapy. Eccentric muscle training applies resistance only during the lengthening of a muscle. In the study, 2 15 recreational athletes were treated with conservative therapy and another 15 recreational athletes were treated with heavy eccentric calf muscle training. The mean age was 44 years in the treatment group and 40 years in the control group.

All patients had degenerative changes in the tendon 2 to 6 cm above the Achilles tendon insertion on the calcaneus seen on ultrasonographs, and had pain in this area for at least three months. The result of the study 2 was that all members of the treatment group were running pain-free in three months, and none of the patients in the "conservative therapy" group had regained full function. Although the treatment group was small, the results were compelling. These results are supported by similar studies 3, 4 of eccentric calf training. Heavy-load eccentric calf muscle training appears to be an effective, safe, and reasonable treatment of a difficult chronic condition.
2. The patient population I serve here at the Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg, N. C., is an active one, and Achilles tendinosis is a common complaint.

My experience with using this technique of calf muscle training in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinosis has been that it is effective and superior to conservative measures. One of the greatest values of this treatment is that people can continue to run during therapy. Patients who are prone to recurrent bouts of this condition continue the therapy at a reduced intensity as effective prophylaxis. Active patients do not respond well to clinical recommendations that require prolonged decrease in activity or surgery with a prolonged recovery period.

### The effectiveness of acupuncture on myofascial trigger points versus traditional Chinese medicine acupoints for treating plantar fasciitis with low back pain: a study protocol for a randomised clinical trial [^116xTnpf]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Acupuncture is one of the therapies based on ancient Chinese philosophy and commonly involves manual stimulation of the needles. Traditional acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into acupoints located on meridians and to achieve a deqi sensation, such as numbness, fullness, warmth, or soreness, either locally or radiating along a certain meridian. Dry needling involves inserting needles in myofascial trigger points. The use of needling can involve acupuncture needles or any other type of injection needle without any liquid. Both acupuncture and trigger point dry needling can also be used to treat plantar fasciitis. These techniques involve the insertion of needles into the body to reduce pain and promote healing. Dry needling typically targets body trigger points to treat musculoskeletal conditions, while acupuncture focuses on acupoints to treat a variety of diseases. Trigger points associated with heel pain are found in the flexor digitorum brevis and quadratus plantae muscles of the foot, as well as in the soleus muscles in the calves. One study indicated that trigger point dry needling may reduce pain, but the degree of reduction may not be clinically significant. Another study suggested that dry needling may reduce heel pain more effectively than methylprednisolone acetate injections after more than three months in adults. A meta-analysis showed that dry-needling might be effective in reducing the heel pain due to plantar fasciitis and low back pain. However, due to limited evidence, whether dry needling is recommended for patients with plantar fasciitis remains controversial. Acupuncture alone, or combined with conventional therapies (eg, ice therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stretching) may improve pain in the short term in participants with plantar fasciitis and low back pain.

### Effects on neovascularisation behind the good results with eccentric training in chronic mid-portion achilles tendinosis? [^115nzQye]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The background to the good clinical results reported using painful eccentric calf-muscle training as treatment for chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis is not known. Recently, using ultrasound and colour Doppler technique, we showed that painful tendinosis was associated with a local neovascularisation. Furthermore, in a pilot study, destroying these neovessels by sclerosing therapy cured the pain in most patients. Dynamic ultrasound and colour Doppler examination has shown that the flow in the neovessels stops during dorsiflexion in the ankle joint. Therefore, it was of interest to study the occurrence of neovascularisation before and after eccentric training. Forty-one tendons in 30 patients (22 men and 8 women, mean age 48 years) with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis were examined with ultrasonography and colour Doppler, before and after 12 weeks of eccentric calf-muscle training. Before treatment, there was a local neovascularisation in the area with tendon changes (hypo-echoic areas, irregular fibre structure) in all tendons. At follow-up after treatment (mean 28 months), there was a good clinical result (no tendon pain during activity) in 36/41 tendons, and a poor result in 5/41 tendons. In 34/36 tendons with a good clinical result of treatment there was a more normal tendon structure, and in 32/36 tendons there was no remaining neovascularisation. In 5/5 tendons with a poor clinical result there was a remaining neovascularisation in the tendon, and in 2/5 tendons there were remaining structural abnormalities. In conclusion, in patients with chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinosis, a good clinical result after eccentric training seems to be associated with a more normal tendon structure and no remaining neovascularisation. Action on the area with neovessels during the eccentric training regimen might possibly be responsible for the good clinical results.

### Clinical impact of metabolic syndrome on eccentric exercises for chronic insertional achilles tendinopathy [^1129L8cC]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic syndrome is one factor known to contribute to the development of tendinopathies. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of eccentric calf-muscle exercise for treatment of chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy in patients with or without metabolic syndrome. Twenty-eight patients with chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy and metabolic syndrome who performed eccentric calf-muscle exercise were retrospectively compared with 28 age- and sex-matched controls without metabolic syndrome. Comparisons between the 2 groups were made by evaluating the Visual Analog Scale for pain, patient satisfaction, and amount of pain medications needed during 3 months of follow-up. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures showed that the pain scales in the metabolic syndrome group were higher than those in the control group during the follow-up period (F[1,54] = 24.45, p < .001). The patient satisfaction ratings were lower and the amount of required pain medication was higher in the metabolic syndrome group (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). Eccentric calf-muscle exercises for chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy were less effective in patients with metabolic syndrome. Therefore, these patients should be managed with a combination of other treatment modalities rather than eccentric exercise alone.

Figure 4
Change in epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD)

Skin biopsies from the standard distal leg site (lower calf) were largely devoid of epidermal nerve fibers and demonstrated an increase in ENFD at 1 year (p = 0.014) (A). Skin biopsies from the upper thigh revealed no significant change in ENFD in participants taking placebo vs serine (B). Correlation between changes in ENFD in the lower calf and changes in plasma deoxysphingosine levels is shown in (C).

No treatment effects were detected in nerve conduction studies or AFT (table 2). In addition, none of the patient-reported outcomes revealed significant differences between treatment groups (table 2). No significant effect of treatment on NPS scores was observed, but mean levels of "unpleasant pain" were numerically lower among participants on-serine vs those on placebo at 1 year, with further relative reduction in pain at 2 years (relative change of −0.18 ± 1.2 points, p = 0.88; and −0.85 ± 1.4 points, p = 0.56, respectively). No difference in "sharp pain" was seen between the 2 groups following 1 year of treatment (-serine participants had relative change of 0.14 ± 1.4 points, p = 0.92). No significant effect of treatment on SF-36 scores was observed, but mean physical functioning component scores were numerically lower in the treatment group in the first year and in both groups following crossover to open-label-serine (+4.2 points at 1 year in-serine group, 95% CI −4.2 to 1.5, p = 0.29) (table 2).

### Patients with persistent pain after breast cancer treatment show enhanced alpha activity in spontaneous EEG [^1154HmxY]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether patients with persistent pain after breast cancer treatment show an enhanced and slowed dominant alpha activity in their electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during rest in comparison with patients that also had undergone breast cancer treatment but do not have pain.

Methods

The spontaneous EEG was recorded during rest and before painful stimulation of the calf and analyzed with spectral analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation). Outcome measures, i.e., alpha indices (center of gravity and overall amplitude), were statistically tested between patients with and without persistent pain.

Results

In comparison with patients without pain, patients with persistent pain after breast cancer treatment show more alpha activity in their spontaneous EEG observed from parietal-occipital brain regions.

Conclusion

Persistent pain after breast cancer treatment affects spontaneous brain activity, which might influence cognitive functioning.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^116SeGib]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic trauma — risk settings and anatomic distribution emphasize maintaining a high index of suspicion for compartment syndrome, as all high-energy injuries warrant consideration of compartment syndrome; although it is most common in the leg and the forearm, it can occur in any fascial compartment of the extremities (hand, forearm, upper arm, deltoid, buttocks, thigh, calf, and foot), and most compartment syndromes occur in the calf or forearm. A detailed history regarding the mechanism of the injury, a thorough physical exam specifically evaluating for compartment syndrome, and radiographic studies assessing the extent of bony injuries are key.

### Tendinopathies of the foot and ankle [^112NWF4n]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Because our understanding of tendinopathy has evolved in recent years, the condition is now considered a degenerative process; this affects the approach to treatment. Initial therapy should always involve relative rest and modification of physical activity, use of rehabilitative exercises, and evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic causes of injury. The posterior tibial tendon is a dynamic arch stabilizer; injury to this tendon can cause a painful flat-footed deformity with hindfoot valgus and midfoot abduction (characterized by the too many toes sign). Treatment of posterior tibial tendinopathy is determined by its severity and can include immobilization, orthotics, physical therapy, or subspecialty referral. Because peroneal tendinopathy is often misdiagnosed, it can lead to chronic lateral ankle pain and instability and should be suspected in a patient with either of these symptoms. Treatment involves physical therapy and close monitoring for surgical indications. Achilles tendinopathy is often caused by overtraining, use of inappropriate training surfaces, and poor flexibility. It is characterized by pain in the Achilles tendon 4 to 6 cm above the point of insertion into the calcaneus. Evidence from clinical trials shows that eccentric strengthening of the calf muscle can help patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Flexor hallucis longus tendinopathy is most common among ballet dancers. Patients may complain of an insidious onset of pain in the posteromedial aspect of the ankle; treatment involves correcting physical training errors, focusing on body mechanics, and strengthening the body's core. Anterior tibial tendinopathy is rare, but is typically seen in patients older than 45 years. It causes weakness in dorsiflexion of the ankle; treatment involves short-term immobilization and physical therapy.

Neurogenic Claudication

Claudication refers to intermittent pain in the lower extremities that is exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Neurogenic claudication must be differentiated from other mimickers, most significantly VC. NC is a pain syndrome whose etiology is LSS, which is a reduction in the cross-sectional area of the lumbar spinal canal. The symptoms of NC are thought to arise from a combination of mechanical compression and circulatory dysfunction within the cauda equina nerve roots. In addition to pain, patients with NC may complain of leg heaviness, numbness, tingling, and weakness. The pain from NC is classically worsened by lumbar extension and alleviated with lumbar flexion. The improvement in pain and facilitating of ambulation with forward flexion is sometimes called the positive shopping cart sign. The diagnosis of NC is made from the history and involves pain in the low back, buttocks, thighs, and/or legs that develops with prolonged standing and walking and is relieved when the patient sits down. The symptoms of NC are generally bilateral.

CT and MRI images of LSS have been shown to sometimes correlate poorly with lower extremity symptoms, and therefore, the history and examination remain important. A study of the reliability of differentiating NC from VC based on symptomatology has shown that the most sensitive symptom (sensitivity 0.97) to rule out NC was the absence of "triggering of pain with standing alone". This same study found that there was a strong likelihood of NC if patients showed a constellation of positive "shopping cart sign", symptoms above the knees, symptoms triggered with standing alone and symptoms relieved with sitting. Patients with symptoms in the calf relieved with standing alone had a strong likelihood of VC.

There is no gold standard diagnostic tool for NC and patients with radiographically severe LSS may be asymptomatic. In some settings, the diagnosis of NC is supported by a positive response to intralaminar lumbar epidural injection with steroid and local anesthetic or with local anesthetic alone. The published evidence has shown that such epidural injections provide both short- and long-term relief for patients with NC and can improve gait function. Thus, it is the opinion of the authors that a response to such injections can be helpful in making a diagnosis of NC.

### Lower extremity peripheral artery disease without chronic limb-threatening ischemia: a review [^116MZk4o]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects approximately 8.5 million people in the US and approximately 230 million worldwide.

Observations

Peripheral artery disease is uncommon before aged 50 years but affects up to 20% of people aged 80 years and older. It can be noninvasively diagnosed with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a ratio of Doppler-recorded pressures in the dorsalis pedis and/or posterior tibial artery in each leg to brachial artery pressures. An ABI value less than 0.90 is 57% to 79% sensitive and 83% to 99% specific for arterial stenosis of at least 50%. Intermittent claudication, consisting of exertional calf pain that does not begin at rest and that resolves within 10 minutes of rest, is considered the classic symptom of PAD. However, 70% to 90% of people with an ABI value less than 0.90 either report no exertional leg symptoms (ie, asymptomatic) or report leg symptoms with walking that are not consistent with classic claudication. Over time, people with PAD restrict walking activity or slow walking speed to avoid leg symptoms. Thus, although approximately 75% of people with PAD report no change in leg symptoms over time, those with PAD have significantly greater annual declines in 6-minute walk performance compared with those without it. Approximately 11% of people with PAD develop chronic limb-threatening ischemia, the most severe form of PAD. Compared with people without PAD, those with the disease have approximately twice the rate of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major coronary events at 10-year follow-up. High-dose statins and antiplatelet therapy with or without antithrombotic therapy reduced rates of coronary events and stroke in people with PAD. Supervised treadmill exercise improved 6-minute walk distance by 30 to 35 m, consistent with a clinically meaningful change, whereas effective home-based walking exercise interventions improved 6-minute walk by 42 to 53 m. Effective home-based exercise programs require behavioral methods, including monitoring by a coach.

Conclusions and Relevance

Peripheral artery disease affects approximately 230 million people worldwide and is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular events, lower extremity events, and functional decline compared with that of people without PAD. People with PAD should be treated with the highest dose of statin tolerated, antithrombotic and/or antiplatelet therapy, and exercise.

### Loading speed and intensity in eccentric calf training impact acute changes in achilles tendon thickness and stiffness: a randomized crossover trial [^113FfMSD]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Eccentric calf training for Achilles tendinopathy shows variable success in athletes. Recent insights suggest a role for tendon fluid flow (exudation or redistribution) during exercise, which explains post-exercise reductions in thickness and increases in stiffness of the tendon. This fluid flow is thought to be beneficial as it may promote tendon remodeling, reduce intratendinous pressure, and alleviate pain. In this perspective, slow, high-load exercises are promoted as they theoretically facilitate tendon fluid flow. However, evidence supporting this assumption is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether loading speed and intensity during eccentric calf training impact acute changes in midportion Achilles tendon thickness and stiffness, reflecting alterations in local tendon fluid content.

Methods

A randomized, assessor-blinded, crossover trial was conducted with 34 healthy athletes (17 men, 17 women, age: 23.7 ± 6 yr). Participants underwent three single-leg eccentric heel-drop interventions with 20% additional bodyweight, varying in loading speed (fast: 1 s, slow: 3 s) and loading intensity (low: to plantigrade, high: to maximal dorsiflexion). Achilles tendon anteroposterior diameter, cross-sectional area, and shear wave velocity were assessed in the midportion region using ultrasonography and shear wave elastography pre- and immediately post-intervention.

Results

The slow, high-load intervention produced greater immediate reductions in tendon anteroposterior diameter and cross-sectional area (8.9% and 10.1%), compared with the slow, low-load (3.8% and 4.7%) and fast, high-load (2.9% and 3.4%) interventions (P < 0.001). Moreover, only the slow, high-load intervention increased tendon shear wave velocity (54.5%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

These findings provide the first evidence that both loading speed and intensity during eccentric calf training impact acute changes in Achilles tendon thickness and stiffness, likely mediated by changes in fluid flow, which could be relevant for tendinopathy rehabilitation.

Treatment

Alectinib (300 mg two times a day) was administered as the initial treatment, and the gastrocnemius tumour shrank in a month. After 10 months of treatment with alectinib, the gastrocnemius tumour increased in size with pain again. And in spite of two cycles of second-line therapy using pemetrexed, the disease could not be controlled. Lorlatinib (100 mg one time a day) was initiated as third-line therapy.

Module 1 risk factors and primary prevention of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

Which individuals are at increased risk of developing Achilles tendinopathy and how can this be prevented?

This scoping question includes the following two subquestions

Which modifiable and non-modifiable factors increase the risk of Achilles tendinopathy?
Which primary prevention strategy is most effective for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

The onset of Achilles tendinopathy is generally related to ageing and overuse. In addition, biomechanical factors, genetic factors, specific health problems, medication use and imaging abnormalities are thought to be associated with the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. There is currently insufficient knowledge about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the onset of Achilles tendinopathy. This is important because it can inform (preventive) interventions.

Primary prevention aims to prevent an initial disease episode, and this is an important topic especially in sports. By applying primary prevention in specific populations at high risk of Achilles tendinopathy, both the incidence and long-term symptoms may be reduced.

There is insufficient knowledge about the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 1.

Recommendations

Midportion and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Consider informing individuals with a history of lower limb tendinopathy who are going to become active or increase their training load about the increased risk of Achilles tendinopathy.

A gradual training build-up, taking into account the type, frequency, size and intensity of the training.
Targeted calf muscle strengthening exercises prior to the sports season, in which the exercise dosage should be tailored to the individual.
Wearing enough warm clothing during training in the winter.

In the context of the importance of preventing Achilles tendinopathy, consider advising individuals to avoid the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if alternative antibiotics are available and the clinical picture allows.

### Endovascular treatment of the internal iliac artery in peripheral arterial disease [^1154RX8W]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

In patients with peripheral arterial disease not much is known about the relationship between the localization of the pain and the localization of arterial occlusions in the iliac arteries. Occlusions high in the iliac arteries are assumed to be able to induce pain in the buttocks and upper leg as well as pain in the calves. Several case reports show that the symptoms of arteriosclerotic lesions in the internal iliac artery are often atypical and not easy to diagnose. In this report, 3 patients with internal iliac artery occlusions who were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) are described. One patient had isolated pain in the buttock region. In the other 2 patients the initial pain was focused on the buttock region with extension to the calves during exercise. After PTA, 2 patients were free of symptoms, while in the other patient the symptoms improved but did not disappear. Future research should clarify the relation between certain arterial occlusions and the location of the pain.

### Effect of compression therapy on knee swelling and pain after total knee arthroplasty [^1136JNki]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Knee swelling after total knee arthroplasty may impair postoperative mobilisation and training, and as medical elastic compression stockings are well tolerated and effective to prevent oedema, haematoma and postoperative pain after venous surgery, we wanted to study whether this effect could be transferred to total knee arthroplasty surgery reducing postoperative swelling and pain and thereby facilitating mobilisation and improving patient-reported knee function.

Methods

In a randomised controlled study, 88 patients were randomised to use either a medical elastic compression stocking or no stocking from the first postoperative day and the following 4 weeks after total knee arthroplasty. Outcome measures were knee, calf and ankle swelling, knee flexion, pain and patient-reported knee function.

Results

Seventy per cent of the swelling had occurred before application of the stocking the day after surgery. Knee, calf and ankle swelling and knee flexion measured on days 2, 7, 14 and 30 showed no significant difference between the two groups. Maximum pain level at rest and at walking was similar for both groups during the observation period. Also, the Oxford knee score was similar between the two groups on days 14 and 30.

Conclusion

We did not find any clinical effect using a medical elastic compression stocking after total knee arthroplasty.

### Diagnosis, prevention and treatment of common lower extremity muscle injuries in sport-grading the evidence: a statement paper commissioned by the Danish society of sports physical therapy (DSSF) [^111F9kQS]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We have graded the quality of evidence concerning diagnosis, prevention and treatment of the most common muscle injuries and provide a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of the best available evidence. Most clinical tests showed very low to low diagnostic effectiveness. For hamstring injury prevention, programmes that included the Nordic hamstring exercise resulted in a risk reduction of 45% to 65% when compared with usual care. For prevention of groin injuries, both the FIFA 11+ programme and the Copenhagen adductor strengthening programme resulted in risk reduction of 41% when compared with usual care. For treatment of hamstring injuries, lengthening hamstring exercises showed fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate when compared with conventional hamstring exercises. Platelet-rich plasma had no effect on time to return-to-play and reinjury risk after a hamstring injury when compared with placebo or rehabilitation. Most outcomes for all muscle injuries and domains were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, indicating that further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates. At this point, research on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of muscle injuries primarily concerns hamstring muscle injuries, with only limited research on quadriceps, adductor and calf muscle injuries. Furthermore, muscle injury prevention research is mainly conducted in football, whereas muscle injury treatment research is conducted across different sports.

What is already known

Lower extremity muscle strain injuries are very common in multidirectional sports.
The quality of evidence related to diagnosis, prevention and treatment for the most common muscle injuries (hamstring, adductor, calf, rectus femoris/quadriceps) have not been investigated.

What are the new findings

Most clinical tests for acute muscle injuries show very low to low diagnostic effectiveness.
Hamstring and groin injuries can be reduced 40% to 65% using specific exercise interventions.
Lengthening hamstring exercises show fastest return to play and lower reinjury rate compared with conventional exercises, and platelet-rich plasma offers no additional effect to current rehabilitation.
Most outcomes were graded as very low to moderate quality of evidence, thus further high-quality research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the effect estimates.

### Short-term and mid-term outcome of isolated symptomatic muscular calf vein thrombosis [^114abi5Y]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although muscular calf vein thrombosis (MCVT) is commonly seen in everyday practice, no treatment guidelines are available. This study evaluated short-term and mid-term outcome of isolated symptomatic MCVT.

Method

We included prospectively and consecutively all patients referred to an outpatient clinic with isolated MCVT. Clinical signs were pain or edema, or both, of the calf. Diagnosis was established with duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination. Not completely occlusive and asymptomatic MCVTs were excluded. Patients were followed up clinically and with DUS at 1, 3, and 9 months, and up to 36 months. Anticoagulant therapy at curative dosage associated with compression was prescribed for 1 month and was extended for 2 additional months in case of incomplete recanalization at 1 month or if risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) were present.

Results

Included were 128 patients (78 women, 50 men) presenting with 131 MCVTs. Their mean age was 57.02 ± 15.36 years (range, 20 to 87 years). Thrombus was present in the soleal veins (SoV) in 73 patients (55.7%) and in the medial gastrocnemius veins (MGV) in 58 (44.3%). Initial symptoms were isolated pain in the calf in 90 patients, isolated edema of the calf in six, and pain plus edema in 32. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 53 patients (41.4%) for 1 month, in 59 (46.1%) for 3 months, and in 13 (10.2%) for ≥ 6 months. At baseline, nine pulmonary embolisms (7%), complicated with MCVT, were observed in six MGV patients (10.3%) and three SoV patients (4.1%; P = 0.18). Two nonfatal hemorrhagic events occurred. Three patients died during the follow-up after anticoagulant therapy had been discontinued. Recanalization of MCVT was considered complete at 1, 3, and 9 months in 54.8%, 84.7%, and 96% of cases, respectively, with no significant difference between the MGV and the SoV groups. Twenty-nine VTE symptomatic recurrences (PE, n = 6; DVT including MCVT, n = 23) were observed in 24 patients (18.8%), with similar figures in both thrombosis groups: none at 3 months, 11 between 3 and 9 months and 18 between 9 and 36 months. No extension of the MCVT or a recurrence of VTE was observed in patients treated with anticoagulant therapy. Twelve cases of superficial thrombophlebitis occurred during the follow-up period.

Conclusion

This study confirms the place of MCVT in VTE disorders. Pulmonary embolism at the MCVT initial diagnosis was not rare, and mid-term follow-up (mean, 26.7 months) revealed that 18.8% of patients had at least one VTE recurrence. The treatment of acute MCVT needs to be standardized because no guidelines currently exist.

### Exercise for intermittent claudication [^111g1E77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise programmes are a relatively inexpensive, low-risk option compared with other, more invasive therapies for treatment of leg pain on walking (intermittent claudication (IC)). This is the fourth update of a review first published in 1998.

Objectives

Our goal was to determine whether an exercise programme was effective in alleviating symptoms and increasing walking treadmill distances and walking times in people with intermittent claudication. Secondary objectives were to determine whether exercise was effective in preventing deterioration of underlying disease, reducing cardiovascular events, and improving quality of life.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Specialised Register (last searched 15 November 2016) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, along with trials registries.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of an exercise regimen versus control or versus medical therapy for people with IC due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). We included any exercise programme or regimen used for treatment of IC, such as walking, skipping, and running. Inclusion of trials was not affected by duration, frequency, or intensity of the exercise programme. Outcome measures collected included treadmill walking distance (time to onset of pain or pain-free walking distance and maximum walking time or maximum walking distance), ankle brachial index (ABI), quality of life, morbidity, or amputation; if none of these was reported, we did not include the trial in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update (2017), RAL and AH selected trials and extracted data independently. We assessed study quality by using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We analysed continuous data by determining mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and dichotomous data by determining risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model unless we identified significant heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review.

Main Results

We included two new studies in this update and identified additional publications for previously included studies, bringing the total number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria to 32, and involving a total of 1835 participants with stable leg pain. The follow-up period ranged from two weeks to two years. Types of exercise varied from strength training to polestriding and upper or lower limb exercises; supervised sessions were generally held at least twice a week. Most trials used a treadmill walking test for one of the primary outcome measures. The methodological quality of included trials was moderate, mainly owing to absence of relevant information. Most trials were small and included 20 to 49 participants. Twenty-seven trials compared exercise versus usual care or placebo, and the five remaining trials compared exercise versus medication (pentoxifylline, iloprost, antiplatelet agents, and vitamin E) or pneumatic calf compression; we generally excluded people with various medical conditions or other pre-existing limitations to their exercise capacity. Meta-analysis from nine studies with 391 participants showed overall improvement in pain-free walking distance in the exercise group compared with the no exercise group (MD 82.11 m, 95% CI 71.73 to 92.48, P < 0.00001, high-quality evidence). Data also showed benefit from exercise in improved maximum walking distance (MD 120.36 m, 95% CI 50.79 to 189.92, P < 0.0007, high-quality evidence), as revealed by pooling data from 10 studies with 500 participants. Improvements were seen for up to two years. Exercise did not improve the ABI (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08, 13 trials, 570 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Limited data were available for the outcomes of mortality and amputation; trials provided no evidence of an effect of exercise, when compared with placebo or usual care, on mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.17, 5 trials, 540 participants, moderate-quality evidence) or amputation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.15, 1 trial, 177 participants, low-quality evidence). Researchers measured quality of life using Short Form (SF)-36 at three and six months. At three months, the domains 'physical function', 'vitality', and 'role physical' improved with exercise; however this was a limited finding, as it was reported by only two trials. At six months, meta-analysis showed improvement in 'physical summary score' (MD 2.15, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.04, P = 0.02, 5 trials, 429 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and in 'mental summary score' (MD 3.76, 95% CI 2.70 to 4.82, P < 0.01, 4 trials, 343 participants, moderate-quality evidence) secondary to exercise. Two trials reported the remaining domains of the SF-36. Data showed improvements secondary to exercise in 'physical function' and 'general health'. The other domains - 'role physical', 'bodily pain', 'vitality', 'social', 'role emotional', and 'mental health' - did not show improvement at six months. Evidence was generally limited in trials comparing exercise versus antiplatelet therapy, pentoxifylline, iloprost, vitamin E, and pneumatic foot and calf compression owing to small numbers of trials and participants. Review authors used GRADE to assess the evidence presented in this review and determined that quality was moderate to high. Although results showed significant heterogeneity between trials, populations and outcomes were comparable overall, with findings relevant to the claudicant population. Results were pooled for large sample sizes - over 300 participants for most outcomes - using reproducible methods.

Authors' Conclusions

High-quality evidence shows that exercise programmes provided important benefit compared with placebo or usual care in improving both pain-free and maximum walking distance in people with leg pain from IC who were considered to be fit for exercise intervention. Exercise did not improve ABI, and we found no evidence of an effect of exercise on amputation or mortality. Exercise may improve quality of life when compared with placebo or usual care. As time has progressed, the trials undertaken have begun to include exercise versus exercise or other modalities; therefore we can include fewer of the new trials in this update.

### The controversy of managing calf vein thrombosis [^116Pz2hF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists as to whether all calf vein thrombi should be treated with anticoagulation or observed with duplex surveillance. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess whether data could support either approach, followed by examination of its natural history by stratifying results according to early clot propagation, pulmonary emboli (PE), recurrence, and postthrombotic syndrome (PTS).

Methods

A total of 1513 articles were reviewed that were published from January 1975 to August 2010 using computerized database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and extensive cross-references. English-language studies specifically examining calf deep vein thrombosis (C-DVT) defined as axial and/or muscular veins of the calf, not involving the popliteal vein, were included. Papers were independently reviewed by two investigators (E.M. F.L.) and quality graded based on nine methodologic standards reporting on four outcome parameters.

Results

Of the 1513 citations reviewed, 31 relevant papers meeting predefined criteria were found: six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 25 observational cohort studies or case series. There was a single RCT directly comparing anticoagulation with no anticoagulation with compression and duplex surveillance, and they found no difference in propagation, PE, or bleeding in a low-risk population. Based on two studies of moderately strong methodology, C-DVT propagation was reduced with anticoagulation. When treatment was unassigned, moderately strong evidence suggested that about 15% propagate to the popliteal vein or higher. However, based on nonrandomized data but with moderate to high quality (level A and B studies), propagation to popliteal or higher was 8% in those with no anticoagulation treated with surveillance only. Propagation involving adjacent calf veins but remaining in the calf occured in up to one-half of all those who propagate. Major bleeding was an intended endpoint in three RCTs and was reported as 0% to 6%, with a trend toward lower bleeding risk in more recent studies. PE during surveillance in studies with unassigned treatment was strikingly lower than the historical reports of PE recorded at presentation, emphasizing the distinction that must be made between the two entities. Recurrence in C-DVT is lower than thigh DVT, and data suggest that in low-risk groups with transient risk factors, 6 weeks of anticoagulation may be sufficient, as opposed to 12 weeks. Studies of PTS reported that patients with C-DVT had fewer symptoms than their thigh DVT counterparts. Approximately one out of 10 showed symptoms of CEAP Class 4 to 6; however, C5 or C6 with healed or active ulceration were not commonly encountered.

Conclusions

No study of strong methodology could be found to resolve the controversy of optimal treatment of C-DVT. Given the risks of propagation, PE, and recurrence, the option of doing nothing should be considered unacceptable. In the absence of strong evidence to support anticoagulation over imaging surveillance with selective anticoagulation, either method of managing calf DVT must remain as current acceptable standards.

### Prescribed exercise with compression vs compression alone in treating patients with venous leg ulcers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111bmACw]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Exercise is recommended as an adjuvant treatment for venous leg ulceration (VLU) to improve calf muscle pump function. However, the association of exercise with VLU healing has not been properly aggregated, and the effectiveness of different exercise interventions has not been characterized.

Objective

To summarize the association of different exercise interventions with VLU healing when used as an adjuvant to any form of compression.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched through October 9, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of any exercise compared with no exercise in participants with VLU were included, where compression was used as standard therapy and a healing outcome was reported. Independent title screening and full text review by 2 authors (A.J. J.S.) with appeal to a third author (J.P.) if disagreement was unresolved. Of the 519 articles screened, a total of 6 (1.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria for systematic review, including 5 for meta-analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent quality assessment for Cochrane risk of bias and data extraction by 2 authors with appeal to third author if disagreement unresolved (PRISMA). Data pooled using fixed effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The a priori primary outcome was any healing outcome (proportion healed, time to healing, or change in ulcer area). Secondary outcomes (adverse events, costs, and health-related quality of life) were only collected if a primary outcome was reported.

Results

Six RCTs were identified and 5 (190 participants) met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The exercise interventions were progressive resistance exercise alone (2 RCTs, 53 participants) or combined with prescribed physical activity (2 RCTs, 102 participants), walking only (1 RCT, 35 participants), or ankle exercises (1 RCT, 40 participants). Overall, exercise was associated with increased VLU healing at 12 weeks although the effect was imprecise (additional 14 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 1–27 cases per 100; P = 0.04). The combination of progressive resistance exercise plus prescribed physical activity appeared to be most effective, again with imprecision (additional 27 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 9–45 cases per 100; P = 0.004).

Conclusions and Relevance

The evidence base may now be sufficiently suggestive for clinicians to consider recommending simple progressive resistance and aerobic activity to suitable patients with VLU while further research is produced.

### Reassessing the villalta score's use of signs and symptoms [^112aysvh]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

We read with interest the study by Iding et al titled "Untangling profiles of post-thrombotic syndrome using unsupervised machine learning". The authors identified 4 distinct clusters exhibiting changes in symptom and sign profiles over a 6-month follow-up period. However, our review of the Villalta score for postthrombotic syndrome reveals an inherent weakness in the classification of signs and symptoms, which may influence the interpretation of their findings.

A sign is typically defined as an observable feature that conveys information or supports an inference about an underlying pathological process. In contrast, a symptom refers to a subjective deviation from normal function, as reported by the patient, although it may also be observed objectively in some cases. Objectively noted symptoms, however, are more accurately termed physical findings. Importantly, a symptom should be reclassified as a sign only if it supports a specific diagnostic inference.

Although we support Villalta's inclusion of clinical symptoms, we question the categorization of several elements listed as signs. For example, features such as pretibial edema, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, redness, venous ectasia, and ulceration are more appropriately classified as physical findings. Among the included criteria, pain elicited by calf compression is arguably the only true sign. Notably, the Villalta scale provides no standardized guidance on how this maneuver should be performed.

The maneuver can be executed either by applying forward pressure to the gastrocnemius muscle against the posterior aspect of the tibia or by grasping the calf between its lower and middle thirds and pressing anteriorly against the tibia. Understanding how this physical manipulation elicits pain is essential to ensure consistency in clinical assessment and reproducibility across raters.

The Villalta score demonstrates good to excellent interrater reliability, particularly in more severe cases, and is regarded as externally valid and clinically useful. However, significant limitations remain, most notably the lack of data regarding intrarater and test-retest reliability. Despite these concerns, the score remains a valuable tool for assessing disease severity across multiple dimensions. Improved classification of its 12 components, clearly distinguishing signs, symptoms, and physical findings, together with standardization of the calf compression technique, could enhance its utility in risk stratification and support more individualized treatment strategies.

### Perceived versus objective change in walking ability in peripheral artery disease: results from 3 randomized clinical trials of exercise therapy [^1138hosz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Leg Symptoms

The presence and characteristics of exertional leg symptoms were measured using the San Diego Claudication Questionnaire. Intermittent claudication was defined as exertional calf pain that was not present at rest and resolved within 10 minutes of rest. Atypical exertional leg symptoms were defined as exertional leg symptoms that did not meet criteria for intermittent claudication. Participants reporting no exertional leg symptoms were classified as "asymptomatic".

WIQ Distance Score

The WIQ was developed specifically for people with PAD, to measure perceived difficulty walking distances in the community. The WIQ includes 3 domains: walking distance, walking speed, and stair climbing. These analyses focused on the WIQ distance domain because it measures the participant's perception of difficulty walking long distances and therefore is most directly related to the 6‐minute walk test, an objective assessment of walking endurance, than the other WIQ domains (stair climbing and walking speed). The WIQ distance questionnaire consists of 7 questions measuring participants' perceived difficulty walking 7 specified distances, ranging from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks, without stopping to rest. For each question, participants indicated their perception of difficulty walking the distance on level ground without stopping to rest on a 0–4 scale, where 0 represents inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty walking the distance. A total WIQ distance score was calculated, ranging from 0 to 100 (100 = best and indicates no difficulty walking any of the distances) as previously described.

The WIQ also includes Likert scale questions about the degree to which pain, aching, or cramps in calves or buttocks cause difficulty walking and the degree to which pain or aching in the thighs cause difficulty walking. Responses to each question are rated on a 5‐point scale, ranging from "none" to "very difficult". For these analyses, participants were classified according to whether their response at 6‐month follow‐up represented improvement, no change, or decline, compared with their baseline response.

### Poor association between tendon structure and self-reported symptoms following conservative management in active soldiers with mid-portion achilles tendinopathy [^113MsAs4]. BMJ Military Health (2024). High credibility.

Rehabilitation programme

A total of 9 out of 40 participants included in this study had not undergone previous treatment. The other 31 patients were referred for ESWT due to unsatisfactory results in primary care, where they received various interventions, that is, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ankle mobilisation, calf stretching exercises, massage and gait retraining. Tendon loading exercises had been a part of the previous treatment in 28 participants. Although these exercises currently represent the standard of care for mid-AT, a large number of patients does not seem to respond adequately, and up to half of all patients seeking alternative treatment.

Clinical applicability

As tendon structure appears poorly associated with pain and function in mid-AT, we recommend assessing both clinical entities separately. We strongly advise clinicians to use great caution in communicating (causal) relationships between tendon structure and pain and function in soldiers suffering from mid-AT, as our results cannot support this in any way. It is our belief that in physically highly active populations, like soldiers, assessment of Achilles tendon structure should be used to evaluate load, or to evaluate interventions targeting tendon structure, and also to prevent potential structural damage to Achilles tendons.

### Assessment and monitoring of achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice: a qualitative descriptive exploration of the barriers clinicians face [^116wTacJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Access to equipment is difficult to overcome but the use of reliable measures of physical function capacity which do not require equipment should be encouraged (eg, single leg heel raise) as these may provide valuable information and negate the need for equipment. However, patient symptoms can significantly improve in the absence of any changes in calf endurance, as measured by a single leg heel raise, so the clinicians must be clear on why they are assessing physical function capacity. Patient symptom severity will always be a barrier in irritable presentations. However, assessments providing a measure of physical function capacity without increasing pain should be considered. The reality that outcome measure domain focus shifts during the clinical journey assists with this issue, with the initial focus being on pain-related outcome measure domains, then progressing to more disability and functional outcome measure domains as the patients' clinical status improves.

### Supervised exercise training as an adjunct therapy for venous leg ulcers: a randomized controlled feasibility trial [^116Dxu1V]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Almost 70% of all leg ulcers have a venous component. 1 Occurrence of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) increases with age, with the U.K. prevalence in those > 65 years of age being estimated at about 3%. 2 VLUs arise from venous valve incompetence and calf muscle pump insufficiency, which leads to venous stasis and hypertension. This results in microcirculatory changes and localized tissue ischaemia. 3, 4 The natural history of VLUs is of a continuous cycle of healing and breakdown over decades: 5 VLUs are typically painful and heal slowly, resulting in an impaired quality of life (QoL), social isolation and reduced work productivity. 6 Treatment of this major health problem results in a considerable cost to the National Health Service (NHS): each ulcer costs up to £1981 per year; 7 estimated total healthcare costs are between £198 million and £400 million per year, 8, 9 with 65% of these costs occurring in the community. 10

Lower‐limb compression therapy is an established first‐line therapy for VLUs, 11 with approximately 50% of VLUs closing within 24 weeks. 10 Nevertheless, recurrence rates remain high (up to 56% within 4 years). 12 Furthermore, up to 30% of VLUs do not respond to compression alone, remain open after 1 year of treatment and need an average of 51 treatment visits to heal. 10, 11, 13 Therefore, it is important to develop adjunct therapies to compression, which would improve healing outcomes.

Lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise and smoking, are mentioned in guidelines on the management of VLUs but receive relatively little emphasis. 14 Exercise training might enhance ulcer healing and other aspects of health, and is routinely prescribed for other cardiovascular diseases (e.g. peripheral arterial disease and coronary artery disease). 15, 16 In patients with VLUs, supervised calf muscle exercise has been shown to increase calf muscle pump function and improve lower‐limb haemodynamics, 17, 18 as well as mobility and QoL. 19, 20, 21 A recent systematic review suggested further research to determine whether exercise training has an effect on ulcer healing and QoL. 22

### What is a recurrence? The onset, frequency and time loss impact of recurrent calf muscle strain injuries in elite male Australian football players over a decade [^1177zs7D]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent calf muscle strain injuries are challenging for clinicians, as they are relatively commonand often result in prolonged time loss. Knowledge of the epidemiology of recurrent calf muscle strain injuries in elite athletes is limited, considering the magnitude of the problem they represent, and significant variation exists in the literature in key areas, such as diagnosis, subsequent injury definitions and surveillance periods. Further evaluation of key recurrence outcomes (eg, the onset, frequency and time loss impact) is required to better understand the aetiology and management, as has been done for injuries affecting other regions, such as the hamstrings.

Subsequent injury categorisation in sport is a cornerstone of contemporary epidemiological researchand consensus recommendations are available to guide researchers and practitioners. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recommended that a recurrence be defined as a subsequent injury occurring after full recovery and affecting the same location and tissue as the index (ie, primary) injury. In instances where the subsequent injury occurs before full recovery (ie, during rehabilitation), it is defined as an exacerbation. Despite the IOC recommendations becoming available, inconsistency in research methods remains common.

### Understanding the pain experience and treatment considerations along the spectrum of peripheral artery disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115pDB9b]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2025). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic condition that affects a growing number of individuals worldwide, with estimates exceeding 220 million. One of the central hallmarks of PAD is lower extremity pain, which may present as intermittent claudication and atypical leg pain, and, in more severe cases, ischemic rest pain, neuropathic pain, or phantom limb pain in those who underwent amputation. Although the majority of individuals with PAD may experience pain that is chronic in nature, the pathogenesis and phenomenology of pain may differ. Nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic mechanisms all play a role in the generation of pain. Pain in PAD results in severe disability and can copresent with distress, sickness behaviors such as avoidance and further deconditioning, and concomitant depression, anxiety, and addiction secondary to opioid use. These factors potentially lead to chronic pain interacting with a multitude of domains of functioning, including physical, emotional, and behavioral. Whereas pain is a normal adaptive response, self-defeating behaviors and cognitions contribute to the persistence or worsening of the chronic pain experience, disability, and distress. Much remains unknown about the phenomenology of pain in PAD and its clinical subgroups and how it affects outcomes. Borrowing from other chronic pain syndromes, multimodal pain management strategies that emphasize a biopsychosocial model have generated a solid evidence base for the use of cognitive behavioral approaches to manage pain. Multimodal pain management in PAD is not the norm, but theoretical pathways and road maps for further research, assessment, and clinical implementation are presented in this scientific statement.

### The effect of lumbar sympathetic ganglion block on gynecologic cancer-related lymphedema [^114CcUmh]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Eighteen to 25% of patients after gynecological cancer treatment suffer from lower limb lymphedema (LLL) that decreases the quality of life of gynecological cancer survivors. Lumbar sympathetic ganglion block (LSGB) is widely used in practice for the evaluation and management of sympathetically mediated pain in the lower limbs. Several articles have suggested that sympathetic ganglion block could be an effective treatment for lymphedema.

Objectives

To investigate the effect of LSGB on patients with secondary lymphedema related to the treatment of gynecologic cancer, who do not respond to a conservative treatment.

Study Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

A single academic medical center, outpatient setting.

Methods

Eighteen patients with stage II lower limb lymphedema who did not response to the conservative treatment were recruited. The patients underwent fluoroscopy-guided LSGB 3 times at 2-week intervals. The circumference of the thigh and calf was measured in the upright position at the first visit and 2 weeks after each session of LSGB. The pain score of the lower limb was checked at the same time by a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10. The patients were asked about their satisfaction with the procedure at the last follow-up visit. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for data analysis. Significance was accepted at a P-value less than 0.05/3.

Results

The circumferences of affected thighs and calves decreased from 56.38 ± 4.77 and 35.33 ± 3.51 cm to 54.42 ± 5.27 and 34.41 ± 3.35 cm, respectively, in a significant manner after 3 consecutive LSGBs (P < 0.05/3). The maximal decrease after the third LSGB was 4 cm in the thigh and 2 cm in the calf. The pain score also showed a significant decrease after 3 consecutive LSGBs from 2.17 to 1.28. The tightness and heaviness of the affected limb decreased after the first LSGB in 15 patients (83.3%) and after the second LSGB in 2 patients (11.1%). Five of 18 patients (27.8%) answered that the result of the LSGB met their expectations, 10 (55.6%) answered they would undergo the same treatment for the same outcome, 2 (11.1%) answered they did not improve as much as they had hoped, and they would not undergo the same treatment for the same outcome, and only one patient (5.6%) answered the LSGB showed no effect.

Limitations

This study lacks a placebo control group and has only 18 patients. We did not evaluate the quality of life of the patients.

Conclusion

We suggest that LSGB can be one of the treatment options for patients suffering from LLL after gynecologic cancer treatment. Our result could provide a basis for a randomized controlled trial in future investigations. The pain physicians can play an important role as one of the multidisciplinary team for a comprehensive treatment of LLL.
