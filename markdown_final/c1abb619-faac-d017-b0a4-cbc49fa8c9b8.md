## Question

UTI symptoms with hematuria, but you have a negative UA￼

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage UTI symptoms with hematuria when the urinalysis is negative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the urinalysis was truly negative and properly collected. Then, I should verify the pretest probability of UTI from symptoms and risk factors. Next, I will consider alternative diagnoses that can mimic UTI, especially in women. After that, I need to decide when to obtain a urine culture despite a negative urinalysis. Finally, I should outline management pathways for likely UTI, likely noninfectious causes, and persistent hematuria, and close with follow-up and special-population considerations.

> Let me first confirm the urinalysis details, because a "negative UA" may not actually exclude disease. I need to check whether the specimen was a clean-catch midstream sample, whether it was processed promptly, and whether microscopy was performed to confirm hematuria and quantify pyuria, since dipsticks alone can miss microscopic hematuria and pyuria and are not sufficient to rule out clinically significant findings [^6b3a8ffd] [^ff676142] [^99c33e6a]. Wait, let me verify the microscopy thresholds: pyuria at or above about 5–10 WBC/hpf supports infection, whereas fewer WBCs lower the likelihood, and hematuria should be confirmed as at least 3 RBCs/hpf on microscopy to be meaningful [^55b5409c] [^be6c22a1].

> Next, I should review the pretest probability of UTI from symptoms, because in women with classic acute cystitis features, the likelihood exceeds 90% even before testing. Dysuria with frequency and urgency, especially without vaginal discharge or irritation, strongly supports UTI, and hematuria itself modestly increases the probability, whereas isolated urgency/frequency without dysuria lowers it [^abb92430] [^9e9ba0f2]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across ages; in older adults, symptoms are less specific, so I need to be more cautious and integrate local epidemiology and prior history before concluding UTI [^9e9ba0f2].

> I will now examine alternative diagnoses that can present with urinary symptoms and apparent hematuria but a negative urinalysis. Vaginitis, cervicitis, and sexually transmitted infections can cause dysuria and irritative voiding; vaginal discharge or irritation markedly decreases the likelihood of UTI, so I should screen for these when suspected [^abb92430] [^0ac166be]. But wait, what if the hematuria is spurious? Menstruation, contamination, or myoglobinuria can cause a positive blood dipstick without RBCs, so I need to repeat a clean-catch specimen with microscopy to confirm true hematuria before attributing it to UTI or other pathology [^6b3a8ffd] [^ff676142].

> Now, I should decide whether to obtain a urine culture despite a negative urinalysis. In women with high-probability symptoms, a negative dipstick does not reliably rule out UTI, and culture can detect lower-count bacteriuria that standard urinalysis misses; this is especially relevant in recurrent presentations or atypical features, and in patients with risk factors for complicated infection or resistant organisms [^abb92430] [^5124ac8e]. Hold on, I should verify stewardship guidance: reflex cultures based on urinalysis alone can drive overtreatment, so I should reserve culture for patients with compatible symptoms or when the diagnosis remains uncertain after clinical assessment [^c89f0cc7] [^33829b7b].

> If the clinical picture remains consistent with UTI and the urinalysis is negative, I should treat empirically while awaiting culture, but I need to ensure I am not overcalling asymptomatic bacteriuria. In uncomplicated, nonpregnant women with classic symptoms, empiric therapy is reasonable, whereas in patients with low pretest probability or alternative explanations, I should avoid antibiotics and pursue the alternative diagnosis instead [^5124ac8e] [^52dde126]. I should double-check that I am aligning with local resistance patterns and choosing agents like nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, or TMP-SMX when appropriate, and I should plan follow-up to ensure symptom resolution and to review culture results if obtained [^5124ac8e].

> If symptoms persist or recur and cultures remain negative, I need to reconsider the diagnosis and look for noninfectious causes or low-count infection syndromes. Overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, pelvic floor dysfunction, and endometriosis can mimic UTI; careful history, exam, and, when indicated, urologic or gynecologic evaluation are warranted, and I should avoid repeated antibiotic courses without microbiologic support [^f22e97cd] [^0ac166be]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "culture-negative UTI" might be common, but I should correct that: while low-count or fastidious organisms can occur, many such cases reflect noninfectious etiologies or sampling issues, so I must integrate symptoms, microscopy, and, when appropriate, targeted testing rather than defaulting to antibiotics [^5124ac8e] [^33829b7b].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook hematuria itself. If true microscopic hematuria is confirmed, I should follow a risk-based evaluation per AUA/SUFU guidance: assess malignancy risks, obtain serum creatinine, and stratify to low/negligible, intermediate, or high risk. Low-risk patients should have repeat urinalysis in 6 months rather than immediate cystoscopy or imaging, whereas intermediate- and high-risk patients should proceed to cystoscopy and upper tract imaging, with cytology reserved for select high-risk scenarios [^83275ef5] [^45f94ea2] [^839726ca]. Hold on, I should verify exceptions: if hematuria is attributed to a treated UTI, I should repeat urinalysis after therapy to confirm resolution; persistent hematuria warrants the standard risk-based workup [^f40ab8ed].

> For follow-up, I should confirm symptom resolution within 3–7 days and avoid routine test-of-cure in asymptomatic patients, but if symptoms persist beyond 7 days or recur rapidly, I should repeat urinalysis and culture and reassess for alternative diagnoses or structural contributors, reserving imaging or cystoscopy for high-risk hematuria or complicated presentations [^14751a20] [^573af149]. I should double-check that I am not anchoring on a single negative urinalysis; intermittent hematuria and variable pyuria are common, so persistence or evolution of findings should guide escalation rather than a single data point [^be6c22a1].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In older adults, I should have a lower threshold to culture because symptoms are atypical and asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, yet I must avoid treating bacteriuria without compatible localizing symptoms to prevent harm from overtreatment [^5124ac8e] [^c89f0cc7]. In pregnancy, I should treat even asymptomatic bacteriuria and consider imaging if hematuria persists due to unique risks. In patients with indwelling catheters, I should not screen for ASB and should only treat when there are clear signs of CA-UTI, ideally with a specimen from a freshly placed catheter rather than a bag sample [^5124ac8e] [^c7518a27] [^da0c1ec3].

> Putting this together, my algorithm is as follows: confirm the urinalysis method and repeat with microscopy if needed. Assess symptom pretest probability. If high, obtain a urine culture and treat empirically while awaiting results. If low, evaluate for alternative diagnoses and avoid antibiotics. If hematuria is confirmed, risk-stratify and pursue guideline-concordant follow-up. And if symptoms persist or recur, broaden the differential, repeat testing, and escalate evaluation as indicated, always aligning with stewardship principles to minimize unnecessary antibiotics and procedures [^83275ef5] [^5124ac8e] [^c89f0cc7].

UTI symptoms with hematuria but a negative urinalysis can occur due to **early or low-count infection** [^5124ac8e], **contamination or improper collection** [^6b3a8ffd], or **noninfectious causes** such as stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease [^966b6000] [^46be03bc]. A negative urinalysis **does not exclude UTI**, especially if symptoms are classic or risk factors are present [^5124ac8e] [^abb92430]. If suspicion remains, **obtain a urine culture** [^68b5e22b] and consider imaging or cystoscopy if hematuria persists or risk factors for malignancy exist [^83275ef5] [^03cefe05].

## Limitations of urinalysis in detecting UTI with hematuria

Urinalysis is a rapid screening tool, but it has **important limitations**:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: Urinalysis can miss low-count or early infections, particularly if bacterial concentrations are below standard thresholds [^5124ac8e] [^4a280c02].

- **Contamination**: Improper collection can lead to false negatives, especially in women [^6b3a8ffd].

- **Intermittent hematuria**: Hematuria may be transient or intermittent, leading to negative results on a single test [^be6c22a1].

- **Noninfectious hematuria**: Stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease can cause hematuria without pyuria or bacteriuria [^966b6000] [^46be03bc].

---

## Clinical scenarios where UTI symptoms and hematuria occur despite negative urinalysis

Several scenarios can explain **UTI symptoms with hematuria and a negative urinalysis**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Early or low-count infection | Bacterial concentration below detection thresholds [^5124ac8e] [^4a280c02] |
| Contamination or improper collection | False-negative results due to poor sampling technique [^6b3a8ffd] |
| Intermittent hematuria | Transient bleeding not captured on a single test [^be6c22a1] |
| Noninfectious hematuria | Stones, malignancy, or glomerular disease causing hematuria without infection [^966b6000] [^46be03bc] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

When UTI symptoms and hematuria coexist with a negative urinalysis, the following **diagnostic approach is recommended**:

- **Confirm hematuria**: Repeat urinalysis with microscopy to confirm true hematuria and exclude contamination [^6b3a8ffd] [^99c33e6a].

- **Urine culture**: Obtain a urine culture to detect low-count or atypical pathogens [^68b5e22b] [^5124ac8e].

- **Imaging**: Consider renal ultrasound or CT urography if hematuria persists or if risk factors for stones or malignancy are present [^03cefe05] [^83275ef5].

- **Cystoscopy**: Indicated for persistent hematuria, especially in patients over 35 or with risk factors for bladder cancer [^83275ef5] [^661b187a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **risk-stratified approach** to hematuria and UTI evaluation:

- **AUA/SUFU guidelines**: Recommend repeat urinalysis, risk-based evaluation, and selective use of cystoscopy and imaging based on patient risk factors [^83275ef5] [^45f94ea2].

- **IDSA guidelines**: Emphasize clinical judgment and discourage overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria [^c89f0cc7] [^ebb22780].

- **ACP guidelines**: Advocate for targeted testing and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Management should be **individualized** based on clinical suspicion, risk factors, and diagnostic findings:

- **Empiric treatment**: Consider empiric antibiotics if clinical suspicion for UTI is high, even with negative urinalysis, while awaiting culture results [^5124ac8e].

- **Follow-up**: Ensure close follow-up to monitor symptom resolution and address persistent hematuria or recurrent symptoms [^f40ab8ed].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on proper urine collection techniques and the importance of follow-up testing [^da0c1ec3].

---

UTI symptoms with hematuria and a negative urinalysis can occur due to early or low-count infection, contamination, or noninfectious causes. A negative urinalysis **does not exclude UTI**, and further evaluation with culture, imaging, or cystoscopy may be necessary based on clinical suspicion and risk factors [^5124ac8e] [^83275ef5].

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^49da5f0c]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^af3a1e66]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^966b6000]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

Introduction

There is growing awareness that urinary tract infection (UTI), undetected by routine diagnostics, might play a causal role in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This proposal is controversial because the exclusion of UTI is a key step in every guideline concerned with the management of LUTS. As a result, LUTS have become synonymous with noninfective disease. However, there is increasing evidence that patients presenting with LUTS may harbour a UTI despite negative tests. The problem lies with the diagnostic criteria used in culture-based diagnosis. A significant body of published literature points to the inherent flaws of quantitative urinary microbiological analysis, in which thresholds between 10 3 cfu mL −1 and 10 6 cfu mL −1 of a pure growth of a single urinary pathogen are employed to diagnose UTI. Dipstick urinalysis performs equally poorly, hampered by insensitivity and spectrum bias. These tests cannot reliably exclude UTI and do not take into account differences in bacterial strain virulence, host genetic variability, intracellular bacterial reservoirs, or even urine dilution due to high fluid intake before the test.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^03cefe05]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Hematuria [^d5f3a63e]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^6b3a8ffd]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### The optimal use of diagnostic testing in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis [^69f26821]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a common and costly disorder in women, and there is considerable variation in the diagnostic strategies currently used in clinical practice. Because the diagnosis of cystitis can be established in most patients using the history alone, the clinician's responsibility is to determine which patients require additional diagnostic testing. Patients with typical symptoms (i.e., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria), without risk factors for complicated infection or pyelonephritis, and without a history of vaginal discharge, have a very high probability of cystitis and are appropriate candidates for empiric treatment. It is more difficult, however, to rule out infection in patients with suspected cystitis. Because the prevalence of culture-proven infection is very high in women who present with ≥ 1 symptom, and because the treatment threshold for this condition is low, a urine culture is generally required to rule out infection in patients with atypical symptoms, even in the presence of a negative dipstick test. In population-based, before-and-after studies, use of diagnostic algorithms has been shown to significantly decrease the use of urinalysis, urine culture, and office visits while increasing the percentage of patients who receive recommended antibiotics. These strategies have substantially reduced the cost of managing cystitis without an increase in adverse events or a decrease in patient satisfaction. Randomized controlled trials are needed to more closely examine the outcomes, costs of care, and patient satisfaction from different diagnostic and management strategies.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^51f25589]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) asymptomatic microscopic hematuria — evaluation scope and evidence indicate the guideline "lowered the age threshold for evaluation from older than 40 years to 35 years," and "the recommended evaluation for all patients meeting the criteria for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (after other causes have been ruled out) includes cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with multiphasic computed tomography (CT) urography, with and without intravenous contrast." The document emphasizes that "'blood' on a dipstick urinalysis is not hematuria, and this finding indicates the need for a microscopic urinalysis to evaluate for red blood cells." Regarding screening, "the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2011 concluded the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults (4)." The evidence strength behind the AUA recommendations "is Grade C," is "primarily… based on data from male patients," and "the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men."

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^4e3d1b21]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^f22e97cd]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — urinalysis and culture in idiopathic overactive bladder states that dipstick or microscopic urinalysis should be performed in all patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to evaluate for other causes of LUTS, and urine culture should be performed when urinalysis is suggestive of infection and/or hematuria. Any identified UTI should be treated, and the patient should be instructed to follow up for assessment if symptoms do not resolve. If microscopic hematuria (> 3 RBC/HPF) is identified in the absence of infection, further evaluation should be performed in accordance with the Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline, and the presence of glucosuria or proteinuria may be the sequelae of diabetes.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^36552811]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^45f94ea2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to repeat urinalysis, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to re-classify low/negligible-risk patients as intermediate- or high-risk based on hematuria on repeat urinalysis, and obtain risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata.

### Diagnostic work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms [^150b8083]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The goal of work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms is to establish the severity and cause of lower urinary tract symptoms and to predict with certainty which patients will respond to which treatments. Clinical guidelines exist to guide urologists in decision-making. All patients need a medical history with a validated symptom score, a physical examination, and a urinalysis. Prostate-specific antigen, postvoid urine residual, and peak urine flow rate provide additional information at little cost. For more invasive testing high-level data are lacking and guidelines defer to the urologist. Even the most extensive work-up is imperfect, and thus the attempt to balance costs with benefits of invasive testing.

Microhematuria initial evaluation — in patients with microhematuria, clinicians should perform a history, physical examination including blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy, medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microhematuria; clinicians should perform the same evaluation of patients with microhematuria who are taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (regardless of the type or level of therapy) as patients not on these agents; in patients with findings suggestive of a gynecologic or non-malignant urologic etiology, clinicians should evaluate the patients with appropriate physical examination techniques and tests to identify such an etiology; in patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause, and if microhematuria persists or the etiology cannot be identified, clinicians should perform risk-based urologic evaluation; in patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria; and clinicians should refer patients with microhematuria for nephrological evaluation if medical renal disease is suspected. However, risk-based urologic evaluation should still be performed.

AUA/SUFU guideline — cystoscopy in OAB explains that cystoscopy is not helpful to make the diagnosis of OAB, but specific scenarios may warrant it. Those with hematuria on urinalysis at the time of initial or subsequent OAB evaluation should undergo evaluation as recommended by the Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline which often calls for cystoscopy and upper urinary tract imaging. Patients with OAB symptoms and a history of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) may benefit from cystoscopy as recommended by the Recurrent Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections in Women: AUA/CUA/SUFU Guideline, and cystoscopy may be helpful in women with symptoms of OAB and a history of a prior sling for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), where potential issues include mesh erosion or BOO and potential indications include recurrent UTI, hematuria, and post-sling voiding symptoms.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^258b589d]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^c3e164c6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Taken together, these findings are of real concern, and whilst guidance on the diagnosis and management of UTI is increasingly prescriptive, one size does not necessarily fit all. We hypothesise that chronic LUTS may result from urinary infection falling below the routine culture threshold and that antibiotic treatment could confer benefit. Indeed, Stamm et al. published an RCT reporting success from a 10-day regimen of doxycycline for culture-negative patients with acute frequency and dysuria who had microscopic pyuria (using ≥ 8 wbc μL −1 as their threshold). Further studies are needed to support these findings.

In 2004, we started to use antibiotics to treat patients with chronic LUTS who demonstrated microscopic pyuria, despite negative dipstick testing and negative MSU cultures employing a 10 5 cfu mL −1 threshold. Using sensitive microbiological methods, we have since generated data demonstrating widespread bacterial infection in these patients. Other groups have also reported similar findings. Our clinical approach sought to manage patients towards symptom resolution and clearance of pyuria by combining antibiotic treatment with careful outpatient monitoring. This paper describes the evolution of our clinical practice as a result of these observations.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^be6c22a1]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^db61e36c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — evaluation and diagnostic accuracy in suspected recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI): A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that the combination of sudden-onset dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge confers a 90% probability of UTI, defined in this report as > 10^4 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen. In the same study, approximately 50% of women with one or more UTI symptoms (e.g., dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, or back pain), who lacked that very specific combination of symptoms did not have cystitis, suggesting misdiagnosis of acute UTI is common. In-person assessment significantly improves UTI diagnostic accuracy; culture positivity rates for those tested following virtual assessment (29%) are less than half that for patients seen in person (64%). Given the number of conditions that share significant symptomatology with UTI and the common misdiagnosis of acute cystitis, patients with rUTI warrant evaluation with an examination at least at their initial presentation to rule out alternative explanations for the patient's relapsing symptoms and to identify any structural or functional abnormalities that may be contributing to infection recurrence, and additional examinations with subsequent infections are not required, particularly when presenting symptoms are consistent with prior episodes, but may be useful in situations where the patient's symptoms are atypical or fail to resolve with appropriate treatment.

### Performance of urinalysis parameters in predicting urinary tract infection: does one size fit all? [^5cf23efe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In a multihospital cohort study of 3392 patients, positive urinalysis parameters had poor positive predictive value for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI). Combined urinalysis parameters (pyuria or nitrite) performed better than pyuria alone for ruling out UTI. However, performance of all urinalysis parameters was poor in older women.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^ea054c22]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — management after repeat urinalysis in initially low/negligible-risk patients: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis; in such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Low/negligible-risk patients should undergo a repeat UA to evaluate for the resolution versus persistence of MH, and if the repeat UA shows no evidence of MH, then no further evaluation of the bladder or upper tract is needed at this time. A study of over 11,000 patients found that persistent MH on repeat urine testing had a significantly higher rate of malignancy on subsequent evaluation (0.35% versus 0.07%), and patients with persistent MH are classified as either intermediate- or high-risk for malignancy depending upon the degree of MH at the repeat UA and other risk factors.

### Diagnosis of urinary incontinence [^41672fc5]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary incontinence is common, increases in prevalence with age, and affects quality of life for men and women. The initial evaluation occurs in the family physician's office and generally does not require urologic or gynecologic evaluation. The basic workup is aimed at identifying possible reversible causes. If no reversible cause is identified, then the incontinence is considered chronic. The next step is to determine the type of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow, mixed, or functional) and the urgency with which it should be treated. These determinations are made using a patient questionnaire, such as the 3 Incontinence Questions, an assessment of other medical problems that may contribute to incontinence, a discussion of the effect of symptoms on the patient's quality of life, a review of the patient's completed voiding diary, a physical examination, and, if stress incontinence is suspected, a cough stress test. Other components of the evaluation include laboratory tests and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume. If the type of urinary incontinence is still not clear, or if red flags such as hematuria, obstructive symptoms, or recurrent urinary tract infections are present, referral to a urologist or urogynecologist should be considered.

In this first episode of the Microbiologist in the Clinic series, clinicians and laboratory scientists share their perspectives about a 30 y/o woman, who is seeking specialty consultation for frequent episodes of urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria, which respond to short courses of antibiotics. Although her home dipsticks suggest that she has a UTI, and her urinalysis typically has a moderate number of white blood cells, her urine cultures are always negative. The challenges of this clinical presentation are discussed with evidence for evaluation and treatment.

### Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and recurrent cystitis but negative urinalysis: what should we do? [^4a280c02]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Pyuria, detected by microscopy of a fresh midstream urine (MSU) specimen, is the most sensitive surrogate marker of UTI. It circumvents the problems associated with quantitative bacterial culture, and its value in the diagnosis of UTI is recognised by international practice guidelines. Whilst ≥ 10 wbc μl −1 is employed almost universally to diagnose UTI, contemporary data cast doubt on this threshold in patients with LUTS. In the symptomatic patient, controlled studies have demonstrated that lower pyuria counts of 1–9 wbc μl −1 are associated with an increase in independent inflammatory and microbiological markers of UTI. Thus, lower levels of pyuria may also indicate infection and immune activation.

The diagnostic picture has become even more complex with the recent discovery that UTI can legitimately involve polymicrobial infection; mixed growth cultures do not necessarily reflect contamination. What's more, advances in enhanced culture and genomics technology have revealed that even the normal bladder is not sterile and that a bona fide, possibly protective, urinary microbiota can be described. Uncertain diagnosis is not the only area that complicates UTI management. The treatment of acute cystitis also has its limitations. A Cochrane review reported symptomatic and microbiological failure rates of 37 and 28% 4–10 weeks after treatment. Amongst healthy young women with their first UTI, the risk of recurrence within 6 months is 24%. If they have a history of one or more UTIs, the risk of recurrence rises to 70% in that same year. In a Canadian surveillance study, 14% of 30,851 residents with UTI experienced more than one episode during the 2-year study period, and 2% had six or more episodes.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1ad70d05]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should not perform a post-treatment test of cure urinalysis or urine culture in asymptomatic patients (Expert Opinion). The Panel does not endorse microbiological reassessment after successful UTI treatment as this may lead to overtreatment, and it should again be emphasized that symptom clearance is sufficient. The Panel recognizes certain scenarios that may prompt screening such as planned surgical intervention in which mucosal bleeding is anticipated. In patients with rapid recurrence (particularly with the same organism), clinicians may consider evaluation on and off therapy, and repeated infection with bacteria associated with struvite stone formation (e.g. P. mirabilis) may prompt consideration of imaging to rule out calculus.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^55b5409c]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — definition and diagnostic criteria emphasize that this Guideline supports the most commonly used definition of two episodes of acute bacterial cystitis within a six-month period sometime within the preceding year, and any patient experiencing episodes of symptomatic acute cystitis after previous resolution of similar symptoms meets the criteria for rUTI. Strong evidence suggests that the diagnosis of acute bacterial cystitis should include the combination of acute-onset symptoms referable to the urinary tract, urinary inflammation on microscopic urinalysis (pyuria), and laboratory confirmation of significant bacteriuria, with Table 1 detailing components such as acute-onset symptoms including dysuria with increased urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence; urinary tract inflammation defined as pyuria ≥ 5 WBC/high power field (hpf) on microscopic urinalysis; and detection of a bacterial uropathogen. Without symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered asymptomatic bacteriuria, and patients who recur rapidly within two weeks of initial treatment or who display bacterial persistence without symptom resolution may require imaging, cystoscopy, or other further investigation for bacterial reservoirs.

### Does this woman have an acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection? [^abb92430]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Symptoms suggestive of acute urinary tract infection (UTI) constitute one of the most common reasons for women to visit clinicians. Although the clinical encounter typically involves taking a history and performing a physical examination, the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment for UTI remains uncertain.

Objective

To review the accuracy and precision of history taking and physical examination for the diagnosis of UTI in women.

Data Sources

We conducted a MEDLINE search for articles published from 1966 through September 2001 and manually reviewed bibliographies, 3 commonly used clinical skills textbooks, and contacted experts in the field.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained original data on the accuracy or precision of history or physical examination for diagnosing acute uncomplicated UTI in women. One author initially screened titles and abstracts found by our search. Nine of 464 identified studies met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly increased the probability of UTI: dysuria (summary positive likelihood ratio [LR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–2.0), frequency (LR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1–3.0), hematuria (LR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3–2.9), back pain (LR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2–2.1), and costovertebral angle tenderness (LR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). Four symptoms and 1 sign significantly decreased the probability of UTI: absence of dysuria (summary negative LR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7), absence of back pain (LR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7–0.9), history of vaginal discharge (LR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), history of vaginal irritation (LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1–0.9), and vaginal discharge on examination (LR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5–0.9). Of all individual diagnostic signs and symptoms, the 2 most powerful were history of vaginal discharge and history of vaginal irritation, which significantly decreased the likelihood of UTI when present (LRs, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively). One study examined combinations of symptoms, and the resulting LRs were more powerful (24.6 for the combination of dysuria and frequency but no vaginal discharge or irritation). One study of patients with recurrent UTI found that self-diagnosis significantly increased the probability of UTI (LR, 4.0).

Conclusions

In women who present with 1 or more symptoms of UTI, the probability of infection is approximately 50%. Specific combinations of symptoms (eg, dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation) raise the probability of UTI to more than 90%, effectively ruling in the diagnosis based on history alone. In contrast, history taking, physical examination, and dipstick urinalysis are not able to reliably lower the posttest probability of disease to a level where a UTI can be ruled out when a patient presents with 1 or more symptoms.

European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1 Section 1: Assessment of Urinary Symptoms

Table 1 and Appendix S5 present the evidence supporting the recommendations for assessing urinary symptoms. Figure 2 illustrates the assessment and treatment algorithm for urinary symptoms based on these recommendations.

Clinical Question 1. Should neurologists obtain a history of a patient's urinary symptoms versus not asking about urinary symptoms?

History taking forms the cornerstone of the assessment of urinary symptoms, and this is summarised as a checklist in Table 5.

Recommendation: Neurologists should actively ask about urinary symptoms in individuals with neurological diseases on a regular basis. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 100%).

Clinical Question 2. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a focused physical examination versus not undergoing a physical examination?

Individuals reporting urinary symptoms should undergo a targeted physical examination at initial evaluation, which is repeated annually in moderate or high‐risk individuals. The examination helps to plan investigations and treatments and screen for complications.

Recommendation: Neurologists should perform a targeted physical examination in individuals with neurological diseases and urinary symptoms. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 94%).

Clinical Question 3. Should individuals with neurological disease reporting urinary symptoms undergo a urinalysis versus not undergoing a urinalysis?

Screening urinalysis, which includes physical, chemical (dipstick testing) and/or microscopic evaluation of urine, should be a part of the initial evaluation when an individual reports urinary symptoms. The urine should be tested at follow‐up in case of significant changes in urinary symptoms. Urinalysis is more useful to exclude UTIs, and when a UTI is suspected, the urine should be sent for culture. Urinalysis should not be routinely performed to screen for UTIs in individuals who are using a catheter, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and leukocyturia. Urine dipstick testing can also screen for glucosuria, proteinuria, and microscopic haematuria, prompting further investigations if persistent and unexplained.

Microhematuria — interventions, comparators, and outcomes note that interventions include urinary cytology and urine-based tumor markers (UBTMs), patient engagement tools and decision aids, and follow-up schedules in patients with initial negative hematuria evaluation. Comparators are defined as any of the included interventions of interest when used as the control and compared to another intervention, and it was anticipated that most identified studies would be single arm. Critical outcomes include hematuria detection concordance (urinalysis [UA] versus dipstick), diagnostic yield incorporating prevalence of malignant and/or benign diagnoses, diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and false positive rate), risk stratification for urologic malignancy with system performance characteristics (predictive ability, prognostic ability, number needed to screen), and rate of adverse events and number needed to harm; important outcomes include disease specific survival rates, diagnostic grade/stage of malignancy, prevalence of risk factors in hematuria patients, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.

### Confirmatory microscopic urinalysis after positive dipstick microhematuria: adherence patterns and quality improvement [^cf545e18]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate adherence to the 2025 AUA/SUFU microhematuria (MH) guideline, which requires confirmatory microscopic urinalysis (MUA ≥ 3 RBC/HPF) after a positive dipstick.

Materials and Methods

TriNetX Research Network data (109 U.S. health systems) were queried for adults aged 18–90 years with an initial positive dipstick from July 2020 to February 2025. Patients with gross hematuria, urinary tract infections, and kidney and/or ureteral calculi, cystitis, proteinuria, dysuria, and pregnancy diagnoses were excluded. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: no MUA, negative MUA, and positive MUA. We recorded the use of CT urography, MRI urography, renal ultrasound, or cystoscopy within 6 months of positive dipstick.

Results

Among 37,300 eligible patients, 25,904 (69%) received MUA and 11,396 (31%) did not. MUA was positive in 9,913 cases (38%) and negative in 15,991 (62%). Downstream testing followed 7.5% of dipstick-only cases, 16.1% of negative-MUA cases, and 16.3% of positive-MUA cases. In total, 855 procedures were performed without any MUA and 2,575 after a negative MUA, resulting in potentially avoidable charges. Conversely, 84% of patients with confirmed MH underwent no further evaluation.

Conclusion

31% of positive urine dipstick results were not followed by a confirmatory MUA, and 84% of patients with a positive MUA underwent no additional evaluation. These shortfalls point to gaps in the implementation of guideline-based care for MH. Future work should test targeted decision-support tools and simplified referral pathways to improve adherence and patient outcomes.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^6ec0084a]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^68b5e22b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women: Clinicians should obtain urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity with each symptomatic acute cystitis episode prior to initiating treatment in patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Although no randomized, prospective studies were identified that were specifically designed to document direct effects of procuring urinalysis and urine culture with antibiotic sensitivities prior to initiating treatment, the bulk of observational data supports the comprehensive laboratory diagnostic evaluation of each episode (e.g., urinalysis and standard urine culture), and every effort should be made to obtain urinalysis, microbiological identification, and antimicrobial resistance patterns to confirm the diagnosis and follow clinical responses to management; the routine prescription of antibiotics based on patient symptoms without microbiological evaluation should be discouraged, and independent evaluation of each symptomatic episode not only allows for the modification of treatment plans as needed to address atypical or antimicrobial-resistant bacteria but will also help to identify those patients with one of the numerous alternative diagnoses who would benefit from a different approach to treatment.

Assess healthcare professional competency in catheter use, catheter care, and maintenance. – (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Train clinicians to consider other methods for bladder management (eg, intermittent catheterization, or external male or female collection devices) when appropriate before placing an indwelling urethral catheter. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — cystoscopy and upper tract imaging should not be routinely obtained in the index patient presenting with rUTI (Expert Opinion), supported by low diagnostic yield data: in a single-institutional cohort of 163 women, cystoscopy identified only 9 clinically significant cases and only five were uniquely identified, and intravenous urography (IVU) was normal in 91.7% with only 5.5% positive IVUs among 164 female patients without management change; cystoscopy is not necessary for gross hematuria with a positive urine culture and no risk factors for urothelial malignancy, but if any risk factors are present cystoscopy should be performed, and further evaluation for bladder cancer should be performed with gross hematuria without documented infection; higher yield may occur in "high-risk" presentations (gross or persistent microscopic hematuria, pyelonephritis, atypical presentation), and for any patient with suspicion for pyelonephritis, or history of hematuria or renal calculi, upper tract imaging is recommended.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^c9ff59fa]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation — In situations where ongoing follow up after a negative hematuria evaluation is desired following shared decision-making, the Panel recommends obtaining a repeat urinalysis (UA) with microscopy, and patients who have a negative repeat UA after a negative microhematuria (MH) evaluation do not need further MH follow up. Even among patients with persistent or recurrent MH, the incidence of malignancy is low, and these cancers are diagnosed years after the initial evaluation; in a retrospective cohort with complete MH evaluation, repeat cystoscopy in 161 of the 637 patients revealed two new bladder cancers (1.2%), while repeat imaging detected a new suspicious renal mass in 4 of 317 patients (1.3%), and both cancers were detected more than 36 months following the initial evaluation; in another retrospective evaluation of 250 patients with a negative MH evaluation, 87 low-risk patients (32.2%) had persistent MH and underwent repeat cystoscopy and imaging three years following initial evaluation, with the only malignancy identified being a single case of prostate cancer. Based on these data, the Panel recommends shared decision-making regarding the utility of a repeat UA among patients with a negative MH and the optimal timing of obtaining it, if desired, and if a complete MH evaluation reveals a benign etiology not requiring intervention and a subsequent UA shows a persistent, stable degree of MH, the Panel recommends shared decision-making regarding whether to proceed with further repeat evaluation.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

Urinalysis performance and interpretation in recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) — A negative urinalysis (i.e., negative nitrites and < 5 WBC/hpf) is useful in ruling out acute cystitis and is associated with a very low risk of progression to bacteremia; in a study of more than 12,000 urinalyses, a negative urinalysis showed high predictive accuracy for absence of clinically relevant UTI with specificity 92.2% and positive predictive value (PPV) 97.4%, and stewardship programs that reflex culture only after a positive urinalysis are estimated to reduce inappropriate antibiotics by five-fold; by contrast, positive leukocyte esterase (≥ 1+), pyuria (≥ 10 WBC/hpf), nitrite (≥ 1+), and bacteriuria (≥ 50 cells/field) all have PPVs for UTI lower than 50%, and discordance such as urine culture with > 100,000 CFU/mL E. coli but absent urine nitrites may reflect sampling or handling issues, where identifying epithelial cells or mucus can suggest contamination and obtaining a catheterized specimen may be reasonable; overall, urinalysis is specifically helpful due to its high negative predictive value, but positive findings should not be interpreted as evidence of a clinically significant UTI.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^0ac166be]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

Urinary tract infection is common, and it is not surprising that urine specimens make up a large proportion of those samples submitted to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Many of these specimens will show no evidence of infection and several methods can be used to screen out negative samples. Those that grow bacteria need to be carefully assessed to quantify the degree of bacteriuria and hence clinical relevance. To influence treatment, a final report should be produced within 24 hours of specimen receipt, with turnaround times continuously monitored. Much work needs to be done to determine the cost effectiveness involved in processing urine specimens and the evidence base for the final report provided.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^5124ac8e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10 2 colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

### Diagnosis of urologic malignancies in patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria: prospective study with 13 years' follow-up [^21681277]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To appraise the outcomes, determine the natural history, and instigate a rationale plan for follow-up of patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria.

Methods

A total of 292 consecutive patients with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria referred between January 1992 and December 1994 were investigated and prospectively followed up. The initial investigations included urinalysis, urine culture and sensitivity, cytology, intravenous urography, with or without ultrasonography, and cystoscopy. Baseline data and follow-up events, particularly the development of urologic malignancy, were recorded for a 13-year period.

Results

Sixteen patients (5.4%) were found to have urologic malignancies on initial evaluation. Of these, 11 died. During a follow-up of 13 years, 21 patients (7%) were lost to follow-up and 42 died of various unrelated causes (other than urologic malignancies). Of the remaining 213 patients, 180 (84.5%) subsequently had negative urinalysis. None with negative urinalysis developed a urologic malignancy during follow-up. The presence of dipstick hematuria persisted in 33 patients. Of these 33 patients, 10 had nephrologic causes, 8 had urinary tract infection, and 15 underwent repeat investigation with no pathologic cause identified. One patient, discharged with negative findings after full initial investigations, presented 2 years later with frank hematuria and was found to have a new bladder tumor.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with asymptomatic dipstick hematuria who have undergone thorough initial negative investigations can be discharged from tertiary urologic care services. Nephrologic referral is recommended if dipstick hematuria and proteinuria persist. The repetition of the urologic investigations is unwarranted, unless patients present with symptoms or develop frank hematuria.

### Cross-over data supporting long-term antibiotic treatment in patients with painful lower urinary tract symptoms, pyuria and negative urinalysis [^e7f0467d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recalcitrant chronic bladder pain and symptoms of recurrent cystitis in patients with negative urinalysis present a worrying management problem. The treatment of painful lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is a significant challenge, and there are few quality data to guide clinicians. The evidence for oral or intravesical therapies for painful bladder symptoms is poor. Cystodistension and urethral dilation are also deployed without evidence to support their utility. Patients with recurrent, acute symptoms of cystitis and negative urinalysis are often exposed to multiple, short courses of antibiotics in primary care without evidence of benefit.

While there are published guidelines for managing acute and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), there are none for patients who may be suffering a chronic form of the disease. Recently, we published data describing our experience treating women with chronic painful LUTS for a mean duration of 6 years prior to presentation to our clinic. These patients had been exposed to conventional therapies without a resolution of symptoms. Data were gathered from 624 patients over 10 years. Given microscopic pyuria and symptoms, we presumed an infectious cause even in the face of negative dipstick urinalysis and urine cultures, as these tests lack sensitivity and fail to detect infective organisms in bona fide disease. This previous report described the evolution of a simple management regimen using first-generation, narrow-spectrum, urinary antibiotics combined with methenamine hippurate, guided by symptom palliation and the resolution of pyuria. The study demonstrated that treatment was associated with symptomatic improvement and the resolution of biomarkers of infection. There were few treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and no significant increase in antibiotic-resistant isolates. These data are being employed to develop a randomised trial (RCT).

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^818fd57c]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

Microhematuria — diagnostic evaluation context: Most experts agree that patients with gross hematuria (GH) should be evaluated with cystoscopy, upper tract imaging and urinary cytology, but variability exists across guidelines regarding microhematuria. The 2012 AUA Guideline recommended computed tomography (CT) urography and cystoscopy in all patients over 35 years of age with microhematuria and was crafted without regard to an individual patients' risk of malignancy, and its principal goal was to minimize the likelihood of missing a malignancy diagnosis.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) urinary tract infection practice points — Recurrent UTIs in people with ADPKD should be investigated for a possible underlying predisposition. A urine culture should be obtained before antibiotics are started for UTI, especially for upper UTI and/or suspected kidney cyst infection. Blood cultures should be obtained if an upper UTI or kidney cyst infection is suspected. UTIs in people with ADPKD need to be differentiated from noninfectious processes such as cyst hemorrhage or kidney stone. People with ADPKD who present with fever, acute abdominal or flank pain, and increased white blood cells and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) should be worked up for kidney cyst infection (Figure 16).

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^294e0532]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Evaluation of women with a positive urine cytology and no demonstrable disease in the urinary tract [^cabf2975]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Urinary cytology is indispensable both for the evaluation of gross hematuria and surveillance of patients with urothelial neoplasms. A positive urine cytology usually indicates the presence of urothelial carcinoma somewhere in the urinary tract. However, in women, it may also signal urothelial carcinoma involvement of the lower gynecologic tract or be the presenting sign for a primary cancer of the lower gynecologic tract or rectum. Guidelines for the evaluation of women with a positive cytology and normal urinary tract are lacking. We present a review of the current literature with case scenarios to bring clinicians attention to this diagnostic dilemma.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^efcdcd78]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Use of midstream urine analysis

There was no evidence that either using midstream urine analysis as an initial strategy to guide antibiotic prescribing or the use of midstream urine samples by doctors as part of their overall clinical management made any difference to ordering analysis during follow-up or other outcomes. As with antibiotic prescribing, as perceptions change among patients and doctors regarding the need for midstream urine analysis in clinical management of uncomplicated infections, use of laboratory resources for such an unnecessary investigation could be significantly reduced.

Conclusion

All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples, and patients who delay waiting for results of such analysis by more than 48 hours might have poor symptom control. Antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription help reduce antibiotic use.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^33829b7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis with reflex-to-culture algorithms — pyuria thresholds and exceptions indicate there is no single laboratory parameter or combination of parameters that can sufficiently predict whether the patient has a urinary tract infection or if bacteria will be recovered in culture, and that pyuria alone is likely the best marker in terms of negative predictive value, with leukocyte esterase or white blood cells (WBCs) increasing the likelihood of a positive culture, although detection methods have not been standardized. Although > 10 WBCs per low power field is a commonly adopted threshold for a urinalysis with reflex to culture (UARC) algorithm, this threshold cannot be effectively applied to all patient groups, and exceptions are recommended for patients who are pregnant and for patients with urologic abnormalities or undergoing urologic procedures. Laboratory algorithms should take into account local patient populations and should be guided by both clinicians and laboratorians, and in older adults with mental status changes or other signs classically localizing UTI symptoms, bacteriuria may be unrelated and a thoughtful approach should be taken before interpretations are made.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^9e9ba0f2]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline — urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms note that acute-onset symptoms attributable to the urinary tract typically include dysuria in conjunction with variable degrees of increased urinary urgency and frequency, hematuria, and new or worsening incontinence. Dysuria (urethral burning during voiding) is central in the diagnosis of UTI, and acute-onset dysuria is a specific symptom, with more than 90% accuracy for UTI in young women in the absence of concomitant vaginal irritation or increased vaginal discharge. Dysuria can have other causes (e.g., atrophic vaginitis, pelvic floor myofascial pain, vulvar lichen sclerosus), and the specificity of this symptom outside of this narrow population has not been defined. In older adults, the symptoms of UTI may be less clear, and careful evaluation of their chronicity becomes an important consideration when the diagnosis of UTI is in doubt.

An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. UTI Symptom: dysuria Urinary retention is not the same as dysuria and cannot be used to meet the UTI definition. Dysuria is defined as painful or uncomfortable urination.

UTI Symptoms: urinary urgency, urinary frequency, and dysuria No, "with no other recognized cause" does not apply to these symptoms. In the presence of a positive urine culture which may have been collected as a differential diagnosis for suspicion of UTI, it would be very rare that there is another associated cause for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and dysuria which are hallmark UTI symptoms. Yes. If the patient's urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria occurred when the indwelling urinary catheter was not in place at the time the patient experienced the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria, then the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria can be used as an element to meet NHSN UTI criteria, even on a day when the was in place for part of the day.

General guidance: UTI signs/symptoms within the IWP of a positive urine culture would seem to indicate the symptom is a UTI symptom related to the positive urine culture, which may have been collected based on suspicion of a UTI. To exclude using "with no other recognized cause, " it should be clear the symptom relates to that other cause and is clearly differentiated from a UTI symptom.

### Approach to the child with hematuria [^05ca0dba]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The causes of macroscopic and microscopic hematuria overlap; both are often caused by urinary tract infections or urethral/bladder irritation. Coexistent hypertension and proteinuria should prompt investigation for glomerular disease. The most common glomerulonephritis in children is postinfectious glomerulonephritis. In most patients, and especially with isolated microscopic hematuria, the diagnostic workup reveals no clear underlying cause. In those cases whereby a diagnosis is made, the most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria are thin basement membrane nephropathy, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or idiopathic hypercalciuria. Treatment and long-term prognosis varies with the underlying disease.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^d50b5e85]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to elicit a history and perform a physical examination, including BP measurement, and obtain serum creatinine in patients with microscopic hematuria to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy (such as detailed smoking history), medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microscopic hematuria.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^472a7f68]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Institutional review board approval was obtained to query medical records for pertinent clinical information in 239 consecutive patients evaluated between January 2003 and August 2005 for microscopic hematuria at a urology outpatient clinic in a tertiary-care inner-city hospital. Microscopic hematuria was characterized as microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)]. Initial evaluations included medical history; physical examination, urinalysis, and voided urinary cytology. Urine cultures were obtained in patients if there was high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the cause of the hematuria. Clinic and hospital records were reviewed for several key factors including tobacco usage, voiding symptoms (American Urologic Association, AUA, symptom score), urinalysis, urinary cytology, cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation, and pathologic outcomes. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 1–66 months).

Based on AUA guideline criteria on the use of urinary cytology, voided urinary cytologies were collected over a seven day period prior to radiologic and cystoscopic evaluation. Of the 239 patients, 182 patients had one cytology available for review whereas 125 and 96 patients had two and three cytologies, respectively, available for evaluation. Thus a total of 403 urinary cytologies were reviewed by our cytopathologists. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, final cytologic testing results were classified by the cytopathologists into 1 of 4 categories: normal, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant.

Cystoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary tract and bladder biopsy

Hematuria evaluation included cystourethroscopy performed by an attending urologist with a 30- and 70-degree endoscope in a 17-F sheath in women in the outpatient setting, an 18-F flexible cystoscopy in men in the outpatient setting, or with a 30-and 70-degree endoscope with a 21-F sheath in the operating room. Any abnormal bladder lesions were biopsied and frank tumors were resected. Pathologic specimens were sent for evaluation in 10% formalin. In patients with atypia, suspicious, or carcinoma on cytology and no obviously bladder tumor, random bladder and prostatic biopsies were obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^52dde126]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^ebb22780]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10^3 CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10^2 to < 10^5 CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^573af149]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

### Utilization and yield of CT urography: are the American Urological Association guidelines for imaging of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria being followed? [^40c77865]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to determine whether patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria undergoing CT urography (CTU) meet the American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation and to determine the yield of CTU for upper tract malignancy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive CTU examinations performed for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adult patients. Patients with clinical evidence suggestive of a benign cause of hematuria (stone, urinary tract infection, trauma) or prior urologic malignancy were excluded. The study group included 419 patients (173 men, 246 women). CT reports were reviewed to identify causes of hematuria in all cases. Evaluate for appropriateness was conducted with 200 randomly allocated patients. Urinalysis results were reviewed, and appropriate use of CTU was defined as more than 3 RBCs per high-power field in the absence of urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy results after CTU were noted.

Results

In total, 58 of 200 patients (29.0%; 95% CI, 23.2–35.6%) did not meet American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation. Fifteen (7.5%) received dipstick analysis only. Thirty-eight (19.0%) had urinalysis results showing 0–2 RBCs per high-power field. Five patients (2.5%) were found to have urinary tract infections. No upper tract urothelial neoplasms were identified (0/419; 95% CI, 0.0–0.9%). One solid renal mass was identified without pathologic confirmation. One possible bladder mass was seen at CTU but not visualized at subsequent cystoscopy.

Conclusion

In 29.0% of examinations, CTU is performed for patients who do not meet the criteria for radiologic evaluation. The yield of CTU for upper urinary tract malignancy is low.

### Sole dependence on urine testing strips and the ability to identify clinically significant disease: challenging the current paradigm for heme detection in general clinical situations [^99c33e6a]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of health care professionals to provide patient care is potentially compromised when predicated on untested, although longstanding, perspectives. One such example is urinalysis testing, which has been currently simplified to use only urine testing strips for detection of microscopic hematuria.

Objective

To determine whether urine testing strips are sufficient for identification of clinically significant findings in urinalysis.

Methods

To determine the presence of microscopic hematuria, I examined a collection of urine specimens that had tested heme negative during the 3-month study period.

Results

Of the 342 patients from whom urine specimens were examined during this interval, 50 had microscopic hematuria, despite having tested negative for heme via urine testing strip. Also, 30% were not receiving any medication known to produce microscopic hematuria, and 18% had clinically significant pathology.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of significant clinical pathologic manifestations would have been compromised had microscopic examination not been performed on the urine specimens from the cohort individuals. Examination of the novel approach of including microscopic examination of specimens in a specific clinical situation challenges the dominant paradigm of reliance on assaying using urine testing strips only, revealing that the current method is not only unreliable for determining microscopic hematuria but also is less than optimal in general clinical practice. The findings of this study provide evidence of the importance of microscopic evaluation as a routine component of urinalysis.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^f41ef943]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Over testing for UTIs is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture in the absence of vaginal symptoms are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis, however, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER. In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740). While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed the ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that over‐testing of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture‐negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient‐based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture‐negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either poorly documented in the clinical record or based on point‐of‐care urine dipstick testing. While the absence of pyuria on urinalysis has a high negative predictive value and can help rule out the diagnosis, urinalysis when utilized independent of UTI symptoms should not be used to guide treatment decisions even if positive for pyuria as it has a poor positive predictive value for UTI. Given that pyuria is common among women of all ages, especially elderly women, performing an initial screening urinalysis in the absence of urinary symptoms often results in overtreatment as it may be uncomfortable for providers to withhold antibiotic treatment in the face of positive laboratory results. These principles underlie clinical guidance by the US Preventative Services Task Force and Infectious Disease Society of America both recommending against screening urinalysis in nonpregnant adults. This is why we encourage not only antibiotic stewardship but also diagnostic stewardship appropriately restricting laboratory testing to patients in whom there is significant clinical suspicion for UTI.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in women with rUTIs — testing and treatment: Clinicians should omit surveillance urine testing, including urine culture, in asymptomatic patients with rUTIs. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) Clinicians should not treat ASB in patients. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Without appropriate symptoms, bacteriuria of any magnitude is considered ASB, and clinicians should, in general, omit testing for malodorous and/or cloudy urine when not accompanied by an acute change in other lower urinary tract symptoms.
