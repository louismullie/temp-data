## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Adie's pupil, including its definition, pathophysiology, diagnostic features, differentials, workup, management, prognosis, and special contexts like COVID-19 and pediatrics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining Adie's pupil and Holmes-Adie syndrome. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology and the pharmacologic basis of the dilute pilocarpine test. Next, I will review the core diagnostic features and how to distinguish Adie's from look-alikes. After that, I need to check the differential diagnosis and when to image. Then, I will outline a practical diagnostic workup, including pilocarpine testing and what concentrations to use. Finally, I will consider management, prognosis, special scenarios, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't gloss over nuances. Adie's pupil, also called tonic pupil, is a parasympathetic denervation of the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves causing a dilated pupil with poor light reaction but preserved near response and slow redilation, often with sector palsy of the iris sphincter; when accompanied by absent deep tendon reflexes, it is termed Holmes-Adie syndrome, which is typically benign but may have broader autonomic involvement in some patients [^115CV8CX] [^113mVM9f].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. The core mechanism is post-ganglionic parasympathetic denervation with cholinergic supersensitivity of the denervated iris sphincter, which explains the constrictive response to very dilute pilocarpine that would not affect a normal pupil; this supersensitivity is the pharmacologic hallmark used in diagnosis and is well supported by controlled studies of dilute pilocarpine in healthy volunteers establishing dose-response thresholds [^notfound] [^115CV8CX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the clinical picture; I should verify the classic features. Clinically, Adie's pupil shows anisocoria greater in bright light, poor direct and consensual light reactions, light-near dissociation with a brisk accommodation response, slow redilation after near focus, and often sectoral iris sphincter palsy visible on slit lamp; tendon reflexes may be reduced or absent in Holmes-Adie syndrome, and some patients develop progressive cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction over time, so I should remember to ask about orthostatic symptoms and consider autonomic testing when indicated [^116TqY27] [^113mVM9f].

> Next, I should review the differential and make sure I don't miss emergencies. Key mimics include third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement, pharmacologic mydriasis, traumatic iris sphincter injury, and other causes of anisocoria such as Horner syndrome; distinguishing features include extraocular muscle involvement and ptosis in third nerve palsy, a history of exposure or lack of response to pilocarpine in pharmacologic blockade, and the presence of cholinergic supersensitivity in Adie's pupil, which helps separate it from these entities [^115CV8CX] [^112VAh4U].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup so I don't over-order tests. In isolated, typical cases, no imaging is needed; the diagnosis is clinical plus pharmacologic testing with dilute pilocarpine, typically 0.1% to 0.125%, which produces constriction in Adie's pupil but not in normal pupils, with 0.0625% sometimes sufficient in sensitive tests; if there are atypical features, associated cranial neuropathies, or a history of malignancy or radiation, then neuroimaging of the ciliary ganglion region and brainstem is warranted to exclude compressive or infiltrative lesions [^1126yMH6] [^115CV8CX] [^115qrQgN].

> I should double-check management details. Symptomatic relief of photophobia and blur can be achieved with dilute pilocarpine drops, commonly 0.1% three times daily, which restores pupil size and improves near vision; many patients adapt over time as the pupil becomes smaller, so therapy can be tapered or used as needed, and reassurance about the benign nature of isolated Adie's pupil is important [^115CV8CX].

> Let me consider prognosis and follow-up. Most cases are stable or improve spontaneously, with the pupil often becoming smaller over years; however, a subset with Holmes-Adie syndrome may develop progressive cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, so periodic inquiry about orthostatic symptoms and, when indicated, autonomic testing can be reasonable in longitudinal care [^113mVM9f].

> But wait, what if the presentation is in a child or in the setting of COVID-19; I need to ensure I address special contexts. In pediatrics, Adie's pupil is uncommon but recognized, and persistent mydriasis can follow ophthalmoplegic migraine; in COVID-19, tonic pupils have been reported and may reflect immune-mediated ciliary ganglion injury, so in new anisocoria during or after COVID-19, I should still apply the same diagnostic principles and consider dilute pilocarpine testing to confirm a tonic pupil before attributing it to other causes [^113USh2B] [^113aFq6P] [^116oWQ5k].

> I will now examine the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Adie's pupil is a benign, parasympathetic denervation syndrome with characteristic light-near dissociation and cholinergic supersensitivity; diagnosis is clinical plus dilute pilocarpine testing, imaging is reserved for atypical or complicated cases, management is symptomatic with dilute pilocarpine and reassurance, and prognosis is generally favorable though autonomic progression can occur in Holmes-Adie syndrome, so a focused history and selective testing are the cornerstones of care [^115CV8CX] [^113mVM9f] [^1126yMH6].

---

Adie's pupil is a **benign neurological disorder** characterized by a tonic pupil with poor light reaction, preserved near response, and slow redilation, often with absent tendon reflexes (Holmes-Adie syndrome) [^115CV8CX] [^113mVM9f]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by **dilute pilocarpine testing** (0.1–0.125%) showing cholinergic supersensitivity with constriction of the affected pupil [^1126yMH6] [^115CV8CX]. Most cases are idiopathic and require no treatment beyond reassurance; symptomatic photophobia or blur can be managed with dilute pilocarpine or corrective lenses [^115CV8CX]. Prognosis is excellent, with many pupils gradually shrinking over years and rare progression to broader autonomic dysfunction [^113mVM9f].

---

## Clinical features

- **Pupil size and reactivity**: The affected pupil is typically dilated and reacts poorly to direct light, but constricts slowly and tonically to near focus, with slow redilation when focus returns to distance [^115CV8CX].

- **Light-near dissociation**: Characteristic finding where the pupil shows minimal reaction to light but a strong, slow constriction to accommodation [^115CV8CX].

- **Sector palsy**: Slit-lamp exam may reveal segmental iris sphincter palsy, appearing as irregular pupil shape or sectoral constriction defects [^116TqY27].

- **Tendon reflexes**: Absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes are common, especially in Holmes-Adie syndrome [^113mVM9f].

- **Symptoms**: Patients may report photophobia, blurred vision, and difficulty with near work; symptoms often improve over time [^115CV8CX].

---

## Pathophysiology

Adie's pupil results from **parasympathetic denervation** of the iris sphincter and ciliary muscle due to ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerve injury, most often idiopathic [^115CV8CX]. Denervation leads to cholinergic supersensitivity, explaining the constrictive response to dilute pilocarpine [^1126yMH6]. Some cases follow viral illness, trauma, or surgery, and rare associations include autoimmune or paraneoplastic processes [^114Nwz7U].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical examination**: Assess pupil size, shape, and reactivity in light and near; look for sector palsy and check deep tendon reflexes [^112VAh4U].

- **Dilute pilocarpine test**: Instill 0.1–0.125% pilocarpine; constriction of the affected pupil within 15–30 minutes indicates cholinergic supersensitivity and supports the diagnosis [^1126yMH6] [^115CV8CX].

- **Imaging**: MRI is not routinely indicated for isolated Adie's pupil; consider if there are atypical features, additional neurological deficits, or concern for compressive lesions [^115qrQgN].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Key distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Third nerve palsy | - Ptosis <br/> - Extraocular muscle involvement <br/> - No cholinergic supersensitivity [^1121gJh7] |
| Pharmacologic mydriasis | - History of exposure <br/> - No constriction to dilute pilocarpine [^115LW663] |
| Horner syndrome | - Ptosis <br/> - Miosis <br/> - Anhidrosis <br/> - No cholinergic supersensitivity [^1172LSSk] |
| Traumatic iris sphincter injury | - History of trauma <br/> - Irregular pupil shape <br/> - No cholinergic supersensitivity |

---

## Management

- **Observation**: Most cases require no treatment beyond reassurance and education [^115CV8CX].

- **Symptomatic therapy**: Dilute pilocarpine (0.1%) drops can reduce photophobia and improve near vision; use as needed [^115CV8CX].

- **Corrective lenses**: Prescription glasses or contact lenses can help with accommodative symptoms [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Periodic reassessment to monitor for progression or development of additional neurological features [^113mVM9f].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent**; many pupils gradually decrease in size over years, and symptoms often lessen. Rarely, patients develop broader autonomic dysfunction, but most remain stable and benign [^113mVM9f].

---

Adie's pupil is a **benign, self-limited neurological disorder** with characteristic pupillary findings and a straightforward diagnostic approach. Management is conservative, and prognosis is excellent, though patients should be monitored for rare autonomic progression [^113mVM9f].

### Residual and persistent Adie's pupil after pediatric ophthalmoplegic migraine [^113USh2B]. Pediatric Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

We report on a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with ophthalmoplegic migraines who had been previously diagnosed, at age 7 years, with typical migraines with aura. After resolution of the third ophthalmoplegic migraine attack, the only evident residual clinical sign was Adie's pupil. During 24-month follow-up, at age 11 years, a neurologic examination produced completely normal results. However, Adie's pupil persisted. Adie's tonic pupil can be associated with extraocular diseases, which were all excluded in this patient. The mechanisms underlying tonic pupil are not fully understood. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of an ophthalmoplegic migraine followed by persistent Adie's pupil. Possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.

### Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy and Adie's pupil after measles vaccination [^114pZ4A2]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is an increasingly recognized disorder with typical radiologic findings of bilateral gray- and white-matter abnormalities in the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres. The majority of patients with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome are adults, and it is rare in children. Previously reported associations of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome include hypertension, vasculitis, nephrotic syndrome, severe hypercalcemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, eclampsia, renal failure, and use of immunosuppressive drugs. Adie's pupil is described as the presence of a large unilateral or bilateral tonic pupil related to virus infections or trauma. In this article, we describe a case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy and Adie's pupil association that occurred after measles vaccination. To our knowledge, this association has not been reported.

### Asymmetric pigment dispersion in a patient with the unilateral adie pupil [^115LXH42]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pigmentary glaucoma is a bilateral disorder. When it occurs asymmetrically or unilaterally, a cause should be sought because it may help us to understand the pathophysiology of this condition better. We describe a patient with unilateral pigmentary glaucoma and the Adie pupil in the same eye and discuss the possible role of the Adie pupil in the development of the pigmentary glaucoma.

Methods

A case report. A 37-year-old woman presented with asymmetric pigment dispersion resulting in pigmentary glaucoma in the right eye and an unilateral Adie pupil in the same eye.

Results

We believe that the dilated Adie pupil in the right eye might have resulted in a decreased amount of relative pupillary block. This, then, might have led to an increased contact between the posterior iris and the zonules, resulting in greater pigment dispersion and trabecular obstruction in the right eye.

Conclusion

It has been proposed that the pigment is liberated from the iris pigment epithelium because of the mechanical rubbing of the posterior iris against the anterior zonular packets. Our case supports this proposed mechanism of pigment release.

### A case of angle closure glaucoma caused by plateau iris and Adie's pupil [^113DKUG5]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a case of plateau iris associated with bilateral Adie's pupil.

Design

Interventional case report.

Methods

A 54-year-old woman presented with pain in her right eye and headache. Intraocular pressure was 34 mm Hg in the right eye. Light reflex was defective bilaterally.

Results

Ultrasound biomicroscopic imaging revealed normal anterior chamber depth and narrow angle. The ciliary processes were situated anteriorly. The eyes showed supersensitivity to 0.125% pilocarpine. The patient was diagnosed as having bilateral angle-closure glaucoma induced by Adie's pupil and plateau iris.

Conclusion

Mild pupillary dilation caused by Adie's pupil may have played a role in the development of angle closure in the plateau iris configuration of our patient.

### The review of ophthalmic symptoms in COVID-19 [^113aFq6P]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pupil Abnormalities

In the context of COVID-19, cases of tonic pupil (Adie's pupil), both unilateraland bilateral, have been observed. It is a symptom resulting from weakened parasympathetic innervation of the pupillary sphincter muscle, which leads to a weak reaction of the pupil to light, while relatively good accommodation is maintained. There is a report of a patient with bilateral tonic mydriasis due to COVID-19 and additional multifocal uveitis. Ordás et al described a case of tonic pupil with trochlear nerve palsy associated with COVID-19. There is no consensus in the available literature on how exactly the SARS-CoV2 virus causes the formation of a tonic pupil (Adie's pupil). According to the hypothesis raised by most researchers, in COVID-19 the tonic pupil is the result of delayed immune damage caused by the viral infection and not the result of a direct effect of the virus on the central nervous system.

Horner's syndrome, with eyelid ptosis and pupil abnormalities can occur in COVID-19 and refers to patients with involvement of the upper part of the lungs in whom other possible causes of Horner's syndrome have been excluded.

### Neurobehavioral meaning of pupil size [^114qA5MS]. Neuron (2024). Medium credibility.

Pupil size is a widely used metric of brain state. It is one of the few signals originating from the brain that can be readily monitored with low-cost devices in basic science, clinical, and home settings. It is, therefore, important to investigate and generate well-defined theories related to specific interpretations of this metric. What exactly does it tell us about the brain? Pupils constrict in response to light and dilate during darkness, but the brain also controls pupil size irrespective of luminosity. Pupil size fluctuations resulting from ongoing "brain states" are used as a metric of arousal, but what is pupil-linked arousal and how should it be interpreted in neural, cognitive, and computational terms? Here, we discuss some recent findings related to these issues. We identify open questions and propose how to answer them through a combination of well-defined tasks, neurocomputational models, and neurophysiological probing of the interconnected loops of causes and consequences of pupil size.

### Adie's tonic pupil presenting with unilateral photophobia successfully treated with dilute pilocarpine [^115CV8CX]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 40-year-old healthy man presented with a 4-month history of photophobia, blurred vision and a right dilated pupil. Examination revealed a right pupil that was not reactive to light but constricted strongly to a near target and slowly redilated when he looked back in the distance. Pharmacological testing with dilute pilocarpine 0.1% resulted in constriction of the right pupil but no change in the left pupil. This also resulted in resolution of his photophobia and blurry vision. Neurological examination was otherwise normal, and a diagnosis of Adie's tonic pupil was made. The main differential diagnosis to consider for a large pupil is a third nerve palsy, pharmacological mydriasis, tonic pupil and local iris processes, such as iris sphincter tears from trauma. Knowledge of the key features of these conditions can avoid wasted resources from unnecessary testing. Dilute pilocarpine 0.1% three times a day can be considered as a pharmacological therapy for symptomatic relief.

### Bilateral tonic pupils: holmes adie syndrome or generalised neuropathy? [^116TqY27]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the pupil signs in patients with bilateral pupillotonia caused by Holmes-Adie syndrome or generalised peripheral neuropathy.

Methods

Infrared video pupillographic techniques were used to measure a number of pupil variables in patients with Holmes-Adie syndrome, generalised neuropathy (various aetiologies) and healthy age-matched control subjects.

Results

Regardless of aetiology, the patients generally had pupil signs typical of pupillotonia (small dark diameters, large light diameters, tonic near responses, attenuated light responses with light-near dissociation, and sector palsy). However, significant differences were found in the prevalence and magnitude of several pupil variables in the two patient groups. In particular, sector palsy and anisocoria exceeding 1 mm (in the light) were seen much more commonly in Holmes-Adie patients than patients with generalised neuropathy. The presence of both these pupil signs can be used to distinguish between these diagnoses with a sensitivity of 58% and a specificity of 90%.

Conclusions

The tonic pupils of patients with Holmes-Adie syndrome are significantly different to those found in patients with generalised neuropathy; recognition of these differences may allow distinction between these diagnoses.

### Pupillary response to four concentrations of pilocarpine in normal subjects: application to testing for adie tonic pupil [^1126yMH6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the amount of pupillary constriction to four different concentrations of pilocarpine in normal human subjects and to determine if pupillary constriction correlates with bioavailability of the instilled concentrations. The amount of pupillary constriction to dilute pilocarpine is utilized as a diagnostic test for Adie tonic pupil as distinguished from a normal pupil response.

Design

Twenty healthy volunteers had automated binocular infrared pupillography in the dark after instillation of four different concentrations of dilute pilocarpine. Ocular penetration of eye drops was also assessed using 2% fluorescein sodium as a tracer.

Methods

Prospective institutional double-masked study of both eyes of twenty healthy volunteers, ten with brown irides, ten with blue irides, between the ages of 20–40 years.

Results

A pilocarpine dose-dependent curve showed decreased pupil size within 15 minutes, peaking at 30–60 minutes. No difference was noted between right and left eyes, iris color, or corneal permeability.

Conclusions

Normal pupils constrict to dilute concentrations of pilocarpine (0.25% or 0.125%), but constrict insignificantly to concentrations of 0.0313% or 0.0625%. Pupil constriction with 0.0625% pilocarpine should distinguish an Adie pupil from normal. This confirms the utility of this simple office diagnostic procedure.

### The pupil [^114Nwz7U]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To give an overview on topics of pupillary function selected according to their relevance in clinical neurology. Mainly publications of the last 3 years have been considered.

Recent Findings

The discovery of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells not serving vision, but serving circadian rhythm and the pupil initiated many studies. There is evidence that pupil reaction to light might be preserved even if all rods and cones are lost. Spontaneous pupillary contractions in darkness occur in sleepy subjects and have been used to quantify the state of alertness. Apraclonidine eye drops have been suggested to diagnose Horner syndrome. Iatrogenic cause and carotid artery dissection are the most frequently reported underlying causes of Horner syndrome. Anti-Hu antibodies may be associated with tonic pupils.

Summary

Pupil studies in blind patients may give new insights into the function of the pupillary system. Testing for sleepiness by means of pupillography might be used more frequently. Testing for Horner syndrome still needs to be done with cocaine eye drops. Clinical evaluation has to be focused on detecting additional signs and symptoms. Unknown malignancy is very rare. In the tonic pupil (Adie syndrome) autoantibodies may play a role, in exceptional cases it might represent a paraneoplastic disorder.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^112VAh4U]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric eye evaluations — pupillary examination: The pupils should be assessed for size, symmetry, and shape; for their direct and consensual responses to light; and for presence of a relative afferent defect, recognizing that pupillary evaluation in infants and children may be difficult due to hippus, poorly maintained fixation, and/or rapid changes in accommodative status. Anisocoria greater than 1 millimeter may indicate a pathological process, such as Horner syndrome, Adie tonic pupil, or a pupil-involving third-cranial-nerve palsy, and irregular pupils may indicate the presence of traumatic sphincter damage, iritis, or a congenital abnormality. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) of 0.3 or more log units (i.e., easily visible) is not typically seen in amblyopia, a subtle RAPD may be seen with dense amblyopia, and the presence of a large RAPD should suggest optic nerve damage, compressive optic neuropathy or other etiologies of visual impairment.

### Ophthalmoplegic migraine with persistent dilated pupil [^111Z2RaW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a rare disorder characterized by childhood-onset ophthalmoplegia and migraine headaches. The third cranial nerve is commonly involved, while involvement of the sixth and fourth cranial nerves is uncommon. We present the case study of a 15-year-old female teenager whose condition was diagnosed with ophthalmoplegic migraine when she was 9 years old and since then has experienced multiple and recurrent attacks. Since the diagnosis, she has exhibited a persistent right-eye mydriasis, despite resolution of migrainous episodes. Pupillary involvement in ophthalmoplegic migraine is the rule in children, with total recovery in the majority of cases. We will discuss some aspects related to the eventual association between this entity and other comorbidities, such as Adie tonic pupil, emphasizing the fact that the underlying mechanisms of this residual mydriasis are not fully understood.

### Tonic pupil caused by adenoid cystic carcinoma versus postradiation changes to the ciliary ganglion [^115qrQgN]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Learning points

A truly isolated tonic pupil is usually a benign finding. The dilated pupil will be more evident in a bright room, reacts poorly to light but briskly to accommodation. The patient must also be evaluated for an oculomotor nerve palsy. In isolated cases with reduced tendon reflexes, this is Adie syndrome.
Patients with a tonic pupil should be assessed for history or signs that might suggest other lesions in the orbit or brain. Here, the history of malignancy and abducens palsy both mandated imaging for a structural cause in the area of the ciliary ganglion.
Separating diffuse tumour infiltration from radiation effects can be difficult with MRI, and when a tissue biopsy is not safe, serial imaging can be important to watch for tumour growth and spread.

### Progression of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in holmes-adie syndrome [^113mVM9f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The Holmes-Adie Syndrome (HAS) is a disorder of unknown aetiology comprising unilateral or bilateral tonic pupils with near light dissociation and tendon areflexia. Although considered to be benign, troublesome symptoms may result from autonomic disturbances, affecting vasomotor, sudomotor and respiratory function. It is unclear if the autonomic manifestations of the disease remain stable or progress, as longitudinal studies with detailed autonomic assessments have not been described. The authors report four HAS patients studied at intervals over 16, 8, 4 and 2&emsp14; years with cardiovascular autonomic tests (head-up tilt, isometric exercise, mental arithmetic, cutaneous cold, deep breathing, Valsalva manoeuvre and standing). In each, there was progression of cardiovascular autonomic deficits with time, accompanied by symptomatic worsening. These observations in HAS, for the first time, indicate progression of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction of clinical significance. This has a number of implications, including those relating to aetiology and prognosis. The authors recommend regular clinical and laboratory follow-up, especially of cardiovascular autonomic function, in patients with HAS.

### Ciliary ganglioplegic migraine: migraine-related prolonged mydriasis [^116wmCjE]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Transient, unilateral mydriasis has been reported in migraine patients, and this has been regarded as a possible co-morbidity between migraine and Adie's tonic pupil. Mydriasis that outlasts the duration of migraine attacks is rare.

Methods

Through an eight-year period we have studied all patients referred to our neurological clinic because of migraine attack with mydriasis. All the patients underwent thorough neurologic and ophthalmologic examinations including MRI of the brain and testing of the pupil response to ocular instillation of dilute pilocarpine (0.125%).

Results

Seven women and two men, with a mean age of 33.8 ± 12.3 years (range: 19–52) were included. The patients presented during one hemicranial migraine attack with an ipsilateral mydriasis that persisted for a mean of three months, while migraine headaches remained with their typical episodic course. In all the patients a cholinergic supersensitivity in the symptomatic pupil was demonstrated, thus pointing to a dysfunction of the ipsilateral ganglionic parasympathetic fibers.

Conclusions

Synchronous co-localization of the features suggests a pathogenic link between the pupil dysfunction and migraine, rather than a simultaneous coexistence of two independent disorders. Likely explanations include a latent Adie's pupil that could have been triggered during a particular migraine attack; a ciliar ganglionic lesion/dysfunction produced by the migrainous process; an ophthalmoplegic migraine with selective parasympathycoparesis; or an episodic ciliar ganglionitis with migrainous features. Ciliary ganglioplegic migraine is proposed as a nominal term pointing to the possible anatomic source of the migrainous-related pupil dysfunction; the pathogenesis remains unknown.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^1129PMDG]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We find that distinct temporal characteristics of pupil responses to event boundaries lead to changes in subjective (time dilation) and objective (impaired recency discrimination) aspects of temporal memory. Trial-level analyses reveal that greater variability in pupil diameter over more prolonged periods of time is also associated with these segmentation-like effects in memory. We conclude that dynamic fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal states may track multiple mental processes that promote the formation of discrete episodic memories.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^111oARuB]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Everyday life unfolds continuously, yet we tend to remember past experiences as discrete event sequences or episodes. Although this phenomenon has been well documented, the neuromechanisms that support the transformation of continuous experience into distinct and memorable episodes remain unknown. Here, we show that changes in context, or event boundaries, elicit a burst of autonomic arousal, as indexed by pupil dilation. Event boundaries also lead to the segmentation of adjacent episodes in later memory, evidenced by changes in memory for the temporal duration, order, and perceptual details of recent event sequences. These subjective and objective changes in temporal memory are also related to distinct temporal features of pupil dilations to boundaries as well as to the temporal stability of more prolonged pupil-linked arousal states. Collectively, our findings suggest that pupil measures reflect both stability and change in ongoing mental context representations, which in turn shape the temporal structure of memory.

### Ross syndrome: a rare or a misknown disorder of thermoregulation? A skin innervation study on 12 subjects [^114Ab1zc]. Brain (2006). Low credibility.

Ross syndrome is described as a rare disorder of sweating associated with areflexia and tonic pupil. Since Ross's first description in 1958, approximately 40 cases have been described. We assessed the involvement of cutaneous innervation in 12 subjects with Ross syndrome using quantitative sensory testing, sweating assessment and immunohistochemical study of anhidrotic and hyperhidrotic skin. This evaluation was repeated over time in 4 out of 12 subjects. In addition, we enrolled four subjects with Holmes-Adie syndrome (areflexia and tonic pupil) to investigate similarities between the two conditions. We found in Ross patients a complex and progressive involvement of cutaneous sensory and autonomic innervation underlying the impairment of heat production and heat dissipation through both loss of sweating and loss of cutaneous blood flow regulation. In Holmes-Adie subjects we found a mild impairment of sweating without thermoregulatory problems. The persistence of a sudomotor vasoactive intestinal peptide-immunoreactive (VIP-ir) innervation, although deranged and poor, definitely differentiated Holmes-Adie from Ross patients. Ross syndrome is a progressive and complex disorder of thermoregulation difficult to differentiate from the probably pathogenetically related Holmes-Adie syndrome. Sweating assessment and skin biopsy are suitable tools to define a boundary between them. Owing to the large number of Ross patients observed in only 5 years, and to the long and complex medical history of most of them, doubts arise on the effective rarity of this condition, and we warn family doctors and other specialists, besides neurologists, to become aware of this complex disorder.

All patients in this study were 18 years or older, and were recruited during their visit at our clinic. Exclusion criteria included any prior ocular trauma or surgery, any ocular condition requiring treatment by intravitreal injections, any ocular condition that affects pupillary function (such as optic neuropathy, Adie's tonic pupil, oculomotor nerve palsy, and so on), and any use of drops or gels. Male patients were also specifically asked about current or previous use of α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists (such as tamsulosin) for prostate problems, and were excluded if their history was positive for their use. Patients with pseudoexfoliation or anisocoria > 0.5 mm at baseline were also excluded. Patients with known allergy to tropicamide or phenylephrine were not included. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board, and a written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers were followed during this research.

Recorded parameters included demographic information and previous medical and ocular history. Specifically, patients were asked whether they had diabetes mellitus or not, and this was confirmed with their medical records.

### Tonic pupil caused by adenoid cystic carcinoma versus postradiation changes to the ciliary ganglion [^115g1SUi]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignancy of exocrine glands that most often arises from the salivary glands, with 2.4%–3.7% of head and neck cases originating in the nasopharynx. Perineural spread is common via branches of the trigeminal nerve. Skull base involvement can occur through the trigeminal nerve, internal carotid artery or Eustachian tube.

A tonic pupil is due to a lesion in the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves; it is usually unilateral and displays light-near dissociation with minimal reactivity to light, retained constriction to near, and slow redilation to distance. The most common cause of an isolated tonic pupil is Adie syndrome — a benign condition associated with loss of reflexes. Tonic pupils arising from a direct tumour or treatment-related effects of the ciliary ganglion are uncommon. Pupillary involvement in ACC has been reported in only a few cases.

Here, we present a case of tonic pupil and abducens nerve palsy, which were likely due to direct ACC neural invasion or side effects of radiotherapy (RT).

### Idiopathic unilateral hyperhidrosis with holmes-adie syndrome: case report [^116B31Bi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a disease that is characterized by excessive sweating due to hyperactivation of eccrine sweat glands. It may be localized or generalized form. Holmes-Adie syndrome is an idiopathic disease with unilateral pupil dilatation and loss of deep tendon reflexes. We present a 37-year-old female patient diagnosed with unilateral hyperhidrosis coincident with Holmes-Adie syndrome because of this unusual presentation.

### Pupil-linked arousal is driven by decision uncertainty and alters serial choice bias [^112kws7g]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain's arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers' tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.

### Validation of monocular pupillometry in healthy controls and patients with autonomic dysfunction: pupillary biomarkers for autonomic failure [^111C3eLB]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.2 Validation With Binocular Pupillometer

Thirteen patients and seven healthy controls underwent pupillary assessment with both the monocular PLR‐4000 and the binocular DP2000. Results were comparable as assessed by two different pupillometers: five patients had no ocular autonomic dysfunction, one patient with Holmes‐Adie syndrome presented with parasympathetic denervation, five patients had isolated sympathetic dysfunction (including one patient with ATTRv whose sympathetic response could not be evaluated on the DP2000 due to repeat blinking), and two patients had combined parasympathetic and sympathetic denervation. In one of the latter, parasympathetic impairment assessed by PLR4000 was only detectable by mildly impaired constriction velocities, showing normal relative pupillary constriction. All healthy controls had normal findings as assessed by both pupillometers.

3.1.3 Intra‐Individual Test–Retest Variability

Twenty healthy individuals (a total of 40 eyes) underwent test–retest experiments. Median intra‐individual difference in resting pupil size was 0.4 (0.1–0.7) mm. Median light response difference was 3.0% (1.0%–4.8%). Median % difference in response to apraclonidine (40 min) was 5.2% (2.2%–10.6%).

3.1.4 Effect of Apraclonidine

Twelve controls had repeat assessments every 5 min during the 40–60 min interval after topical application of apraclonidine. The largest differences in pupillary size compared to measurements before use of eye drops were found at 40 min (in 13 eyes), 45 min (1 eye), 50 min (2 eyes), 55 min (2 eyes), and 60 min (6 eyes).

3.2 Clinical Validation

In total, 100 patients with autonomic symptoms due to different etiologies underwent pupillary assessment. Median age at time of testing was 58 (43.75–66.25) years; 50% were males.

### Idiopathic harlequin syndrome: a pediatric case [^116fms3K]. Journal of Child Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Harlequin syndrome, Harlequin sign, Holmes-Adie syndrome, and Ross syndrome lie on a spectrum of partial dysautonomias affecting facial sudomotor, vasomotor, and pupillary responses. These syndromes have imprecise clinical boundaries and overlap syndromes are known. We report a 9-year-old girl who presented with anhidrosis over the right half of her face and the left side of her body, with compensatory hyperhidrosis on the contralateral side. She was noted to have bilateral tonic pupils and normal muscle stretch reflexes with other features suggestive of autonomic dysfunction. Investigations to rule out secondary causes were noncontributory. Her clinical presentation can be categorized as partial overlap between Harlequin syndrome and Holmes-Adie syndrome.

### Ross syndrome plus: beyond horner, holmes-adie, and harlequin [^1163CXEt]. Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Ross syndrome is an uncommon disorder characterized by the triad of segmental anhidrosis, hyporeflexia, and tonic pupils.

Methods

The authors describe the clinical findings of five patients with Ross syndrome and detail the results of their pharmacologic and autonomic testing.

Results

In four patients, the classic findings of Ross syndrome were accompanied by Horner's syndrome. Other symptoms of dysautonomia were also common.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that Ross syndrome is a dysautonomic condition of varying expression resulting from a generalized injury to ganglion cells or their projections.

### Fixed and dilated: the history of a classic pupil abnormality [^112fw4Se]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the development of ideas about the nature and mechanism of the fixed dilated pupil, paying particular attention to experimental conditions and clinical observations in the 19th century. Starting from Kocher's standard review in 1901, the authors studied German, English, and French texts for historical information. Medical and neurological textbooks from the 19th and 20th centuries were reviewed to investigate when and how this information percolated through neurological and neurosurgical practices. Cooper experimented with intracranial pressure (ICP) in a dog in the 1830s, but did not mention the pupils. He described dilated pupils in clinical cases without referring to the effect of light. Bright demonstrated to have some knowledge of the pupil sign (clinical observations). Realizing the unreliability of the pupil sign, Hutchinson in 1867–1868 tried to reason in which cases trepanation would be advisable. Von Leyden's 1866 animal experiments, in which he increased CSF volume by injecting protein solutions intracranially, was the first observation in which the association between fixed dilated pupils and increased ICP was established. Along with bradycardia and motor and respiratory effects, he noticed wide pupils were usually present in a comatose state. Asymmetrical dilation could not always be attributed to increased ICP, but to an oculomotor nerve lesion. Pagenstecher in 1871 extended knowledge by meticulously studying consecutive pupil phenomena with increasing pressure. In 1880, von Bergmann emphasized the significance of the ipsilateral dilation in experiments as well as in clinical cases. He distinguished the extent of pressure increase and its duration. Probably confusing irritation (epileptic head turning to the other side with pupil dilation) and lesion effects, he suggested a cortical area responsible for oculomotor phenomena, indicating what is now known as the frontal eye field. Naunyn and Schreiber (1881) understood the relationship between increased ICP with pupil dilation and decreased pulse frequency and blood pressure, warning not to decrease the latter. Concentrating on experimental traumatic effects, Duret (1878) investigated compression and commotion, in which he distinguished two phases, notably pupil constriction by bulbar lesions, due to CSF shock, followed by dilation from congestion and inflammation, due to blood around the oculomotor nerve. The key observation of a fixed dilated pupil as a sign of acute mass effect came gradually and after some localization stumbles. Following the period of extensive experimental research in ICP, the results of which were translated to clinical observations, the prognostic significance was gradually acknowledged by authors of neurological textbooks. It is well known that Cushing did similar experiments in Berne (1900–1901), and later suggested he would not have done so if he had studied the literature.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^112r38QT]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Interestingly, we also demonstrate that the stability of pupil-linked arousal states over time helps integrate dynamic experiences into memorable events. Previous work suggests that there are many organizational principles by which temporally-extended experiences cluster together in memory, including temporal context, semantics, and overlapping perceptual features. However, this body of work mostly considers contextual information that is either theoretical (e.g. mental context,) or comes from the external environment (e.g. categories, colors, space). Our results suggest that, like other forms of context, arousal might be a strong feature of an internal contextual state that binds information together in memory.

Using PCA, we found that momentary increases in different temporal characteristics of pupil dilation at boundaries were associated with subjective and objective markers of event memory separation. The PCA first revealed prototypical temporal features of pupil dilation, which have been previously associated with different autonomic pathways that regulate pupil size. These features of pupil dilation have also been linked to different aspects of cognition, such as sustained cognitive processing, response anticipation, and motor responses –, suggesting that multiple arousal-related mental processes are engaged by boundaries in ways that relate to later memory segmentation.

### Anisocoria in an intubated patient with COVID-19 [^116oWQ5k]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

As COVID-19 is known to be prothrombotic, our first differential diagnosis was a cavernous sinus thrombosis. This was disproved after CT venogram. Both the ophthalmology team and the neurology team then thought that a thrombotic or ischaemic event could have happened specifically in the midbrain (as this is where the pupil reflex nuclei are found). Microhaemorrhages on the MRI of the head did provide evidence towards this diagnosis, although the absence of disc swelling made a diagnosis of ischaemic optic neuropathy more difficult.

However, after the patient was stepped down from ICU, IOP measurements were high and the angle was partially closed in the left eye. Therefore, our final diagnosis was subacute closed angle glaucoma.

After reviewing the patient's medication in ICU, none was known to cause an increase in IOP or acute angle closure glaucoma.

An Adie's tonic pupil is also an important differential for anisocoria. An Adie's pupil occurs due to parasympathetic denervation of the ciliary ganglion. There are reports of Adie's pupils occurring in patients with COVID-19. It is therefore important to test anisocoria with diluted pilocarpine and examine if there is light-near dissociation to exclude an acute Adie's pupil.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^113Pbe8r]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To date, the primary method of indexing the formation of discrete event memories has been to examine memory for the order and duration of sequential information (for a review, see ref.). For instance, when individuals are presented with two items from a recent experience, memory for the order of those items is relatively impaired if there was an intervening context change compared to instances where the items were encountered in the same context –. Likewise, item pairs are also remembered as having occurred farther apart in time if they spanned an event boundary compared to items that had been encountered in the same context. Event boundaries can also influence non-temporal aspects of episodic memory, such as enhancing associative memory for an item and any co-incident contextual information (e.g. background color). The existing literature therefore presents a complex story, whereby temporal aspects of episodic memory integration are disrupted by changes in the surrounding context, while other elements of the new context present at event boundaries are enhanced in memory.

### Multimodal non-invasive assessment of intracranial hypertension: an observational study [^116KLDiK]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was performed according to the STROBE reporting guidelines for observational studies.

Study population

All consecutive adult (> 18 years) patients admitted to the Department of Intensive Care of the Hôpital Erasme (Université Libre de Bruxelles) over a period of 20 months (January 2017 to September 2018) were eligible if (a) they underwent invasive ICP monitoring for risk of intracranial hypertension; (b) they had a TBI, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); and (c) they had a "stable ICP" value (see below). Patients with other reasons for ICP monitoring, with known pupillary abnormalities (such as Adie's pupil, Argyll Robertson pupil, post-surgical deformation, glaucoma), multiple sclerosis, ocular surgery, or severe peri-orbital edema limiting pupillary assessment were excluded. Patients without a temporal window for TCD assessment and without an arterial catheter for continuous blood pressure measurement were also excluded.

The decision to insert invasive ICP monitoring was made by the attending ICU physician in collaboration with the neurosurgeons. The decision was based on the latest version of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines for TBI patients, while for SAH and ICH, this mainly based on patient's clinical status on arrival (i.e. alteration of consciousness or rapid neuro-worsening) and neuroradiological findings (i.e. midline shift, impelling herniation, hydrocephalus). ICP was measured using an intraparenchymal fiber-optic transducer (Neurovent, Raumedic SA, Switzerland), or an extra-ventricular drainage (EVD) catheter inserted into the brain ventricles and connected to an external pressure transducer and drainage system. For non-invasive ICP assessment, patients needed to have a stable ICP value (< 10% variation) for at least 30 min and to not require specific ICP-driven therapies, suctioning, or other physical interventions. Concomitant therapies were not modified during the measurements.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^117ExWWS]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To identify different sub-components of pupil dilation, we averaged all of the pupil samples across the time-window of the tone-evoked pupil dilations (i.e. onset of tone plus three seconds; see Fig. 5a) across participants and experiments. Importantly, the PCA was completely data-driven and agnostic to condition (i.e. boundary versus same-context tones). The PCA revealed four principal components that accounted for significant variance in tone-evoked pupil dilations (Fig. 5c). The temporal features of these components, including their latencies-to-peak and the amount of variance they accounted for, were as follows: (1) a late component (2424 ms; 76.09% variance); (2) an intermediate component (1316 ms; 16.35% variance); (3) a slowly decreasing component (308 ms; 3.01% variance); and (4) an early peaking component (800 ms; 2.66% variance). These pupil components were highly consistent with prior work applying PCA to pupil data, including a biphasic response that may signify separable contributions of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems to pupil size –.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^116hR51R]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Pupil dilation analysis

Tone-evoked pupil dilations were compared for two events of interest: the boundary tone (i.e. tone switch after the eighth item in an event) and the same-context, or repeated, tones (i.e. the seven subsequent tones that remained stable within an event). To measure pupil dilation responses, average pupil diameter was measured from 1 to 2 s after cue onset when the tone-evoked pupil response was most apparent (Fig. 5a). The average pupil size during this time-window was then baseline-normed by subtracting the average pupil size during the 500 ms window prior to tone onset. To examine the influence of event boundaries on pupil dilation, we performed two-tailed paired t -tests comparing average pupil dilation responses between the boundary (i.e. tone switched) and same-context (i.e. tone repeated) trials.

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2J with MPZ thr124Met mutation: clinico-electrophysiological and MRI study of a family [^1124PsaF]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to describe clinico-electrophysiological features and lower limb muscle MRI findings in a CMT2J pedigree due to MPZ Thr124Met mutation. We examined the proband, aged 56 years, and her affected daughter and son, aged 30 and 29 years. Disease severity in terms of ability to walk and run was established using a nine-point functional disability scale (FDS). We administered the CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS) based on patient's symptoms, neurologic examination and neurophysiologic testing. All three patients had non-symptomatic Adie's pupil. The proband and her son presented with late-onset lower limb sensorimotor neuropathy and pes cavus; the proband's daughter had no signs of polyneuropathy. FDS score was 4 in the proband, 2 in her son, and 0 (normal) in her daughter. In both symptomatic patients, electrophysiological study showed a pattern of length-dependent axonal neuropathy mainly involving lower limb nerves; this was normal in the other patient. CMTNS was 18 in the proband, 12 in her son, and 0 (normal) in her daughter. MRI of foot and leg musculature was normal in the proband's daughter, whereas the other two patients showed massive fatty atrophy of intrinsic foot musculature, extensive and diffuse fatty atrophy of leg muscles in the proband, and mild distally accentuated fatty infiltration of calf muscles in her son. Muscle edema, detected only in the proband's son, was present in 7 out of 22 (33%) of visualized leg muscles, whereas contrast enhancement occurred in 6 of them. The reported mutation may manifest with either isolated Adie's pupil or pupil abnormalities with late-onset sensorimotor length-dependent axonal polyneuropathy, though the presence of pes cavus might indicate an earlier onset. MRI examination helps to delineate an accurate extent of muscle involvement in the disease.

### Combination low-dose pilocarpine / diclofenac sodium and pilocarpine alone for presbyopia: results of a randomized phase 2b clinical trial [^112KPDiJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The initial choice to use a 0.2% concentration in phase 2a studies was based on a gradual increase from the lower pilocarpine concentration (0.1%) that is known to induce miosis. Other concentrations of pilocarpine have been effective in treating dilated pupils after cataract surgery and Adie's pupil, and other systemic conditions. This stepwise approach determined the selection to use 0.2% and 0.4% concentrations in this dose range finding Phase 2b study.

The results from this phase 2b study demonstrated that 0.4% pilocarpine HCl groups (CSF-1 and CSF-1-FDC) met the primary efficacy endpoint of ≥ 3-line gain in DCNVA 1 hour post-treatment on day 15, while the 0.2% pilocarpine HCl groups (Pilo 0.2% and Pilo 0.2%-FDC) on day 8 did not. The results also showed a higher percentage of participants achieving ≥ 3-line improvement from baseline in DCNVA in the CSF-1 and CSF-1-FDC groups compared to the Control group up to 2-hours post-treatment and at 8 hours post-treatment on day 15. Results of the secondary endpoint of ≥ 2-line gain from baseline showed CSF-1 and CSF-1-FDC demonstrated superiority over Pilo 0.2% and Pilo 0.2%-FDC up to 8 hours and 6 hours, respectively. The results of the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary efficacy endpoints are an indication that 0.4% pilocarpine HCl is the minimum concentration needed to achieve ≥ 3-line and ≥ 2-line gain from baseline, which are improvements that are considered clinically significant and clinically meaningful for presbyopes. These results also informed the study design of the two Phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of CSF-1.

### Pharmacologic anisocoria due to nebulized ipratropium bromide: a diagnostic challenge [^117Bi6Zd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Anisocoria may be physiological or seen in fatal conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Newly developing anisocoria may cause confusion and diagnostic difficulty in the emergency department (ED). A 35-year-old female was admitted to the ED with an asthma attack and dyspnea. On examination, the patient was observed to have bilateral rhonchi and was treated with nebulized albuterol (salbutamol) and ipratropium bromide. After the treatment, the dyspnea improved, and mydriasis developed in the left eye (left pupil diameter 9 mm, right 4 mm). An examination revealed that the left pupil was dilated and unreactive to light, but there was no neurological finding. Afterwards, the patient reported that, during the treatment, some aerosol had leaked from the left side of the mask and may have come into contact with her left eye. Given this information, a pilocarpine test was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with pharmacologic anisocoria. The pupil returned to normal within 24 h. Ipratropium bromide is a drug frequently used in patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea. During treatment, nebulized ipratropium may leak from the edge of the facial mask into the ipsilateral eye and may cause mydriasis. A pilocarpine test can be used to differentiate pharmacological anisocoria from other causes, such as third nerve palsy and Adie's pupil. Through the awareness of emergency physicians and the use of the pilocarpine test, a diagnosis can be made without engaging in time-consuming and costly analyses. In addition, this complication can be prevented using masks that better fit the face, as well as protective goggles or eye patches, during treatment.

### Quantitative pupillometry: clinical applications for the internist [^113xqu59]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

From the time of Galen, examination of the pupillary light reflex has been a standard of care across the continuum of health care. The growing body of evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of quantitative pupillometry over subjective examination with flashlight or penlight. At current time, pupillometers have become standard of care in many hospitals across 6 continents. This review paper provides an overview and rationale for pupillometer use and highlights literature supporting pupillometer-derived measures of the pupillary light reflex in both neurological and non-neurological patients across the health care continuum.

### The pupillary light-off reflex in acute disorders of consciousness [^113Z6yxx]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Why might the pupillary light-off reflex provide more information than just measuring pupil size in the dark? When light is turned off, the pupil dilates quickly, but it does not reach maximum size until about 50–60 s after darkness. So, when the lights in the patient room are turned out and we go to study the patient, the time is variable, and the size of the pupil when recording the NPi depends on the amount of time that elapses. The light-off reflex is more precise because the measurement starts with a known, stronger, and longer lasting light intensity and each measurement is carefully timed (7 s of "light-off"). This provides a more precise measurement that can be trended over time and thus may follow the degree of consciousness more precisely. Indeed, while the NPi was unable to show a difference between the low-responsive patients and healthy controls, the pupillary light-off reflex did show this difference. Furthermore, among the 25 clinically unresponsive patients, only three had preserved pupillary light-off reflexes bilaterally and four unilaterally, all of whom had preserved light reflexes. Automated pupillometry assessing the pupillary light-off reflex also appears to distinguish between clinically unresponsive and low-responsive patients with better precision than some other technological approaches that require much greater computational expertise like, for example, arterial spin labeling MRI evaluating cerebral blood flow measurements.

Of the six unresponsive patients with a pupillary light-off reflex who could be followed up, five regained clinical awareness. Interestingly, it has been argued that sympathetic pupillary innervation requires consciousness to be preserved to at least some degree, and the proportion of clinically unresponsive patients with a preserved pupillary light-off reflex is of the same order of magnitude as the proportion of unresponsive patients with covert consciousness (15–25%). In future studies it will be interesting to investigate whether the pupillary light-off reflex could be a sign of covert consciousness and help to identify clinical trajectories after brain injury.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^115UipVj]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Evaluation of a unilateral mydriasis can be a diagnostic challenge and is considered a neurological emergency. Differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accident, oculomotor nerve palsy, Adie tonic pupil, previous trauma/eye surgery, cerebral aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, topical/systemic drug-induced mydriasis or exposure to plant toxins. Through the patient's history, physical examination and thorough investigation, these diagnoses were excluded as they would present with other neurological symptoms.

### Abnormal pupillary activity in a brainstem-dead patient [^11696Kki]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

The pupils in brainstem-dead patients are classically fixed and dilated. We present a case of a brainstem-dead patient whose pupils displayed persistent asynchronous pupillary constriction and dilatation independent of external physical stimuli. Central causes for the phenomenon were excluded leaving an unexplained peripheral cause as the most likely explanation. Early recognition of this phenomenon prevents delay in the diagnosis of brainstem death, lessening to some extent the distress for the family, and facilitating earlier organ donation and allowing the better use of resources.

### Neuro-ophthalmologic and electroretinographic findings in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (formerly Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) [^111YQwjL]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

The onset of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) occurs in the first and second decade of life and a pigmentary retinal degeneration is a feature of the disorder. Since the neuro-ophthalmologic and electroretinographic (ERG) features have never been well delineated, we describe them in 16 patients with PKAN.

Design

Observational case series.

Methods

Sixteen patients with genetic and neuroimaging-confirmed PKAN were examined. Ten underwent neuro-ophthalmologic examination and all had ERGs.

Results

Of the 10 who underwent neuro-ophthalmologic examination, all showed saccadic pursuits and eight showed hypometric or slowed vertical saccades. Seven of eight had inability to suppress the vestibulo-ocular reflex; two patients could not cooperate. Two had square wave jerks and four had poor convergence. Vertical optokinetic responses were abnormal in five, and two patients had blepharospasm. Eight patients had sectoral iris paralysis and partial loss of the pupillary ruff consistent with Adie's pupils in both eyes. Only four of 10 examined patients showed a pigmentary retinopathy, but 11 of 16 had abnormal ERGs ranging from mild cone abnormalities to severe rod-cone dysfunction. No patient had optic atrophy. The PANK2 mutations of all of the patients were heterogeneous.

Conclusions

Adie's-like pupils, abnormal vertical saccades, and saccadic pursuits were very common. These findings suggest that mid-brain degeneration occurs in PKAN more frequently than previously thought. ERG abnormalities were present in approximately 70% and no patient had optic atrophy. Although genotype-ocular phenotype correlations could not be established, allelic differences probably contributed to the variable clinical expression of retinopathy and other clinical characteristics in these patients.

Eye tracking

Thirteen patients underwent eye-tracking analysis and the results were interpretable for nine and eight of them under face and object conditions respectively. The results per patient are shown in Fig. 1. For each condition the mean time spent exploring was measured for all participants ((mean ± SD) Face 3.34 s ± 0.18; Object 3.10 s ± 0.25). One-sample Student t -tests (T) were applied to analyse standardized data (z -scores), showing that this time did not differ between each patient and the expected norm, either for age, face (t = − 2.23; df = 8; p = ns) or object (t = − 1.30; df = 7; p = ns) conditions.

Fig. 1
Individual results for pupil dilation measurements.

Pupil dilation in standard deviation by age (SDA) is presented for each patient in face and object conditions. Patient results are colour coded as follows: Red for criteria exceeding cut-off scores for both ADI-R and ADOS-2; yellow when meeting only ADI-R criteria and blue when criteria do not exceed both cut-off scores

Changes in pupil size when the stimuli were faces ((mean ± SD) − 0.300 ± 0.329) were in the norm for age (t = 1.30; df = 8; p = ns). Pupil sizes observed when the stimuli were objects ((mean ± SD) − 0.309 ± 0.320) were greater (t = 4.70; df = 7; p = 0.002), although they remained within the limits of 2SD.

### The value of pupillary dilation in pre-emptive analgesia: is there more to this than meets the eye? [^113EsNc6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The pupillary dilatation reflex may present an objective method of predicting whether sedated patients require additional analgesia for painful procedures. Behavioural pain assessment tools identify pain only once it has occurred and are unable to guide pre-emptive management. The pupillary dilatation reflex response to a tetanic stimulus has been utilised to assess analgesic requirements in patients under anaesthesia and for those with postoperative pain. This tool appears promising to assess pain in the critically ill; however, a number of questions remain unanswered regarding the influence of sedation on this response. These questions require further exploration before the pupillary dilatation reflex can be widely adopted into clinical practice.

### Unilateral mydriasis in a child with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus: a diagnostic dilemma [^115LW663]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Either dilatation or constriction of only one pupil results in anisocoria. Normally pupils dilate in the dark and constrict in bright light. When anisocoria becomes prominent in the dark, it indicates that the small pupil is abnormal and hence the problem is with the sympathetic pathway. Conversely, if anisocoria becomes prominent in light, it indicates that the dilated pupil is abnormal and hence the problem is with the parasympathetic pathway. Our index child had a fixed dilated pupil in the left eye, which was more prominent in bright light, indicating parasympathetic involvement.

Ipratropium bromide inhalers or nebulisers are crucial for the management of viral-induced wheeze/asthma and are delivered using spacer device or face mask. Ipratropium bromide has antimuscarinic properties and leakage from ill-fitting face masks can be absorbed by the cornea and conjunctiva. Older preparations containing benzalkonium chloride preservative increased the permeability of the cornea. Once the drug reaches cornea, it acts like atropine and produces a parasympatholytic effect. It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in paralysis of sphincter pupillae and inhibits the ciliary muscles. This leads to mydriasis, a fixed dilated pupil, and when affected on one side leads to anisocoria. Rarely delays in diagnosis of this cause have resulted in angle-closure glaucoma. Pilocarpine test using 0.1% and 1% drops on the eye produces pupillary constriction in Adie's pupil and oculomotor palsy, respectively, through muscarinic action. However, pilocarpine fails to reverse pupillary dilatation in case of pharmacological mydriasis where muscarinic receptors are already saturated with antimuscarinic agent.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^113kNFt4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In contrast to the temporal distance ratings, we found that boundary-related impairments in an objective memory measure, temporal order memory, were associated with engagement of a different pupil component that peaked around the time of tone onset and slowly decreased thereafter. We interpret this slowly decreasing pupil dilation component (#3 in the current study) as signifying anticipatory arousal, given evidence that it is triggered in preparation of impending responses. When we accounted for the combined pupil response to both the onsets of the tones and their subsequent images (i.e. the 3 s window PCA), we found more evidence of this slowly decreasing component during event boundaries compared to same-context trials. This result suggests that the initial information presented after a boundary may also be processed differently than same-context information, perhaps because it is the first piece of information that becomes bound to a novel context (i.e. it may define or become an important part of a new event model). In our experiments, all events were of the same length, and there was an equal amount of time between each item in the sequences. The anticipatory pupil response may thereby reflect participantsʼ ability to predict when an impending tone switch and image would occur. From this perspective, predictable changes in the environment could be used to proactively allocate ongoing experiences into contextually appropriate memory representations. Indeed, individuals can still perceive discrete events even when the transition between them is predictable. This pupil–memory relationship was only observed in the experiment with a larger number of intervening items between the to-be-tested item pairs (Experiment 3), suggesting that this mechanism may have a more significant ripple effect on information encountered farther away in time from the boundary.

### Etiological distribution of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy: analysis of 633 patients and literature review [^1121gJh7]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Subjects

This study was based on 672 consecutive patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea, from 2003 to 2020 (Figure 1). The data on diagnoses and clinical features were acquired using electronic medical records. The search terms adopted for screening of oculomotor nerve palsy on the electronic medical records included diplopia, strabismus, oculomotor nerve palsy, third cranial nerve palsy, oculomotor nerve aplasia, third cranial nerve aplasia, injury of oculomotor nerve and injury of third cranial nerve.

FIGURE 1
The flow diagram for subjects of the study.

The diagnosis of oculomotor palsy was based on the weakness of the extraocular muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve with or without a pupillary involvement. Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy was diagnosed when the patients had no other neurological symptoms and signs except headache or periorbital pain associated with the diplopia. Particular attention was paid to exclude disorders that may mimic oculomotor nerve palsy, such as exotropia, blepharoptosis, congenital ptosis, anisocoria of other causes (e.g. physiological anisocoria, Horner's syndrome, Adie's tonic pupil), thyroid‐associated orbitopathy, orbital wall fracture, orbital myositis, myasthenia gravis, childhood exotropia, congenital exotropia and Duane syndrome. The investigation was subjected to the clinical features and suspected etiology of isolated oculomotor nerve palsy even though most patients had complete blood counts with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, routine chemistry and serology for inflammation (C‐reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti‐double‐stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) in addition to routine physical and neuro‐ophthalmological examination. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol included T1‐ and T2‐weighted gradient echo axial imaging, T1‐weighted sagittal imaging and gadolinium‐enhanced T1‐axial imaging with or without diffusion‐weighted MRI, high‐resolution cranial nerve imaging of the brainstem and orbit, and MR angiography.

Standard protocol approvals and patient consents

All experiments followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB No. B‐2308‐844‐103). All patients gave an informed and written consent to participate in this study.

### Probing infants' sensitivity to pupil size when viewing eyes [^116Zcihz]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitive responding to eye cues plays a key role in human social interactions. Pupil size provides subtle cues regarding a social interaction partner's arousal states. The current study assessed infants' sensitivity to and preference for differences in pupil size. Specifically, we examined White 14-month-old infants' pupillary responses when viewing own-race and other-race (Asian) eyes with dilating, constricting, and static medium-sized pupils. Our results show that, independent of race, infants' pupils dilated more when viewing eyes with dynamically changing (dilating and constricting) pupils than when viewing eyes with non-changing, static, and medium-sized pupils. We also measured infants' looking preferences, showing that, independent of race, infants preferentially attended to eyes with dilated pupils. Moreover, our results show that infants orient more quickly to pupillary changes in own-race eyes than in other-race eyes. These findings demonstrate that infants detect, but do not mimic, changes in pupil size in others and show a preference for eyes with dilated pupils.

### Rational regulation of learning dynamics by pupil-linked arousal systems [^113xbVqH]. Nature Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

The ability to make inferences about the current state of a dynamic process requires ongoing assessments of the stability and reliability of data generated by that process. We found that these assessments, as defined by a normative model, were reflected in nonluminance-mediated changes in pupil diameter of human subjects performing a predictive-inference task. Brief changes in pupil diameter reflected assessed instabilities in a process that generated noisy data. Baseline pupil diameter reflected the reliability with which recent data indicate the current state of the data-generating process and individual differences in expectations about the rate of instabilities. Together these pupil metrics predicted the influence of new data on subsequent inferences. Moreover, a task- and luminance-independent manipulation of pupil diameter predictably altered the influence of new data. Thus, pupil-linked arousal systems can help to regulate the influence of incoming data on existing beliefs in a dynamic environment.

### Ocular and systemic complications of COVID-19: impact on patients and healthcare [^1144Uryn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Posterior Segment Findings

Histopathologic specimens from the retinas of deceased patients with COVID-19 have found presumed SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform, inner nuclear, outer plexiform, outer nuclear layer, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid. A literature review found that COVID-19 was associated with an 8.86-fold risk of retinal vascular microvasculopathy, including retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, infarcts at the internal plexus, and thinner ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer. More severe systemic disease was associated with lower vascular density on OCT angiography (OCTA). Other potential posterior segment findings included possible hyperreflective lesions in the inner and outer retina and vitreous, uveitis-like multifocal evanescent white dot syndrome, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, intraretinal hemorrhages, and inflammatory multifocal chorioretinitis with Adie's pupil. These changes may reflect the underlying systemic hypercoagulable, ischemic, inflammatory, and/or hypertensive state of the patient or direct invasion of the virus.,

Neuro-Ophthalmic Findings

Up to 21% of patients with COVID-19 may have systemic neurologic signs, and 0.4% have cranial nerve impairment. Potential neuro-ophthalmic associations with COVID-19 include optic neuritis and myelitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Miller-Fisher syndrome, and cranial neuropathies like CNIII or CNVI palsies. These neurologic conditions may be related to hypoxia, ischemia, and/or inflammation. An immunologic response to peripheral nerve antigens may result in demyelination and nerve injury. A systemic review found a higher prevalence of Guillain-Barre syndrome in patients with COVID-19 than in the general population (0.15% vs 0.02%, respectively), which was believed to be due to an immune-mediated response rather than a direct viral infection.

Given the constellation of clinical findings in the setting of a large left upper lung lobe tumor, the patient was diagnosed with Harlequin sign associated with Horner syndrome secondary to a mass effect with T1 and T2 nerve impingement. The normal reflexes and light-reactive pupils on physical examination help rule out other dysautonomic conditions such as Adie and Ross syndrome. Following the diagnosis, the patient continued radiation treatment for her underlying malignancy, leading to subsequent improvement in her facial flushing.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^116mWf8A]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Of course, another possibility is that our results signify the contributions of multiple neuromodulatory systems to episodic memory organization. For instance, acetylcholine (ACh) release also co-occurs with pupil dilationand regulates pupil size exclusively via parasympathetic nervous system pathways. Given that we found a strong association between a parasympathetic-related feature of pupil dilation (the early-peaking component) and temporal distance ratings, one possibility is that ACh may specifically modulate subjective representations of time. Like NE, ACh also influences hippocampal-encoding processes, particularly those that support the separation of experience into distinct memories. Future work could investigate these neuromodulatory mechanisms using a combination of fMRI, eye-tracking, and pharmacology.

The present findings have important implications for improving learning in both educational settings and everyday life. For instance, the ability to perceive and segment events is associated with enhanced memory for those events, even up to one month later –. The boundary-related impairments in temporal order memory we report might thereby be beneficial for structuring event memories in ways that improve long-term recall. This memory-structuring process seems to be driven, in part, by individuals anticipating and responding to meaningful contextual changes in the environment, as signaled by the activation of specific sub-components of pupil dilation. Our work highlights that arousal fluctuations play an important role in signaling and/or supporting this organizational process, and suggests that manipulating the structure of learning with arousing context shifts may be especially effective for enhancing long-term memory in the classroom and beyond.

### Pupil fluctuations track rapid changes in adrenergic and cholinergic activity in cortex [^1174V1Di]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Rapid variations in cortical state during wakefulness have a strong influence on neural and behavioural responses and are tightly coupled to changes in pupil size across species. However, the physiological processes linking cortical state and pupil variations are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that these rapid variations, during both quiet waking and locomotion, are highly correlated with fluctuations in the activity of corticopetal noradrenergic and cholinergic projections. Rapid dilations of the pupil are tightly associated with phasic activity in noradrenergic axons, whereas longer-lasting dilations of the pupil, such as during locomotion, are accompanied by sustained activity in cholinergic axons. Thus, the pupil can be used to sensitively track the activity in multiple neuromodulatory transmitter systems as they control the state of the waking brain.

### Unilateral transient mydriasis and ptosis after botulinum toxin injection for a cosmetic procedure [^11178JzS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Botulinum neurotoxins inhibit the release of acetylcholine and act primarily at the peripheral cholinergic synapses. These agents act at the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle, causing transient muscle paresis. However, botulinum toxins also inhibit the release of acetylcholine at the sympathetic ganglia and at the preganglionic and postganglionic nerve terminals in the parasympathetic nervous system. People who are systemically poisoned with botulinum toxins characteristically have fixed mid-dilated pupils due to paralysis of the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to the iris. Botulinum toxins could therefore cause pupil dilatation by uptake into the parasympathetic neurons at the level of the ciliary ganglion or the parasympathetic neuromuscular junctions in the sphincter pupillae of the iris. It has been shown in animal studies that botulinum toxin injected intracamerally or near the ciliary ganglion causes mydriasis. Persistent mydriasis has been reported after medial rectus muscle injection of botulinum toxin for esotropia in a child.

There are no reports in the literature on reversible mydriasis secondary to cosmetic procedures. We believe that botulinum toxin had been administered at a high dose in our patient, and that the cumulative BTX-A dose to the right eye was more than that to the left eye.

Transient mydriasis has been observed with experimental retrobulbar botulinum toxin injection at doses of 1.5 and 2.5 ng in rats, with the mydriasis resolving within 12 weeks. In a rabbit model, intravitreal injection of 1.25 to 25 units caused mydriasis lasting for 3 weeks. Five cases of transient mydriasis have been reported in humans. In these five cases, after botulinum toxin injection to extraocular muscles, mostly the lateral rectus muscles, transient mydriasis was shown with Adie's pupils. The most likely suggested cause was injury to the ciliary ganglion, resulting in weakened accommodation. None of the cases, however, showed mydriasis persisting for more than a few weeks.

### Neurologist versus machine: is the pupillometer better than the naked eye in detecting pupillary reactivity [^112kfoCL]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A 62-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury developed postsurgical anisocoria in which there was a discrepancy between pupillometer and manual testing.

Methods

Case report.

Results

The patient's larger pupil was read as unreactive by the pupillometer but constricted 1 mm over 7–9 s of continuous light stimulation.

Conclusions

While pupillometry assessment is a valuable adjunct to the manual pupillary assessment, this case demonstrates that nonreactive pupils read on the pupillometer should be confirmed with the manual examination because it can miss very slowly reacting pupils.

### Basics, benefits, and pitfalls of pupillometers assessing visual function [^116KbwAK]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Numerous commercially and non-commercially available pupillometers are nowadays able to assess various biological functions in humans, by evaluating pupils' dynamics in response to specific stimuli. However, the use of pupillometers for ophthalmic afferent evaluations (i.e., photoreceptoral responses) in real-world settings is relatively limited. Recent scientific and technological advances, coupled with artificial intelligence methods have improved the performance of such devices to objectively detect, quantify, and classify functional disturbances of the retina and the optic nerve. This review aims to summarize the scientific principles, indications, outcomes, and current limitations of pupillometry used for evaluation of afferent pathways in ophthalmic clinical settings.

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^112Z8hKT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Consumption of cannabis is increasing for both recreational and medical use. As a consequence, the physical and mental effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-THC or THC), the definition of "acting under the influence", and the impact of THC consumption on liability and driving ability are a matter of debate. Many countries or states have established limits of THC serum concentrations or are debating such limits. Such discussions are substantiated by statistics of road traffic accidents, investigations regarding driving performance under the influence of THC, and studies on the clinical effects of THC.

In terms of clinical effects, neurocognitive performance under the influence of the same amount of THC has been reported as significantly worse in occasional compared to heavy or regular cannabis users. Hence, the effects of THC likely not only depend on the mode and quantity, but also on the frequency of consumption. It might therefore be sensible to institute a more complex approach to the assessment of THC consumption that relies not only on serum concentrations, but also on an objective assessment of physical and mental effects and actual impairment from THC consumption. Such assessment of impairment could include both mental and somatic effects of THC, including the effects of THC on the eyes.

Pupil examination — "Both pupils should be equal, round, and equally reactive when light is directed toward either eye". "Asymmetric responses to light may indicate visual system dysfunction". Anisocoria thresholds are specified: "Asymmetry of pupil shape or difference in diameter greater than 1 mm can often be attributable to an ocular injury or disease or to a neurologic disorder", whereas "Differences in pupil size less than 1 mm can occur normally and are generally benign unless associated with ptosis or an ocular motility deficit".

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^114jAuqF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that THC significantly impacts the function of the pupil, reducing the relative amplitude of pupillary constriction, pupil diameter, constriction time and contraction amplitude and increasing latency. This means that THC results in a slower and less pronounced reaction of the pupil to light. These data provide evidence that pupillography, a very simple and rapidly applicable method, is able to objectively detect the effects of THC on the human eye. This can substantiate the ongoing discussions about liability following THC consumption, which is of interest to the scientific community, but also to the legislation, jurisdiction and the wider public community.

### Saccade, pupil, and blink responses in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder [^116n2reM]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

A major challenge in Parkinson's disease (PD) research is the discovery of a disease‐modifying therapy. This therapy would be most effective during prodromal PD. To successfully prove such a therapy effective, biomarkers for prodromal PD must be identified. Such biomarkers should: (1) be related to the disease process and easily measurable; (2) reflect progression of prodromal PD; and (3) be responsive to therapy. Here, we investigate whether saccade, pupil, and blink behavior can provide suitable biomarkers. To test this hypothesis, we chose patients with the parasomnia "isolated REM (rapid eye movement) Sleep Behavior Disorder" (RBD).RBD is characterized by the loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep accompanied by dream enactment. The annual rate of phenoconversion of RBD to PD or another alpha‐synucleinopathy disorder (αSYND) is approximately 6% and nearly 80% of RBD individuals will develop an αSYND within 10–15 years. For these reasons, RBD is considered a specific prodromal phenotype for PD, and suitable for biomarker research.

PD is clinically diagnosed using cardinal motor symptoms, namely bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and resting tremor. These symptoms are caused, at least in part, by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). An alternative is to objectively investigate oculomotor system abnormalities. Video‐based eye‐tracking provides a simple, non‐invasive, and effective way to assess brain function related to oculomotion, pupillary function, and blink rate. Measuring saccade, pupil, and blink behavior during sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks allows for the assessment of multiple brain circuits. The interleaved pro‐ and anti‐saccade task (IPAST) pseudo‐randomly combines pro‐saccade (look towards a peripheral stimulus) and anti‐saccade (look in the opposite direction of peripheral stimulus) trials, which scrutinize areas that are implicated in PD, such as the basal ganglia (BG). This task is also associated with pupil size changes related to locus coeruleus (LC) function.PD patients have specific deficits: increase in direction errors and slowed saccadic reaction time (SRT) during anti‐saccade trials, hypometric amplitudes during the pro‐saccade trials, and dampened pupil constriction and dilation. The combination of saccade, pupil, and blink behavior have not yet been systematically studied in prodromal PD.

### The pupillary light-off reflex in acute disorders of consciousness [^111nh577]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pupillary Light-Off and Pupillary Light Reflexes Indices

Data regarding the pupillary light-off reflex are summarized in Table 2. During the pupillary light-off reflex, the absolute and relative increase in pupillary diameter was smallest in unresponsive patients (mean ± SD: 0.5 mm ± 0.6 mm or 20% ± 21%), followed by low-responsive patients (1.1 mm ± 0.7 mm or 47% ± 26%) and healthy controls (1.8 mm ± 0.5 mm or 67% ± 17.4%). This difference in pupillary dilation was significant across the groups (F [2, 97] = 43.1, p < 0.001). Specifically, the increase in pupillary diameter was smaller in unresponsive patients compared to low-responsive patients (mean difference between groups, M = −20, p < 0.001) and healthy controls (M = −47, p < 0.001) and smaller in low-responsive patients compared with healthy controls (M = −27, p < 0.001). Figures 2 a and 3 a provide details. Significant differences in dilation velocity were observed for the left (but not the right) pupil across groups (F [2, 86] = 6, p = 0.004), with unresponsive patients showing slower dilation velocity compared to healthy controls (M = −1.1, p = 0.006). There were no differences in latency to dilation across any groups.

### Pupil wizard: an app to enhance knowledge of pupillary abnormalities [^114svizv]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The pupils serve as a window to the brain, as their responses provide valuable insights into brain function, neurological integrity, and autonomic nervous system activity. The ability to accurately identify pupillary findings is essential in clinical practice; some findings, such as physiological anisocoria, are entirely harmless, whereas others, such as mydriasis in compressive third-nerve palsy, may indicate life-threatening conditions that require immediate management.

A pedagogical challenge in teaching and learning of pupillary disorders is their highly dynamic nature, with varying reactions to light stimuli, near focus, and pharmacological agents. There are several comprehensive articles on diagnosing pupillary abnormalities, but passively learning pupil testing through static illustrations and text remains challenging. Moreover, many pupillary disorders are relatively uncommon (for instance, even a fully trained physician may never have encountered a case of Argyll Robertson pupil), making it difficult to gain broad clinical experience within a student semester or residency. An alternative is to watch educational videos, but this remains a passive learning process. In contrast, there is a general support in the literature for active learning in medical education, as it is effective in engaging students, among other benefits.

As neuro-ophthalmology educators, we have sought ways to improve the teaching of pupil-related disorder, focusing on incorporating their dynamic aspects and active learning. Our solution is an app for smartphone and tablet devices. The app, Pupil Wizard, provides a digital textbook featuring a dynamic presentation of the key pupillary abnormalities. It allows the users to interact with a digital patient and explore how each condition responds to direct and indirect light stimuli, near focus, and changes in ambient light (Fig. 1). Moreover, the users can test their knowledge in quiz mode, where random pupillary abnormalities must be correctly identified and multiple-choice questions about them answered.

Fig. 1
The figure shows a screenshot of the Eye Wizard app.

The symbols represent the active elements on the screen: the penlights test the pupillary light reflexes, the finger tests the accommodation-convergence reflex, the light bulb toggles the ambient light, and the information symbol provides details about the condition.

We hope Pupil Wizard will provide a valuable addition to traditional teaching of pupil testing. The app is now available on App Store (for iOS devices) and Google Play (for Android devices) and can be downloaded free of charge.

### Pure sensory neuropathy in primary Sjögren's syndrome. longterm prospective followup and review of the literature [^114wCCfS]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the clinical course, response to therapy, and longterm outcome of pure sensory neuropathy (PSN) in a series of patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) followed prospectively in our referral centers.

Methods

We studied 15 patients (13 women, 2 men) with primary SS and PSN. All patients fulfilled 4 or more of the European diagnostic criteria.

Results

At diagnosis of PSN, clinical manifestations included numbness and paresthesias (11 patients), trigeminal neuropathy (6 patients), and Adie's pupil syndrome (4 patients). In 7 patients, PSN was diagnosed prior to SS, in 5 the diagnoses were made simultaneously, and in the remaining 3 patients PSN was diagnosed after the appearance of SS symptomatology. The mean duration of the prospective PSN followup was 10 years (range 1–20). The progression of PSN was acute in 1 patient (producing severe dysfunction in less than 1 month), subacute in 3 patients, and in the remaining 11, the symptoms progressed slowly over the ensuing years to other extremities. Patients were treated with corticosteroids (n = 13), cyclophosphamide (n = 4), and intravenous immunoglobulins (n = 1), and 2 patients received no treatment. In spite of treatment, most patients showed an indolent and insidious longterm PSN course.

Conclusion

We found 3 differentiated clinical courses of the PSN in patients with primary SS: subacute progression in less than 1 month (7%), late acceleration of PSN 2–4 years after an initial indolent onset (20%), and a very longterm insidious, chronic evolution (73%). Prospective analysis of the longterm course of PSN shows a chronic and insidious evolution in most patients with PSN and SS, with a poor response to treatment, although stabilization of symptomatology for long periods is often observed.

### Visual performance and subjective outcomes with enhanced monofocal intraocular lens implantation targeted for emmetropia or modest monovision [^114HvZqG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Patients

This was a prospective interventional comparative study carried out at the Department of Ophthalmology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore between 1 st December 2021 and 31 st March 2023. The study was approved by the National Healthcare Group Institutional Review Board of Singapore (2021/00925) and followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were given a detailed explanation of the study and provided written informed consent to undergo cataract surgery and tests with inclusion of their data for research purposes.

Patients were included if they had bilateral visually significant cataracts requiring surgery, aged ≥ 21 years to 90 years old, with an expected best corrected visual acuity of 6/9 or better after cataract surgery, calculated IOL power within range of +10 D to +30 D, corneal astigmatism of ≤ 1.50 D, and were willing to undergo additional investigations (pupillometry, defocus measurements and questionnaire). Screening of corneal astigmatism was performed with the Nidek ARK-1 (Nidek Co. Ltd. Gamagori, Japan). Exclusion criteria included history of ocular trauma, prior incisional or laser refractive surgery or intraocular surgery, irregular corneal astigmatism, corneal decompensation or endothelial insufficiency (cell count < 1500/mm 2), pseudoexfoliation, zonulopathy, Adie's pupil or tonic pupil, glaucoma, strabismus, amblyopia, vitreoretinal or macular diseases (eg exudative age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy), neuro-ophthalmic diseases (eg optic neuropathy), or a history of uveitis.

The patients were divided into two groups: a bilateral emmetropia group and a modest monovision group. Patients in the first group had target refraction of emmetropia for both eyes, while the latter group had target refraction of emmetropia for the first eye and −1.50 D for the second eye. The eye which had worse visual acuity was operated first. The patients were enrolled into each group based on their expressed visual needs after surgery.

### Novel aspects of Sjögren's syndrome in 2012 [^112qpoqC]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients with pSS develop autoimmune thyroiditis (primarily Hashimoto thyroiditis and to a lesser extent, Graves' disease) and more than 50% of them have subclinical hypothyroidism. Autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and thyroglobulin (anti-TG) can be used as primary indicators of patients who are prone to developing thyroid disease in the future.

The prevalence of neurological manifestations in pSS varies between 2% to 60% with pure or predominantly sensory polyneuropathies being the most common manifestations (for example, sensory ataxic or small fiber sensory painful neuropathy). Sensorimotor polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, autonomic neuropathy (for example, Adie's pupils and orthostatic hypotension), trigeminal and other cranial neuropathies are other manifestations of the involvement of peripheral nervous system (PNS) in pSS. Central nervous system involvement is much less common than PNS involvement, with multiple sclerosis-like changes, seizures, transverse myelitis, aseptic meningitis, optic neuritis, diffuse encephalopathy and dementia as reported manifestations.

### Eyes and the heart: what a clinician should know [^115FX3yK]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The eye is frequently affected by systemic diseases, and modern medical practice has become increasingly specialised and focused on specific organ systems. However, patients often present with multiple system involvement, and it is important for clinicians, including cardiologists, to recognise ocular manifestations that may indicate underlying cardiovascular abnormalities. This review examines the complex interplay between the eye and the cardiovascular system and emphasises the use of conventional and emerging tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to improve diagnosis, management and prognostication of patients.

Ocular examination

Clinical examination is an indispensable aspect of diagnostic workup, and clinicians should continually hone their skills in this area. A thorough cardiovascular examination should include a brief ocular assessment, as it can uncover critical findings that will inform further investigations and management. For cardiologists, a basic eye examination should encompass general inspection, orbit and periorbital inspection, pupils, focused ocular movement assessment and if an ophthalmoscope is available, to examine the fundus. Abnormalities in eyelid position, swelling, redness, eye prominence and skin changes may emerge during close inspection of the eyes and adnexa. A quick assessment of eye movements can also unmask vital signs such as lid lag, diplopia and fatigable ptosis, all of which may indicate underlying systemic conditions. After examination, one may elect to conduct a variety of investigations depending on the presenting issue and respective findings. These are summarised in the online supplemental table 1.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^116sFNwB]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Good Practice Statement 4 — use a multimodal approach and the complete clinical scenario: We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be multimodal, with consideration of the complete clinical scenario, and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). As previously described, an element of uncertainty is inherent with neuroprognostication and therefore a thorough assessment should be performed in every patient; the use of multiple modalities of assessment, such as clinical examination, imaging, and electrophysiological studies, will mitigate the risk of error from a single modality, exemplified by questioning a subjective determination of nonreactive pupils in a patient with a withdrawal motor response, reactive EEG, and normal brain imaging at 72 h.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^1114iPye]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Pupillary examination — procedures and abnormal findings: Pupils should be assessed for size, shape, symmetry, and response to light, and to assess for a difference in pupil size they should be observed in dim light, where a difference of more than 1 millimeter may be clinically significant; the swinging-light test is used to assess for the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect, performed in a darkened room with a penlight shined in the right eye for less than 5 seconds while the child fixes on a distant target and then quickly swung to the other eye, and an abnormal response is pupillary dilation when the light is shined on the eye indicating an afferent pupil defect that is usually a sign of a unilateral problem with the optic nerve or other areas in the anterior visual pathway.

### Pupillary anomaly masquerading as a glaucomatous visual field defect: a case report [^111DXxzF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients are often referred to ophthalmologists with focal visual field defects on routine testing, possibly related to a potential diagnosis of glaucoma. However, examination of the individual patient's ocular characteristics as well as facial characteristics may often reveal a cause of the visual field defect.

Case Presentation

We describe a patient who was found to have a superior visual field defect on routine testing by the optician. Repeat perimetry with pharmacological dilatation of the pupil revealed that the cause of the field defect was related to an eccentric inferiorly displaced pupil, secondary to trauma some years previously.

Discussion

Individual patient characteristics, including both ocular, as well as facial, need to be considered, when interpreting any visual field defect.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^112rbdU4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anisocoria is defined as an inequality in pupil size, and its presence in the absence of ocular and neurologic pathology is known as physiologic anisocoria. Generally, a small difference in pupil diameter in both dim and bright illumination, with normal light response, no dilation lag, and no ptosis, does not warrant concern. The characteristics of normal physiologic anisocoria have been studied previously in attempts to assist eye care professionals in separating benign from pathologic findings.–Historically, pupil gauges and flashlights were used to measure the pupil, but these devices were limited to static estimations of pupil size in shifting light conditions. Over the years, new devices have been developed to help offset these limitations, significantly improving the repeatability of pupil measurement and diagnostic accuracy in the clinic. There is, however, a lack of consensus on the threshold of anisocoria that is considered clinically significant. There is also no consensus on whether anisocoria that disappears under varied lighting conditions is considered physiologic or random pupillary noise. Meyer used a "perceptible" difference in pupil size as a threshold for anisocoria and was among the first to record the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria in a healthy population. Loewenfeld later used a criterion of > 0.4 mm difference in pupil diameter as a threshold for physiologic anisocoria in a healthy population and found the prevalence to be about 20%. Lam was among the first to record the prevalence of physiologic anisocora under varying lighting conditions. He noted that 41% of his subjects exhibited anisocoria > 0.4 mm in at least 1 light setting, while only 3% exhibited anisocoria in every setting.

### Interrater reliability of pupillary assessments [^115RuQCt]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Subjective scoring of pupil reactivity is a fundamental element of the neurological examination for which the pupillometer provides an objective measure.

Methods

This single-blinded observational study examined interrater reliability of pupil exam findings between two practitioners and between practitioners and a pupillometer.

Results

From 2329 paired assessments, the interrater reliability between practitioners was only moderate for pupil size (k = 0.54), shape (k = 0.62), and reactivity (k = 0.40). Only 33.3% of pupils scored as non-reactive by practitioners were scored as non-reactive by pupillometry.

Conclusions

Despite the strong emphasis placed on the traditional pupil examination, especially for patients with a neurological illness, there is limited interrater reliability for subjective scoring of pupillary assessments. Thus, the use of automated pupillometers should be examined as a potential method to increase the reliability of measuring of pupil reactivity.

### Modelling floppy iris syndrome and the impact of pupil size and ring devices on iris displacement [^115NW5C6]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known

Floppy iris syndrome can result in abnormal iris displacement in a buckling configuration (billowing behaviour).
Pupil expansion devices such as the Malyugin ring can restrict floppy iris behaviour.
There are no other mathematical models or simulations of floppy iris syndrome in the literature to demonstrate this effect, or provide a model to test the impact of pharmacological agents.

What this paper adds

We have refined a mathematical model for floppy iris syndrome and provided a computer simulation to demonstrate the potential for iris displacement.
Mechanical pupil expansion devices such as the Malyugin ring are very effective in preventing abnormal iris movement, even when modelling a floppy iris scenario with 40% degradation of its elastic properties.
Altering the parameters for this model provides a proof for the impact of mechanical expansion devices in addressing abnormal iris behaviour in floppy iris syndrome, and can be used to test the impact of other adjuncts such as pharmacological agents.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^112PtHwB]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Pupil dilation temporal PCA

To analyze how event boundaries altered different components of pupil dilation, we performed a temporal PCA by adapting methods described in Johansson et al. Experiments 2 and 3 were conducted in the same behavioral testing room and under the same dimly-lit lighting conditions. Thus, we combined the data from the two eye-tracking experiments to take advantage of additional statistical power to detect different pupil components. This also enabled us to draw comparisons between the same components across the two eye-tracking studies. The PCA was performed using SPSS Version 25.

Average baseline-normed pupil dilation was computed for each of the tone types (boundary and same-context trials). These values were then averaged across participants to reduce the amount of input variables (130 variables; 65 participants with two conditions each) and to control for noisy, spontaneous pupil changes on individual trials. All pupil samples across a 3-s window covering the average time-course of tone-evoked pupil dilation (750 pupil samples in total; see Fig. 5a) served as dependent measures in the PCA. This pupil-sampling time window was selected in order to capture the "boundary-ness" of both the tone switch and the first boundary item (i.e. item in position 1 within an 8-item event).

A Varimax rotation was performed on the components output by the temporal PCA, which were defined based on an eigenvalue equal to or greater than the average value of the original variables. An unrestricted PCA using the covariance matrix with Kaiser normalization and Varimax rotation was used on all components to generate maximal component loadings on one component with minimal overlap with other components. The resulting loadings reflect the correlated, temporally dynamic patterns of pupil dilation elicited by the auditory tones. Factor loadings with eigenvalues > 1 were analyzed in subsequent analyses (Kaiser criterion).

Because the PCA was data-driven and agnostic to condition, we were able to then examine the relative contributions of loading patterns for each pupil component to same-context versus boundary tones. Two-tailed paired t -tests were performed on these loading values to determine how boundaries modulated different temporal characteristics of pupil dilation. In addition, we performed two follow-up PCA's on the pupil data for the boundary and same-context trials, separately. This was done using the same approach as the original analysis with the data collapsed across both conditions.

### Pupillary dynamics as a marker of acute cannabis inhalation [^111pYHqQ]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cannabis use has been found to affect pupil size and pupillary dynamics. Law enforcement may consider ocular changes in their examinations to determine drug impairment and the source, including from cannabis. A limited number of studies have used pupillometer technology to provide an objective measure of pupillary changes associated with cannabis use. The purpose of the study was to examine the sensitivity and specificity of pupil size and dynamics, measured with a pupillometer, associated with recent cannabis inhalation.

Methods

Participants (n = 126) completed a pupillometer assessment, using the NeurOptics PLR-3000 at three times. Of the 126 participants, 95 completed assessments at baseline, and at 40min and 100min following 15min of ad libitum inhalation of self-provided cannabis flower or concentrate products. Thirty-one participants completed the same assessments without using cannabis. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for pupil size and dynamics measures associated with recent cannabis use versus no use, for both post-use time points. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models were used to identify the combination of ocular metrics that were most predictive and parsimonious.

Results

Following cannabis use, the pupillary measure with the highest area under the curve was percent change in pupil size, which decreased after cannabis use, with an area under the curve of 0.73 at 40min and 0.75 at 100min following cannabis use. Considering variables together in a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model did not meaningfully improve prediction over individual measures.

Discussion

Consistent with some prior studies, we did not find that cannabis use was associated with substantial and consistent change in the maximum pupil size (measured in darkness) relative to controls. However, diminished pupil dynamics, such as constriction in response to light and recovery dilation, were more predictive of recent cannabis use, consistent with limited prior studies.

Conclusions

Pupillary dynamics, when measured with an objective test, may contribute to providing an indication of recent cannabis inhalation.

### Variability in pupil size estimation [^114HUHmM]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical estimation of pupil size and reactivity is central to the neurological assessment of patients, particularly those with or at risk of neurological damage. Health care professionals who examine pupils have differing levels of skill and training, yet their recordings are passed along the patient care pathway and can influence care decisions. The aim of this study was to determine if any statistical differences existed in the estimation of pupil size by different groups of health care professionals.

Methods

A total of 102 health care professionals working in the critical care environment were asked to estimate and record the pupil size of a series of 12 artificial eyes with varying pupil diameter and iris colour. All estimations were performed indoors under ambient lighting conditions.

Results

Our results established a statistically significant difference between staff groups in the estimation of pupil size.

Conclusion

The demonstrated variability in pupil size estimation may not be clinically significant. However, it remains desirable to have consistency of measurement throughout the patient care pathway.

### Evaluation of the visual system by the primary care provider following concussion [^111AaquY]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Pupils — Pupillary assessment involves eliciting direct and consensual responses to light on both sides, checking for an afferent pupillary defect, and examining the response to accommodation. The swinging light test is used to evaluate for an afferent pupillary defect: have the patient fixate on an object at least 10 feet away and shine a bright light on one eye from slightly below, then swing the light between eyes; a normal response is that the pupil maintains a similar size, and dilation of one pupil indicates an afferent pupillary defect. The response to accommodation is assessed by alternately looking between the same 10-foot target and a second target 6 inches from the face while illuminating both pupils from below.

### The pupillary light-off reflex in acute disorders of consciousness [^114FiLoR]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that the pupillary light-off reflex is diminished in patients with DoC with acute brain injury, especially in those who are clinically unresponsive, and that this reflex correlates with the levels of consciousness. We have shown that the pupillary light-off reflex may be abolished or abnormal in patients with preserved pupillary light reflexes, thereby potentially adding prognostic information in patients with acute DoC in the ICU.

The Pupillary Light-Off Reflex Compared to the Pupillary Light Reflex in Patients with DoC

Both relaxed and dilated pupillary diameters were smaller in patients with DoC compared to healthy controls, with the lowest increase in pupillary dilation and number of preserved light-off reflexes observed in unresponsive patients, followed by low-responsive patients. Although the pupillary light reflex showed similar patterns, these appeared to be less pronounced than what we found for the pupillary light-off reflex, suggesting that sympathetic input to the pupils is overall more severely compromised than parasympathetic input. While the exact reasons require further investigations, these findings are consistent with previous research: We recently showed that eye drops containing brimonidine, an alpha-2 agonist reducing sympathetic pupillary tone, do not significantly change pupil size in deeply comatose patients, indicating the absence of sympathetic innervation. The present study extends these findings by demonstrating the autonomic nervous system's influence (or lack thereof) on the association of the pupillary light-off reflex with levels of consciousness.

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^111QUHh6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This prospective, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (d9-THC) on the pupillary light reflex and pupil size in volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis.

Methods

With ethics committee approval and written informed consent, healthy cannabis-naïve or abstinent volunteers were included. Fifteen volunteers received an intravenous bolus of d9-THC and four received placebo. Pupillary reaction and pupil size were assessed by pupillography before and for 5 h after drug administration. Primary outcome was relative amplitude. Secondary outcomes were latency, velocity of contraction, constriction time, contraction amplitude, and pupil diameter.

Results

Pupillographic measurements were significantly altered by THC: The relative amplitude was significantly reduced with a global difference between groups (p = 0.001). The relative amplitude significantly declined at 20 min after THC administration (23.5–15.0%), and stayed constant in after placebo (27.5–28.1%). Constriction time was significantly reduced with a significant global time effect (p = 0.002), global group effect (p = 0.001), and global effect of the interaction between group and time (p < 0.001). Contraction amplitude was reduced with a significant global group effect (p < 0.001). Latency and velocity of contraction demonstrated a statistically non-significant increase. Pupil size decreased after THC administration.

Discussion

Pupillography can objectively detect effects of THC on the human eye. In cannabis-naïve or abstinent volunteers THC dampens the pupillary light reflex which could result in an increased sensitivity to light. THC does not cause mydriasis, but rather miosis. These results can substantiate questions regarding liability and driving ability under the influence of THC.

Trial registration

The study was prospectively registered at www.isrctn.com (registration number ISRCTN53019164) on 14/04/2010.

### Reduced pupillary reward sensitivity in Parkinson's disease [^116XSZnD]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous research suggests altered reward processing in PD. This study is the first to quantify direct incentive effects via nonmotor measures. Reward sensitivity as measured by pupillometry was blunted OFF medication. This was restored to normal levels when ON, indicating that abnormal evaluation of rewards is coupled to dopaminergic function in PD.

These findings suggest a crucial role for dopamine in linking reward to motivational preparatory states. They support growing evidence in animals that dopamine has a dual role in evaluating reward and motivating effortful action. In PD, dopaminergic state also modulates motivational disturbances such as apathy and impulsivity, presumably by influencing incentive processing. Pupillometric measures might therefore provide a window into motivational abnormalities and their response to dopamine.

The drug- and disease-related effects observed here are unlikely to be caused by direct pupillomotor effects. Dopamine agonists produce inconsistent effects at the pupil, and the diminished and slow light reflex observed in PDis likely to be cholinergic and independent of dopaminergic state. Sympathetic output to the pupil appears to be relatively spared, as evidenced by normal responses to emotional faces in PD.

Abnormal pupillary reward sensitivity in patients may arise through dysfunction of a brainstem arousal mechanism, in which dopamine and noradrenaline interact, linking reward to motivation. In addition to explaining how low-dopamine states alter reward-related learning and behavior, pupillary reward responses could provide a potential means to measure abnormal reward processing in the motivational syndromes of impulsivity and apathy in PD.

### Altered pupil light and darkness reflex and eye-blink responses in late-life depression [^1177wZPW]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Correlations between neuropsychological test scores and pupil and eye blink rate measures

The relationship between neuropsychological tests scores and pupil and blink measures was examined. GDS-15 and PHQ-15 were used to respectively assess their disease severity and somatic symptoms, and MoCA was used to assess their cognitive function. LLD and OLD participants were collapsed, such that we can examine whether pupil and eye measures could correlate with these scores in ageing population, focusing on tonic pupil size, light and darkness reflex sizes, and blink rate (see " Methods and materials " section). As illustrated in Fig. 5, scores on the GDS-15 significantly correlated with light reflex CoV (Fig. 5 B, R = 0.34, p = 0.02), darkness reflex CoV (Fig. 5 C, R = 0.3, p = 0.04), and blink rate (Fig. 5 D, R = 0.32, p = 0.027), showing severe depression symptoms correlating to higher light reflex CoV, lower darkness reflex CoV and higher blink rates. In contrast, GDS-15 scores did not correlate with tonic pupil and darkness reflex responses. Figure 6 D illustrates a positive correlation between PHQ-15 score and blink rates (R = 0.37, p < 0.001), showing a more severe levels of somatization correlating with higher blink rates. Scores on the PHQ-15 did not correlate with other pupil measures (Fig. 6 A-C). As displayed in Fig. 7, tonic pupil size significantly correlated with MoCA scores (Fig. 7 A, R = 0.29, p = 0.034), with higher pupil sizes correlating with lower scores. MoCA scores did not correlate with other measures (Fig. 7 B-D).

### Altered pupil light and darkness reflex and eye-blink responses in late-life depression [^113VKZqB]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Late-life depression (LLD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder in the older population. While LLD exhibits high mortality rates, depressive symptoms in older adults are often masked by physical health conditions. In younger adults, depression is associated with deficits in pupil light reflex and eye blink rate, suggesting the potential use of these responses as biomarkers for LLD.

Methods

We conducted a study using video-based eye-tracking to investigate pupil and blink responses in LLD patients (n = 25), older (OLD) healthy controls (n = 29), and younger (YOUNG) healthy controls (n = 25). The aim was to determine whether there were alterations in pupil and blink responses in LLD compared to both OLD and YOUNG groups.

Results

LLD patients displayed significantly higher blink rates and dampened pupil constriction responses compared to OLD and YOUNG controls. While tonic pupil size in YOUNG differed from that of OLD, LLD patients did not exhibit a significant difference compared to OLD and YOUNG controls. GDS-15 scores in older adults correlated with light and darkness reflex response variability and blink rates. PHQ-15 scores showed a correlation with blink rates, while MoCA scores correlated with tonic pupil sizes.

Conclusions

The findings demonstrate that LLD patients display altered pupil and blink behavior compared to OLD and YOUNG controls. These altered responses correlated differently with the severity of depressive, somatic, and cognitive symptoms, indicating their potential as objective biomarkers for LLD.

### Essential noninvasive multimodality neuromonitoring for the critically ill patient [^113jDjjH]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Traumatic Brain Injury

Pupillary light reactivity is a well-described prognostic variable in the setting of severe head injury. The literature is full of evidence demonstrating that alterations of the pupillary light reflex, pupil size, and/or anisocoria are correlated with outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In fact, neurosurgeons triage patients to surgical evacuation of mass lesions or conservative therapy according to the pupillary status. It has also been shown that patients who undergo prompt treatment after a new pupil abnormality, whether it be medical or surgical, have a better outcome.

In patients with acute traumatic epidural hematoma and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 8, anisocoria was present in 67% of patients and reducing the surgery interval to < 90 min was associated with a better outcome. TBI patients with a GCS = 3 and fixed, dilated pupils had no chance of survival, whereas patients with a GCS = 3 with pupils that were not fixed or dilated had an excellent survival rate. Intracranial hypertension is associated with decreased NPi, and patients with elevated ICP had an improvement in NPi values after treatment with osmotic therapy. Therefore, pupillometry has the potential as a noninvasive tool to assess the efficacy of osmotic therapy.

Stevens et al. performed a prospective observational study on 40 patients with TBI requiring invasive ICP monitoring and showed a weak relationship between ICP events and a preceding NPi event. The strength of this trend appeared to diminish post-decompressive surgery. Jahns et al. assessed 54 patients with severe TBI with abnormal lesions on head computed tomography (CT) imaging who underwent parenchymal ICP monitoring and repeated NPi assessment through four consecutive measurements over intervals of 6 h prior to sustained elevated ICP > 20 mmHg and found that episodes of elevated ICP correlated with a concomitant decrease in NPi. Sustained abnormal NPi was in turn associated with a more complicated ICP course and worse outcome.

Vassilieva et al. assessed the feasibility of automated pupillometry for the detection of command following in patients with altered consciousness. They enrolled 20 healthy volunteers and 48 patients with a wide range of neurological disorders who were asked to engage in mental arithmetic. Fourteen of 20 (70%) healthy volunteers and 17 of 43 (39.5%) neurological patients fulfilled pre-specified criteria for command following by showing pupillary dilations during 4 or 5 arithmetic tasks.

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^111maxF8]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous data reported inconsistent findings regarding the effect of THC on pupil size, which can at least partially be explained by heterogeneous forms of THC administration and varying degrees of bioavailability. THC is often thought to cause mydriasis, which could cause impaired vision and glare. Here, we used an intravenous application of THC to have a predictable and high bioavailability and we assessed not only pupil size, but differentiated pupillographic measurements, demonstrating a slowed and decreased pupillary constriction in response to light. Another recent publication also demonstrated a reduced pupil size after THC intake, which is in line with our results. Following THC consumption, vision could be impaired by glare. This is however not a result of mydriasis, but of a sluggish reaction of the pupil to light. An increased sensitivity to light as a result of THC consumption is supported by the fact that several volunteers in the THC group could not tolerate the light stimuli of the pupillographic measurements as they found them to be disturbingly bright, while this was not the case in the placebo group. This resulted in a relevant number of aborted pupillographic measurements, particularly at the early timepoints after THC administration. While some volunteers could not complete the pupillographic measurements due to very pronounced sensitivity to light, this sensitivity to light could already be seen as somewhat suggestive of THC consumption as it did not occur in the placebo group. Pronounced sensitivity to light might cause glare and might impair driving ability, but this remains speculative. Also, it is possible that the interplay of psychotropic effects and effects of THC on the eye result in the observed intolerance of bright light noted in several volunteers. Indeed, we previously reported that psychotropic and somatic effect of THC peak between 45 and 60 min after injection, which is in line with the highest number of impossible pupillographic measurements that occurred at 60 min. It is possible that the volunteers not tolerating the stimulus indeed exhibited the highest degree of effects of THC on the eye and that our results therefore underestimate the effects, but again, this remains speculative. Note, however, that peak effects occur later than peak plasma levels.

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^11125B9r]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

A typical pupillography curve is shown in Fig. 1. The following functionally relevant parameters were assessed:

Initial diameter: This is the diameter of the pupil before the stimulus and during latency.
Latency (L): This is the time between the onset of the light stimulus and the beginning of the pupillary response. Normal latency is at least 200ms.
Velocity of contraction (VC): The velocity of pupil contraction to a light stimulus is calculated from the mainly linear downward slope of the curve (interval 40–80%).
Constriction time (T C): This is the time from onset of the pupillary constriction to minimal diameter.
Contraction Amplitude: This is the difference between the initial diameter and the minimal diameter of the pupil.
Relative (pupil constriction) amplitude: This is calculated as contraction amplitude/ initial diameter = (initial diameter - minimal pupil diameter)/ initial pupil diameter. It is given in percent.

Fig. 1
A typical pupillography curve. The following parameters are reported in this study: Initial diameter of the pupil (y-axis at time 0); Line 1: Length of stimulus (set to 200ms); Line 2: latency; Interval 3: velocity of contraction; Interval 4: constriction time; Line 9: contraction amplitude

For clarity, the relative (pupil constriction) amplitude is calculated as the pupil diameter in percent from baseline for any given timepoint, i.e. for the timepoint 20 min this will be the pupil diameter after the stimulus at 20 min in percentage of the pupil diameter directly before the stimulus at 20 min. This is done to control for interindividual differences in pupil diameter and to normalize for intraindividual fluctuations in pupil diameter. As such, the relative amplitude is a measure of the contractility of the pupil in response to light.

Definition of outcome parameters and aim

Primary outcome parameter was the relative amplitude of the pupillary light reflex.

Secondary outcome parameters were the pupil diameter (i.e. the initial diameter before the light stimulus at each timepoint), and other parameters of the pupillary light reflex such as the latency, the velocity of contraction, the constriction time and the contraction amplitude.

Aim

The aim was to estimate the impact of IV THC on the function and size of the pupil.

### Reduced pupillary reward sensitivity in Parkinson's disease [^1132hMjY]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in reward processing may be a critical part of understanding nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysfunction in dopaminergic pathways, which signal upcoming rewards, might result in altered motivation by incentives. To examine this proposal, we studied 16 patients with PD, both ON and OFF their normal dopaminergic medication, comparing them with healthy controls. Participants performed a speeded saccade task to obtain monetary rewards. Crucially, we manipulated the reward available from trial to trial, by presenting an auditory incentive precue before each saccade. The effects of incentives on pupil dilatation (an index of autonomic response) were measured. Individuals with PD showed diminished autonomic reward effects, compared with age-matched controls. When tested ON medication, pupil responses to reward increased, demonstrating that dopaminergic drugs can restore reward sensitivity. These findings reveal blunted autonomic responses to incentives in PD, which can be modulated by dopaminergic drugs.
