## Question

What are the common causes of discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose levels in patients with anemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose levels in patients with anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiology linking HbA1c to red cell lifespan and glycation. Then, I should categorize anemia types by their effect on red cell turnover and HbA1c directionality. Next, I will examine specific mechanisms for iron deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemias, and hemoglobinopathies. After that, I should review assay interferences and population-level data. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical guidance, including when to use glucose-based criteria and alternative markers, and how to confirm discordance before acting on it.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology. HbA1c reflects the irreversible glycation of hemoglobin over the average lifespan of erythrocytes, roughly 90–120 days, so anything that alters red cell survival or the proportion of young versus old red cells will change HbA1c independent of true glycemia, and recent glucose exposure contributes disproportionately to the measured HbA1c, which explains why turnover changes can have outsized effects on results [^09b9feb9] [^644b16ff].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize anemia by mechanism and expected HbA1c effect. Iron deficiency anemia tends to prolong red cell lifespan and increase HbA1c, hemolytic anemias and some hemoglobinopathies shorten lifespan and lower HbA1c, and megaloblastic anemia from B12/folate deficiency often has minimal effect on HbA1c because turnover is not consistently altered, though exceptions exist, so I need to keep these buckets in mind as I proceed [^65f9223f] [^1c04aaab] [^19a51662].

> I will now examine iron deficiency anemia specifically. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and mechanism. Multiple studies show IDA can falsely elevate HbA1c by about 1–1.5% on average, and treatment that corrects iron deficiency typically lowers HbA1c toward the true glycemic baseline, supporting a causal relationship rather than just association; proposed mechanisms include older circulating red cells with more glycation, altered hemoglobin structure increasing glycation susceptibility, and a higher glycated fraction when total hemoglobin is low, though the exact mechanism remains debated and likely multifactorial [^7b830d41] [^1c04aaab] [^8ea709d1] [^9d3e3025].

> Next, I should review hemolytic and high-turnover states. Shortened red cell lifespan reduces the time available for glycation, so HbA1c underestimates average glycemia. Sickle cell disease, G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria all demonstrate this pattern, and case series document markedly low HbA1c despite hyperglycemia, reinforcing the need to avoid HbA1c-based diagnosis or monitoring in these settings [^081105d8] [^24313557] [^68339042] [^3a278a6e].

> But wait, what if the patient has a hemoglobinopathy without overt hemolysis. I should double-check sickle cell trait data. Large cohorts show that even sickle cell trait is associated with lower HbA1c at a given glucose level, indicating a systematic underestimation of glycemia, and guidelines advise using glucose-based criteria when hemoglobinopathies are present or suspected, with attention to assay interference depending on the method used [^7715ded6] [^aa2582f1] [^5849f447].

> I need to check assay-related issues next. Some hemoglobin variants co-elute with HbA1c on certain HPLC platforms, producing spuriously high results, whereas immunoassays may be unaffected or yield different interferences. Case reports of Hb Raleigh and other variants illustrate dramatic discordance between methods, so if the clinical picture conflicts with HbA1c, repeating with an alternate, NGSP-certified method and considering hemoglobinopathy testing is prudent [^fc977baa] [^aa2582f1].

> Let me consider population-level signals to ensure this isn't just theoretical. In regions with high anemia prevalence, HbA1c-based diabetes prevalence estimates diverge from glucose-based estimates, with patterns consistent with iron deficiency inflating HbA1c and hemolysis or hemoglobinopathies deflating it. Discordance is common enough that expert groups caution against relying on HbA1c alone in these populations, and studies in sub-Saharan Africa show substantial misclassification risk when HbA1c is used in isolation [^0703c17b] [^e50db132] [^8b432698].

> I should confirm guideline positions to anchor practice. ADA Standards advise that when there is consistent and substantial discordance between glucose and A1C, we should evaluate for assay problems or conditions that alter the A1C–glycemia relationship, and in such conditions, plasma glucose criteria should be used for diagnosis. VA/DoD similarly recommends caution and discourages medication changes based on a single discordant A1C, emphasizing confirmatory testing and clinical context [^aa2582f1] [^5849f447] [^7bb5d3f0].

> Next, I should review practical steps when discordance is suspected. Let me think about a sequence: confirm the A1C with a different NGSP-certified method, check a CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, and consider hemoglobinopathy screening when appropriate. If red cell turnover is abnormal or iron deficiency is present, prioritize fasting plasma glucose, OGTT, or CGM-derived metrics for diagnosis and monitoring, and consider alternative markers like fructosamine or glycated albumin when A1C is unreliable, recognizing their own limitations in CKD or low albumin states [^aa2582f1] [^83e42e55] [^0d523e1c].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of effect to guide counseling. In IDA, HbA1c can be roughly 1–1.5% higher than expected for the true mean glucose, and in hemolytic states, HbA1c can be markedly lower, sometimes by more than 1–2%, which can easily shift patients across diagnostic thresholds or mislead therapy intensification, so documenting the hematologic cause and correcting it before reassessing glycemia is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and iatrogenic harm [^7b830d41] [^1c04aaab] [^7715ded6].

> Let me reconsider whether any anemias leave HbA1c relatively untouched. Megaloblastic anemia from B12 deficiency may not consistently alter red cell lifespan, and some studies show minimal HbA1c change in thalassemia trait, though interindividual variability and assay differences can still create discordance, so I should avoid overgeneralizing and always interpret results in the clinical context with corroborating glucose measures [^1c04aaab] [^0ccea247].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: anemia causes HbA1c–glucose discordance primarily by altering red cell lifespan and, secondarily, through hemoglobin variants that interfere with assays. Iron deficiency anemia tends to falsely elevate HbA1c, whereas hemolytic anemias and certain hemoglobinopathies tend to falsely lower it, and in both scenarios, glucose-based diagnostic criteria and alternative markers should be used to avoid misclassification and to guide safe, effective care [^aa2582f1] [^1f66a5d4] [^7b830d41] [^081105d8].

Discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose in anemia arises from **altered red cell turnover** and **assay interference**. Iron deficiency anemia and chronic kidney disease increase HbA1c by 1–2% due to older erythrocytes and carbamylation, whereas hemolytic anemia, sickle cell disease, and recent transfusions shorten RBC lifespan, lowering HbA1c. Hemoglobin variants (e.g. HbS, HbC, HbE) and certain HPLC methods can also cause spurious results. Clinicians should **use glucose-based criteria** (FPG, OGTT, or CGM) when anemia is present or HbA1c is discordant, and consider fructosamine or glycated albumin when available [^aa2582f1] [^5849f447] [^0d523e1c].

## Physiological mechanisms of discordance

### Altered red blood cell lifespan

- **Normal RBC lifespan**: ~120 days, allowing HbA1c to reflect ~3-month average glycemia [^09b9feb9].
- **Shortened RBC lifespan**: Hemolysis, sickle cell disease, G6PD deficiency, or recent transfusions reduce glycation, causing falsely low HbA1c [^081105d8] [^24313557] [^3a278a6e].
- **Prolonged RBC lifespan**: Iron deficiency anemia or CKD increases older RBCs, raising HbA1c independent of glycemia [^644b16ff] [^7b830d41].

---

### Assay interference

Certain hemoglobin variants (HbS, HbC, HbE) can **interfere with some HbA1c assays**, causing spurious results, and **uremia** leads to carbamylation of hemoglobin, which some assays read as HbA1c, falsely elevating results [^fc977baa] [^0d523e1c].

## Clinical evidence of discordance

| **Anemia type** | **Effect on hba1c** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Iron deficiency anemia | Increase by 1–2% | Prolonged RBC lifespan, carbamylation | - Multiple studies [^7b830d41] [^1c04aaab] <br/> - ADA guidance [^aa2582f1] |
| Hemolytic anemia (e.g. sickle cell, G6PD deficiency) | Decrease by 1–2% | Shortened RBC lifespan | - ADA guidance [^aa2582f1] <br/> - Case reports [^24313557] [^3a278a6e] |
| Chronic kidney disease-related anemia | Increase by 1–2% | Carbamylation, prolonged RBC lifespan | - KDOQI guidance [^0d523e1c] <br/> - ADA guidance [^aa2582f1] |
| Recent blood transfusion | Decrease | Young RBCs with less glycation | ADA guidance [^aa2582f1] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Diagnosis**: Use glucose-based criteria (FPG, OGTT, or CGM) when anemia is present or HbA1c is discordant with glucose [^aa2582f1] [^5849f447].
- **Monitoring**: Consider fructosamine or glycated albumin when HbA1c is unreliable, especially in CKD or hemolysis [^0d523e1c] [^3a278a6e].
- **Assay selection**: Use NGSP-certified methods and be aware of hemoglobin variant interference [^aa2582f1] [^fc977baa].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Iron deficiency anemia and CKD**: Increase HbA1c by 1–2% via older RBCs and carbamylation.
- **Hemolytic anemia and transfusions**: Lower HbA1c by shortening RBC lifespan.
- **Hemoglobin variants**: Cause assay interference and spurious results.
- **Clinical action**: Use glucose-based tests or alternative markers when anemia is present or HbA1c is discordant [^aa2582f1] [^5849f447].

Discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose in anemia is common and clinically meaningful; **recognizing the cause and using alternative glycemic assessments** prevents misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^d153b04a]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In a panel discussion after Nathan's presentation, Harold Lebovitz (Staten Island, NY) asked whether this approach would negatively impact patients' understanding of their condition when there were discrepancies between A1C and glucose levels. I have raised this issue in recommending that the relationship between A1C and mean glycemia is insufficiently precise to allow the use of A1C in defining estimated average glucose (eAG). The argument that A1C correlates with the complications of diabetes on a population basis does not strongly favor its use in diagnosis because any measure linked to glycemia will show such a relationship. A1C represents glycation of hemoglobin, localized to a specific biologic compartment, the erythrocyte cytoplasm, which is potentially rather different from the entire glucose distribution volume. Erythrocyte turnover, cell membrane permeability to glucose, hemoglobin glycation and deglycation, and a myriad of other processes will change glycated hemoglobin levels. Twin studies show heritable components contributing to A1C: when twins are concordant for diabetes, their A1C levels are, unsurprisingly, rather similar, but, interestingly, twins discordant for diabetes also show correlation of A1C levels, leading to suggestion of a strong nonglycemic hereditable component to A1C.

A large number of medical conditions are associated with alterations in the relationship between mean glycemia and A1C: hematological conditions, such as persistent fetal hemoglobin, hemoglobin S, C, or D, and the presence of carbamylated hemoglobin in uremia; illnesses characterized by hemolysis or other states with shortened erythrocyte life span; a variety of systemic conditions including certain forms of dyslipidemia, malignancies, and cirrhosis. The common condition of iron deficiency anemia can, for unexplained reasons, lead to an increase in A1C by 1–1.5% that subsequently falls following iron treatment. Given the frequency with which subjects with diabetes have other medical illnesses, the likelihood that such factors may alter A1C is widely underestimated. Interestingly, hyperglycemia may itself shorten erythrocyte life span, suggesting a mechanism by which glycemia need not to exhibit a direct linear relationship to the A1C level. Pregnancy is well recognized to be associated with a substantial reduction in A1C levels, perhaps as a function of hemodilution or increased erythrocyte turnover, although it has not been fully explained by either mechanism; during late pregnancy, A1C levels decrease by ∼0.5% at every level of mean plasma glucose.

### When the blood glucose and the HbA (1c) don't match: turning uncertainty into opportunity [^8394a4da]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Acentral principle in science and medicine is that the more independent pieces of evidence there are that agree, the more convincing it is that a hypothesis — or diagnosis — is valid. The opposite is also true: discordant information leads to uncertainty. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for clinicians caring for people with diabetes to encounter individuals in whom HbA 1c and blood glucose simply do not match. Sometimes, there is an obvious explanation such as hemolytic anemia. But when it occurs in people with reliable blood glucose records and ostensibly normal peripheral blood and reticulocyte counts, without evidence of hemoglobinopathy, hemolytic disorder, blood loss/transfusion, or nutritional deficiency such as iron, folate, or vitamin B12, we are left with the questions of how the discordant information should be treated and what it means for patient care.

Part of the challenge is that even the best characterization of the association between HbA 1c and blood glucose shows an imperfect relationship in populations. For example, at an HbA 1c of 6.0%, the mean blood glucose has a 95% CI ranging from 100 to 152 mg/dL. This overlaps with the 95% CI for the mean blood glucose at an HbA 1c of 7.0%, which is 123–185 mg/dL. Such wide variation reinforces the notion that HbA 1c and blood glucose are not exactly equivalent. Moreover, it raises the question of whether a binary cut point for HbA 1c in the diagnosis of diabetes, such as 6.5%, is an adequate representation of blood glucose and suggests that reliance only on HbA 1c could miss persons with diabetes and falsely diagnose those without. But, if we obtain both glucose measurements and HbA 1c, we are left with what to do with discordant information.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^57a572b6]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The dilemma is the high interpatient variability of hemoglobin glycation, which is quite different from the high degree of tracking of mean blood glucose with A1C for each individual studied at multiple levels of glycemia. A related phenomenon of greater variability in groups of diabetic patients, but much stronger correlation within individuals, has been shown in the relationship between A1C and fructosamine. This phenomenon of variable degrees of hemoglobin glycation is well demonstrated in the DCCT 1-day, seven-sample capillary glucose versus A1C database of some 250,000 blood glucose and 72,000 A1C values, where participants could be divided into high, medium, and low glycators. Although studies of CGM might be expected to be more accurate, analysis of a pediatric population showed that while there was a strong correlation of A1C with mean glucose in the group, the use of A1C to estimate mean glucose in individuals would lead to error. Although the ADAG study group, as Nathan discussed, did find strong correlation between A1C and average glucose based either on self-monitored capillary glucose or CGM analysis and although this study was hailed editorially as "a key reference regarding the relationship between A1C and average glucose", I explained some important features of the study design that could bias it to overly support the relationship. Subjects with hemoglobinopathy, anemia, reticulocytosis, blood loss, and chronic renal or liver disease or those receiving high-dose vitamin C, transfusion, or erythropoietin treatment were excluded. Furthermore, of those entering the study, 23% subsequently were deleted from analysis for conditions that might increase the discordance between A1C and glycemia. Representation of a variety of ethnic groups was limited. Precisely those subjects most important for clinicians to identify, then, were not included. Furthermore, there were limited data for subjects with average glucose > 10 mmol/l. I speculated that the discrepancy between A1C and mean glucose might be clinically detrimental, potentially explaining the treatment effect on mortality in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, because "high glycators" might, if assigned to a treatment protocol dictating additional medication for A1C regardless of glycemia, develop hypoglycemia with consequent adverse outcome. In a recent case report, a "low glycator" was allowed to have substantially poorer actual glycemic control than would be desirable because of misleadingly "good" levels of A1C.

Correlation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and blood glucose values in different stages of glucose metabolism

In patients with both HbA1c and BG (FBG or RBG) values in the diabetic range (n = 24), median BG was numerically higher (14.7 mmol/L; inter quartile range (IQR) 6.4 mmol/L) than in patients in whom only BG (n = 6) was in the diabetic range (9.8 mmol/L; IQR 4.2 mmol/L) (p = 0.443). In patients with only HbA1c in the diabetic range (n = 33), median BG was lower (5.8 mmol/L; IQR 1.5 mmol/L) than in patients with both HbA1c and BG in the diabetic range (14.7 mmol/L; IQR 6.4 mmol/L) (p < 0.001), but higher than in patients without IGM (4.7 mmol/L; IQR 1.0 mmol/L) (p < 0.001) (figure 3A and included table a).

### Assessment of diabetes and prediabetes prevalence and predictors by HbA1c in a population from sub-saharan Africa with a high proportion of anemia: a prospective cross-sectional study [^32c9a576]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

We could further show that there was a strong correlation and a clear "dose dependent" relationship between HbA1c levels and FBG as well as RBG values. The highest HbA1c values were observed in patients who had also FBG or RBG values in the diabetic range. In discordant pairs in which only HbA1c was in the diabetic range, FBG and RBG were lower, but still clearly higher than in the population with normal HbA1c values. Vice versa, in the few cases in which only FBG or RBG were in the diabetic range and HbA1c values were not, the HbA1c levels were higher than the values of the normal population. This observation was also consistent in the prediabetic states and overall for all patients with IGM, even if it did not always reach the level of significance due to the small number of cases. The clear positive relationship between HbA1c and FBG and even RBG in a cross-sectional setting is astonishing, because the strength of HbA1c measurements lies in the reflection of glucose metabolism over the past few months and not in the correlation with random single BG measurements. The results underline that HbA1c is very valid and reliable to detect a disturbed glucose balance even in populations with a high proportion of anemia, such as those in SSA. Our findings are further supported by a recently published study, which found similar age-standardized DM prevalence estimates based on HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance test, and FBG in an urban black South African population. However, in this study, data on Hb levels and their impact on HbA1c levels were not explored.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^93a691dc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^874181da]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases worldwide and is rapidly increasing. It is also one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Complications from diabetes have been correlated to the control of the disease. Despite newer targets that reflect diabetes control, like the time in range, glycated hemoglobin (i.e. hemoglobin A1C) remains the main measure of disease control. The hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test is used to measure an individual's glycemic index in the last 3 months. Many specialists apply this test to evaluate blood glucose levels. Normal HbA1c is < 5.7%, levels between 5.7–6.4% are considered prediabetes, and a level of > 6.5% is diagnostic for diabetes. Since HbA1c measures the sugar that is linked to a form of hemoglobin, abnormalities in hemoglobin can theoretically falsely affect the HbA1c level. Hemoglobinopathies involve all genetic hemoglobin conditions, and they are divided into two categories, abnormal hemoglobin and thalassemia disorder. All of them happen because of deletions and/or mutations in the α- or β-globin genes.

Anemia is a major public health issue in many regions of the world, affecting over 30% of the world's population. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a condition in which iron is gradually depleted due to inadequate dietary intake, hemorrhage, or insufficient intestinal iron absorption. As a result, the production of iron-containing proteins such as hemoglobin (Hb) is hampered. More than 2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from IDA, and it is still the leading cause of anemia. A previous study discovered a link between IDA and HbA1c levels and attempted to explain the change in HbA1c levels in IDA using both hemoglobin structure modifications and HbA1c levels in old and new red blood cells. The literature is divided on the effect of IDA on HbA1c levels, with some studies showing an increase in HbA1c and others showing that HbA1c was significantly lower in IDA patients compared to control groups.

### Association between metabolic parameters and risks of anemia and electrolyte disturbances among stages 3–5 chronic kidney disease patients in Taiwan [^9e99d3a5]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c are associated with presence of anemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia in patients with stage 3–5 CKD. Moreover, the results of the present study suggest that there is a discordant association of blood pressure or serum lipid concentrations with anemia or electrolyte and mineral imbalances. A longitudinal study with prospective measurements is needed to further investigate this association.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^0703c17b]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives:

Nonglycemic factors like iron deficiency (ID) or anemia may interfere with classification of diabetes and prediabetes using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, few population-based studies of diabetes in areas with endemic ID/anemia have been conducted. We aimed to determine how mutually exclusive categories of ID alone, anemia alone and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) were each associated with prediabetes and diabetes prevalence using fasting blood glucose (FBG) versus HbA1c in a population-based study of adults with endemic ID/anemia.

Subjects/Methods:

We used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a longitudinal, population-based study across 228 communities within nine provinces of China. This analysis included 7308 adults seen in the 2009 survey aged 18–75 years. We used descriptive and covariate-adjusted models to examine relative risk of prediabetes and diabetes using FBG alone, HbA1c alone, HbA1c and FBG, or neither (normoglycemia) by anemia alone, ID alone, IDA or normal iron/hemoglobin.

Results:

Approximately 65% of individuals with diabetes in our sample were concordantly classified with diabetes using both FBG and HbA1c, while 35% had a discordant diabetes classification: they were classified using either FBG or HbA1c, but not both. Fewer participants with ID alone versus normal iron/hemoglobin were classified with diabetes using HbA1c only. From covariate-adjusted, multinomial regression analyses, the adjusted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 22% for men with anemia alone, but 13% for men with normal iron/hemoglobin. In contrast, the predicted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 8% for women with ID alone, compared with 13% for women with normal iron/hemoglobin.

Conclusions:

These findings suggest potential misclassification of diabetes using HbA1c in areas of endemic ID/anemia. Estimating diabetes prevalence using HbA1c may result in under-diagnosis in women with ID and over-diagnosis in men with anemia.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^1f66a5d4]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

There is an inherent logic to using a more chronic versus an acute marker of dysglycemia, particularly since the A1C is already widely familiar to clinicians as a marker of glycemic control. Moreover, the A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required, evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages, however, must be balanced by greater cost, the limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and the incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies, which may also have unique ethnic or geographic distributions. For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list is available at). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must employ glucose criteria exclusively.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^48ea10af]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are important diagnostic measures to assess glycemia; however, HbA1c is increasingly recommended for use in population-based settings because it does not require fasting and has low intra-individual variability. In the general population, HbA1c and FBG do not classify diabetes identically because they reflect glycemia status over different time periods. It is well established that HbA1c levels can be affected by conditions unrelated to diabetes including anemia, blood loss and iron deficiency (ID). Anemia affects an estimated five million women of reproductive age in the USand 1.6 billion individuals worldwide, a substantial portion of whom have concurrent ID. Thus, there is potential for diabetes misclassification across many populations worldwide. To understand the clinical implications of ID and/or anemia for diabetes prevalence estimates when using HbA1c, population-based research in areas with a high prevalence of ID and/or anemia is needed.

The magnitude and direction of diabetes misclassification due to ID and anemia is not well understood. The mechanism through which ID and anemia influences HbA1c has yet to be fully elucidated;, however, most epidemiologic studies suggest that iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) can result in spuriously high HbA1c values, though some suggest there is lower HbA1c among individuals with IDAor anemia. These differences may relate to the multiple etiologies for anemia, which include ID, sickle cell disease or other thalassemias, vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency. ID may be caused by insufficient iron intake, inability to absorb iron, blood loss, menstrual blood loss or pregnancy. With these multiple etiologies, IDA may represent two separate disease processes, anemia and ID. Furthermore, susceptibility to, or severity of, ID versus anemia may differ by sex because of menstruation in women. Few population-based studies have separated ID and anemia into mutually exclusive categories to examine how each may differentially impact prediabetes and diabetes prevalence estimates using HbA1c.

Thus, we examined how anemia alone, ID alone and IDA were each associated with the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes when using FBG and HbA1c in a population-based sample of 7308 Chinese adults aged 18–75 years from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We examined the variation in the prevalence of prediabetes or diabetes using descriptive and covariate-controlled analyses, hypothesizing that IDA would result in over-diagnosis of diabetes using HbA1c versus FBG.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^081105d8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hemoglobin S (Hb S) production, is one of the most prevalent hereditary hemoglobinopathy diseases worldwide. In the United States, SCA affects about 72,000 people and approximately 2 million are carriers. Hemoglobin S changes the normal shape of the red blood cells (RBCs) to become sickle-shaped cells. Sickle cell disease (SCD) may alter HbA1c's ability to accurately reflect past glycemia. When compared to people with normal hemoglobin, the lifespan of red blood cells in people with SCD may be shortened, leaving less time for glycation, which can falsely lower HbA1c levels.

Thalassemia is a diverse set of inherited autosomal recessive disorders, which are caused by a reduction in alpha or beta chains that compose the hemoglobin. Thalassemia is classified according to the affected hemoglobin molecule into alpha- and beta-thalassemia. Beta-thalassemia is caused by the deletion of the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11, which results in the formation of fewer or no beta-globin chains. It is characterized by a lack of erythropoiesis and persistent hemolysis. Heterozygous thalassemia (also known as thalassemia minor) is thalassemia that affects 1–5% of people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Because β-thalassemia carriers have a shorter erythrocyte lifetime, ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis may lower HbA1c levels.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^e50db132]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Nonglycemic factors like iron deficiency (ID) or anemia may interfere with classification of diabetes and prediabetes using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, few population-based studies of diabetes in areas with endemic ID/anemia have been conducted. We aimed to determine how mutually exclusive categories of ID alone, anemia alone and iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) were each associated with prediabetes and diabetes prevalence using fasting blood glucose (FBG) versus HbA1c in a population-based study of adults with endemic ID/anemia.

Subjects/Methods

We used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, a longitudinal, population-based study across 228 communities within nine provinces of China. This analysis included 7308 adults seen in the 2009 survey aged 18–75 years. We used descriptive and covariate-adjusted models to examine relative risk of prediabetes and diabetes using FBG alone, HbA1c alone, HbA1c and FBG, or neither (normoglycemia) by anemia alone, ID alone, IDA or normal iron/hemoglobin.

Results

Approximately 65% of individuals with diabetes in our sample were concordantly classified with diabetes using both FBG and HbA1c, while 35% had a discordant diabetes classification: they were classified using either FBG or HbA1c, but not both. Fewer participants with ID alone versus normal iron/hemoglobin were classified with diabetes using HbA1c only. From covariate-adjusted, multinomial regression analyses, the adjusted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 22% for men with anemia alone, but 13% for men with normal iron/hemoglobin. In contrast, the predicted prevalence of prediabetes using HbA1c only was 8% for women with ID alone, compared with 13% for women with normal iron/hemoglobin.

Conclusions

These findings suggest potential misclassification of diabetes using HbA1c in areas of endemic ID/anemia. Estimating diabetes prevalence using HbA1c may result in under-diagnosis in women with ID and over-diagnosis in men with anemia.

Descriptive analyses

All analyses were conducted in Stata 13 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). First, we examined the differences in sample characteristics by sex, using χ 2 or analysis of variance tests for categorical or continuous variables, respectively. Second, we examined sex-specific differences in diabetes classification (nondiabetic, diabetes HbA1c, diabetes FBG or diabetes HbA1c+FBG) or prediabetes classification (normoglycemia, prediabetes HbA1c, prediabetes FBG or prediabetes HbA1c+FBG) according to ID and/or anemia status (normal iron/hemoglobin, anemia alone, ID or IDA), testing group-level differences in the classification via χ 2 tests. Third, among individuals with diabetes or prediabetes, we examined the mismatch between the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes (separately) on the basis of HbA1c versus FBG (concordant by HbA1c and FBG; discordant by FBG only; discordant by HbA1c only) using pairwise χ 2 tests comparing categories of ID alone, anemia alone or IDA with normal iron/hemoglobin as referent. Statistical significance was set at the P < 0.05 level for all descriptive analyses.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^86af470a]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Using these unique data, we report the impact of anemia alone, ID or IDA on diabetes and prediabetes prevalence estimates in a sex-stratified, population-based sample of Chinese adults with substantial variability in iron, hemoglobin and diabetes measures. Our findings suggest that ID may result in under-diagnosis of diabetes and anemia may result in over-diagnosis of diabetes when using HbA1c. Furthermore, differences in diabetes/prediabetes classification for individuals with IDA may be driven by the positive association between anemia and HbA1c, but attenuated by the opposing, negative association between ID and HbA1c. Our findings suggest that inconsistent findings in the literature could be due to the complex disease etiology of IDA, and confirm warnings that HbA1c should only be used for glycemic assessment in the absence of ID and/or anemia. These findings suggest that concurrent measurement of iron, hemoglobin and HbA1c is critical to correctly interpret glycaemia status in populations with prevalent ID and/or anemia.

### Interactions between kidney disease and diabetes: dangerous liaisons [^644b16ff]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations of glycated hemoglobin in CKD

In addition to glucose, other factors might also influence HbA1c: this is the main reason for which the dosage of HbA1c is questioned in patients with CKD. Among these influences, we highlight a few. First, the formation of HbA1c is dependent on the interaction (intensity and duration) between the concentrations of glucose and blood erythrocytes. On average, erythrocytes survive 117 days in men and 106 days in women. At a certain point, a blood sample contains erythrocytes of different ages, mainly younger elements and with different degrees of exposure to hyperglycemia. HbA1c is a measure for the mean level of blood glucose in the past 90 days. The impact of recent blood glucose levels on the measurement of A1c are: 50% for the last month, 25% for the 2nd month ago, and 25% for the 3rd and 4th month ago.

An unexplained discrepancy between HbA1c and other measurements of glycemic control can be partly due to the different life span of erythrocytes. Decreased erythropoiesis, caused by iron or vitamin B12 deficiency or aplastic anemia, leads to an increased number of aged red blood cells and a subsequent progressive increase of HbA1c, unrelated to glycemic control.

Anemia due to iron deficiency increases HbA1c up to 2%, which can be reverted by iron supplementation. Conversely, a decrease in HbA1c is observed after the administration of erythropoietin, iron, and vitamin B12, and in cases of hemolytic anemia. Due to a reduction in the survival of red blood cells, younger erythrocytes have less time to be exposed to a glycemic environment and therefore undergo less glycation Hemoglobinopathies, of which the most common example is sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, can lead to problems in the interpretation of HbA1c. In case of these changes, in addition to the normal HbA0 glycation to form HbA1c, other glycation products derived from HbC (African populations), HbD (indigenous populations), HbE (Asian populations), or HbS (sickle cell anemia) could be formed.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^08d2b216]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

With the exception of our model predicting prediabetes in women, the relationship of IDA (versus normal iron/hemoglobin) with diabetes HbA1c or prediabetes HbA1c (versus normoglycemia), though not statistically significant, was in the same direction as the associations we observed between anemia alone and a higher relative risk of diabetes/prediabetes. It is possible that a positive relationship between IDA (which is severe ID with anemia) and HbA1c is attenuated because ID is negatively associated with HbA1c, while anemia is positively associated with HbA1c. Another possibility is that the low prevalence of diabetes and IDA, particularly in men, could have resulted in insufficient statistical power, or that hemoglobinopathies, thalassemias or other confounding factors could have reduced the precision of our estimates. However, our findings suggest that a different direction of association between ID and HbA1c (negative) versus that between anemia and HbA1c (positive) may underlie inconsistent findings in the epidemiologic literature and support the need to examine both iron and anemia status when assessing diabetes using HbA1c.

Our study contributes to the literature on influences of nonglycemic factors on HbA1c, but there are some limitations of note. In our population-based sample, we do not have an oral glucose tolerance test, the gold standard of glycemic measurementyet we do have HbA1c and FGB, whereas most studies only collect one or the other. As a nonclinical study, we only have one FBG and HbA1c measurement from participants, which is standard for research studies in the field, whereas a clinical diagnostic test would include replicate measures. We do not have information on genetic hemoglobinopathies such as HbE, which affects ~30% of Southeast Asians and may artificially lower HbA1c. However, in sensitivity analysis, we excluded participants from the South region of China where the HbE variant is most prevalent, and observed similar findings in the full sample, although estimates were less precise due to the smaller sample size. Our analysis does not address pregnancy, a time when women are at high risk of developing ID and gestational diabetes. However, our study has the great strengths of reporting population-level associations between ID alone, anemia alone and IDA and diabetes/prediabetes classification in a population-based sample, using a standardized and calibrated technique for HbA1c measurement, allowing us to compare HbA1c across a large and geographically diverse sample; discordant samples and techniques would make this impossible.

### Sky high or undetectable? A patient with discordant hemoglobin A1c [^fc977baa]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A female patient aged 47 years presented with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 54.6%, as measured by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and a glucose level of 106 mg/dL. The HbA1c was re-evaluated using a turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay and found below the level of detection. Hemoglobinopathy testing led to the identification of a hemoglobin variant consistent with Hb Raleigh, in which a valine → alanine substitution on the beta chain effects a charge difference, resulting in coelution with HbA1c on HPLC and a spuriously high reading. Many Hb variants may interfere with HbA1c measurement and generate misleading results. The unique properties of Hb Raleigh may give rise to analytical errors when evaluating HbA1c using 2 different methods-molecular charge-based (eg, HPLC) and molecular structure-based (eg, immunoassay)-yielding diametrically opposed results. Consequently, recognition and diagnosis of this entity are essential in patients with Hb Raleigh, especially when monitoring long-term glucose control.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^aef9b564]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C testing for screening/diagnosis, discordance management, and assay requirements specifies that "Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel", and instructs to "Evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results". In conditions with an altered A1C–glycemia relationship (e.g., some hemoglobin variants; pregnancy [second and third trimesters and the postpartum period]; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; HIV; hemodialysis; recent blood loss or transfusion; hemolysis; erythropoietin therapy), "plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes". Methodologically, "The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)… and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay". For point-of-care use, "A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic management" and "FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards", which "include… participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program".

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes: response to the international expert committee [^66c9d403]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Members of the International Expert Committee have recommended that diabetes should be diagnosed if A1C is ≤ 6.5%, without need to measure the plasma glucose concentration. We are concerned that practical limitations will lead to false positives and negatives with this approach.

A given A1C instrument may identify some but not other abnormal hemoglobins. How, therefore, can we be sure whether a hemoglobinopathy is causing (or preventing) diagnosis? Before diagnosis, should we not also exclude iron deficiency anemia, which may increase A1C by 1–1.5%, as well as hemolytic anemia and renal failure or chronic infections, which also lower A1C? The International Expert Committee breezes over the effect of aging (0.4% higher in 70-year-old subjects than in 40-year-old subjects, apparently, despite the same glucose tolerance) and ethnicity (0.5% higher in Afro-Caribbeans than Europids) because their "etiology and significance are unclear". Before this matter is settled, surely potential overdiagnosis of the elderly and non-Europids is inappropriate? These issues, and the possible list of tests required in addition to the simple A1C, still make the idea of fasting overnight for a glucose test an attractive option.

### Racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between HbA1c and blood glucose: implications for the diagnosis of diabetes [^a74f4948]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used as an index of mean glycemia in diabetes, as a measure of risk for the development of diabetic complications, and as a measure of the quality of diabetes care. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association recommended that HbA1c tests, performed in a laboratory using a method certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, be used for the diagnosis of diabetes. Although HbA1c has a number of advantages compared to traditional glucose criteria, it has a number of disadvantages. Hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia syndromes, factors that impact red blood cell survival and red blood cell age, uremia, hyperbilirubinemia, and iron deficiency may alter HbA1c test results as a measure of average glycemia. Recently, racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between HbA1c and blood glucose have also been described. Although the reasons for racial and ethnic differences remain unknown, factors such as differences in red cell survival, extracellular-intracellular glucose balance, and nonglycemic genetic determinants of hemoglobin glycation are being explored as contributors. Until the reasons for these differences are more clearly defined, reliance on HbA1c as the sole, or even preferred, criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes creates the potential for systematic error and misclassification. HbA1c must be used thoughtfully and in combination with traditional glucose criteria when screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^e532d8e4]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

ADA has not previously recommended the use of A1C for diagnosing diabetes, in part due to lack of standardization of the assay. However, A1C assays are now highly standardized, and their results can be uniformly applied both temporally and across populations. In a recent report, after an extensive review of both established and emerging epidemiological evidence, an international expert committee recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes with a threshold of ≥ 6.5%, and ADA affirms this decision. The diagnostic test should be performed using a method certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes.

Epidemiologic datasets show a relationship between A1C and the risk of retinopathy similar to that which has been shown for corresponding FPG and 2-h PG thresholds. The A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required; evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability; and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages must be balanced by greater cost, limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies. For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list of A1C assays and whether abnormal hemoglobins impact them is available at). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as pregnancy or anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must use glucose criteria exclusively.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^541fb558]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A recent study shows little rationale for the proposed threshold of 6.5% based on total retinopathy, albuminuria, or neuropathy. Interestingly, in that study, nonfasting ("random") glucose was as suitable as A1C for identifying subjects with diabetes. Analysis of U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data revealed that 50–60% of patients with fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/l had A1C < 6.5%, suggesting that A1C might reduce the number of people diagnosed as having diabetes from that using current glycemic criteria. If because of anemia, renal disease, infection, ethnicity, age, or other patient medical characteristics or for economic reasons one uses glucose rather than A1C measurements, the likelihood of diabetes would presumably be greater, which is certainly not desirable.

Measuring fasting and 2-h glucose values to diagnose diabetes, then, has limitations, but there may be less risk that these measurements could lead to an individual being misdiagnosed as could occur with A1C based on age, ethnicity, renal disease, anemia, or hemoglobinopathy. These issues and the possible list of tests required in addition to the "simple" A1C make the idea of just fasting overnight for a glucose test an attractive option.

Indeed, as discussed above, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of A1C will lead to overdiagnosis among the elderly, blacks, subjects with iron deficiency, and individuals genetically predisposed to greater levels of hemoglobin glycation, whereas those with anemia, renal insufficiency, and many hemoglobinopathies, as well as those with other genetic variations, will be incorrectly told that they do not have diabetes. If A1C is used as the sole means of diagnosis (and of assessing glycemia) and if there is encouragement to limit glucose self-monitoring until a patient is treated with insulin, one must wonder how without concurrent hemoglobinopathy screening, testing for anemia and testing for renal impairment we will identify the incorrectly diagnosed and incorrectly treated patients. A further entirely distinct argument against the use of A1C for diagnosis is the lack of access to this test in many of the countries where diabetes is likely to increase most in prevalence over coming decades.

### HbA1c performs well in monitoring glucose control even in populations with high prevalence of medical conditions that may alter its reliability: the OPTIMAL observational multicenter study [^7b33c85f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The international guidelines recommend HbA1c for monitoring glycemic control and blood glucose test where HbA1c is unavailable. Despite this guidance, there remains concerns about the accuracy of HbA1c in populations with high frequency of other medical conditions that may alter its reliability. In this study, we used CGM to compare the accuracy of HbA1c, FPG and RPG tests in assessing glycemic control among patients with diabetes under conditions of everyday life in low-resource settings. The prevalence of other medical conditions that may alter HbA1c reliability was remarkably high. However, we found that HbA1c remained the most accurate test of average glucose control, despite the high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies, anemia and renal impairment. Similarly, FPG and RPG demonstrated reasonable accuracy as measures of average glycemic control, providing confidence that glucose tests provide a good measure of glycemia where HbA1c is not available. Furthermore, the very modest loss of diagnostic test performance using RPG provides some reassurance for use of this test in situations where a RPG is the only or most practical measure available.

### Glycosylated haemoglobin: a false sense of security [^68339042]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report the unusual case of a patient found to have a low glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) despite having recently been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient, who was not anaemic, with no symptoms or family history of haematological conditions, was subsequently found to have an elevated reticulocyte count, inferring increased red cell turnover as the culprit for the discordant HbA1c result. A diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis was made based on characteristic peripheral blood film appearances and confirmed by eosin-5-maleimide binding test. Exposure of an undiagnosed haemolytic anaemia by virtue of a low HbA1c is uncommon. However, conditions that distort HbA1c measurements are not infrequent. This case should serve to remind clinicians of the limitations of HbA1c in specified situations, and to remain vigilant when interpreting results.

### Novel indicator of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and shortened erythrocyte lifespan: a multicenter cross-sectional analysis [^896b867a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The level of HbA1c is primarily affected by three key factors: first, the HbA1c content in reticulocytes released from the bone marrow; second, the efficiency and level of glycosylation, where the level of glycosylation depends principally on blood glucose concentration, with individual variations in glycosylation efficiency; and third, the average lifespan of erythrocytes in the bloodstream, which determines the duration of hemoglobin (HB) exposure to glucose. The normal erythrocyte lifespan is approximately 120 days, but in certain conditions such as iron-deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia, and pregnancy, the erythrocyte lifespan can be shortened or lengthened, resulting in a mismatch between HbA1c and average blood glucose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the hyperglycemic environment and abnormal glycosylation can have adverse effects on hemoglobin and membrane proteins within erythrocytes. This not only leads to a decrease in erythrocyte membrane fluidity and a significant increase in erythrocyte osmotic fragility but also causes increased erythrocyte destruction, ultimately resulting in anemia and a shortened erythrocyte lifespan. These conditions are fairly common and can impact the physician's clinical decision-making. Consequently, when blood glucose levels are similar but the erythrocyte lifespan is abnormal, a divergence occurs between actual HbA1c and predicted HbA1c results. HbA1c then becomes a less reliable index of glycemic control, requiring the exploration of new and more reliable indicators of glycemic control.

Glycated albumin (GA) is another glycated protein used clinically to assess glycemic status, unaffected by erythrocyte status. In patients with a shortened erythrocyte lifespan, the GMI/GA ratio may provide an alternative to GMI/HbA1c for capturing individual differences in glycosylation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between GMI/GA and microvascular complications in T2DM patients with a shortened erythrocyte lifespan.

### HbA1c overestimates the glucose management indicator: a pilot study in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, and anemia using isCGM [^af5aa3ad]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 537 million people will be living with type 2 diabetes in the world by 2021 and 784 million by 2045. Up to a quarter of them live with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a prevalence that is increasing due to the improvement in life expectancy. It is, therefore, essential to achieve timely glycemic control that has an impact on mortality and cardiorenal outcomes. American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommend evaluating glycated hemoglobin at least twice a year in controlled patients, and at least four times a year in noncontrolled patients. However, there are multiple metabolic interactions between CKD and diabetes; thus, the interpretation of good control is not equivalent to that in patients without CKD. These include impaired glucose clearance by muscle due to uremia, decreased insulin clearance by a damaged kidney, persistence of a constant proinflammatory state, and overproduction of counterregulatory hormones.

In terms of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), there are multiple variables that make its interpretation difficult: race, the presence of anemia, the frequent use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents, and the reduction in the half-life of erythrocytes due to uremia make the value of HbA1c at follow-up biased or imprecise. Therefore, other biomarkers such as glycated albumin and fructosamine have been proposed; however, they lack precision and validation studies at the population level.

Diabetes technology and specifically continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may be useful to overcome these difficulties. Multiple studies have supported the use of CGM in the population with diabetes. Both intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) and real-time continuous glucose monitoring allow the calculation of internationally accepted metrics to assess glycemic control, such as the glucose management indicator (GMI) from interstitial glucose measurements, with the advantage that they are not affected by the metabolic alterations or deterioration of glomerular rate filtration. The GMI is based on the glucose average to give a value analogous to HbA1c and provides information for a more personalized diabetes management plan, which may be useful in patients with renal failure or anemia in whom there may be discrepancies between the HbA1c result and the patient's actual mean blood glucose.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^962377eb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

I concluded that A1C certainly reflects the phenomenon of hemoglobin glycation being proportional to mean glycemia and that the measurement is, of course, useful in understanding the glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes, but that one should not expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, suggesting that it will be important to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes. Any highly homogeneous population will be likely to show higher correlation between A1C and average glucose than is seen in the overall population of diabetic patients treated in clinical practice. Alternative A1C-derived indexes that include age, ethnicity, anemia, and renal function might, in fact, make A1C more useful and more clinically relevant. I further commented that these considerations call into question our current reliance on A1C as a "goal" and certainly lead one to be circumspect in recommending that it be used alone in diagnosis of diabetes in divergent populations, of varying age and ethnicity, and with underlying medical conditions affecting erythrocytes. Furthermore, these arguments suggest that glycemic self-monitoring of diabetic subjects not requiring insulin treatment would be likely to add considerably to A1C measurement in endeavoring to optimize the control of their diabetes.

Sacks reviewed the correlation of A1C with average glucose and suggested that laboratory information systems can be used to perform a variety of calculations, such as the estimated glomerular filtration rate. In a CAP survey of ∼3,000 laboratories in April 2009, 16.7% reported eAG, with 28.8% using the equation derived from the ADAG study, 22.6% using an equation derived from the DCCT A1C versus glucose dataset, and the remainder using other equations. He noted that the AACC recommendations in January 2009 "call on all labs in the U.S. to report eAG along with A1C" and suggested this to be reasonable for three reasons: first, because "healthcare providers find it useful", second, because the "ADA believes eAG facilitates communication", and, third, because its use is strongly supported by diabetes educators. He did not show information in support of these views.

### Optimal hyperglycemia thresholds in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a cross sectional study of oncologists' practices [^9f665478]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the parameters used to identify hyperglycemia, 12 studies in the review by Storey et al. used fasting blood glucose only, three used random blood glucose only, four used a combination of both, six used all available blood glucose values, five did not specify, and none used HbA1c. A surprising finding from our study is the high proportion of oncologists (78.6%) who reported relying on HbA1c to base their decisions to reduce, delay, or discontinue chemotherapy due to hyperglycemia. This parameter is not regularly used in the cancer setting because anemia or the receipt of blood transfusions can alter its results and lead to inappropriate treatment. Similarly, interpretation of HbA1c is also affected in patients with chronic kidney disease. This represents an important opportunity for education of oncologists. Random and postprandial blood glucose, rather than fasting blood glucose, are the best measures to capture glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. Time in range or glycemic variability obtained from continuous glucose monitoring provide better indication of glycemic control than HbA1c.

Our study has several implications for practice and research. Given discordance in guidelines reportedly used in clinical decision-making versus consistent blood glucose targets and HbA1c goals, future directions include exploring the need for resources that address oncology-specific hyperglycemia management. Development of oncology-specific guidelines or inclusion of patients with cancer as a special population within non-oncology guidelines could help to standardize management of patients with cancer and hyperglycemia. Further, it is unclear how the shift from a quantitative to a qualitative description of hyperglycemia severity in the CTCAE is perceived by oncologists and this aspect warrants future research. If the United Kingdom guidelines were to be adopted in the US, implementation in practice could still be an issue, as it takes an average of 17 years to translate evidence into practice. Both the guidelines and the open-ended comments in our study allude to the need to have a multidisciplinary approach to hyperglycemia management, including endocrinologists, PCPs, nurses, pharmacists, and dietitians. As such, future research should also focus on understanding how the larger interdisciplinary oncology team (beyond oncologists) approaches hyperglycemia management and potential treatment discontinuation. Agreeing on thresholds for treatment discontinuation from an oncology standpoint would be helpful for diabetes practitioners (e.g. endocrinologists, PCPs) to promote more frequent visits with patients and more frequent dose adjstments.

### HbA1c and iron deficiency: a review [^9d3e3025]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover influence HbA1c concentrations and the International Expert Committee has warned clinicians to be aware of any conditions that could affect the turnover of red blood cells. Although many forms of anemia are associated with lowering of HbA1c, iron deficiency has been shown to shift HbA1c slightly upward. The exact mechanism through which iron deficiency anemia affects HbA1c levels, however still remains unclear. The explanations provided above are merely speculations, warranting further studies to confirm and elucidate the role of these factors. As little work has been done in this field so future and large scale studies are required which may address HbA1c enhancing effect and the mechanism of increased HbA glycation in iron deficiency properly.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain blood glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes in conditions associated with an altered relationship between HbA1c and glycemia, such as hemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), G6PD deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy.

### Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as diagnostic criteria for diabetes: the optimal cut-off points values for the Pakistani population; a study from second national diabetes survey of Pakistan (NDSP) 2016–2017 [^497a38da]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Similarly, in our population, the optimal HbA1c cut-off point 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) was able to identify people with undiagnosed diabetes and 5.1% (32 mmol/mol) had an increased risk for progression to type 2 diabetes with high predictive sensitivity than recommended HbA1c values by ADA. Hence, these cut-offs similar to other reported studies are too high to use for screening diabetes in our populations. The discrepancy between our study and others may be caused by differences in study design, study participants demography and area location. Racial differences may affect optimal HbA1c threshold for diagnosing diabetes, therefore, more and more data are still needed from all over the world.

Age-stratified analysis of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes in our study shows the specific trends that also suggest the age-specific diagnostic threshold should be considered, if HbA1c being recommended as diagnostic standard similar to previous studies. Studies in Dutch and US population also present the HbA1c cut-off of 5.8% (40 mmol/mol) and 5.7% (39 mmol/mol), respectively. Accordingly, it seems difficult to develop a common HbA1c cut-off worldwide. Gender differences have also been reported in HbA1c levels being higher in men. This study showed no statistically significant difference in genders using both criteria. In a recent study, high specificity and sensitivity of HbA1c versus OGTT was noted after excluding 16% participants with anemia, but relatively very low number of these participants diagnosed with OGTT were compared with HbA1c, non-representative results. In this substudy, anemia was not determined as a confounding factor beyond the scope of 2nd NDSP (2016–2017) reported as our limitations. However, HbA1c is considered as an effective, more convenient and good alternative to FPG to diagnose complications in subjects with known diabetes, better indicator of chronic glycemic levels, has less pre-analytic instability and does not need a fasting or timed sample. Therapeutic decisions are also based on HbA1c value, so to improve the ability for screening prediabetes and NDD, additional FPG or OGTT tests are still necessary.

Based on topical results, considering HbA1c as a diagnostic tool we also have to diagnose anemia first. It is also a debate for new researchers regarding different HbA1c cut-offs for males and females by WHO and ADA similar to hemoglobin. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully choose HbA1c or FPG (OGTT) as diagnostic criteria.

Biology

Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) is formed by the non-enzymatic attachment of glucose to the N-terminal valine of the β-chain of hemoglobin over the red blood cells' lifespan. In healthy individuals, the average lifespan of red cells is 90 days, and therefore, A1C levels generally reflect the average blood glucose in the preceding 3 months. However, A1C values are influenced more by recent glucose levels than more distant ones as the mean level of blood glucose in the 30 days preceding the A1C contributes to ~ 50% of the A1C level. A1C measurements and reporting are highly standardized, and the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) ensures standardization and calibration of A1C assays, minimizing analytic variability between individual laboratories.

Special considerations in CKD

The interpretation of A1C levels in patients with CKD comes with numerous caveats (Table 1). Anemia is common in advanced CKD for multiple reasons, including reduced erythropoietin production by the kidney, inflammation, and the effect of circulating uremic toxins. When anemia is treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, there is an increase in circulating young red cells. Due to the shortened red cell lifespan and the higher number of immature red cells, there is a shorter time for glycation, resulting in A1C being lower than expected. Variable effects on A1C occur due to other factors in patients with CKD, including sickle cell trait (more common in Blacks), oxidative stress, inflammation, and acidosis. A1C levels also vary according to ethnicity and race, with some evidence of higher A1C levels in non-Whites than Whites. These factors influence both the diagnostic accuracy of A1C and its predictive validity in CKD.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1c in clinical medicine: an American perspective [^35293398]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Therefore, particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly decided based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c. In this commentary, however, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell life span has been developed, we present evidence that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^0d523e1c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline — assessment of glycemic control in chronic kidney disease (CKD) states that inaccuracy of the HbA1c measurement in reflecting ambient glucose concentrations must be considered, with falsely decreased values from reduced red blood cell lifespan, transfusions, and hemolysis, and falsely increased values from carbamylation of hemoglobin and acidosis. Evidence is mixed: an HbA1c increase of 1% correlated with a change in mean glucose of 20 mg/dL in hemodialysis patients and 30 mg/dL in those with normal kidney function, and at lower levels of glucose (< 160 mg/dL and HbA1c < 7.5%) hemodialysis patients tended to have higher glucose levels for a given HbA1c, whereas at higher levels the correlations were similar; when patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were evaluated, glucose levels were also found to be slightly higher than expected for a given HbA1c level. Importantly, all of these studies show a very wide variability in the glucose-HbA1c relationship. Iron supplementation or erythropoietin administration led to a modest fall of 0.5–0.7% in HbA1c along with the rise in total hemoglobin in patients with advanced CKD, but overall the modest changes with decreasing eGFR from 75 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and, even with hemodialysis, do not appear to be of clinical significance compared to the inter-individual variability, and neither peritoneal nor hemodialysis acutely change HbA1c levels.

### Hemoglobin A1c in African Americans with sickle cell trait… [^7715ded6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

An unpaired comparison of the AUROC curves indicated that the diagnostic ability of HbA1c to identify fasting glucose–defined prediabetes or diabetes was significantly lower among those with SCT than among those without it. Conclusions and Relevance Among African Americans from 2 large, well-established cohorts, participants with SCT had lower levels of HbA1c at any given concentration of fasting or 2-hour glucose compared with participants without SCT. These findings suggest that HbA1c may systematically underestimate past glycemia in black patients with SCT and may require further evaluation. The majority of participants had HbA1c and glucose measured at least twice. Using all available observations, the mean HbA1c was 5. 7% in those with SCT vs
6. 0% in those without SCT, despite similar mean fasting and 2-hour glucose values for those with SCT vs those without SCT, respectively.

Results for 2-hour glucose measures revealed similar HbA1c differences by SCT status. For a given 2-hour glucose level, HbA1c values were statistically significantly lower in those with SCT vs in those without SCT, for a mean HbA1c difference of −0. 30%. Hemoglobin A1c levels remained significantly lower in those with SCT in adjusted analyses. The difference in HbA1c levels by SCT status was greater at higher 2-hour glucose concentrations.

Irrespective of the mechanism, our results suggest that currently accepted clinical measures of HbA1c do not reflect recent past glycemia in the same way in African Americans with and without SCT, as evidenced by significantly lower HbA1c values at the same glucose concentration in those with vs without SCT. These results could have clinically significant implications.

A1C assay limitations and ancestry considerations in diabetes diagnosis: A1C may not be a suitable diagnostic test in people with anemia, those treated with erythropoietin, or those undergoing hemodialysis or HIV treatment, and some hemoglobin variants can interfere with A1C test results depending on the specific assay. The glucose-independent racial difference in A1C is small (~0.3 percentage points) and may reflect genetic differences in hemoglobin or red cell turnover that vary by ancestry; accordingly, the text emphasizes that we do not use race or ancestry as proxies for poorly understood genetic differences, while noting that the field lacks adequate genetic data in diverse populations.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^65f9223f]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The HbA1c test is used to measure the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in the blood in the past 3 months. It is used primarily to diagnose patients with diabetes mellitus and to monitor those diagnosed to assess their response to therapy. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes is diagnosed when HbA1c is ≥ 6.5%. Levels between 5.7–6.4% are considered prediabetes, while normal HbA1c is < 5.7%. Conditions such as different types of anemia can affect the levels of HbA1c in the blood. In general, conditions associated with decreased erythropoiesis (e.g. IDA) can falsely increase HbA1c because of the longer half-life of red blood cells. On the contrary, increased erythropoiesis resulting in rapid turnover of red blood cells can falsely lower HbA1c. Many previous studies done in this field showed highly contradictory results. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the effects of four groups of anemia, IDA, SCA, β-thalassemia trait, and megaloblastic anemia, on HbA1c levels compared to a control group. It was found that there is a statistically significant increase in HbA1c levels in IDA and SCA patients when compared to the control group.

### When the blood glucose and the HbA (1c) don't match: turning uncertainty into opportunity [^c1630b29]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

As we seek to prevent the complications of diabetes, the discordance between blood glucose and HbA 1c also has implications for health care, health policy, and clinical trials. For example, if HbA 1c is used as the primary measure of quality of diabetes care and provider performance, how is the apparent racial effect accounted for? If HbA 1c is used as a primary diagnostic indicator for diabetes, is a binary threshold appropriate or should the probability of disease be determined based on a range? If HbA 1c is used as the target outcome in clinical trials, how are interindividual differences in the glucose-HbA 1c relationship to be accounted for? While the literature appears to show that HbA 1c — whatever its limitations — remains the strongest predictor we have of at least the microvascular outcomes of diabetes, ignoring the multiple sources of information contained within the HbA 1c measurement will leave us with uncertainty as to what a particular HbA 1c level truly means.

In essence, as clinicians and scientists we should not be concerned with choosing blood glucose or HbA 1c as the most correct measurement. We do not need to succumb to the problem of a "man with two watches never knowing the time". Instead, we should consider the multiple measures as containing complementary information, with each telling us something about the patient. Moreover, let us consider agreement and conflict between measurements as an opportunity to better understand pathophysiology and raise the confidence we can have in individualizing treatment for all people with diabetes.

6 POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ERROR IN

There is a distinction between factors that interfere with the measurement of HbA 1c and those that interfere with its interpretation.

### Cardiometabolic risk profiles and carotid atherosclerosis in individuals with prediabetes identified by fasting glucose, postchallenge glucose, and hemoglobin A1c criteria [^d084896a]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The present results are in agreement with those recently reported in studies of adults from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), from the Screening for Impaired glucose tolerance (SIGT) study, from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), from a cohort of Asian Indians, and from a cohort of Arab ancestry. Higher A1C levels at any given level of FPG have been reported in Hispanics, American Indians, Blacks, and Asian Americans compared with their Caucasian counterparts, even after adjustment for confounding factors affecting glycemia. These disparities are likely due to differences in hemoglobin glycation or erythrocyte turnover among ethnic groups. Because previous studies have included cohorts of different ethnicities, the current results, which are based only on a cohort of Caucasian individuals, provides important information to help clinicians and patients of European ancestry understand the advantages and shortcomings of each test used alone or in combination. Notably, multiple nonglucose factors, such as hemoglobinopathies and anemia, can influence the accuracy of A1C measurement. Although individuals with undiagnosed anemia might possibly have been included in previous studies comparing the concordance of A1C, FPG, or 2-h postchallenge glucose tests for the identification of prediabetes, in the current study, we excluded individuals with conditions that affect red cell turnover, such as anemia and major blood loss, thus increasing the accuracy in the A1C measurement of the present results.

### Improving diabetes and pre-diabetes detection in the UK: insights from HbA1c screening in an acute hospital's emergency department [^8b95876a]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Although our results align with the existing literature on diabetes detection, the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients can vary significantly across different geographic locations. This variation may result in different rates of undiagnosed diabetes in other regions. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when applying HbA1c testing protocols in diverse ED settings. Moreover, the use of HbA1c in diagnosing diabetes is complicated by ethnic variability in the measurement, which is not necessarily reflective of glycemic status or hemoglobin structure and quantity. Studies have shown that HbA1c levels can vary among different ethnic groups independently of actual blood glucose levels. This variability is particularly pertinent in our population, where slight elevations in HbA1c may disproportionately indicate diabetes in some ethnicities compared with others. Such discrepancies necessitate cautious interpretation of HbA1c results and highlight the need for considering ethnic-specific reference ranges or supplementary diagnostic criteria.

It is important to address several limitations that may affect the broader applicability of our findings. Firstly, the accuracy of HbA1c as a diagnostic tool can be compromised by conditions that alter the quality or quantity of hemoglobin, such as anemia, hemoglobinopathies, or recent blood transfusions (though no patient was tested post-transfusion in this ED setting). These factors were not specifically controlled in our study and could lead to an underestimation of diabetes prevalence. Secondly, there is a potential selection bias since our study focused on patients who underwent bloodwork in the ED. These patients might differ from those who did not receive bloodwork, possibly having more comorbidities or symptoms that prompted testing, thereby affecting the generalizability of our results to all ED patients. In addition, our study was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalization of our findings. Furthermore, while we included sex as a covariate in all models and presented disaggregated results by sex, we did not collect data on gender identity, nor conduct a gender-based analysis. Future studies should consider incorporating gender-related variables, as social roles and access to care may influence diabetes risk and screening uptake.

### Mechanisms for racial and ethnic disparities in glycemic control in middle-aged and older Americans in the health and retirement study… [^e53b89db]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

There were no significant racial/ethnic differences in HbA1c levels in respondents not taking antihyperglycemic medications. In 1034 respondents taking medications, the mean HbA1c value was 8. 07% in black respondents and
8. 14% in Latino respondents compared with 7. 22% in white respondents. We examine 2 questions in the present study: Are there racial/ethnic disparities in HbA1c levels. If so, what patient-level factors contribute to the observed disparities in HbA1c levels. Of the variables for which we found racial differences, taking insulin, more diabetes-related comorbidities, lacking health insurance, reporting worse medication adherence, and higher levels of diabetes-specific distress were all associated with higher HbA1c levels.

In the fully adjusted linear regression model for respondents younger than 65 years, the black-white HbA1c differential was 1. 39%, with the model explaining
33. 0% of the variance in HbA1c levels, whereas the differential was 0. 33% for respondents 65 years or older, a difference that was not significant. In these fully adjusted models, insulin use, medication adherence, diabetes care self-efficacy, and diabetes-specific emotional distress were most significantly associated with HbA1c levels. Among respondents younger than 65 years, lack of current health insurance was also independently associated with higher HbA1c levels. Significant residual disparities in glycemic control persist even in the fully adjusted model, and the full model explains less than a quarter of the variance in HbA1c levels.

Potentially important unexplored mechanisms are genetic and other possible physiologic factors, such as stress, 3 measures of treatment intensity that include actual antihyperglycemic medication dosages, and environmental variables. 6 Whereas current research suggests suboptimal treatment intensification in diabetic patients of all ethnicities, 4, 45 further research should explore potential race-specific differences in provider intensification of antihyperglycemic treatment or patient acceptance of more intensive treatment.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^7b830d41]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the IDA group, the mean HbA1c was significantly higher than the control group (5.75% compared to 5.32%). In IDA, red cell production decreases, resulting in an increased age of circulating red blood cells. This will ultimately lead to higher HbA1c levels. We also demonstrated that treating anemia in iron-deficient patients significantly lowered the HbA1c to 5.44%. This finding was supported by multiple previous studies in the literature. Brooks et al. found that iron-deficient nondiabetic patients had increased HbA1c values and returned to normal after iron replacement. Moreover, Gram-Hansen et al. found that normal HbA1c concentrations in iron deficiency decreased to below-normal levels after iron therapy. On the other hand, Heyningen and Dalton showed no differences in HbA1c concentrations in nondiabetic patients with IDA before and after iron replacement. Their study, however, contained only 14 patients, which might be an underrepresentation. El-Agouza et al. explained the HbA1c production mechanism, stating that HbA1c levels reflect a balanced relationship between HbA1c and serum glucose concentrations. The HbA1c level is expressed as a percentage of total HbA. As a result, serum glucose is allowed to remain at a steady state, despite the decrease in hemoglobin concentration, which may result in an increase in the glycated fraction. In our study, patients were subdivided into two groups based on their hemoglobin level; the first group had a hemoglobin level of ≤ 9.5 g/dl and the second group had a hemoglobin level of > 9.5 g/dl. Although the lower hemoglobin group had a numerically higher HbA1c, this did not reach statistical significance. Ford et al. demonstrated that there is an inverse correlation between hemoglobin concentration and HbA1c levels, yet these findings were only for patients who had hemoglobin levels higher than 10 g/dl.

Emerging Glucose Metrics and Measures: Impact on Diabetes Outcomes

Moving "Beyond HbA 1c ": Need of the Hour

Measurement of HbA 1c is considered the gold standard method for assessing chronic glycemic control in people with diabetes. However, the measurement of HbA 1c has its limitations, including its inability to measure acute glucose fluctuations. Further HbA 1c is an unreliable measure in patients with anemia, iron deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, and during pregnancy; moreover, it does not provide information about hypoglycemia and on how to adjust the treatment regimen when HbA 1c levels are elevated. Therefore, although HbA 1c is a valuable indicator of glycation, as well as an indicator of population health and diabetic complications, some limitations do exist for this parameter as well.

Lack of Reliability of HbA 1c in Estimating Prevailing Glycemia: Concept of Glycation Gap

Absolute dependence on HbA 1c for assessment of glycemic control in diabetes may lead to an error in clinical assessment and management owing to either under- or overestimation of prevailing glycemia. The deviation of HbA 1c from serum fructosamine-predicted HbA 1c is defined as the glycation gap (GGap), and depicts an individually consistent difference between other measures of mean glycemia and HbA 1c. A glycation gap is found in around 40% of people with diabetes and is associated with diabetes-related complications and mortality. Individuals with a positive GGap may receive uptitration of glycemia treatment, putting them at undue risk for hypoglycemia. However, individuals with a negative GGap may be falsely reassured with a measured HbA 1c level that is lower than actual glycemic status. This does not result in appropriate therapy intensification to improve glycemia, putting such individuals at risk for diabetes-related complications. Therefore, for therapeutic purposes, using HbA 1c levels alone is not completely reliable for evaluating glycemic status.

SMBG: Limitations in Filling Glycation Gap

Although SMBG has gained broad application with the widespread availability of glucometers, this traditional method only measures single glucose values at time points determined by the user. Therefore, SMBG only provides a snapshot of the whole glucose picture — ignoring rapid glycemic changes occurring between SMBG measurements. It does not provide any indication of the rate or direction of glucose level changes. As a result, even frequent SMBG does not adequately reflect the GV or GGap in people with diabetes, since it provides only serial, single time-point measurements in 24-h glucose dynamics.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^4d78419d]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has many limitations. First, the retrospective nature of the study renders it subject to different types of bias. Also, the sample size of the sickle cell group and β-thalassemia group was relatively small, making interpretation of findings in these two groups difficult. Some patients came to our center already undergoing some treatment for their anemia (IDA and megaloblastic) so their initial hemoglobin levels might have been lower, which can affect the results. Also, since this was a retrospective chart review study, there was a large variation in the treatment of anemia in terms of dosing and route of administration. This might have affected some of the results; however, using the post-treatment hemoglobin level was our objective way of assessing response to therapy. Moreover, the degree of iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency was not severe. It would be interesting to see if severe deficiency can alter the HbA1c levels even more. Although we excluded patients with elevated fasting and post-prandial blood glucose, isolated HbA1c might still be a sign of impaired glucose tolerance and it would not be possible to differentiate this from the effect of anemia or abnormal hemoglobin. Finally, we only included patients who are not diabetics, and our results cannot be generalized to those known to have diabetes.

In conclusion, IDA and sickle cell disease can falsely increase HbA1c and correcting the anemia in IDA patients can decrease the HbA1c level back to baseline. Our study found that the level of hemoglobin was inversely related to the HbA1c level in patients with sickle cell anemia, while high RDW correlated with high HbA1c levels. Clinicians should use caution when depending on HbA1c to diagnose diabetes in those with IDA and sickle cell disease. We recommend correcting the anemia in patients with IDA before using HbA1c for diagnostic purposes. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to evaluate the effect of sickle cell disease and RDW on HbA1c.

### Evidence for interindividual heterogeneity in the glucose gradient across the human red blood cell membrane and its relationship to hemoglobin glycation [^aafad4c5]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

A1C is the current gold standard for determination of chronic glycemic control in people with diabetes. Yet it is common to find hematologically normal people with diabetes in whom A1C appears discordant from other measures of glycemic control. Some have suggested the notion of a "hemoglobin glycation index" to assess A1C discordance from mean blood glucose. We have quantitated this discordance with the use of the glycation gap (GG), a measure of the disparity between two integrated measures of glycemic control, one intracellular in red blood cells (RBCs), A1C, and the other extracellular, glycated serum protein (GSP) measured as fructosamine. A non-zero GG could result from differences between the ambient glucose concentrations or rates of glycation in the intracellular and extracellular compartments, and/or interindividual differences in the turnover/metabolism of underlying proteins. We have demonstrated that the GG is reproducible within subjects over time and is associated with important clinical end points. In longstanding type 1 diabetes, there is a over a twofold rise in prevalence of nephropathy in patients with high GG versus low GG. GG is also a predictor of retinopathy. Furthermore, approximately one-third of the heritable component of A1C is shared in common with a heritable component of the GG, suggesting a genetically determined mechanism for discordance between fructosamine and A1C.

As indicated by Higgins et al. two factors other than plasma glucose influence the level of glycated hemoglobin: lifespan and "glucose permeability" of the RBC. Yet there has been little systematic investigation of how interindividual variability in these parameters may affect the relationship between measured A1C levels and plasma glucose. In another study, we examined differences in RBC survival and reported variability that can produce significant deviations of A1C from expected values. We focus here on glucose permeability, i.e. the concentration of glucose within versus outside the RBC. Glucose transport across the RBC membrane mediated by the GLUT1 transporter is complete within seconds at body temperature. Thus, in addition to plasma glucose and RBC lifespan, "equilibrium" intracellular glucose, rather than the rate of glucose transport, is likely the determining factor in hemoglobin glycation.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^1c04aaab]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases worldwide with significant morbidity and mortality. HbA1c remains one of the most important methods for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Since HbA1c is a reflection of the glucose attached to red blood cells, factors affecting hemoglobin and red blood cells' half-life can influence HbA1c measurements.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the effect of different types of anemia including iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, β -thalassemia trait, and megaloblastic anemia on HbA1c levels in a tertiary hospital over the past 6 years (2016–2022).

Method

This is a retrospective chart review study of 324 patients including those with one of the four types of anemia mentioned above and a control group. The control group were healthy adults with normal HbA1c and hemoglobin, who were not known to have diabetes or anemia. Patients with diabetes or prediabetes based on self-reporting or elevated fasting, random blood sugar, or 2hours post-prandial blood glucose were excluded.

Results

The mean HbA1c levels were significantly higher in sickle cell anemia at 5.83% (95% CI = 5.39–6.28) and in iron deficiency anemia at 5.75% (95% CI = 5.68–5.82) when compared to the control group at 5.32% (95% CI = 5.22–5.41). However, the mean HbA1c levels in megaloblastic anemia were 5.38% (95% CI = 5.26–5.5) and 5.45% (95% CI = 5.21–5.69) in beta thalassemia trait, which were not significantly different when compared to the control group. HbA1c significantly decreased from 5.75 to 5.44% after treatment in the iron-deficient group with a p-value of < 0.001. Moreover, lower hemoglobin and higher red cell distribution width correlated with higher HbA1c levels in patients with sickle cell anemia.

Conclusion

This study found a significant increase in HbA1c levels in iron deficiency anemia and sickle cell disease in patients not known to have diabetes. However, there was no significant effect in those patients with β-thalassemia trait and megaloblastic anemia. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia significantly decreased the HbA1c level, bringing it back to normal.

### HbA1c overestimates the glucose management indicator: a pilot study in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, and anemia using isCGM [^72bd2502]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There are multiple mechanisms by which HbA1c values can be altered in chronic kidney disease (CKD), which limits its usefulness as a strategy to assess glycemic control in this population.

Methods

Concordance and agreement study between two diagnostic tests: HbA1c and glucose management indicator (GMI) measured by intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM), based in a prospective cohort of patients with diabetes, CKD (glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 60ml/min/1.73m²), and anemia. The isCGM was performed for 3months, and the GMI was compared with the HbA1c levels taken at the end of isCGM. Agreement was evaluated using Bland-Altman graph analysis and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). The concordance of the measures with good glycemic control (< 7%) was also evaluated.

Results

A total of 74 patients were enrolled (median age 68.5years, 51.3% female, 64.9% with CKD stage 3, hemoglobin 11.1 ± 1.2g/l). The Bland-Altman analysis shows a mean difference between GMI and HbA1c of 0.757 ± 0.687% (95% limits of agreement: -0.590 and 2.105). Difference was greater as the values of GMI and HbA1c increased. The agreement was poor [CCC 0.477; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.360–0.594], as well as the concordance of values with good glycemic control according to GMI versus HbA1c (67.5% versus 29.7%, p < 0.001) (Kappa 0.2430; 95% CI: 0.16–0.32).

Conclusion

The HbA1c overestimates the GMI values with highly variable ranges of difference, which prevents a precise correction factor. isCGM probably is a safer option for monitoring and decision-making in this population, especially in patients treated with insulin where the risk of hypoglycemia is greater.

FPG and RPG have broadly similar diagnostic performance in identifying patients with poor glycemia control

Among participants without conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability (including hemoglobinopathies, anemia and renal impairment), RPG and FPG had similar correlation with HbA1c (0.74; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.80) and (0.78; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84), respectively (figure 2). The equivalent thresholds and diagnostic performances of FPG and RPG for predicting HbA1c defined suboptimal glucose control (at different HbA1c thresholds), restricted to those without conditions thought to alter HbA1c reliability, are shown in table 3. FPG and RPG had very similar performance in identifying those with suboptimal glycemic control (table 3). For the widely used HbA1c target of 7.0%, the AUC ROC for these tests was similar (FPG 0.76, RPG 0.77). At their respective optimal thresholds (FPG ≥ 7.1 mmol/L and RPG ≥ 10.5 mmol/L), the tests had a similar sensitivity (FPG −81.0, 95% CI 71.9 to 88.2 vs RPG −81.6, 95% CI 72.7 to 88.5) and specificity (FPG −71.4, 95% CI 55.4 to 84.3 vs RPG −72.1, 95% CI 56.3 to 84.7) for identifying suboptimal glycemic control. The linear equations for estimating HbA1c from FPG and RPG among patients with diabetes were HbA1c (mmol/mol) = 5.40*FPG+21.3 and HbA1c = 3.07*RPG+28.58, respectively, for patients without comorbidities thought to alter HbA1c (online supplemental table 4).

### Understanding the clinical implications of differences between glucose management indicator and glycated haemoglobin [^08124de8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory measured glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control in people with diabetes and correlates with their risk of long-term complications. The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has highlighted limitations of HbA1c testing. HbA1c can only be reviewed infrequently and can mask the risk of hypoglycaemia or extreme glucose fluctuations. While CGM provides insights in to the risk of hypoglycaemia as well as daily fluctuations of glucose, it can also be used to calculate an estimated HbA1c that has been used as a substitute for laboratory HbA1c. However, it is evident that estimated HbA1c and HbA1c values can differ widely. The glucose management indicator (GMI), calculated exclusively from CGM data, has been proposed. It uses the same scale (% or mmol/mol) as HbA1c, but is based on short-term average glucose values, rather than long-term glucose exposure. HbA1c and GMI values differ in up to 81% of individuals by more than ± 0.1% and by more than ± 0.3% in 51% of cases. Here, we review the factors that define these differences, such as the time period being assessed, the variation in glycation rates and factors such as anaemia and haemoglobinopathies. Recognizing and understanding the factors that cause differences between HbA1c and GMI is an important clinical skill. In circumstances when HbA1c is elevated above GMI, further attempts at intensification of therapy based solely on the HbA1c value may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. The observed difference between GMI and HbA1c also informs the important question about the predictive ability of GMI regarding long-term complications.

Comparison of FPG and RPG measurement with HbA1c

As HbA1c is the measure which has been robustly validated against clinical outcomes, we performed additional analysis, where we assessed the strength of the relationship between HbA1c and each of the FPG and RPG tests in the absence of medical conditions that might affect HbA1c reliability. Participants were considered to have no other medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability if they met the following characteristics: no hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell trait and HbC), absence of anemia (Hb in women ≥ 120 g/L, men ≥ 130 g/L), and no renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). In participants without these medical conditions, we determined diagnostic performance of the glucose tests for suboptimal glucose control defined by HbA1c at the following thresholds: HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), ≥ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%), 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), 64 mmol/mol (8.0%), 69 mmol/mol (8.5%) and 75 mmol/mol (9.0%). Equivalent thresholds of FPG and random glucose for predicting suboptimal glycemic control were obtained by linear regression analysis.

### Implications of iron deficiency / anemia on the classification of diabetes using HbA1c [^a7a8b4f4]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

ID-related changes in the hemoglobin molecule as well as anemia-induced erythrocyte turnover differences may result in inaccurate HbA1c measurements for estimates of diabetes prevalence. Though HbA1c levels may not accurately reflect glycemia status if individuals have certain anemias, blood loss or ID, the magnitude and direction of the associations between ID and/or anemia with diabetes prevalence using HbA1c has not been determined. Furthermore, we are aware of no population-based studies examining differences in the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes according to mutually exclusive categories of ID alone, anemia alone or IDA versus normal iron/hemoglobin. We addressed this gap, finding that fewer women with ID alone versus normal iron/hemoglobin were predicted to have diabetes HbA1c relative to diabetes FBG, diabetes HbA1c+FBG or as nondiabetic. Compared with men with normal iron/hemoglobin, however, more men with anemia alone were predicted to have prediabetes HbA1c relative to prediabetes FBG, prediabetes HbA1c+FBG or normoglycemia. The direction of association between IDA and diabetes/prediabetes using HbA1c versus FBG were mixed across our statistical models. These findings have important implications for diabetes prevalence estimates across developing countries with a high prevalence of both ID and anemia, as well as for developed countries, where HbA1c is often considered preferable to FBG for glycemia assessment.

Multiple small, clinic-based studies have examined IDA–HbA1c relationship, however, inconclusive findings from these studies may be because ID and anemia represent two different disease processes. ID, when mild, does not have clinically relevant effects on hemoglobin levels, whereas severe ID results in concurrent ID and anemia. Though most anemia is due to ID, a large proportion of anemia cases are due to sickle cell disease or other thalassemias, vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency. Thus, combining ID and anemia in research studies may mask heterogeneous disease processes underlying the relationship between IDA and HbA1c. For example, ID may artificially increase HbA1c by inducing changes to the shape of the hemoglobin molecule, promoting glycation of the terminal valineor by lowering erythrocyte turnover, allowing more time for glycation of hemoglobin to occur. Some anemias, on the other hand, may artificially lower HbA1c because of increased erythrocyte turnover. We know of no population-based studies to date that have addressed these potentially different mechanisms by using two separate measures of glycemia status and mutually exclusive categories of ID alone, anemia alone, IDA or normal iron/hemoglobin.

Comparison of glucose and HbA1c measures with CGM measured glucose in daily living

We assessed the strength of the relationship between CGM assessed mean glucose over 2 weeks and each of FPG, RPG and HbA1c using Pearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression. Analysis was based on RPG and HbA1c tests performed on the last visit (visit 3), unless not available, in which case values from visit 1 were used instead (n = 9). To assess the impact of other medical conditions (anemia, hemoglobinopathies, and renal impairment) on HbA1c reliability, we subdivided the cohort into those without medical conditions that may alter HbA1c reliability and those with medical conditions that may alter HbA1c reliability. HbA1c performance in comparison to CGM was assessed in all participants regardless of comorbidities, and by presence or absence of medical conditions thought to affect test performance (see below). Equivalent thresholds for predicting suboptimal glycemic control (defined as CGM glucose values ≥ 8 and ≥ 10 mmol/L) were derived from linear regression equations. We compared the performance of RPG and FPG and HbA1c to identify participants with CGM glucose values ≥ 8 and ≥ 10 mmol/L using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and assessed the sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values of these tests using the equivalent cut-offs derived from linear regression equations.

### A1c for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice [^c3ac0eb5]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A1C as a screening/diagnostic tool has some limitations. The main issues are method bias, which is now being addressed by Internation Federation of Clinical Chemistry standardization and certain confounding medical conditions (hemoglobinopathies and anemia). Most new A1C methods can identify or are unaffected by hemoglobinopathies. Anemia is also readily identifiable.

The cost of A1C has also been raised as a concern. While A1C analysis, per se, is more expensive than for glucose, the overall differences are small once the costs for blood collection are accounted for. From our own estimates, total costs are AUD $10.20 for A1C compared with AUD $8.80 for FPG and AUD $12.10 for a two-point collection of OGTT. These cost comparisons are consistent with reports from other countries. Further, the time and inconvenience to patients in having to fast for an OGTT cannot be ignored.

A1C ≤ 5.5% and ≥ 7.0% predicts with 97.5% confidence the absence or presence of type 2 diabetes using the OGTT as a reference. Many with impaired A1C have pre-diabetes, while diabetes is highly probable when A1C reaches 6.5–6.9%. Impaired A1C thus requires follow-up and lifestyle modification. Although the cost of A1C is slightly higher than for FPG, the overall efficiency of using A1C as a first line for diabetes screening may facilitate early diagnosis and reduce the health burden associated with diabetes complications.

### Associations between features of glucose exposure and A1c: the A1c-derived average glucose (ADAG) study [^e49a3605]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Our study shows that no single blood glucose measurement during the day accurately predicts A1C. This is in accordance with previous studies showing that single or limited numbers of blood glucose measurements daily do not accurately reflect A1C levels. However, any insights into the specific timed glucose measurement or combination of measurements that have the largest effect on A1C can help patients and clinicians to plan optimal glucose-monitoring regimens.

Levels of FBG alone were not clear indicators of overall hyperglycemia. The correlation coefficients to indexes of hyperglycemia and average or postprandial blood glucose levels are between 0.60 and 0.70 in the present study. This adds to previous findings showing that A1C and postchallenge blood glucose are difficult to predict from FBG values alone. Bouma et al. found a correlation coefficient of 0.77 between A1C and FBG in 1,020 individuals with type 2 diabetes.

This study is based on frequent glucose monitoring during real-life activities in a large, heterogeneous population of people with diabetes and those without diabetes and provides the opportunity to assess reliably the different features of glycemia. The limitations of the study are that the ADAG study population was selected to exclude patients with severe renal/liver disease, pregnancy, and anemia. Therefore, the results may not be extrapolated to all patients with diabetes. However, patients were chosen to span a large range of A1C levels. Moreover, the ADAG study recruited a broad multicenter population, so we feel it is justifiable to draw general conclusions from our results.

The fact that participants had stable A1C (< 1% A1C change 6 months prior to study) could have lead to underestimation of glucose variability. However, high levels of glucose variability were seen among our subjects despite stable A1C levels. Even though type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have different glucose patterns due to different disease mechanisms, the mechanism of hemoglobin glycation is likely to be the same. The correlation of the glycemic indexes were therefore calculated for the combined group. Limitations of the MiniMed CGM system include the inability to measure glucose values < 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) or > 22.2 mmol/l (400 mg/dl) (measurements outside this range were treated as 2.2 or 22.2 mmol/l, respectively, for the analyses). The mean FBG is derived from prebreakfast measurements and thus can contain blood glucose not preceded by 8 h of fasting.

### Correlates of poor glycemic control among patients with diabetes initiating hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease [^53665fcf]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Whether HbA1c accurately reflects mean blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes on hemodialysis is somewhat controversial, as some would argue that it may not be a reliable marker for long-term glycemic control. Dialysis patients have shorter erythrocyte lifespan, and low concentrations of erythrocytes in those with anemia or the predominance of younger erythrocytes observed in patients who are on iron replacement therapy or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can result in falsely low HbA1c values, underestimating the patient's glycemic state. While some studies have advocated the use of glycated albumin and fructosamine as alternative measures of glycemic control in dialysis patients, these markers are easily influenced by various physiological conditions. Moreover, the within-subject variation of fructosamine is higher than that of HbA1c, and the use of fructosamine as a marker for glycemic control would depend on normal serum albumin levels, which are rarely observed in dialysis patients. In the absence of consistent and ample clinical data supporting the use of glycated albumin and fructosamine as potential markers of glycemic control, it would be reasonable to use HbA1c as the reference standard for hemodialysis patients with diabetes.

Our study has some limitations. Due to the cross-sectional design of the study, we cannot establish directionality of the observed associations. Prospective epidemiological studies are needed to address the question of whether these sociodemographic and clinical factors lead to higher HbA1c levels or whether poor glycemic control leads to these risk factors. We also cannot rule out potential residual confounding due to the observational nature of the study. Furthermore, we could not determine and adjust for the severity of comorbidities because these data were abstracted from an administrative database. Lastly, the USRDS does not reliably distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We used the occurrence of diabetes in patients of ages < 40 and ≥ 40 years as a surrogate for type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively, but there is some diagnostic uncertainty in using this imperfect approach to making the distinction between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, especially in light of the fact that there is a growing frequency of type 2 diabetes in younger patients and that patients with type 1 diabetes may have reached ESRD after 40 years of age. Despite these limitations, the study herein takes advantage of two unusually large and detailed data sources to characterize patients according to a wide array of demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as clinical parameters, and to assess associations between these variables and HbA1c control.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 213 adults were enrolled in the study. Of these participants, 9.86% (21/213) were excluded for insufficient data. Characteristics of excluded participants were broadly similar to those included in analysis, as shown in online supplemental table 1. Out of 213 participants, 192 had sufficient data for inclusion in the final analysis (see flow chart: online supplemental figure S2). The median CGM duration was 14 (IQR 13–14) days. Participant characteristics are presented in table 1. Average glycemic control was poor with a median (IQR) HbA1c of 67 (52.0–90.0) mmol/mol (8.3% (6.9–10)). The other medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability were common, occurring in 32.8% (63/192) of participants, of whom 9.4% (18/192) had anemia, 22.4% (43/192) had hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell trait (n = 43) and/or hemoglobin AC (HbAC) (n = 1)), and 6.3% (11/190) had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Characteristics according to absence or presence of medical conditions that may affect HbA1c reliability are shown in online supplemental table 2.

FPG and CGM glucose (closest value, within 15 min) were highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98). CGM values showed a modest bias toward lower glucose than FPG, with CGM values mean 1.3 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.5) mmol/L lower — this was consistent across the range of glycemic control (online supplemental figure S3).

### Evaluation of HbA1c and glucose management indicator discordance in a population of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes [^c426d6f5]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose management indicator (GMI) is a useful metric for the clinical management of diabetic patients using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). In adults, a marked discordance between HbA1c and GMI has been reported. To date, no studies have evaluated this discordance in children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Methods

HbA1c and real-life CGM data of the 12weeks preceding HbA1c measurement were collected from 805 children/adolescents. The absolute difference between HbA1c and GMI was calculated for both the 12-week and 4-week periods preceding HbA1c measurement and the proportion of discordant patients was defined according to specific thresholds in the entire study population and in subjects stratified by type of CGM, insulin therapy, gender, age and puberty. Regression analyses were performed with HbA1c-GMI discordance as dependent variable and patients' characteristics as independent ones. A new GMI equation for children and adolescent was derived from the linear regression analysis between mean glucose and HbA1c.

Results

HbA1c-GMI discordance calculated on the 12-week period was < 0.1, ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1.0 in 24.8, 33.9 and 9.2% of the subjects, respectively. No significant differences in the proportion of discordant patients were found comparing patients stratified by type of CGM, insulin therapy, gender, age and puberty. GMI-HbA1c discordance was not significantly explained by age, gender, BMI, type of CGM, insulin therapy, hemoglobin, anemia and autoimmune diseases (R 2 = 0.012, p = 0.409). HbA1c-GMI discordance calculated on the 4-week period was comparable. GMI (%) equation derived for this cohort was: 3.74+0.022x (mean glucose in mg/dl).

Conclusions

GMI could be meaningfully discordant respect to HbA1c in more than a third of children/adolescents with T1D. This discrepancy should be taken into careful consideration when the two indices are directly compared in daily clinical practice.

### Assessment of diabetes and prediabetes prevalence and predictors by HbA1c in a population from sub-saharan Africa with a high proportion of anemia: a prospective cross-sectional study [^8b432698]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Background

For the past few decades, diabetes mellitus (DM) and especially type 2 DM became a major global public health problem. Projections for the increase of DM prevalence are most dramatic for developing countries, and in particular for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as consequence of the fast demographic and epidemiological transition. Therefore, prevention and strategies against DM are on the current agenda of many developing countries including Tanzania and other nations in SSA. However, epidemiological data about DM prevalence are relatively scarce in the region, and most studies in Tanzania were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. At that time, the DM prevalence in Tanzania was estimated at about 2% and impaired glucose tolerance at about 8%, with a trend of a higher prevalence in urban areas than in rural areas. The 2016 WHO diabetes profile estimates a current DM prevalence of 4.3% in Tanzania and illustrates a clear trend of rising numbers for the past three decades. However, this might not reflect the true burden of this chronic disorder, because according to the International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas from 2017, an estimated majority (> 60%) of DM remains undiagnosed in SSA. In the light of these trends and projections, approaches for better screening and early diagnosis of DM are most needed.

None of the diagnostic methods for the detection of DM is considered a true "gold standard" test. Conventionally, blood glucose levels are determined in either a fasting state or at random, or after the intake of a standard portion of glucose. In recent years, however, the switch to a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) based diabetes diagnosis found more evidence-based support. Although HbA1c tests are expensive compared with blood glucose measurements, Dagogo-Jack et al pointed out in a recent publication, that HbA1c testing offers "real hope" for research and clinical work in SSA, as the less demanding logistics allow the test application even in remote parts of the continent.

However, the diagnosis of DM based on HbA1c also presents substantial difficulties and needs further exploration. The method is based on the entire lifespan of the erythrocyte, and HbA1c is an intergrated index over this time period with indication of chronic glycemia rather than glycemia at a particular point in time. Therefore, HbA1c can be affected by genetics and hematologic factors. The latter aspect may be of particular importance in SSA where a high proportion of the population is affected by anemia.

HbA1c has the strongest relationship with CGM glucose in an African population, even in participants with comorbidities thought to alter HbA1c reliability

The relationship between HbA1c, FPG and RPG tests and average CGM glucose is shown in figure 1. There was a strong correlation between all the three tests and mean CGM glucose. HbA1c had the strongest correlation (0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), followed by FPG (0.82; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86) and RPG (0.76; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.81). The derived linear equations for estimating mean glucose from HbA1c, FPG and RPG among patients with diabetes are shown in online supplemental table 3. The diagnostic performances of HbA1c, FPG and RPG tests for diagnosing suboptimal glucose control (defined by illustrative mean CGM thresholds of 8 and 10 mmol/L) are shown in table 2. There was a very modest loss of diagnostic performance using FPG compared with HbA1c, at equivalent thresholds. HbA1c was the most sensitive and specific test followed by FPG.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^0ccea247]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Fourth, abnormal hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin S and F, can sometimes cause an erroneous HbA1c reading. In our lab, we use high-performance liquid chromatography to measure HbA1c utilizing the D-100 system from Bio-Rad. Although this method has not been reported in the literature as being affected by abnormal hemoglobin, we think that it is still a plausible explanation for the falsely higher HbA1c in our sickle cell group. Another possible explanation is the interesting finding that RDW, a measure of difference in size and volume of red blood cells, was significantly higher in the lower Hb group of patients with SCA. Bao et al. found that RDW was independently related to higher HbA1c through non-glycemic ways in patients without diabetes while it didn't affect fasting and random blood sugar readings. Finally, the number of patients with sickle cell anemia in our study is relatively small compared to those in the other studies mentioned.

There is a paucity of studies regarding the effect of β-thalassemia trait on HbA1c in non-diabetics. It is hypothesized that β-thalassemia trait can falsely lower HbA1c through multiple mechanisms. First, ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis can shorten the lifespan of erythrocytes, resulting in lower HbA1c. Additionally, elevated hemoglobin F levels can affect some of the laboratory methods used to measure HbA1c. Our results showed no effect on HbA1c in patients with β-thalassemia trait compared to the control group. Also, there was no relation between the severity of anemia and HbA1c levels. A study by Tsilingiris et al. found that the mean HbA1c percentage in those with heterozygous thalassemia was similar to those without β-thalassemia trait. However, they demonstrated that there is an inverse relation between hemoglobin concentration and HbA1c. They concluded that this correlation is of negligible clinical significance, and they advocated for continuing to utilize HbA1c in diagnosing diabetes mellitus in those with β-thalassemia trait.

Besides increasing age and BMI, acute infection was a further predictor for IGM. This is in line with the known bidirectional interaction between infectious disease and IGM.DM is associated with immune-dysregulation and increased susceptibility to infections, and infectious conditions contribute to the dysregulation of the glucose metabolism. Therefore, particularly in SSA, where endemic infectious diseases remain highly prevalent, the growing DM pandemic will further contribute to the "double burden of disease" and take its toll on the populations well-being and the health systems.

Testing HbA1c offers advantages and conveniences, such as preanalytical stability, better reproducibility and no requirement for fasting. A quick point-of-care test without fasting requirements might be very useful in the setting of semirural SSA.

A decade ago, an expert panel reported that HbA1c testing for DM diagnosis is limited in patients with anemia, due to a more rapid erythrocyte turnover, which lowers the non-enzymatic glycosylation of Hb and decreases the HbA1c level in such patients. In our analyses, there was no evidence of a relevant interaction in the whole population as well as in the explored subgroups between HbA1c and Hb values. Only in the subgroup of men a statistically significant correlation was observed. However, the correlation was very weak, and — other than one would expect — reversed, that is, men with anemia had higher HbA1c levels than men without anemia. This is in line with findings from data analyzed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2002, where only marginal effects between HbA1c concentration and Hb were observed.

### The effect of iron and erythropoietin treatment on the A1c of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^8ea709d1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

ESAs and intravenous iron are commonly used therapies in the management of anemia in patients with CKD. Patients with both diabetes and CKD have a higher prevalence of severe anemia compared with patients with CKD alone. Despite the increased usage of ESA agents, recent findings have shown that the correction of anemia to levels of hemoglobin in excess of 12.5 g/dl in patients with type 2 diabetes using this therapy has not led to an improvement in mortality but rather an increased risk of stroke. This needs to be interpreted carefully, as the two groups received disproportionate amounts of intravenous iron. Indeed, in the placebo group it was noted that there was in increase in the hemoglobin levels with ESA agents. Hence, best practice would suggest that correction of functional and absolute iron deficiency should be obtained prior to commencement of ESA. This is the first study to robustly show that iron and ESA treatments result in a fall in A1C, which is independent of glycemic changes in patients with diabetes and CKD stage IIIb and IV.

Discordantly high A1C values compared with glucose readings have been reported in previous studies and case reports on nondiabetic patients with iron deficiency and in patients with type 1 diabetes in childhood and pregnancy. The correction of the iron deficiency in all these patient groups has lead to a fall in A1C values in these patients, though the monitoring of glycemic control of patients has not been as robust compared with our study (using methods such as fasting plasma glucose or two premeal readings a day).

Several studies have also shown a fall in A1C concentrations following ESA treatment in patients with diabetes undergoing hemodialysis. Other than a single case report, there was scarce data to support the class effect of this therapy on patients not on hemodialysis.

Nakao et al. reported a fall in A1C in nondiabetic patients with CKD on hemodialysis following ESA therapy. The 1.2% fall in their study was much larger when compared with our results. A plausible explanation is that in contrast to our study, iron therapy was given concurrently, which has likely to have potentiated the A1C-lowering effect reported. A proportion of patients in our study had both therapies, and though there was a similar trend of combined lowering of A1C in this group, this failed to reach statistical significance.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^808e61f3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^7087a26c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated a large sample of Chinese non-diabetes adults to explore the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels. Our results showed that Hb levels were independently and negatively associated with HbA1c levels in both men and women.

Anemia is a common condition, clinically defined as a hematocrit value or blood Hb level that is below the normal range. Anemia is often associated with diabetes and is known to increase the risk of diabetes-related complications. However, previous studies that investigated the association between Hb and HbA1c levels in patients with anemia have yielded contradictory conclusions. While several studies have reported that HbA1c level was significantly higher in individuals with anemia, others did not identify a difference in HbA1c levels between individuals with anemia and healthy controls, or found a lower HbA1c level in patients with anemia.

Recently, Grossman et al. conducted a large retrospective cohort study including 11,352 elderly non-diabetic community individuals to evaluate the association between Hb and HbA1c levels. Although they found that Hb levels were significantly lower among individuals in the highest HbA1c quintile than among individuals in the other quintiles, the correlation between HbA1c and Hb levels was negligible. In our study, the correlation between Hb levels in the normal range and HbA1c levels was positive in the unadjusted model but became non-significant after adjusting for age and sex and became negative after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Differences in the reported association between Hb and HbA1c levels between studies might reflect the differences in study design and confounding variables used for adjustment.

The HbA1c test is easy to perform, making it widely available as an ideal tool for busy primary care and endocrine practices. However, the HbA1c level is impacted by numerous factors, such as race, RBC disorders, and hemoglobinopathies. Moreover, iron deficiency anemia may cause a spurious increase in HbA1c values. Our findings supported an independent negative association between Hb and HbA1c levels among non-diabetes adults with normal Hb levels, with this relationship being stable in both men and women.

### Anemia in type 2 diabetic patients and correlation with kidney function in a tertiary care sub-saharan African hospital: a cross-sectional study [^8f037d7d]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the prevalence of anemia in the type 2 diabetic population in Cameroon is high, including in patients with normal kidney function. However, declining kidney function appears as the main determinant. Our findings suggest that patients with diabetes should be routinely screened for anemia, and have other non-renal causes checked. Further, the findings raise issues regarding the added economic burden to diabetic patients attributable to anemia, and the cautious interpretation of the HbA1c level in sub-Saharan Africans.

### Response to comment on: hardikar et al. spuriously high prevalence of prediabetes diagnosed by HbA (1c) in young Indians partly explained by hematological factors and iron deficiency anemia. diabetes care 2012; 35: 797–802 [^b8440ea6]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

We are grateful to Schindhelm et al. for their interest in our article. We measured HbA 1c during follow-up of a birth cohort in the hope of substituting it for an oral glucose tolerance test. We found a discrepancy between the results of the oral glucose tolerance test (World Health Organization, 1999) and HbA 1c (American Diabetes Association, 2009): A large number of individuals were classified as having "prediabetes" by HbA 1c when considered normal glucose tolerant by oral glucose tolerance test. This prompted us to investigate possible causes of this discrepancy. We found that a number of hematological parameters (lower hemoglobin concentration, lower mean corpuscular volume, lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and higher red cell distribution width) predicted higher HbA 1c. These hematological parameters were indicative of iron deficiency, so we measured serum ferritin concentrations. We found that lower ferritin concentrations also predicted higher HbA 1c, supporting an association with iron deficiency. We did not find an association of HbA 1c with another nutritional problem, i.e. vitamin B12 deficiency, which is quite common in this population. We searched the literature and found supportive data that HbA 1c is elevated in iron deficiency. We admit that our interpretation of previous studies about prolonged erythrocyte survival in iron deficiency was not accurate.

Unfortunately, we do not have reticulocyte measurements in our study, nor do we have the expertise to perform the measurements that Schindhelm et al. suggest. We agree that the explanation for elevated HbA 1c concentrations in iron deficiency could be more complex than those suggested in the past. We would appreciate if Schindhelm et al. could transfer the technology to us to make relevant measurements.

Irrespective of the possible explanation, the basic findings and conclusions of our study remain valid; i.e. young nondiabetic individuals with iron deficiency have an inappropriately high HbA 1c concentration. In a subsequent study of 232 rural adolescents, we found a similar pattern: those with hemoglobin concentrations below 12 g% (n = 116) were 45% prediabetic by HbA 1c criteria compared with 15.5% in those with hemoglobin concentrations above 12 g% (P < 0.001) despite normal glucose tolerance. Use of HbA 1c to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes in nutritionally compromised populations might produce misleading estimates of prevalence.

### Assessment of glycaemic status in adult hospital patients for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus: a systematic review [^0e5b248c]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study nation varied across the studies included in this review, which may contribute to variation in the study outcomes as HbA1c has been found to underestimate average blood glucose in African‐Americans populations with sickle cell traitand higher HbA1c values have been reported in African‐Americans and American Indians compared with white Americans, independent of haemoglobin variants.

Only one study (Karakonstantis et al.) excluded individuals with medical conditions, which might affect HbA1c accuracy. HbA1c can underestimate glycaemia in HIV‐infectedand G6PD‐deficientindividuals, and overestimate glycaemia in people with iron‐deficiency anaemia. Corticosteroid use can cause persistent hyperglycaemia ('steroid diabetes')so its effect on HbA1c should be considered, especially in a hospital patient population, although literature on the subject is scarce. The possibility that illness preceding hospital admission, including acute pancreatic damage or renal failure, could perturb HbA1c should also be considered as a possible limitation. Both NICE and the ADA recommend cautious interpretation of HbA1c and suggest oral glucose tolerance testing or fasting blood glucose testing be used for individuals with conditions that might affect HbA1c. This should be incorporated in future study designs and clinical judgment exercised in considering the possibility of conditions that may alter HbA1c.

Variation in thresholds used to define hyperglycaemia and HbA1c among the identified studies prevented an overall assessment of the diagnostic performance of the thresholds applied. In addition, comparison of study results was hindered because the reporting of findings differed between studies, with each using different measures of diagnostic performance. WHO guidelines state that a fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L is diagnostic of diabetes, so it is perhaps surprising that six reviewed studies use thresholds lower than this for random blood glucose testing. Two of these based their thresholds on previous publications; Hng et al.cite Valentine et al.and Jelinek et al.cite Hewat et al.and George et al.both of which were deemed ineligible for inclusion in this review because neither used HbA1c for reference diagnostic testing.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^2b7a37b4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Sickle cell anemia was defined as an HbS level of 75–95%, HbF of 2–25%, and positive genetic testing. We included only those with sickle cell disease rather than the trait. Iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed based on a hemoglobin level of less than 130 g/L (13 g/dL) in men and less than 120 g/L (12 g/dL) in non-pregnant women in addition to an MCV level of less than 80 fL and a ferritin level of less than 30 mcg/L. Megaloblastic anemia is defined as a low hemoglobin level as mentioned above with a vitamin B12 level of less than 148 pmol/L. Although megaloblastic anemia can also be caused by folate deficiency, we only included those caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Beta-thalassemia trait was diagnosed based on genetic testing and HbA2 of 4% or more. Abnormal fasting blood glucose was defined as more than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and an abnormal glucose tolerance test with blood sugar at more than 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). Those patients were excluded.

The patient's data were collected from the electronic medical records and entered into the data collection sheet, which contained multiple variables: age; gender; type of anemia; comorbidities age; hemoglobin level; hemoglobin A1C; red blood cell count; mean corpuscular volume (MCV); red cell distribution width (RDW); mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH); creatinine level; bilirubin level; ferritin level for IDA patients; and vitamin B12 for patients with megaloblastic anemia. HbA1c is measured in our center using high-performance liquid chromatography utilizing the D-100 system from Bio-Rad.

### Pitfalls of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes [^c82732ed]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Many health care providers screen high-risk individuals exclusively with an HbA1c despite its insensitivity for detecting dysglycemia. The 2 cases presented describe the inherent caveats of interpreting HbA1c without performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The first case reflects the risk of overdiagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an older African American male in whom HbA1c levels, although variable, were primarily in the mid-prediabetes range (5.7–6.4% [39–46 mmol/mol]) for many years although the initial OGTT demonstrated borderline impaired fasting glucose with a fasting plasma glucose of 102 mg/dL [5.7 mmol/L]) without evidence for impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose ≥ 140–199 mg/dl ([7.8–11.1 mmol/L]). Because subsequent HbA1c levels were diagnostic of T2D (6.5%-6.6% [48–49 mmol/mol]), a second OGTT performed was normal. The second case illustrates the risk of underdiagnosing T2D in a male with HIV having normal HbA1c levels over many years who underwent an OGTT when mild prediabetes (HbA1c = 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) developed that was diagnostic of T2D. To avoid inadvertent mistreatment, it is therefore essential to perform an OGTT, despite its limitations, in high-risk individuals, particularly when glucose or fructosamine and HbA1c values are discordant. Innate differences in the relationship between fructosamine or fasting glucose to HbA1c are demonstrated by the glycation gap or hemoglobin glycation index.

### Relative contributions of preprandial and postprandial glucose exposures, glycemic variability, and non-glycemic factors to hbAin individuals with and without diabetes [^73e1270c]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

The frequent CGM measurement periods during free-living conditions in combination with HbA 1c measured by high-quality techniques after 3 months of glucose exposure made it possible to assess the contributions of real-life glycemic exposures to the variation in HbA 1c in a large heterogeneous group of individuals with and without T2D. HbA 1c is a measure of the average blood glucose concentration over the last 8–12 weeks and is determined by glycemic as well as genetic, hematologic, and illness-related factors. Changes in the lifespan of the erythrocytes can therefore affect HbA 1c concentrations, such that a higher mean age of erythrocytes will lead to higher HbA 1c concentrations. The average survival of erythrocytes is slightly longer in men (117 days) than in women (106 days), so also sex can confound HbA 1c concentrations in a given population. Accordingly, we adjusted for age and sex in our analyses. In the ADAG study, individuals with anemia or with severe liver or renal disease were excluded from participation in order to avoid effects of iron deficiency anemia on HbA 1c concentrations. Factors, unrelated to age and sex, have been examined in twin studies. In non-diabetic, healthy, female twins with similar glucose tolerance, 62% of the between-person variation in HbA 1c was attributable to genetic factors, with the remainder reflecting age and environmental factors. The relatively high contribution of non-glycemic factors to HbA 1c in non-diabetic individuals may explain the relatively poor overlap among fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, and HbA 1c in this population. This also suggests that markers other than HbA 1c might better capture the relatively subtle differences in glycemia among non-diabetic individuals.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^b69c2f1e]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

A1C-based glycemic assessment — In people with diabetes, A1C reflects average glycemia over approximately 2–3 months, and measurement approximately every 3 months is used to determine whether glycemic goals have been reached and maintained. A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia, and for individuals prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency and/or intensive insulin therapy) glycemic status is best evaluated by the combination of results from blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and A1C, because discordant results between A1C and BGM or CGM can occur due to high glycemic variability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measurement, or inaccurate A1C.

### What clinical laboratorians should Do in response to extremely low hemoglobin A1c results [^e96af2ed]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Extremely low hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) results below reference range are rare, and the causes and clinical implications associated with low HbA1c results are not well understood among clinical laboratorians. A case of extremely low HbA1c results was reported, in which liver cirrhosis, subacute hemorrhage and recent transfusion all contributed to the low result. This case illustrates when HbA1c should not be used as a clinically relevant diabetes marker. However, low or extremely low HbA1c (< 5.0% or < 4.0%) may occur in apparently healthy individuals. When this occurs, it is an independent risk factor associated with liver diseases, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. From the clinical laboratory perspective, the clinical cause of extremely low HbA1c should be determined, and suggestions of different test utilization or increased health surveillance should be given to care providers.

### Effect of biological variation in HbA1c and blood glucose on the diagnosis of prediabetes [^8cb48c5d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The diagnostic dilemma

Diabetes can be clinically diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‐hour plasma glucose following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT) or glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All three metrics are continuous variables in human populations with no inflection points that differentiate between normal glucose metabolism and chronic hyperglycaemia. Marked overlap in what's normal and what's abnormal led to the use of 'prediabetes' as a clinical diagnosis for individuals with inconclusive test results. Normal, prediabetic and diabetic reference ranges recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) represent the medical community's best estimate of what can be expected in metabolically normal people compared to those with Type 2 diabetes. Periodic prediabetes screening is now recommended for all people between 35 and 70 years of age based on FPG, 2hOGTT or HbA1c. The problem with this multimetric approach is that prediabetes diagnoses based on these three common clinical tests often disagree.,

1.2 Are two metrics better than one?

In an effort to develop a more specific, timely and unambiguous approach to diabetes diagnosis, Selvin et al.proposed a two‐dimensional, single‐sample definition of confirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having both FPG and HbA1c levels above their respective ADA diabetes cutpoints. The investigators used this confirmation‐by‐agreement approach to analyse data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and found that 'A single‐sample confirmatory definition of diabetes had a high positive predictive value for subsequent diagnosis and was strongly associated with clinical end points'. The authors defined unconfirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having either FPG or HbA1c but not both above their respective cutpoints and suggested that diagnostic ambiguity should be addressed by monitoring FPG and HbA1c over time.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^c9ea0933]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^baab24c8]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic test characteristics for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) indicate that diagnostic tests are fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and HbA1c. For instance, the FPG is highly reproducible; the OGTT, which does not fare as well on reproducibility, is effective in identifying dysglycemia, and this is a good reason to use the OGTT as a confirmation test if the initial test result is equivocal. The OGTT may not be readily available at some medical settings, requires fasting before the test, lasts at least 2 hours, and includes an unpalatable glucose drink, which can limit its outpatient use. The HbA1c test is easy to obtain as fasting is not required; it provides a measure of chronic hyperglycemia and has been shown to increase evaluation for T2DM in primary care; it is also the recommended test for monitoring prediabetes. However, the sensitivity of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes is lower in children when compared with adults, HbA1c levels can be 0.1% to 0.2% higher in individuals with iron deficiency anemia, and fasting insulin is not recommended for diagnosis of prediabetes or T2DM.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^19a51662]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a known cause of megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B12 is crucial for DNA synthesis during erythropoiesis, and its deficiency, which results from inadequate intake or malabsorption, is associated with the decreased synthesis of healthy, mature RBCs. According to the hypothesis that HbA1c increases with aged RBCs and decreases with increased amounts of immature blood cells, HbA1c was hypothesized to be normal in megaloblastic anemia (MA) since it is associated with decreased RBC synthesis with no aged RBCs.

Since HbA1c measures the sugar attached to hemoglobin, abnormalities in hemoglobin can theoretically falsely affect the level of HbA1c, which can be reflected in diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. Falsely low HbA1c can delay diabetes diagnosis or give the physician the impression that diabetes is well-controlled. On the contrary, a falsely elevated HbA1c can mislabel patients with diabetes and lead to associated psychological stress and unnecessary treatment. Our study aims to evaluate the effect of different types of anemias, including IDA, SCA, β-thalassemia trait (BT), and megaloblastic anemia, on HbA1c levels in King Abdulaziz Medical City, a tertiary university hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over the past 6 years.

Clinicians should obtain information regarding the coefficient of variation (CV) from the methodology used at their site". The "HbA1c range reflects an 'HbA1c average goal' over time" and "Intensification or relaxation of therapy should be undertaken based on individual clinical circumstances and treatment options". The guideline adds, "We discourage medication changes in response to a single HbA1c test that falls slightly outside target ranges, especially if it is discordant with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results". It notes "African Americans, on average, have HbA1c levels about 0.4% higher than Whites", and "The VA/DoD DM CPG does not recommend the use of estimated average glucose derived from HbA1c levels".

### Glucose meters: a review of technical challenges to obtaining accurate results [^fc098468]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Glucose meters are universally utilized in the management of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic disorders in a variety of healthcare settings. Establishing the accuracy of glucose meters, however, is challenging. Glucose meters can only analyze whole blood, and glucose is unstable in whole blood. Technical accuracy is defined as the closeness of agreement between a test result and the true value of that analyte. Truth for glucose is analysis by isotope dilution mass spectrometry, and frozen serum standards analyzed by this method are available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Truth for whole blood has not been established, and cells must be separated from the whole blood matrix before analysis by a method like isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Serum cannot be analyzed by glucose meters, and isotope dilution mass spectrometry is not commonly available in most hospitals and diabetes clinics to evaluate glucose meter accuracy. Consensus standards recommend comparing whole blood analysis on a glucose meter against plasma/serum centrifuged from a capillary specimen and analyzed by a clinical laboratory comparative method. Yet capillary samples may not provide sufficient volume to test by both methods, and venous samples may be used as an alternative when differences between venous and capillary blood are considered. There are thus multiple complexities involved in defining technical accuracy and no clear consensus among standards agencies and professional societies on accuracy criteria. Clinicians, however, are more concerned with clinical agreement of the glucose meter with a serum/plasma laboratory result. Acceptance criteria for clinical agreement vary across the range of glucose concentrations and depend on how the result will be used in screening or management of the patient. A variety of factors can affect glucose meter results, including operator technique, environmental exposure, and patient factors, such as medication, oxygen therapy, anemia, hypotension, and other disease states. This article reviews the challenges involved in obtaining accurate glucose meter results.

### Misleading hemoglobin A1c levels in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [^3a278a6e]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report a case of a patient with diabetes mellitus and unexpectedly low hemoglobin A1c results associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). We review the impact of shortened RBC half-life on the interpretation of hemoglobin A1c levels.

Methods

Patient history and laboratory test results were obtained from electronic medical records and analyzed.

Results

The patient's hemoglobin A1c declined in parallel to worsening anemia after the diagnosis of PNH. However, elevated serum glucose (random), fructosamine, and glycated albumin suggest ongoing hyperglycemia. Together, these results argue that the decline in hemoglobin A1c was due to decreased RBC survival secondary to PNH.

Conclusions

Hemoglobin A1c levels must be interpreted with caution in patients with hematologic diseases that change RBC survival. Serum fructosamine and glycated albumin measurements are alternative measures of time-averaged blood glucose control and may be useful in this subset of patients.

### Investigating the reliability of HbA1c monitoring for blood glucose control during late pregnancy in patients with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with and without β-thalassemia minor [^637acf01]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which has potentially adverse consequences, is a growing public health problem. The prevalence of GDM in China has increased significantly in recent years. Glucose control is the key medical intervention in cases of GDM.

The goal of glycemic control during pregnancy should be to keep blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible without inducing hypoglycemia. It is essential to find an accurate indicator of blood sugar, as this can provide valuable information for achieving glycemic control. Strict glycemic control should be implemented through self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). It is difficult to perform blood glucose measurements in every patient, but blood glucose control can be monitored by measuring HbA1c. This approach is more specific and has lower biological and analytical variability than the fasting glucose test. There is a continuously increasing demand for the routine testing of HbA1c to detect diabetes mellitus and (especially) for long-term glycemic control.

Although the HbA1c reference interval for the general population is well established, the reference interval for healthy pregnant women is not clearly defined. Different studies have reported different trends in HbA1c during pregnancy: HbA1c levels during pregnancy can gradually or very frequently increase or decrease. It is difficult to use HbA1c to monitor glycemic control in GDM patients due to the dramatic changes in physical condition that occur during pregnancy and the different genetic backgrounds of pregnant women. Thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobin disease. Hemoglobinopathy can affect the HbA1c value, potentially leading to an inaccurate judgment of the patient's blood glucose control.

The clinical manifestations of thalassemia are very diverse. The clinical classification scheme for β-thalassemia includes β-thalassemia major (TM; severe), β-thalassemia intermedia (TI; intermediate), and β-thalassemia minor (mild). TM refers to patients with severe anemia from the early stages of life on who require lifelong blood transfusion and iron chelation. TI patients are a highly diverse group who present various clinical severities: mild, moderate, and moderate-severe anemia. However, β-thalassemia minor is often asymptomatic or presents as mild anemia, and such patients do not require blood transfusion. Genetic counseling is needed. β-Thalassemia minor is caused by the presence of a single β-thalassemia mutation; the β-globin gene on the other chromosome is normal.

### A laboratory standpoint on the role of hemoglobin A1c for the diagnosis of diabetes in childhood: more doubts than certainties? [^352fcc5c]. Pediatric Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Lippi G, Targher G. A laboratory standpoint on the role of hemoglobin A1c for the diagnosis of diabetes in childhood: more doubts than certainties? The American Diabetes Association has recently included the measurement of hemoglobin A1c (A1c) among the criteria for diagnosing diabetes, so that this diagnostic strategy might also be extended in childhood and adolescence. Although the possibility of using A1c testing for screening and even diagnosing diabetes is highly appealing, A1c testing cannot be considered as yet the 'panacea' for a variety of reasons that include the suboptimal correlation with the mean blood glucose, the risk of misdiagnosis in children or adolescents with impaired renal function, iron-deficiency anemia and increased red blood cell turnover, the interference from hemoglobin variants, and the heterogeneous diagnostic performance among different populations. Additional limitations include the higher imprecision of most A1c assays (especially point-of-care testing devices) when compared with plasma glucose measurement, as well as the incremental cost deriving from routinely replacing plasma glucose with A1c determination. Taken together, the current limitations would suggest a certain degree of caution before recommending the widespread implementation of the A1c assay for diagnosing diabetes in childhood and adolescence. The potential clinical benefits (if any) of replacing blood glucose testing with A1c for diagnosing diabetes are still uncertain and will probably remain so until reliable cost-effective analyses are available.

### Assessment of diabetes and prediabetes prevalence and predictors by HbA1c in a population from sub-saharan Africa with a high proportion of anemia: a prospective cross-sectional study [^556c924c]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Definitions

DM was defined if one of the following criteria was fulfilled: a positive history of DM, the use of antidiabetic medication, or a HbA1c of ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), prediabetes (pre-DM) was defined if HbA1c ≥ 5.7%–6.49% (39–47 mmol/mol). Impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) was defined when either a DM or pre-DM was present in a patient. The blood glucose test was considered as fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurement, if the time lag between the last meal and the enrolment time was ≥ 8 hours. For the correlation with HbA1c values, a FBG measurement ≥ 7 mmol/L and a random blood glucose (RBG) ≥ 11.1 mmol/L was classified as DM, a FBG ≥ 5.6–6.9 mmol/L and a RBG 7.8–11.1 mmol/L as pre-DM, according to the ADA fasting plasma glucose classification. Anemia was defined according to WHO classification, if hemoglobin (Hb) was < 130.0 g/L in male and < 120.0 g/L in female patients. Acute systemic infection/inflammation was defined if one of the following criteria was fulfilled: body temperature ≥ 38.5°C (armpit), diagnosis of acute malaria, acute tuberculosis, newly diagnosed HIV, and urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI was defined with a cut-off of > 20 leukocytes/high power field in urinary sediment.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes of the study were DM, pre-DM, and IGM prevalence rates and predictors based on HbA1c measurements. Secondary outcome was to explore whether there is a relevant interaction between HbA1c and Hb levels.

### HbA1c overestimates the glucose management indicator: a pilot study in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, and anemia using isCGM [^e658a65c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The correlation between GMI and HbA1c was moderate (r = 0.728, p < 0.05) with a 1.5 percentage point increase in HbA1c values (16 mmol/mol) for every 1% increase in GMI [Figure 1(a)]. The Bland–Altman graphic analysis showed an average difference between GMI and HbA1c values of 0.757 ± 0.687%, with 95% limits of agreement between −0.590 and 2.105. The difference was greater as the GMI and HbA1c increased [Figure 1(b)]. Agreement was poor according to Lin's CCC (0.477; 95% CI: 0.360–0.594). These findings were consistent in the subgroup analysis according to glomerular filtration rate and serum Hb level (Figure 2).

### Falsely low glycosylated haemoglobin levels probably secondary to hypersplenism in a patient with diabetes mellitus [^f8a049fc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his 70s presented with a history of low glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values despite a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. His blood glucose readings ranged between 8 and 15mmol/L, but his HbA1c values were below 27mmol/mol. Initial investigations demonstrated evidence of reduced red blood cell lifespan as a cause of misleadingly low HbA1c values. Further investigation revealed chronic liver disease and splenomegaly, with hypersplenism being the probable cause of increased red blood cell turnover. HbA1c estimation was no longer reliable, so ongoing diabetic care was guided by home capillary blood glucose monitoring. Healthcare providers and clinical laboratorians need to be aware of the possible clinical implications of very low HbA1c values in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^83e42e55]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.
