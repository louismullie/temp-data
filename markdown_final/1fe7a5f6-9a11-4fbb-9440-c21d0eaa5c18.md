## Question

Can plavix be used in a fib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Plavix (clopidogrel) can be used in atrial fibrillation, in which situations it might be appropriate, and how to balance its benefits and risks. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indication for clopidogrel and the pathophysiology of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence comparing clopidogrel-based strategies to oral anticoagulation. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions for stroke prevention in AF without coronary indications. After that, I need to examine the special case of AF with ACS or PCI, where antiplatelet therapy is often layered onto anticoagulation. Finally, I should consider practical safety issues, pharmacogenomics, and synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats for exceptions and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the basics. Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 inhibitor indicated for ACS and for secondary prevention after MI, stroke, or PAD; it is not indicated for primary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, which is driven by left atrial thromboembolism and requires anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy for optimal prevention [^115VaVTp] [^111dttGL].

> Wait, let me verify the head-to-head evidence. The ACTIVE W trial randomized high-risk AF patients to warfarin versus clopidogrel plus aspirin and was stopped early because warfarin was clearly superior for preventing stroke and vascular events, with no bleeding advantage for dual antiplatelet therapy, establishing that oral anticoagulation beats clopidogrel plus aspirin for AF stroke prevention [^116eNDpP] [^113uwMJb].

> I should double-check the evidence for patients who cannot take warfarin. ACTIVE A showed that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced stroke versus aspirin alone in AF patients unsuitable for VKA therapy, but at the cost of increased major bleeding; the absolute risk reduction in stroke was modest and the absolute increase in major bleeding was substantial, so the net clinical benefit is small and must be individualized [^113pBi6F] [^112D4DVL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought dual antiplatelet therapy might approximate anticoagulation in some patients, but ACTIVE W definitively refutes that, and contemporary guidelines align with this, recommending oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel for stroke prevention in AF when anticoagulation is feasible [^116eNDpP] [^111dttGL] [^114zYr9z].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Current ACC/AHA/HRS guidance gives a Class 3 Harm recommendation against using aspirin alone or aspirin plus clopidogrel as an alternative to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF patients who are candidates for anticoagulation, emphasizing DOACs as preferred agents when no mechanical valve or rheumatic mitral stenosis is present [^111dttGL] [^114zYr9z]. CHEST similarly recommends oral anticoagulation over antiplatelet strategies across stroke-risk strata, reserving aspirin plus clopidogrel only for those who truly cannot take any oral anticoagulant and after informed consent about inferior stroke prevention and higher bleeding [^1169yWdE] [^116SGXZT].

> But wait, what if the patient has AF and an ACS or PCI? I need to check the coronary scenario carefully. In AF patients undergoing PCI, the default is to minimize bleeding by using dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) with a DOAC plus a single antiplatelet agent, preferably clopidogrel, and to limit triple therapy (OAC plus DAPT) to the shortest feasible duration when stent thrombosis risk is high, typically no more than 1 week to 1 month depending on ischemic versus bleeding risk balance [^112aGFJM] [^114NLm97] [^116cfv9E]. ACC expert consensus supports stopping aspirin early (often 1–4 weeks) and continuing a P2Y12 inhibitor with OAC, with clopidogrel favored over prasugrel or ticagrelor in this setting due to lower bleeding risk, and ticagrelor reserved for select high-ischemic-risk cases with caution [^115XwcrN] [^116prmf5] [^114JSdcw].

> I should confirm duration and transitions. For AF with ACS, DAT with a DOAC plus clopidogrel is generally continued for 6–12 months, then antiplatelet therapy is stopped and OAC monotherapy is used thereafter, with shorter DAPT/DAT durations considered in high bleeding risk or low ischemic risk patients [^115XwcrN] [^114NLm97]. For chronic coronary disease beyond one year after revascularization or stable CAD without recent stenting, OAC monotherapy is preferred over OAC plus single antiplatelet therapy to reduce major bleeding, so clopidogrel should generally be discontinued in that context unless there is a separate compelling antiplatelet indication [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

> Let me consider safety and pharmacology. Clopidogrel increases major bleeding risk, particularly gastrointestinal and procedural bleeding, and its antiplatelet effect is irreversible for the platelet lifespan, necessitating a 5-day hold before elective surgery. Concomitant omeprazole or esomeprazole reduces active metabolite formation and should be avoided when possible [^114idcBs] [^114Wxd3C]. I should also verify CYP2C19 considerations: randomized data show no significant interaction between CYP2C19 loss-of-function status and clopidogrel efficacy in AF, so routine genotype-guided dosing is not supported in this population, though vigilance for high on-treatment platelet reactivity remains reasonable in complex PCI scenarios [^114zBHEX] [^113kagvw].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize this. If a patient with AF has no coronary indication, clopidogrel should not be used for stroke prevention. Initiate OAC according to CHA2DS2-VASc and use DOACs preferentially when appropriate. If AF coexists with ACS or recent PCI, favor DAT with a DOAC plus clopidogrel and limit triple therapy to the shortest necessary period, reassessing ischemic and bleeding risks at regular intervals to step down to OAC monotherapy as soon as safe [^114zYr9z] [^112aGFJM] [^114NLm97]. If the patient cannot take any OAC, a careful discussion of the modest net benefit of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone, with explicit counseling on increased bleeding and inferior stroke prevention, is warranted before prescribing dual antiplatelet therapy off-label [^113pBi6F] [^112D4DVL].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: clopidogrel is not a substitute for anticoagulation in AF and is generally inappropriate for primary stroke prevention in AF without a coronary indication. It has a limited, second-best role only when anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, and otherwise belongs in AF management primarily as part of short-term DAT after ACS/PCI where its lower bleeding profile than other P2Y12 inhibitors is advantageous [^116eNDpP] [^111dttGL] [^115XwcrN] [^114NLm97].

Plavix (clopidogrel) is **not recommended for routine stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF)** because it is significantly less effective than oral anticoagulants (OACs) and increases bleeding risk when combined with aspirin [^116eNDpP] [^113pBi6F]. Current guidelines state that clopidogrel **should not be used alone or with aspirin as an alternative to OACs** in patients with AF who are eligible for anticoagulation [^111dttGL] [^114zYr9z]. The only scenario where clopidogrel is considered is in **AF patients with recent ACS/PCI**, where short-term dual antithrombotic therapy (OAC plus clopidogrel) is used to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, and even then, aspirin is minimized or omitted to reduce bleeding [^114NLm97] [^115XwcrN] [^112aGFJM]. For AF patients who cannot take OACs, clopidogrel plus aspirin is a modestly effective but bleeding-prone alternative, and patients should be informed of its inferiority to OACs [^113pBi6F] [^112D4DVL] [^116SGXZT].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **ACTIVE W trial**: Clopidogrel plus aspirin was inferior to warfarin for preventing stroke/systemic embolism and was stopped early for superiority of warfarin [^116eNDpP] [^113uwMJb].

- **ACTIVE A trial**: Clopidogrel plus aspirin reduced stroke vs aspirin alone but increased major bleeding; net benefit is modest and bleeding risk is higher [^113pBi6F] [^112D4DVL].

- **ACC/AHA/HRS 2023 guidelines**: Strongly recommend OACs over aspirin or clopidogrel for stroke prevention in AF; clopidogrel is not recommended as monotherapy or with aspirin for AF stroke prevention [^111dttGL] [^114zYr9z].

- **ESC 2024 guidelines**: Recommend OACs as first-line therapy; clopidogrel is considered only in specific post-ACS/PCI scenarios with careful bleeding risk management [^114NLm97] [^116cfv9E].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

### Atrial fibrillation with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

In AF with ACS/PCI, **triple therapy (OAC + aspirin + clopidogrel)** is used only when ischemic risk clearly outweighs bleeding risk and for the shortest possible duration (≤ 1 month) [^1178otRd] [^116cfv9E]. The **preferred strategy** is **dual antithrombotic therapy (OAC + clopidogrel)** with early aspirin cessation (≤ 1 week) to reduce bleeding, continuing for up to 6–12 months based on ischemic/bleeding risk [^114NLm97] [^115XwcrN].

---

### Atrial fibrillation with chronic coronary disease (CCD)

For AF with CCD beyond 1 year post-revascularization or stable CAD without prior stenting, **oral anticoagulation monotherapy** is recommended over combination therapy (OAC + aspirin or clopidogrel) to reduce bleeding [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

---

### Atrial fibrillation with peripheral artery disease (PAD)

For AF with PAD, **monotherapy with OAC** is recommended over dual therapy (OAC + aspirin or clopidogrel) to reduce bleeding risk [^117N5nKd] [^116rhMpc].

---

## Risks and benefits

| **Clinical scenario** | **Benefit** | **Risk** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| AF without ACS/PCI | None | Increased bleeding | Not recommended |
| AF with ACS/PCI | Reduced ischemic events | Increased bleeding | Short-term use only |
| AF with CCD | None | Increased bleeding | Not recommended |
| AF with PAD | None | Increased bleeding | Not recommended |

---

## Alternative anticoagulant therapies

- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Preferred over warfarin for most AF patients due to lower bleeding risk and no routine monitoring [^114zYr9z] [^1126frCA].

- **Warfarin**: Alternative for patients with mechanical heart valves or severe renal impairment [^114zYr9z].

- **Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO)**: Considered for patients with high thromboembolic risk who cannot tolerate long-term OACs [^115LCjBq] [^113tuFh6].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing clopidogrel use

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk (e.g. HAS-BLED ≥ 3) contraindicates clopidogrel use.

- **Ischemic risk**: High ischemic risk (e.g. prior stroke/TIA, multiple risk factors) may necessitate anticoagulation over clopidogrel [^114zYr9z].

- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, liver disease, and age ≥ 75 increase bleeding risk with clopidogrel.

- **Drug interactions**: CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) reduce clopidogrel efficacy [^114idcBs].

---

## Current clinical recommendations

Current recommendations are: **do not use clopidogrel alone or with aspirin as an alternative to OACs** for stroke prevention in AF patients eligible for anticoagulation [^111dttGL] [^114zYr9z]. Clopidogrel may be used **short-term in AF patients with recent ACS/PCI** as part of dual antithrombotic therapy, with careful bleeding risk management [^114NLm97] [^115XwcrN]. For AF patients who cannot take OACs, clopidogrel plus aspirin is a modestly effective but bleeding-prone alternative, and patients should be informed of its inferiority to OACs [^113pBi6F] [^116SGXZT].

---

Plavix (clopidogrel) is **not recommended for routine stroke prevention in AF** because it is less effective than OACs and increases bleeding risk when combined with aspirin. Its use is limited to specific post-ACS/PCI scenarios with careful risk assessment and short-term duration.

For patients with AF and mitral stenosis who are unsuitable for or choose not to take adjusted-dose VKA therapy (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) alone (Grade 1B).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic efficacy — adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation versus aspirin: Adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation is more efficacious than aspirin for prevention of stroke in patients with AF, with a 33% risk reduction (95% CI 13% to 49%) in a meta-analysis of 5 trials. Randomized trials involving high-risk AF patients (stroke rates greater than 6% per year) show larger relative risk reductions by adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation relative to aspirin, whereas relative risk reductions are consistently smaller in trials of AF patients with lower stroke rates; accordingly, oral anticoagulation may be most beneficial for AF patients at higher intrinsic thromboembolic risk, and the need for anticoagulation must be reevaluated periodically in all patients with AF.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix):
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking other drugs increasing the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and long-term NSAIDs. Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgeries with a major risk of bleeding.
- **Cardiovascular events**: use caution when discontinuing clopidogrel. Restart clopidogrel as soon as possible if temporarily discontinued.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: use caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.
- **TTP**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb percutaneous coronary intervention: Following percutaneous coronary intervention or revascularization surgery in patients with AF, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d) may be given concurrently with anticoagulation, but these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C). In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation may be interrupted to prevent bleeding at the site of peripheral arterial puncture, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed as soon as possible and the dose adjusted to achieve an INR in the therapeutic range; the maintenance regimen should then consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) with clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 mo after a bare metal stent, at least 3 mo for a sirolimus-eluting stent, at least 6 mo for a paclitaxel-eluting stent, and 12 mo or longer in selected patients, and when warfarin is given with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin the dose intensity must be carefully regulated (Level of Evidence: C).

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Plavix is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for:

Acute coronary syndrome
For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia. (1.1)
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary PCI is unknown. (1.1)
Recent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. Plavix has been shown to reduce the combined endpoint of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new MI (fatal or not), and other vascular death. (1.2)

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)], including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia.
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown.

The optimal duration of Plavix therapy in ACS is unknown.

1.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

### Effect of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113pBi6F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but are considered unsuitable in many patients, who usually receive aspirin instead. We investigated the hypothesis that the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin would reduce the risk of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A total of 7554 patients with atrial fibrillation who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable were randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel (75 mg) or placebo, once daily, in addition to aspirin. The primary outcome was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-central nervous system systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes.

Results

At a median of 3.6 years of follow-up, major vascular events had occurred in 832 patients receiving clopidogrel (6.8% per year) and in 924 patients receiving placebo (7.6% per year) (relative risk with clopidogrel, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81 to 0.98; P = 0.01). The difference was primarily due to a reduction in the rate of stroke with clopidogrel. Stroke occurred in 296 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.4% per year) and 408 patients receiving placebo (3.3% per year) (relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; P < 0.001). Myocardial infarction occurred in 90 patients receiving clopidogrel (0.7% per year) and in 115 receiving placebo (0.9% per year) (relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.03; P = 0.08). Major bleeding occurred in 251 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.0% per year) and in 162 patients receiving placebo (1.3% per year) (relative risk, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.92; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin reduced the risk of major vascular events, especially stroke, and increased the risk of major hemorrhage. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00249873.)

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) after endovascular intervention — Patients with PAD treated with endovascular intervention/stenting are usually treated with antiplatelet therapy (APT) for 1 to 3 months, and for venous thromboembolism (VTE) needing anticoagulation the pathway recommends continuing or switching to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (either clopidogrel or aspirin, clopidogrel preferred) and treating with an anticoagulant (direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC] preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after endovascular intervention/stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an anticoagulant (AC) alone.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in the atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events (ACTIVE W): a randomised controlled trial [^116eNDpP]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation therapy reduces risk of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, long-term monitoring is necessary and many patients cannot achieve optimum anticoagulation. We assessed whether clopidogrel plus aspirin was non-inferior to oral anticoagulation therapy for prevention of vascular events.

Methods

Patients were enrolled if they had atrial fibrillation plus one or more risk factor for stroke, and were randomly allocated to receive oral anticoagulation therapy (target international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.0; n = 3371) or clopidogrel (75 mg per day) plus aspirin (75–100 mg per day recommended; n = 3335). Outcome events were adjudicated by a blinded committee. Primary outcome was first occurrence of stroke, non-CNS systemic embolus, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00243178.

Results

The study was stopped early because of clear evidence of superiority of oral anticoagulation therapy. There were 165 primary events in patients on oral anticoagulation therapy (annual risk 3.93%) and 234 in those on clopidogrel plus aspirin (annual risk 5.60%; relative risk 1.44 (1.18–1.76; p = 0.0003). Patients on oral anticoagulation therapy who were already receiving this treatment at study entry had a trend towards a greater reduction in vascular events (relative risk 1.50, 95% CI 1.19–1.89) and a significantly (p = 0.03 for interaction) lower risk of major bleeding with oral anticoagulation therapy (1.30; 0.94–1.79) than patients not on this treatment at study entry (1.27, 0.85–1.89 and 0.59, 0.32–1.08, respectively).

Conclusion

Oral anticoagulation therapy is superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for prevention of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke, especially in those already taking oral anticoagulation therapy.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Quality of life and patient preferences in atrial fibrillation (AF) — rate versus rhythm control and anticoagulation: On the whole, rate- and rhythm-control strategies do not affect quality of life significantly or differently, and decision analyses show mixed patient valuations of anticoagulation. Quantitatively, a mean 1.3% decrease in utility has been reported with long-term oral anticoagulation; some patients (16%) preferred aspirin for perceived quality of life despite lower efficacy; and 61% of 97 patients preferred anticoagulation to no treatment, a smaller proportion than guideline thresholds.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) in atrial fibrillation — antithrombotic recommendation (COR 1, LOE B-R): In patients with AF and CCD (beyond 1 year after revascularization or CAD not requiring coronary revascularization) without history of stent thrombosis, oral anticoagulation monotherapy is recommended over the combination therapy of OAC and single APT (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor) to decrease the risk of major bleeding.

The study ACTIVE A was published by ACTIVE Investigators and colleagues in 2009 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ACTIVE A study, the trial question was: what is the effect of clopidogrel addition to aspirin in patients with AF for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable? In the ACTIVE A study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTIVE A study, the population was: 7554 patients (3157 female, 4397 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable. The key exclusion criteria were requirement of a VKA or clopidogrel, documented peptic ulcer disease within the previous 6 months, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, significant thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50×10⁹/L), or ongoing alcohol abuse. In the ACTIVE A study, the interventions were: n = 3772 clopidogrel (at a dose of 75 mg once daily plus aspirin 75–100 mg/day) n = 3782 placebo (matching placebo once daily plus aspirin 75–100 mg/day). In the ACTIVE A study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-CNS systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes, at a median of 3.6 years of follow-up (6.8% / y vs. 7.6% / y; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). In the ACTIVE A study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of stroke (2.4% / y vs. 3.3% / y; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.83) No significant difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction (0.7% / y vs. 0.9% / y; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.03). In the ACTIVE A study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding (2.0% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.001; RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29–1.92). In the ACTIVE A study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF who had an increased risk of stroke and for whom vitamin K-antagonist therapy was unsuitable, clopidogrel was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, non-CNS systemic embolism, or death from vascular causes, at a median of 3.6 years of follow-up.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel) [^114BcLBv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, nonstudy antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel group, 126 patients [2%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36%] in the clopidogrel group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4%).

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: do we still need warfarin? [^115zsEd8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (warfarin, phenprocoumon) is successful in both primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, yielding a 60–70% relative reduction in stroke risk compared with placebo, as well as a mortality reduction of 26%. However, these agents have a number of well documented shortcomings. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) reduces the relative risk of stroke by a nonsignificant 19% compared with placebo, and increased bleeding risk offsets any therapeutic gain from the combination of ASA with clopidogrel. This review describes the current landscape and developments in stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, with special reference to secondary prevention.

Recent Findings

A number of new drugs for oral anticoagulation that do not exhibit the limitations of vitamin K antagonists are under investigation. These include direct factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors. Recent studies (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, AVERROES, ARISTOTLE) provide promising results for new agents, including higher efficacy and significantly lower incidences of intracranial bleeds compared with warfarin. The new substances show similar results in secondary as in primary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Summary

New anticoagulants add to the therapeutic options for patients with atrial fibrillation, and offer a number of advantages over warfarin, for both the clinician and patient, including a favourable bleeding profile and convenience of use. Consideration of these new anticoagulants will improve clinical decision making.

Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, indicated for the prevention of ischemic stroke and in-stent thrombosis. However, it has a number of drawbacks, including an increased risk of hemorrhage; a clinical effect that is slow in onset and irreversible; a genetically determined variability in its clinical potency; and interactions with other commonly administered drugs.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA₂DS₂-VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Determining indication for antiplatelet therapy (APT) when OAC is indicated in AF: For patients with AF who have an indication for OAC therapy and an acceptable bleeding risk, the next step involves reassessing the original and current indication(s) for APT; this assessment should include a history and physical examination, and it is also very important to ascertain the timing and details around prior cardiovascular events.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116SGXZT]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — intermediate stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 1) management: For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score = 1), "we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B)". The guideline also states "We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)". Quantified 1-year effects for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy include, versus no therapy, "five fewer deaths and 15 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients at the cost of eight more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds"; versus aspirin, VKA is anticipated to "prevent nine nonfatal strokes for every 1,000 patients treated for 1 year compared with aspirin but will result in three additional bleeds and no reduction in all-cause mortality"; and versus aspirin plus clopidogrel, VKA is expected to result in "six fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients over a 1-year period, anywhere from four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and no reduction in all-cause mortality". For patients unsuitable for or choosing not to take an oral anticoagulant for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding, such as "difficulty maintaining a stable INR, lifestyle limitations of regular INR monitoring, dietary restrictions that are too burdensome, or costs of new anticoagulant drugs that are too high", the text states that combination aspirin and clopidogrel "provides additional benefit of stroke reduction at the cost of additional bleeding" and that they "should be informed that they are choosing an inferior treatment with regard to stroke prevention".

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^113WMtxj]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

Antithrombotic options in atrial fibrillation — treatment thresholds and choices: Anticoagulation is recommended if ≥ 2%/y (1) and reasonable if 1%- < 2%/y (2a). For agent selection, DOACs are preferred over warfarin (except for mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve) (1). Aspirin either alone or with clopidogrel is not recommended to reduce stroke risk (3: Harm), and if no risk factors for stroke, aspirin to prevent thromboembolic events is not recommended (3: No benefit).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Patients with ACS are usually treated with DAPT for 12 months after ACS, and if previously on prasugrel or ticagrelor switching to clopidogrel is recommended. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, the recommendation for most patients is to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an AC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone; for high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter APT durations can be considered. At clinician discretion for higher thrombotic risk with low bleeding risk, SAPT may be continued beyond 12 months while on an AC with aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

### Adding to the evidence or to the confusion: dual antithrombotic therapy in chronic coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation [^114JcBES]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Precision medicine but too many options with low evidence?

This subanalysis from the recently published randomised controlled 'Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events With Rivaroxaban in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease Study' (AFIRE) by Fukaya et al examines whether aspirin or P2Y 12 inhibitors (clopidogrel in 94.6%) in addition to rivaroxaban impacts outcomes in patients with CCS. The main trial showed that dual antithrombotic therapy is associated with increased mortality compared with OAC monotherapy in patients with AF and CCS.

Patients in the dual antithrombotic arm were compared in regard to additional APT (P2Y₁₂ inhibitors n = 297 vs aspirin n = 778) and a primary outcome of composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring urgent revascularisation or death from any cause. No difference in the primary outcome was observed in patients receiving P2Y 12 inhibitors or aspirin (6.76% vs 5.28%, p = 0.178). However, mortality was higher in the P2Y 12 inhibitors group (4.44% vs 2.85% per patient-year; p = 0.041).

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate early cessation (≤ 1 week) of aspirin and continue an OAC (preferably a DOAC) with a P2Y12 inhibitor, (preferably clopidogrel) for up to 12 months in patients with AF and ACS undergoing an uncomplicated PCI to avoid major bleeding, if the risk of thrombosis is low or bleeding risk is high.

### Antithrombotic treatment in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing PCI: is dual therapy the winner? [^1173crBq]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation have atrial fibrillation. The optimal antithrombotic treatment in such of patients remains one of the most challenging and difficult scenarios in Cardiology. Triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT), consisting of dual antiplatelet therapy plus an oral anticoagulant, has been used for decades in order to reduce ischemic and thromboembolic events, while significantly increasing the risk for severe bleeding. Recently, results of several clinical trials suggest that the use of dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT), consisting of single antiplatelet therapy plus an oral anticoagulant, reduces the risk of bleeding, while maintaining the same level of efficacy as compared to TAT. These data have been interpreted in a variety of ways, often giving conflicting recommendations and leaving many unanswered questions on the optimal antithrombotic treatments of patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI. DAT consisting of a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and clopidogrel, while omitting aspirin from the immediate post discharge period, appears as an attractive, simplified strategy for most patients and supported by many experts in the field. In this review we aim to better define the role of DAT versus TAT in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing PCI and analyze remaining controversial issues and future expectations.

### Short-term prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation with aspirin plus clopidogrel: the clopidogrel-aspirin atrial fibrillation (CLAAF) pilot study [^1178Xh8L]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the short-term safety and efficacy of aspirin-plus-clopidogrel as antithrombotic therapy in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods and Results

Thirty patients (11 women, 45 to 75 years of age) with non-high-risk permanent (n = 12) or persistent AF awaiting cardioversion (n = 18) underwent transesophageal echocardiography to exclude left heart thrombi and were then randomly assigned to receive warfarin (international normalized ratio, 2 to 3 for 3 weeks) or aspirin (100 mg/d alone for 1 week)-plus-clopidogrel (75 mg/d added to aspirin for 3 weeks). Bleeding time and serum thromboxane B2 were measured at entry and at 3 weeks. Bleeding time, not affected by warfarin, was prolonged by 71% by aspirin (P < .05) and further, by 144%, by adding clopidogrel (P < .01 vs aspirin alone; +319%, P < .01, vs baseline). Thromboxane B2, not affected by warfarin, was reduced by aspirin (-98%, P < .01) but not further by clopidogrel. No thrombi or dense spontaneous echo-contrast were found at the 3-week transesophageal echocardiography. Seven of 9 patients receiving warfarin and 7 of 9 patients receiving aspirin-plus-clopidogrel, undergoing electrical cardioversion, achieved sinus rhythm. No thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events occurred in both arms throughout the 3-week treatment and a further 3-month follow-up.

Conclusions

Aspirin-plus-clopidogrel and warfarin were equally safe and effective in preventing thromboembolism in this small group of patients with non-high-risk AF.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention — anticoagulation and antiplatelet timing: PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) on ongoing uninterrupted non‑vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) monotherapy is currently not recommended; in patients not on oral anticoagulant but on stable aspirin, clopidogrel may be given either prior to or during PCI with no apparent outcome differences, and given triple therapy (TAT) bleeding risk it may be considered to withhold the additional antiplatelet until PCI is indicated by diagnostic angiography. The time to effective platelet inhibition with oral clopidogrel is approximately 2 to 6 h depending on a 600 vs 300 mg loading dose, while intravenous cangrelor or aspirin has a nearly immediate effect; when oral pretreatment is chosen, pretreatment with both aspirin and clopidogrel should preferably include loading with 300 mg to reduce initial bleeding risk. For intraprocedural unfractionated heparin (UFH), doses as low as 30–50 IU/kg have been shown effective for preventing ischaemic PCI complications and should be preferred to limit bleeding risk.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^1163Gskt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CURE

The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal.

Patients were randomized to receive Plavix (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.

The patient population was largely White (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% age ≥ 65 years of age. Only about 20% of patients underwent revascularization during the initial hospitalization and few underwent emergent or urgent revascularization.

The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the Plavix-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10%–28%; p < 0.001) for the Plavix-treated group (see Table 4).

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in the atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events (ACTIVE W): a randomised controlled trial [^113uwMJb]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study ACTIVE W was published by ACTIVE Writing Group of the ACTIVE Investigators and colleagues in 2006 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the ACTIVE W study, the trial question was: is oral anticoagulation therapy superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin in patients with AF at high risk for stroke? In the ACTIVE W study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ACTIVE W study, the population was: 6706 patients (2276 female, 4430 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with AF at high risk for stroke. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication for clopidogrel or OAC, documented peptic ulcer disease within the previous 6 months, previous intracerebral hemorrhage, significant thrombocytopenia, or MS. In the ACTIVE W study, the interventions were: n = 3371 oral anticoagulation therapy (a VKA, to target INR between 2.0 and 3.3) n = 3335 dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin 75–100 mg/day). In the ACTIVE W study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the incidence of stroke, non-CNS systemic embolus, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (3.93% / y vs. 5.6% / y; RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.76). In the ACTIVE W study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the incidence of stroke (1.4% / y vs. 2.39% / y; RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.37) Significant increase in vascular events in patients already on oral anticoagulation therapy at entry (3.72% vs. 5.5%; RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.89) No significant difference in vascular events in patients not on oral anticoagulation therapy at entry (4.71% vs. 5.89%; RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.89). In the ACTIVE W study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in major bleeding in patients already on anticoagulation therapy at entry (2.02% vs. 2.63% per year, p for interaction = 0.03) and major bleeding for people not on oral anticoagulation at entry (2.92% vs. 1.73% per year, p = 0.09). In the ACTIVE W study, the conclusion was: in patients with AF at high risk for stroke, oral anticoagulation therapy was superior to dual antiplatelet therapy with respect to the incidence of stroke, non-CNS systemic embolus, myocardial infarction, or vascular death.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a north American perspective: 2021 update [^115gjKty]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation. This poses challenges for their optimal antithrombotic management because patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI require oral anticoagulation for the prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of coronary thrombotic complications. The combination of oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy substantially increases the risk of bleeding. Over the last decade, a series of North American Consensus Statements on the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention have been reported. Since the last update in 2018, several pivotal clinical trials in the field have been published. This document provides a focused updated of the 2018 recommendations. The group recommends that in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is the oral anticoagulation of choice. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y₁₂ inhibitor should be given to all patients during the peri-PCI period (during inpatient stay, until time of discharge, up to 1 week after PCI, at the discretion of the treating physician), after which the default strategy is to stop aspirin and continue treatment with a P2Y₁₂ inhibitor, preferably clopidogrel, in combination with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, double therapy). In patients at increased thrombotic risk who have an acceptable risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to continue aspirin (ie, triple therapy) for up to 1 month. Double therapy should be given for 6 to 12 months with the actual duration depending on the ischemic and bleeding risk profile of the patient, after which patients should discontinue antiplatelet therapy and receive oral anticoagulation alone.

Atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis — For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (target INR range, 2.0–3.0) rather than no therapy, aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily), or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (all Grade 1B); this follows the statement that most randomized controlled trials of adjusted-dose VKA in AF excluded such patients, but results from nonrheumatic AF trials can be generalized to patients with mitral stenosis.

For intermediate risk (eg, CHADS2 score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For high risk (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Do anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs have a role in treating heart failure in the absence of atrial fibrillation? [^1148rouD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) are at risk for stroke, and progress in anticoagulation has led to new options for these patients. Patients in sinus rhythm may benefit from antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, but much work remains to establish efficacy and safety. Additional progress is needed, including better tools for risk stratification and clarity regarding the need for antiplatelet agents in combination with anticoagulants for those with other vascular diseases.

### Stroke and recurrent haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic treatment after gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study [^114QAMH1]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and risk factors for thromboembolism require anticoagulant treatment to reduce the risk of stroke. The major complication with anticoagulant treatment is the increased risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.

After patients have experienced gastrointestinal bleeding during antithrombotic treatment, their clinicians face the clinical dilemma of whether to restart treatment or not. Moreover, there are several treatment regimens for clinicians to choose from: single or combined treatment with a vitamin K antagonist, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), and an adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor). It is important to clarify how clinicians should treat patients with atrial fibrillation after antithrombotic related gastrointestinal bleeding; however, data on this are scarce, and no randomised controlled trial has been performed to elucidate the clinical dilemma regarding risk of stroke versus risk of bleeding in these patients.

In a nationwide cohort study, we examined the risk of all cause mortality and admission to hospital or deaths due to thromboembolism, major bleeding, or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding associated with restarting antithrombotic treatment after a gastrointestinal bleed in patients with atrial fibrillation.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute coronary syndrome (2.1)
Non-ST-segment elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI): 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily)
STEMI: 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without a loading dose and with or without thrombolytics
Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease: 75 mg once daily (2.2)

2.1	Acute Coronary Syndrome

Plavix can be administered with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI), initiate Plavix with a single 300 mg oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiate aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and continue in combination with Plavix [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients with STEMI, the recommended dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, administered in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without thrombolytics. Plavix may be initiated with or without a loading dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

The recommended daily dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers

CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established.

2.4 Use with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)

Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with Plavix. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Assessment of oral antithrombotic therapy by platelet function testing [^116ispMj]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is recommended for the prevention of ischemic events in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. In patients with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin is the 'gold standard' for the prevention of thromboembolism. Nearly 20% of patients with atrial fibrillation also have coronary artery disease and receive combination therapy consisting of dual antiplatelet therapy plus warfarin, also known as triple antithrombotic therapy. Unfortunately, though, increased bleeding risk is a major concern during triple therapy. Whether platelet function testing can guide personalized antiplatelet therapy and reduce ischemic risk is under investigation in large trials of patients treated with coronary artery stents. However, limited data are available to establish the relationship between platelet function testing and bleeding in patients treated with dual or triple therapy. Personalized treatment strategies could help to achieve maximum clinical benefit while avoiding excessive bleeding complications. In this article, we review available data on the utility of platelet function testing in assessing bleeding risk and its potential role in personalizing combination antithrombotic therapies with the aim of reducing ischemic events and the frequency of bleeding.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (no stent) — For patients with AF at intermediate to high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2, score of 1 or greater) who experience an acute coronary syndrome and do not undergo intracoronary stent placement, we suggest for the first 12 months, adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C). After the first 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). For patients with AF at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2, score of 0), we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) rather than adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C), with remarks that some patients prioritizing stroke reduction may choose adjusted-dose VKA therapy plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy and that bleeding risk and additional non-CHADS2 risk factors may influence this choice.

### The role of triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^114M2bXY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel forms the backbone of secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. Patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event therefore have an indication for both OAC and DAPT, so-called triple antithrombotic therapy. However, observational analyses have shown that the annual rate of major bleeding on triple therapy exceeds 10%. For this reason, five major randomized clinical trials have compared double antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus triple therapy in patients with AF who underwent PCI or had an ACS event. Each of the trials showed that double antithrombotic therapy reduced the rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with triple therapy and was non-inferior for prevention of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In the one trial that directly compared warfarin with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), apixaban reduced the rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with warfarin and was non-inferior with respect to prevention of ischemic events. As a result of these trials, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event should be treated with triple antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y₁₂ inhibitor + aspirin) for 7 days or less, followed by double antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y₁₂ inhibitor) for 6 to 12 months.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^114idcBs]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19.

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2	 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix five days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin.

Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7–10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke

In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.

### Indications for dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: evidence-based recommendations for use [^114B7Nqn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature assessing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and subsequently provide evidence-based recommendations for appropriate indications and length of therapy.

Data Sources

An English-language MEDLINE search (1950-December 2007) was conducted using the search terms antiplatelet, aspirin, thienopyridine, and clopidogrel to identify articles assessing dual antiplatelet therapy. Evaluation of references from identified trials for possible inclusion was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that assessed treatment with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for any indication were included.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin and clopidogrel have complementary mechanisms of action to inhibit platelet function. Indications that have been studied include coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerotic ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation. This combination has been beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in PCI patients without an acute event. There is a small but significant risk for increased bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy for these indications. When used in patients with a history of atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or for prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, this combination has been shown to increase bleeding, providing no clinical benefit, and to increase outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, respectively.

Conclusions

There is evidence to support use of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel for patients presenting with all ACS types, as well as for patients presenting with PCI for any indication. The treatment duration varies, but patients who have received stenting should receive at least 1 year of combination therapy. There is no evidence to support this combination for primary prevention of CAD or atherosclerotic ischemic events, secondary prevention of stable CAD, or prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The possible benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy also must be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111gh8Wf]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) at high risk of stroke (Recommendation 2.1.10) specifies that for patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1A), aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B), or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B). Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke, which includes patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, can anticipate large benefits (ie, 15 fewer deaths and 30 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients during 1 year of VKA therapy) with anticoagulation. For every 1,000 patients with a CHADS2 score of 2 treated for 1 year with VKA therapy rather than aspirin, we anticipate 19 fewer nonfatal strokes at the expense of three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and for every 1,000 such patients treated with VKA rather than combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, we anticipate 11 fewer strokes and anywhere between four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds.

### Clopidogrel (Plavix) [^111hJ4st]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, nonstudy antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

### Effects of CYP2C19 genotype on outcomes of clopidogrel treatment [^114zBHEX]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that clopidogrel may be less effective in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events among persons who are carriers of loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles that are associated with reduced conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite.

Methods

We genotyped patients from two large, randomized trials that showed that clopidogrel, as compared with placebo, reduced the rate of cardiovascular events (the primary efficacy outcome) among patients with acute coronary syndromes and among patients with atrial fibrillation. Patients were genotyped for three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (*2, *3, *17) that define the major CYP2C19 alleles.

Results

Among 5059 genotyped patients with acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel as compared with placebo significantly reduced the rate of the primary efficacy outcome, irrespective of the genetically determined metabolizer phenotype (P = 0.12 for heterogeneity). The effect of clopidogrel in reducing the rate of the primary efficacy outcome was similar in patients who were heterozygous or homozygous for loss-of-function alleles and in those who were not carriers of the alleles (rate among carriers, 8.0% with clopidogrel vs. 11.6% with placebo; hazard ratio with clopidogrel, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.98; rate among noncarriers, 9.5% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.87). In contrast, gain-of-function carriers derived more benefit from clopidogrel treatment as compared with placebo than did noncarriers (rate of primary outcome among carriers, 7.7% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.73; rate among noncarriers, 10.0% vs. 12.2%; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.05; P = 0.02 for interaction). The effect of clopidogrel on bleeding did not vary according to genotypic subgroups. Among 1156 genotyped patients with atrial fibrillation, there was no evidence of an interaction with respect to either efficacy or bleeding between the study treatment and the metabolizer phenotype, loss-of-function carrier status, or gain-of-function carrier status.

Conclusions

Among patients with acute coronary syndromes or atrial fibrillation, the effect of clopidogrel as compared with placebo is consistent, irrespective of CYP2C19 loss-of-function carrier status. (Funded by Sanofi-Aventis and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00249873.).

### Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^111MrwtK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most potent common risk factor for ischemic stroke. The number of Americans with nonvalvular AF is expected to increase markedly over the next several decades, making AF-related stroke an important public health concern. Given the individual and societal burden associated with AF-related stroke, efforts to identify and implement efficacious and acceptably safe therapeutic stroke prevention strategies are paramount. This article reviews the existing randomized trial evidence supporting the efficacy of oral vitamin K antagonists (ie, warfarin) or aspirin for preventing thromboembolism in AF, as well as completed and ongoing studies exploring novel antithrombotic agents including the oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, other antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel), factor Xa inhibitors, and other pharmacological agents and additional therapeutic approaches such as mechanical devices and surgical procedures to obliterate the left atrial appendage.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation patients on oral anticoagulation after PCI — postprocedural antithrombotic choices and durations are as follows: For patients on a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with good INR control prior to PCI, continuation of the VKA may be considered post-PCI; one can consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day post-PCI until the INR is therapeutic (ideally, 2.0 to 2.5), and high-stroke-risk patients may be considered for bridging with parenteral anticoagulation until the INR is therapeutic; because prasugrel and ticagrelor have been associated with a higher bleeding risk than clopidogrel, preference should be given to clopidogrel after PCI in patients requiring a long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC), and the use of prasugrel should be avoided in patients treated concomitantly with an OAC; in the first month post-PCI, one may consider additional aspirin 81 mg/day for up to 30 days in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk; for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) requiring an OAC for AF, single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with a P2Y12 inhibitor should be continued for 12 months; for stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) requiring an OAC for AF, SAPT with clopidogrel should be continued for 6 months.

### Does warfarin for stroke thromboprophylaxis protect against MI in atrial fibrillation patients? [^11361FHx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The Randomized Evaluation of Long-term anticoagulation therapY (RE-LY) study demonstrated a significant increase in myocardial infarction events with dabigatran compared with warfarin, provoking renewed interest in whether vitamin K antagonists are useful drugs for the prevention of myocardial infarction in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation. Present analyses examined whether there was an increased risk of myocardial infarction associated with non-warfarin anticoagulants (Stroke Prevention with the ORal direct Thrombin Inhibitor ximelagatran compared with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial Fibrillation III and IV, RE-LY, Amadeus) or "anticoagulant equivalents" (Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for the prevention of Vascular Events) in patients with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation for stroke thromboprophylaxis. The overall annual event rate for those receiving warfarin was 0.98% compared with 1.32% for those receiving comparators. Warfarin was associated with a significant reduction in myocardial infarction (relative risk 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63–0.95), an effect largely driven by the RE-LY trial. Sensitivity analyses, excluding RE-LY, revealed a nonsignificant reduction in myocardial infarctions (relative risk 0.83; 95% CI, 0.62–1.10); an analogous analysis excluding the Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for the prevention of Vascular Events demonstrated a significant reduction in myocardial infarctions (relative risk 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64–1.00). Warfarin might provide a protective effect against myocardial infarction compared with non-warfarin anticoagulants or "anticoagulation equivalents" in patients with atrial fibrillation who are prescribed anticoagulation for stroke thromboprophylaxis.

### Net clinical benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonists are unsuitable [^113xke3X]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy reduces stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but increases hemorrhage.

Objective

To quantify the net benefit of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy, accounting for differences in clinical significance between ischemic and hemorrhagic events.

Design

Observational cohort study to assign the relative weighting of events and post hoc analysis of randomized trial data to assess net benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) clinical trials.

Setting

Global randomized clinical trial.

Patients

10,041 patients with AF, 7554 of whom were not candidates for warfarin therapy.

Measurements

Ischemic events (ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or subdural or extracranial bleeding), weighted by the hazard ratio for death (or death or disability) after an event relative to death (or death or disability) after ischemic stroke. The net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy in the ACTIVE A trial participants was defined as the sum of weighted event incidence with dual antiplatelet therapy subtracted from the sum of weighted event incidence on control treatment, expressed as ischemic stroke equivalents prevented per 100 patients years.

Results

Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy prevented 0.57 ischemic stroke equivalent (95% CI, -0.12 to 1.24) per 100 patient-years of treatment when weighted by hazard for death after ischemia or hemorrhage and 0.67 ischemic stroke equivalent (CI, -0.03 to 1.18) when weighted by death or disability after ischemia or hemorrhage.

Limitation

No attempt was made to relate deaths used for weighting to events; disability data were missing for more than one half of patients.

Conclusion

Adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy resulted in a modest net benefit among patients with AF for whom warfarin was unsuitable. The benefit would probably be clinically relevant for some patients, but estimates could not exclude the possibility of either no benefit or very small harm in this population.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^112HkVHt]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

14.2 Recent Myocardial Infarction, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

CAPRIE

The CAPRIE trial was a 19,185-patient, 304-center, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to aspirin (325 mg daily). The patients randomized had: 1) recent histories of myocardial infarction (within 35 days); 2) recent histories of ischemic stroke (within 6 months) with at least a week of residual neurological signs; or 3) established peripheral arterial disease. Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years).

The trial's primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular.

As shown in Table 6, Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p = 0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the Plavix group.

The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 8. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.

The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p = 0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial.

The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p = 0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin.

### Replacing aspirin and warfarin for secondary stroke prevention: is it worth the costs? [^112miu6u]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to determine whether it is cost-effective to replace aspirin and warfarin with more effective, yet more costly, treatments for secondary stroke prevention.

Recent Findings

For preventing recurrent stroke of arterial origin, clopidogrel and the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole are equally effective and more effective than aspirin. However, limited data only support their incremental cost-effectiveness, compared with aspirin, in nondisabled patients at high risk of a recurrent ischaemic event (e.g. > 20% per year) and when used for short periods (e.g. < 2 years). Clopidogrel is also cost-effective for patients who are intolerant of aspirin. For preventing recurrent stroke due to atrial fibrillation, warfarin is cost-effective. Although the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is more effective than aspirin, it is unlikely to be more cost-effective. Dabigatran is at least as effective and well tolerated as warfarin, but its eventual cost will determine its incremental cost-effectiveness. For atrial fibrillation patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage may be an alternative strategy. Dronedarone may prove to be a cost-effective adjunct to antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Summary

The incremental cost-effectiveness of newer antithrombotic treatments for secondary stroke prevention, compared with aspirin or warfarin, remains to be established.

### Outcomes associated with oral anticoagulants plus antiplatelets in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^116vemha]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What outcomes are associated with combination therapy using oral anticoagulants (OAC) plus antiplatelet drugs in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation?

Findings

This cohort study of 24 436 patients with de novo atrial fibrillation found that, after adjusting for baseline characteristics and comedications, patients treated with OAC plus antiplatelet drugs had significantly higher incidence rates of stroke and any bleeding event than those receiving OAC alone. Use of OAC plus antiplatelet drugs was not associated with reduced risk of experiencing acute coronary syndromes.

Meaning

These findings suggest that patients with atrial fibrillation treated with OAC plus antiplatelet drugs may have significantly higher risk of stroke and bleeding compared with those receiving OAC alone.

Atrial fibrillation — low stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 0) management: For patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), including those with paroxysmal AF, "we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy (Grade 2B)". For patients who do choose antithrombotic therapy, "we suggest aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) rather than oral anticoagulation (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B)". Remarks note that additional risk factors "including age 65 to 74 years and female sex" may influence decisions and that "The presence of multiple non-CHADS2 risk factors for stroke may favor oral anticoagulation therapy".

### Comparison of hemorrhagic complications of warfarin and clopidogrel bisulfate in 25-gauge vitrectomy versus a control group [^1134ezoc]. Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To estimate the risk of hemorrhagic complications associated with 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) when warfarin (Coumadin; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) or clopidogrel (Plavix; Bristol-Myers Squibb) are continued throughout the surgical period, as compared with a control group.

Design

A single-center, retrospective, cohort study of 289 consecutive patients receiving either warfarin therapy or clopidogrel therapy or neither of those therapies who underwent 25-gauge PPV.

Participants

Included were 61 patients (64 eyes; 64 PPV procedures) in the warfarin group and 118 (125 eyes; 136 PPV procedures) in the clopidogrel group. Warfarin patients were subdivided into 4 groups by international normalized ratio (INR). A control group included 110 patients (110 eyes; 110 PPV procedures) who were not receiving warfarin or clopidogrel.

Methods

Retrospective chart review for which the criteria included: 25-gauge PPV, minimum age of 19 years, warfarin or clopidogrel use, and, if taking warfarin, an INR obtained within 5 days of surgery.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhagic complications.

Results

The most common indications for anticoagulation therapy included: atrial fibrillation (38%), valvular heart disease (17%), and thromboembolic disease (16%). The most common indications for antiplatelet therapy included: cardiac stent (49%), coronary artery bypass grafting (24%), and history of transient ischemic attack (16%). No patient experienced anesthesia-related hemorrhagic complications resulting from peribulbar or retrobulbar block. Transient vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 1 (1.6%) of 64 PPV procedures in the warfarin group (P = 0.6531), 5 (3.7%) of 136 PPV procedures in the clopidogrel group (P = 1.0), and 4 (3.6%) of 110 PPV procedures in the control group. No choroidal or retrobulbar hemorrhages occurred in any patient.

Conclusions

The rate of 25-gauge PPV hemorrhagic complications in patients who underwent systemic anticoagulation or who were receiving platelet inhibitor therapy is extremely low. Given the risks associated with stopping these therapies, the authors recommend that patients continue their current therapeutic regimen without cessation.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1169yWdE]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) antithrombotic therapy — intermediate stroke risk (CHADS2 score = 1): For patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at intermediate risk of stroke (CHADS2 score = 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1B). We suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B) or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 2B). For patients who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we suggest combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 2B).

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^1153MYZ5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone for both primary and secondary prevention therapies for ischemic events resulting from coronary atherosclerotic disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a thienopyridine, usually clopidogrel) has assumed a central role in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and after coronary stent deployment. In addition to antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy might be indicated for stroke prevention in a variety of conditions that include atrial fibrillation, profound left ventricular dysfunction, and after mechanical prosthetic heart valve replacement. For this reason, the use of triple antithrombotic therapy (a dual antiplatelet regimen plus warfarin) is expected to become more prominent, given an aging patient population. But although triple therapy can prevent both thromboembolism and stent thrombosis, it is also associated with significant bleeding hazards. Furthermore, when bleeding events do occur, the challenge of balancing the risk of stent thrombosis or stroke and the need for hemostasis requires considerable expertise. It is both prudent and timely to review treatment strategies that employ combinations of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies as well as strategies aimed at reducing bleeding risk in patients treated with these therapies.

### The evolving field of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113ejckY]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard in stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation for decades, but several limitations make it difficult for patients to tolerate chronic anticoagulation treatment. New drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials, including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel and aspirin are alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention but have proven less efficacious in trials. The only drug to have completed a Phase III trial successfully thus far is dabigatran. The 150-mg twice-a-day dose was superior to warfarin in efficacy and similar for major bleeding, whereas the 110-mg twice-a-day dose was noninferior for efficacy and reduced major bleeding. Both doses reduced intracranial hemorrhages substantially compared with warfarin. Dabigatran-assigned patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinically apparent myocardial infarction rates were slightly higher in the dabigatran groups than the warfarin group. Dabigatran is the first agent to show superiority over warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, raising the standard for newer agents.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with antithrombotic therapy — patients are usually treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an OAC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone. For patients at high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter durations of APT can be considered. At the clinician's discretion, selected patients felt to be at higher thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk may continue single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) beyond 12 months while on an OAC.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (clopidogrel) [^114dtN9a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.

Figure 7: Fatal or Nonfatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study

The statistical significance favoring clopidogrel over aspirin was marginal (p = 0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of clopidogrel is substantial.

The CAPRIE trial enrolled a population that had recent MI, recent stroke, or PAD. The efficacy of clopidogrel relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these subgroups (p = 0.043) (see Figure 8). Nonetheless, this difference may be a chance occurrence because the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups. The benefit was most apparent in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral arterial disease and less apparent in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, clopidogrel was not numerically superior to aspirin.

14.3 No Demonstrated Benefit of Clopidogrel plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease

CHARISMA

The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing clopidogrel (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke. A total of 534 (6.9%) patients in the clopidogrel group versus 573 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event (p = 0.22). Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to clopidogrel.

### Antiplatelet drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113kagvw]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Clopidogrel pharmacogenetics and platelet function testing — randomized trial evidence across acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) populations found no significant interaction between CYP2C19 loss-of-function status and clopidogrel effect, and there currently is no evidence to support individualized antiplatelet therapy based on platelet function or genetic testing. In PLATO, 10,285 patients with ACS randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel had similar primary outcomes irrespective of CYP2C19 genotype (interaction P = 0.46). In CURE, 5,059 patients with ACS randomized to clopidogrel or placebo had similar efficacy across loss-of-function genotypes, although carriers of gain-of-function alleles derived more benefit than noncarriers with only nominal significance (interaction P = 0.02). In ACTIVE A, among 1,156 genotyped patients with AF, there was no evidence of an interaction between CYP2C19 genotype and study treatment for efficacy or bleeding. Discrepancies between observational and randomized findings may reflect that only 14.5% of CURE patients underwent PCI and that ACTIVE A enrolled AF patients at relatively low thrombotic risk. Consistent with the absence of benefit from testing, the GRAVITAS trial found no improvement in cardiovascular outcomes or stent thrombosis with double-dose clopidogrel among patients with high residual platelet reactivity after drug-eluting stent implantation on aspirin plus usual-dose clopidogrel, and trials are under way testing therapy adjustment via platelet function testing and evaluating genotype-guided strategies in high-risk groups.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with CAD, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate oral anticoagulation monotherapy over combined therapy with oral anticoagulation and a single antiplatelet agent (aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor) to decrease the risk of major bleeding in patients with AF and chronic coronary disease (beyond 1 year after revascularization or CAD not requiring coronary revascularization) without a history of stent thrombosis.

### Cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel plus aspirin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom warfarin is unsuitable [^112CfjAx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend clopidogrel plus aspirin as an alternative stroke prevention strategy in patients in whom warfarin is unsuitable. A Markov model was conducted from a Medicare prospective using data from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events-A (ACTIVE-A) trial and other published studies. Base-case analysis evaluated patients 65 years old with AF, a CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, 1 point; hypertension defined as blood pressure consistently > 140/90 mm Hg or antihypertension medication, 1 point; age ≥ 75 years, 1 point; diabetes mellitus, 1 point; previous stroke or transient ishemic attack, 2 points) score of 2, and a lower risk for major bleeding. Patients received clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin or aspirin alone. Patients were followed for up to 35 years. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2011 American dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs were 9.37 QALYs and $88,751 with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 9.01 QALYs and $79,057 with aspirin alone. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for clopidogrel plus aspirin was $26,928/QALY. With 1-way sensitivity analysis using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, clopidogrel plus aspirin was no longer cost effective when the CHADS(2) score was ≤ 1, major bleeding risk with aspirin was ≥ 2.50%/patient-year, the relative risk decrease for ischemic stroke with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone was < 25%, and the utility of being healthy with AF on combination therapy decreased to 0.95. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that clopidogrel plus aspirin was cost effective in 55% and 73% of 10,000 iterations assuming willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. In conclusion, clopidogrel plus aspirin appears cost-effective compared to aspirin alone for stroke prevention in patients with AF with a CHADS(2) of ≥ 2 and a lower risk of bleeding.

### Left atrial appendage closure compared with oral anticoagulants for patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113tuFh6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results are generally consistent with 2 previous meta‐analyses including antiplatelet and placebo‐controlled studies as well as trials performed with different DOAC agents in more heterogeneous clinical settings. However, our meta‐analysis for the first time provides evidence of a clinical benefit associated with LAAC in terms of hemorrhagic stroke and nonprocedural bleeding.

Another debated aspect is the postimplantation treatment to prevent device‐related thrombosis. The adequate postprocedural antithrombotic regimen is still not well defined and there is a high variability between trials, registries, and real‐world studies. The early trials mandated an initial course of OAC, followed by aspirin and clopidogrel for 6 months, and then by indefinite aspirin. The ASAP (ASA Plavix Feasibility Study With Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology) registry demonstrated that postprocedural VKA bridging is not mandatory. In the EWOLUTION (Evaluating Real‐World Clinical Outcomes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Receiving the WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology) registry, 73% of patients were ineligible for OAC and received dual (60%) or single (7%) antiplatelet therapy, or no antithrombotic therapy at all (6%) immediately after the procedure. At the present, the only recommended schemes after LAAC relies on regulatory device labeling. In the United States, for WATCHMAN FLX, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a 45‐day dual antiplatelet therapy course followed by aspirin, as an alternative to 45‐day OAC plus aspirin; conversely, for Amulet, a 6‐month dual antiplatelet therapy course followed by aspirin is recommended unless significant peridevice leaks are evident. More recently, different combinations of short‐term DOACs and antiplatelet therapy have been tested for device‐related thrombosis prevention. Further data are needed to define the best postprocedural protocol to optimize the trade‐off between bleeding events and the risk of device‐related thrombosis.

### Effectiveness and patient safety of platelet aggregation inhibitors in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke in older adults-a systematic review [^111rikoE]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAI) are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in older people, though evidence about risks and benefits of their use in older adults is scarce. The objectives of this systematic review are firstly to identify the risks and benefits of their use in the prevention and treatment of vascular events in older adults, and secondly to develop recommendations on discontinuing PAI in this population if risks outweigh benefits.

Methods

Staged systematic review consisting of three searches. Searches 1 and 2 identified systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Search 3 included controlled intervention and observational studies from review-articles not included in searches 1 and 2. All articles were assessed by two independent reviewers regarding the type of study, age of participants, type of intervention, and clinically relevant outcomes. After data extraction and quality appraisal we developed recommendations to stop the prescribing of specific drugs in older adults following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

Results

Overall, 2385 records were screened leading to an inclusion of 35 articles reporting on 22 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 11 randomised controlled trials, and two observational studies. Mean ages ranged from 57.0 to 84.6 years. Ten studies included a subgroup analysis by age. Overall, based on the evaluated evidence, three recommendations were formulated. First, the use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in older people cannot be recommended due to an uncertainty in the risk-benefit ratio (weak recommendation; low quality of evidence). Secondly, the combination of ASA and clopidogrel in patients without specific indications should be avoided (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). Lastly, to improve the effectiveness and reduce the risks of stroke prevention therapy in older people with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of ≥ 2, the use of ASA for the primary prevention of stroke should be discontinued in preference for the use of oral anticoagulants (weak recommendation; low quality of evidence).

Conclusions

The use of ASA for the primary prevention of CVD and the combination therapy of ASA and clopidogrel for the secondary prevention of vascular events in older people may not be justified. The use of oral anticoagulants instead of ASA in older people with atrial fibrillation may be recommended. Further high quality studies with older adults are needed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

History of peripheral artery disease (PAD) with atrial fibrillation (AF) — antithrombotic management is outlined as follows: Patients with PAD without prior intervention or with prior surgical repair are usually treated with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), and for such patients presenting with AF appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC), the pathway recommends stopping all antiplatelet therapy (APT) and treating with an OAC alone (direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC] preferred). After endovascular intervention/stenting, APT is usually given for 1 to 3 months; in patients with AF appropriate for an OAC, the pathway recommends continuing or switching to SAPT (either clopidogrel or aspirin, clopidogrel preferred) and treating with an OAC (DOAC preferred), and if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after endovascular intervention/stenting has been achieved (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone.

### Clopidogrel bisulphate (clopidogrel) [^117CMfYD]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel bisulfate occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of clopidogrel bisulfate did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel bisulfate were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel bisulfate was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

The use of clopidogrel bisulfate in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of clopidogrel bisulfate in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the clopidogrel bisulfate group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

### Combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy: clinical benefits and risks [^114Ng9CF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes but increases the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy is often combined with oral anticoagulants in patients with an indication for warfarin therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation) who also have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (e.g. coronary artery disease) but the appropriateness of such an approach is unresolved. Anticoagulation appears to be as effective as antiplatelet therapy for long-term management of acute coronary syndrome and stroke, and possibly peripheral artery disease, but causes more bleeding. Therefore, in such patients who develop atrial fibrillation, switching from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulants might be all that is required. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has only been proven to provide additional benefit over anticoagulants alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not as effective as oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than oral anticoagulants in patients with coronary stents. Whether the benefits of triple therapy outweigh the risks in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents requires evaluation in randomized trials.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — In patients with AF and an increased risk for stroke who undergo PCI, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in combination with antiplatelet therapy (APT) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A). In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1–4 wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A).

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^114Wxd3C]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54,000 patients, including over 21,000 patients treated for 1 year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below.

Bleeding

CURE

In CURE, Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding (primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites) compared to placebo with aspirin (see Table 1). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) and fatal bleeding (0.2%) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise.

The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1.

Ninety-two percent (92%) of the patients in the CURE study received heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and the rate of bleeding in these patients was similar to the overall results.

COMMIT

In COMMIT, similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups, both of which also received aspirin (see Table 2).

CAPRIE (Plavix vs. Aspirin)

In CAPRIE, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2.0% in those taking Plavix vs. 2.7% in those taking aspirin; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for Plavix compared to 0.5% for aspirin.

Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma.

Other Adverse Events

In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) between Plavix and placebo.

In CAPRIE, which compared Plavix to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix. No other difference in the rate of adverse events (other than bleeding) was reported.

### P2Yinhibitors with oral anticoagulation for percutaneous coronary intervention with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JSdcw]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of third-generation P2Y 12 inhibitors versus clopidogrel in combination with oral anticoagulation (OAC) with or without aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

We performed a systematic review including both prospective and retrospective studies that compared dual and triple antithrombotic regimens for bleeding and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with AF undergoing PCI. We analysed rates of bleeding and MACE by P2Y₁₂ inhibitor choice. Risk ratio (RR) 95% CIs were measured using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Where study heterogeneity was low (I² < 25%), we used the fixed effects model, otherwise the random effects model was used.

Results

A total of 22014 patients were analysed from the seven studies included. Among patients treated with both OAC and P2Y 12 inhibitor with or without aspirin, 90% (n = 9708) were treated with clopidogrel, 8% (n = 830) with ticagrelor, and 2% (n = 191) with prasugrel. When compared with clopidogrel, use of ticagrelor (RR 1.36; 95%CI 1.18 to 1.57) and prasugrel (RR 2.11; 95%CI 1.34 to 3.30) were associated with increased rates of bleeding. Compared with clopidogrel, there were no significant differences in rates of MACE with ticagrelor (RR 1.03; 95%CI 0.65 to 1.62) or prasugrel (RR 1.49; 95%CI 0.69 to 3.24).

Conclusion

Based on this meta-analysis, the use of clopidogrel is associated with a lower rate of bleeding compared with ticagrelor or prasugrel in patients with AF on OAC undergoing PCI.

### The role of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113su7Tg]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke and thromboembolism, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. For the majority of patients with AF, aspirin has a limited role in stroke prevention, being an inferior strategy and not necessarily safer than the anticoagulant warfarin, especially in the elderly. Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Nonetheless, aspirin use should continue in the early stages following presentation of a patient with AF and acute coronary syndrome, and after stenting, in combination with oral anticoagulant drugs and clopidogrel, as appropriate. Notably, aspirin combined with clopidogrel shows only modest benefit in stroke prevention compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with AF who refuse oral anticoagulant drugs (including warfarin), or in those individuals who have difficulties in anticoagulation monitoring, and can be used where bleeding risk is not excessive.
