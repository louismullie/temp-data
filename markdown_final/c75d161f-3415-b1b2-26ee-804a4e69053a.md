## Question

gout flare up

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a gout flare-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the timing of therapy and first-line options. Next, I will consider dosing, safety, and comorbidity-driven adjustments, including CKD. After that, I need to check what to do if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective, including IL-1 blockade. I will then examine adjunctive measures and whether to start urate-lowering therapy during a flare. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, prophylaxis, and patient education elements that reduce recurrence and improve outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions, because septic arthritis, CPPD, and other inflammatory arthritides can mimic gout. I should prioritize joint aspiration when feasible to identify monosodium urate crystals, especially in monoarthritis or atypical presentations, while recognizing that many cases are diagnosed clinically based on classic features and risk factors, and that aspiration also enables intra-articular steroid if indicated [^b070eca0] [^538794e5] [^dcf30ea6].

> Wait, let me verify the timing principle: treat as early as possible. Guidelines converge on initiating anti-inflammatory therapy promptly, ideally within 12–24 hours of symptom onset, to shorten the flare and reduce severity, and patients should be educated to self-treat at the first warning symptoms whenever safe and appropriate [^d6940733] [^53f529f0] [^44adb76c].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacologic options. NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids are all strongly recommended as equivalent first-line choices, with selection driven by comorbidities, contraindications, prior response, and patient preference. I should confirm that low-dose colchicine is preferred over high-dose when colchicine is chosen due to similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c] [^268ef8a1].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing specifics to avoid errors. For colchicine, the FDA-labeled regimen is 1.2 mg immediately, then 0.6 mg one hour later, with no additional dosing during the flare; I initially thought to repeat 0.6 mg every hour, but wait, that would be incorrect and increases toxicity, so I should stick to the two-dose regimen and avoid exceeding 1.8 mg in 24 hours during a flare. For NSAIDs, use at full anti-inflammatory doses with gastroprotection as indicated. For glucocorticoids, 30–35 mg prednisone equivalent daily for 3–5 days is reasonable, or a single intra-articular injection for monoarthritis, with intramuscular options when oral therapy is not feasible [^44adb76c] [^53f529f0] [^4369ae21].

> Next, I should review comorbidity-driven adjustments, especially chronic kidney disease. In CKD, NSAIDs increase toxicity risk, so low-dose colchicine or glucocorticoids are preferred; I need to ensure colchicine dose reduction in advanced CKD and avoid strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors with colchicine, while remembering that short courses of oral steroids are acceptable alternatives when NSAIDs are unsafe [^ec5628dd] [^893983d0].

> But wait, what if first-line agents are contraindicated or ineffective? I should consider IL-1 blockade as a conditional option. Anakinra has randomized data showing non-inferiority to usual care and comparable efficacy to triamcinolone in selected patients, and canakinumab has evidence of superior pain and swelling reduction versus a single triamcinolone dose but with more adverse events and very high cost; I need to screen for active infection before IL-1 inhibitors and counsel on risks and benefits [^ac647dae] [^4a896b05] [^904441cb] [^3d0ffebe].

> I need to ensure I cover adjunctive measures. Topical ice is conditionally recommended as an adjunct to reduce pain and swelling, and joint immobilization with rest can improve comfort during the acute episode. I should also reinforce that these are adjuncts to, not substitutes for, pharmacologic therapy [^44adb76c] [^7043fabc].

> Now, should I start urate-lowering therapy during a flare? Historically, many taught to delay ULT until after resolution, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Contemporary guidelines conditionally recommend initiating ULT during a flare if the decision to start ULT has been made, provided adequate anti-inflammatory coverage is given, because starting ULT does not meaningfully prolong the current flare and may expedite disease control; I should pair ULT initiation with prophylaxis to mitigate mobilization flares [^f00b1b6c] [^4f057803] [^d097b803].

> I should double-check indications for ULT to avoid overtreatment. Strong indications include frequent flares (≥ 2/year), tophi, or radiographic damage attributable to gout; conditional indications include more than one prior flare even if infrequent, marked hyperuricemia (SU > 9 mg/dL), or CKD stage ≥ 3, and in these scenarios I should discuss benefits, harms, and costs with the patient using shared decision-making [^a3f9b726] [^c9b7306e] [^a8a4b616].

> Let me consider prophylaxis details so I don't miss anything. When starting or uptitrating ULT, anti-inflammatory prophylaxis with colchicine, NSAIDs, or low-dose prednisone is strongly recommended for at least 3–6 months, extending if flares continue; I should tailor the agent to comorbidities and monitor for adverse effects, especially with colchicine in renal impairment or interacting drugs [^58d2085f] [^7e8e216f] [^6c900825].

> Next, I should review treat-to-target principles and monitoring. Allopurinol is preferred first-line ULT, started low (≤ 100 mg/day, lower in CKD) and titrated every 2–5 weeks toward a serum urate target of < 6 mg/dL, or < 5 mg/dL in severe disease with tophi; I need to check serum urate periodically and adjust therapy to sustain the target, as this reduces flares, shrinks tophi, and prevents joint damage [^6575affc] [^5a66e003] [^6239eda6].

> I will now examine patient education and lifestyle measures that meaningfully reduce recurrence. Patients should understand that gout is a chronic crystal deposition disease, that ULT is typically lifelong, and that adherence improves outcomes; weight loss, limiting alcohol (especially beer), avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages, and optimizing cardiometabolic comorbidities are important, and I should also counsel on trigger avoidance and a medication-in-pocket strategy for early flare treatment [^8927cdec] [^538794e5] [^6575affc].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence and safety labs. Early follow-up within 2–4 weeks after ULT initiation helps assess adherence, tolerability, and early flares, with serum urate checked after dose changes to guide titration; I should also monitor CBC and renal function periodically, especially with colchicine or in CKD, and reassess prophylaxis needs at 3–6 months [^6239eda6] [^ec5628dd].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm diagnosis and exclude sepsis when indicated, treat early with NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids tailored to comorbidities, escalate to IL-1 blockade if first-line options fail or are contraindicated, add adjunctive ice and rest, initiate ULT during a flare if indicated with prophylaxis, titrate to serum urate target with allopurinol first-line, and embed education and lifestyle change with structured follow-up to sustain control and prevent recurrence [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c] [^f00b1b6c] [^6575affc].

A gout flare is a **rapid-onset, intensely painful** inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystals, typically peaking within 24 hours and resolving in 1–2 weeks [^538794e5] [^ac2e4508]. Immediate treatment with **NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids** is essential to relieve pain and shorten the flare, with the choice guided by comorbidities and contraindications [^526db9c4] [^44adb76c]. Early initiation within 24 hours improves outcomes, and **prophylaxis during urate-lowering therapy** reduces recurrence [^d6940733] [^58d2085f]. Persistent hyperuricemia and lifestyle factors (obesity, alcohol, purine-rich diet) increase flare risk; long-term urate-lowering therapy to a serum urate < 6 mg/dL prevents flares and joint damage [^c9b7306e] [^538794e5].

---

## Pathophysiology

Gout flares result from **urate crystal-triggered inflammation**: crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, driving IL-1β–mediated neutrophil recruitment and a robust inflammatory cascade [^d4a39792]. Flares are self-limited as anti-inflammatory mediators resolve inflammation, but repeated flares cause cumulative joint damage [^538794e5].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Onset**: Rapid, often nocturnal, with severe pain, erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness [^538794e5].
- **Distribution**: Monoarticular in ~90% of first flares; the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra) is classic, but ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows are also common [^538794e5].
- **Course**: Peaks within 24 hours, resolves in 1–2 weeks without treatment; flares become more frequent and polyarticular over time if hyperuricemia persists [^538794e5] [^0ae802d2].

---

## Triggers and risk factors

- **Hyperuricemia**: The primary driver; higher serum urate increases flare risk [^ff90e257].
- **Lifestyle**: Obesity, alcohol (especially beer), purine-rich diet, and sugary drinks elevate urate and flares [^538794e5].
- **Medications**: Diuretics, low-dose aspirin, and cyclosporine can raise urate or precipitate flares [^a14aeae8] [^893983d0].
- **Comorbidities**: CKD, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome increase risk [^b29fa923].
- **Acute events**: Trauma, surgery, or illness can trigger flares via rapid urate shifts [^notfound].

---

## Immediate management of acute flares

Early, effective **anti-inflammatory therapy** is critical; treat within 24 hours when possible [^d6940733].

| **Medication class** | **Examples and dosing** | **Indications and precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen 800 mg TID <br/> - Naproxen 750 mg load, then 250 mg Q8H <br/> - Indomethacin 50 mg TID | - First-line if no GI, CV, or renal contraindications <br/> - Use gastroprotection (PPI) as needed [^4369ae21] |
| Colchicine | - 1.2 mg load, then 0.6 mg in 1 hour <br/> - Max 1.8 mg in 24 hours | - Effective within 24 hours <br/> - Reduce dose in CKD <br/> - Avoid with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors [^44adb76c] [^893983d0] |
| Glucocorticoids | - Prednisone 30–40 mg/day × 3–5 days <br/> - Intra-articular triamcinolone for monoarthritis <br/> - IM methylprednisolone if oral not feasible | - Preferred in CKD, liver disease, or when NSAIDs/colchicine are contraindicated <br/> - Monitor for hyperglycemia and infection [^ec5628dd] [^ea2ddd5f] |
| IL-1 inhibitors | - Anakinra 100 mg SC daily × 3–5 days <br/> - Canakinumab 150 mg SC single dose | - For refractory flares or when standard therapies are contraindicated <br/> - Avoid in active infection [^3d0ffebe] [^ac647dae] |

---

Adjunctive measures include rest, elevation, and **topical ice** to reduce pain and swelling [^44adb76c] [^7043fabc].

---

## Prevention of recurrent flares

- **Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)**: Allopurinol or febuxostat to target serum urate < 6 mg/dL; start low and titrate every 2–5 weeks to target [^6575affc] [^6239eda6].
- **Prophylaxis**: Colchicine 0.5–1 mg/day or NSAIDs for ≥ 3–6 months when initiating ULT to prevent mobilization flares [^58d2085f] [^7e8e216f].
- **Lifestyle modification**: Weight loss, limit alcohol, reduce purines, hydrate, and manage comorbidities [^538794e5] [^a14aeae8].

---

## Complications of untreated or poorly controlled gout

- **Tophi**: Chronic urate deposits causing deformity and functional impairment [^538794e5].
- **Joint damage**: Erosive arthritis and chronic disability [^538794e5].
- **Renal disease**: Urate nephropathy and nephrolithiasis [^b29fa923].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Persistent inflammation and hyperuricemia increase CV morbidity [^4ceaa228].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Patients should be taught to recognize early symptoms and start **medication-in-pocket** therapy promptly [^6575affc]. Emphasize adherence to ULT and prophylaxis, and address lifestyle factors to reduce recurrence [^8927cdec] [^21d9d740].

---

A gout flare is a **rapid, painful inflammatory arthritis** from urate crystals; **early anti-inflammatory therapy** and long-term urate lowering are essential to control symptoms and prevent joint damage, with management tailored to comorbidities and patient preferences [^526db9c4] [^c9b7306e].

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^4e9e571a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Methods — ACR guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to rate the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. The Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions covering indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (8 questions), which were posted for public comment (October 30–November 30, 2018). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout reviewed the evidence report and discussed the desirable and undesirable outcomes for decision making; then prespecified outcomes were obtained for each PICO question from a systematic literature review, and both patient-identified outcomes and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT.

### Discordant American College of Physicians and international rheumatology guidelines for gout management: consensus statement of the gout, hyperuricemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) [^af19a095]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2017). Medium credibility.

In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.

### Gout flare and cardiovascular events… [^70026638]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest gout flares are associated with a transient increase in cardiovascular events following the flare. Importance Gout is associated with cardiovascular diseases. The temporal association between gout flares and cardiovascular events has not been investigated. Objective To investigate whether there is a transient increase in risk of cardiovascular events after a recent gout flare. Conclusions and Relevance Among individuals with gout, those who experienced a cardiovascular event, compared with those who did not experience such an event, had significantly higher odds of a recent gout flare in the preceding days. These findings suggest gout flares are associated with a transient increase in cardiovascular events following the flare.

Gout is characterized by low-grade inflammation with elevated concentration of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet hyperactivity that may precipitate atherothrombosis. 10 Gout flares are characterized by inflammation due to activation of the NALP3 inflammasome. In a randomized clinical trial, blocking the NALP3 inflammasome prevented recurrent cardiovascular events. 10, 11 Therefore, this study assessed whether gout flares were associated with a transient increase in rates of cardiovascular events. Because gout flares typically last for 1 to 2 weeks, gout-related consultations and prescriptions within 14 days of the first flare consultation were considered part of the same flare.

Patients were categorized according to whether they experienced gout flares within 0 to 60, 61 to 120, 121 to 180, after 180 days, or experienced no gout flares prior to the cardiovascular event or index date. For both the case-control study and the self-controlled case series, the outcomes were as follows: Primary: cardiovascular event defined as either acute myocardial infarction or stroke. Three secondary outcomes: fatal cardiovascular event, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. In the nested case-control study of patients with newly diagnosed gout, patients with cardiovascular events had significantly increased odds of a gout flare during the preceding 120 days compared with patients who did not experience cardiovascular events. These findings suggest that gout flares are associated with a transient increase in cardiovascular events following flares.

The increased odds persisted when people with preexisting cardiovascular diseases were excluded and when shorter exposure periods prior to the cardiovascular event were considered.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

### How would you manage this patient with gout? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^8071efc0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued a guideline, which was followed in 2017 by one from the American College of Physicians (ACP). The guidelines agree on treating acute gout with a corticosteroid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or colchicine and on not initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for most patients after a first gout attack and in those whose attacks are infrequent (< 2 per year). However, they differ on treatment of both recurrent gout and problematic gout. The ACR advocates a "treat-to-target" approach, and the ACP did not find enough evidence to support this approach and offered an alternative strategy that bases intensity of ULT on the goal of avoiding recurrent gout attacks ("treat-to-avoid-symptoms") with no monitoring of urate levels. They also disagree on the role of a gout-specific diet. Here, a general internist and a rheumatologist discuss these guidelines; they debate how they would manage an acute attack of gout, if and when to initiate ULT, and the goals for ULT. Lastly, they offer specific advice for a patient who is uncertain about whether to begin this therapy.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

Management

Treatment of a gout flare should be commenced as soon as possible, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine or glucocorticoids being first-line options for treatment. An open-label randomised trial comparing low-dose colchicine 500 mg three times per day for 4 days with naproxen 750 mg immediately, then 250 mg every 8 hours for 7 days found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of pain intensity over 7 days although side effects were more common in the colchicine group, mainly diarrhoea and headache. Another randomised trial comparing oral prednisone and naproxen for monoarticular gout found that either prednisolone 35 mg once a day or naproxen 500 mg two times a day for 5 days were equally effective, and adverse effects were similar between groups. Symptomatic treatment for a gout flare includes immobilisation of the joint and use of cold packs. Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibodies have also been found to be effective for relief of gout flaresand are generally recommended for patients experiencing gout flares where other drugs have caused side effects or were ineffective.

Long-term use of urate-lowering therapy leads to crystal dissolution, resulting in suppression of gout flares, regression of tophiand prevention of progressive joint damage. Rheumatology societies strongly recommend urate-lowering therapy for patients with tophi, evidence of radiographic damage attributable to gout or frequent gout flares. Urate-lowering therapy may also have benefit earlier in the disease course. Allopurinol is the preferred and most commonly prescribed first-line urate-lowering therapy. Second-line treatments include febuxostat, another xanthine oxidase inhibitor, probenecid, a uricosuric agent and pegloticase, a recombinant uricase administered intravenously.

A treat-to-target serum urate approach is recommended by the ACR guidelinesand EULAR recommendations. Serum urate monitoring allows the dose of medication to be titrated to a target serum urate of below 6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) in those with symptomatic gout and often below 5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with features of severe gout such as tophi.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout [^b070eca0]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout has been academically considered to be a step-up disease consisting of different stages: acute gout, intercritical gout, and chronic gout. This simple approach may lead to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. In clinical practice, we should consider gout as a single disease with either or both acute (most commonly, episodes of acute inflammation) and persistent clinical manifestations, but not restricted to chronic synovitis. In this article, an innovative, practical, and rational approach to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout is presented, which may be supportive for clinicians involved in everyday care and management of patients with gout.

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### Update on gout management: what is old and what is new [^bd33696f]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The global burden of gout is rising, as are the prevalence of associated comorbidities, all-cause mortality and societal costs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.

Recent Findings

Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.

Summary

Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed. There is substantial need for improving gout management efforts and gout education among patients and clinicians.

### Investigating gout flares: beyond a definition [^fac1ab3d]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout flares are a paramount component of disease burden inflicted by gout onto the patient. Furthermore, they are included in the core domain set for long-term gout studies recognized by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology. Along with a validated classification criterion for gout, gout investigators have turned their efforts into defining and characterizing the gout flare. This brief review will summarize the efforts that have been done to define and characterize a gout flare in clinical studies.

Recent Findings

Recent findings include a validated definition of a gout flare that has been utilized in novel clinical studies, use of technology to monitor for gout flares and their effects on patient life, and qualitative analyses into the disease burden that a patient undergoes.

Summary

Although guidelines for core outcome domains have been well established, there is question in methods of measuring and reporting gout flares in long-term trials. Furthermore, there is question as to the effectiveness of the agreed upon instruments' abilities to fully capture the disease burden experienced by patients with gout. A combination of outcome measurements including binary data (gout flare present or absent) along with a comprehensive measurement of disease burden over time would theoretically provide a more accurate description of the disease and serve as a basis for intervention development.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^d8603dd7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature for people who have gout. Gout flares affect just about every aspect of life including physical, psychological, social and family life. Prevention of gout flares is therefore a key goal of management for both health care providers and people with gout. Despite this, the majority of studies of urate‐lowering therapies have used serum urate (SU) as a "surrogate" measure for gout flares. However, the burden of gout flares is multifaceted and includes the number of flares as well as the severity of each individual flare. Defining the overall flare burden for people with gout has been challenging because of variable reporting and lack of a validated flares severity definition.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Flare prevention and treatment are critical aspects of gout management.
As gout flare burden increases, so does the impact of gout on the patient.
Most people commencing allopurinol are able to achieve gout flare patient‐acceptable symptom state or low disease activity in the second six months of treatment.

### Anakinra for the treatment of acute gout flares: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, non-inferiority trial [^ac647dae]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra in treating acute gout flares in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, non-inferiority (NI) trial.

Methods

Patients with a crystal-proven acute gout flare were randomized (1: 1) to treatment with anakinra or treatment as usual (free choice: either colchicine, naproxen or prednisone). The primary end point was the change in pain between baseline and the averaged pain score on days 2–4 measured on a five-point rating scale. NI of anakinra would be established if the upper bound of the 95% CI of the numeric difference in changed pain scores between treatment groups did not exceed the NI limit of 0.4 in favour of treatment as usual, in the per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) populations, assessed in an analysis of covariance model. Secondary outcomes included safety assessments, improvement in pain, swelling, tenderness and treatment response after 5 days, assessed using linear mixed models and binary logistic regression models.

Results

Forty-three patients received anakinra and 45 treatment as usual. Anakinra was non-inferior (mean difference; 95% CI) to treatment as usual in both the PP (-0.13; -0.44, 0.18) and ITT (-0.18; -0.44, 0.08) populations. No unexpected or uncommon (serious) adverse events were observed in either treatment arm. Analyses of secondary outcomes showed that patients in both groups reported similar significant reductions in their gout symptoms.

Conclusion

Efficacy of anakinra was shown to be non-inferior to treatment as usual for the treatment of acute gout flares, suggesting that anakinra is an effective treatment alternative for acute gout flares.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^d109f4d6]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

To enhance usability of a DA in daily practice, it is essential to adhere to national and/or international recommendations (EULAR/ACR). The distinction in the current DA between the first-line (allopurinol) and second-line (febuxostat and benzbromaron) ULT options, advice on lifestyle changes, need for prophylaxis on ULT initiation and the role of a sUA target are all supported in national as well as international recommendations.

The development of the DA posed some challenges, especially regarding evidence-based information on the risk of flares with and without ULT. Flares, the most important indicator of effectiveness for patients, are not or inconsistently reported in RCTs and follow-up is often too short to provide meaningful data on risks and benefits for clinical care. Fortunately, observational studies on the relation between sUA and flares with and without ULT were helpful, the discussion on sUA as biomarker for gout is ongoing. An advantage of this approach was that we could 'personalise' the DA, by presenting different risk for future flares depending on the initial sUA level while keeping the relative effectiveness of ULT. Some studies suggest that febuxostat has exacerbation of acute gout flares at the start of treatment, which is less the case for allopurinol, but evidence is weak. In other words, while febuxostat is more effective in sUA target achievement compared with allopurinol at the recommended dose, this does not translate into better effectiveness on flare reduction. Yet, the relationship between sUA and gout flares is complex.

### CaseBook challenges: managing gout, hyperuricemia and comorbidities – dialogue with the experts [^b29fa923]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia are on the rise in the United States corresponding with an increase in risk factors for these conditions, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the use of diuretics. A progressive disorder, untreated gout can be debilitating and result in tophi, chronic arthropathy, and recurrent kidney stones. Although joint aspiration is needed for a definitive diagnosis, the majority of patients are diagnosed presumptively based on medical history and presentation with characteristic signs and symptoms. Patients with gout also often have multiple comorbidities, and there is an increasing body of evidence that shows hyperuricemia is associated with incidence hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Clinical strategies for the management of gout and hyperuricemia must include considerations for these and other common cardiometabolic and renal conditions. In addition to acute flare therapy and prophylaxis, the treatment of gout involves lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels with the urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) allopurinol or febuxostat. Once begun, treatment with ULT is lifelong. However, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology stress tailoring therapy and target SUA level (traditionally < 6 mg/dL, but lower levels may be needed for certain patients) based on gout severity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Because painful acute gout flares may result in trips to the emergency department and because the majority of gout cases are managed in primary care, it is important for clinicians practicing in these settings to be able to diagnose and treat this condition and communicate with patients to improve their understanding of the disease process and adherence to treatment.

### Gout in primary care [^5b28a9e0]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Gout affects around 1% of people in the UK, most aged over 45 years. The condition, which is five times more common in men than women, usually presents as a painful inflammatory monoarthritis, which can be diagnosed clinically and successfully treated with a high dose of an NSAID. Problems arise when the features are atypical or when high doses of an NSAID are inappropriate. Also; there is no robust evidence to guide when to start prophylactic therapy or what advice to give on lifestyle changes. Here we review current practice and offer advice on managing patients with this increasingly common condition, concentrating on approaches to be taken by the non-specialist.

### What is gout? | Rheumatology-JAMA network… [^538794e5]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Yip K, Berman J. What Is Gout. JAMA. 2021; 326:

2541. doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.19770 Gout is a form of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the body. Gout can cause acute inflammation of 1 or more joints and in severe cases can lead to permanent joint damage. Uric acid crystals can also form hard lumpy deposits in the skin called tophi. A gout flare typically occurs over the span of a few hours with pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in a joint developing because of the presence of uric acid crystals. Often a gout flare involves a single joint but sometimes can affect multiple joints, including those in the feet, ankles, knees, and wrists. A gout flare tends to last several days; for most patients, it subsides over 2 weeks without treatment. Over time, repeated attacks can damage the joint, resulting in chronic gouty arthritis.

Gout is usually diagnosed by a medical professional through an evaluation of a patient's medical history and a physical examination. Blood may be tested for uric acid levels and x-ray scans may be performed to assess for arthritis in the joint. Sometimes fluid may be removed from a swollen joint to look for uric acid crystals under a microscope. There is no cure for gout. However, gout flares can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications. These drugs can reduce acute pain and swelling and are typically given for several days to weeks until a flare has subsided. To decrease the risk of future gout flares, medications may be used to lower uric acid levels in the body. These drugs are taken on a long-term basis.

Dietary modifications should be made to reduce intake of alcohol, sugary drinks, and foods that increase uric acid. Weight loss in overweight or obese people with gout results in lower uric acid levels and decreased gout symptoms. In addition, management of high blood pressure, careful use of diuretics, and staying well hydrated may be helpful to prevent gout flares.

### What represents treatment efficacy in long-term studies of gout flare prevention? An interview study of people with gout [^6979eb41]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The patient experience of gout flares is multidimensional, with several contributing factors including pain intensity, duration, and frequency. There is currently no consistent method for reporting gout flare burden in long-term studies. This study aimed to determine which factors contribute to patient perceptions of treatment efficacy in long-term studies of gout flare prevention.

Methods

This study involved face-to-face interviews with people with gout using visual representations of gout flare patterns. Participants were shown different flare scenarios over a hypothetical 6-month treatment period that portrayed varying flare frequency, pain intensity, and flare duration. The participants were asked to indicate and discuss which scenario they believed was most indicative of successful treatment over time. Quantitative data relating to the proportion of participants selecting each scenario were reported using descriptive statistics. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to code and categorize the data from the interview transcripts.

Results

Twenty-two people with gout participated in the semistructured interviews. All 3 factors of pain intensity, flare duration, and flare frequency influenced participants' perception of treatment efficacy. However, a shorter flare duration was the most common indicator of successful treatment, with half of participants (n = 11, 50%) selecting the scenario with a shorter flare duration over those with less painful flares.

Conclusion

Flare duration, flare frequency, and pain severity are all taken into account by patients with gout when considering treatment efficacy over time. Long-term studies of gout should ideally capture all these factors to better represent patients' experience of treatment success.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^d097b803]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes to spontaneously resolve inflammation during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the recommended guidelines, and inflammation was reflected only using VAS, and not by joint swelling, tenderness and erythema.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^ba809735]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation

The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways cited above. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ.

Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids also paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not simply neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison to allopurinol in a Phase II randomized controlled trial comparing ULT strategies and flare prophylaxis.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Assessment of outcome in clinical trials of gout – a review of current measures [^fcf953d9]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

There has been renewed interest in the treatment of gout with recent reported intervention studies of new agents such as etoricoxib, febuxostat and pegylated-uricase. However, these studies have highlighted the relative paucity of validated outcome measures with which to judge efficacy. This review outlines the published information regarding which endpoints have been measured in randomized clinical trials, what should be measured, what tools or instruments are available for this and the technical properties of such instruments. It highlights recent work that validates measures of tophi, radiographic damage and patient-reported outcomes. The absence of a valid definition of gout-flare or how flare reduction defines response is problematic; this forms the basis for a current ACR-EULAR sponsored project.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^904441cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability and it is important to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 19 June 2013. We applied no date or language restrictions. We performed a handsearch of the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and of the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the US National Institutes of Health.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included four studies (806 participants) in the review. The studies had an unclear risk of selection bias and low risk of performance and attrition biases. One study each had an unclear risk of detection and selection bias. Three studies (654 participants) compared subcutaneous canakinumab compared with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in the treatment of acute gout flares of no more than five days' duration. Doses of canakinumab were varied (10 to 150 mg), but most people (255/368) were treated with canakinumab 150 mg. None of the studies provided data on participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that canakinumab 150 mg was probably superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in terms of pain relief, resolution of joint swelling and in achieving a good treatment response at 72 hours following treatment, but was probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Mean pain (0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 mm was no pain) was 36 mm after triamcinolone acetonide treatment; pain was further reduced by a mean of 11 mm with canakinumab treatment (mean difference (MD) -10.6 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.2 to -5.9). Forty-four per cent of participants treated with canakinumab had resolution of joint swelling at 72 hours compared with 32% of participants treated with triamcinolone (risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.74, number needed to treat for an addition beneficial outcome (NNTB) 9); 65% of participants treated with canakinumab assessed their response to treatment as good or excellent compare with 47% of participants treated with triamcinolone acetonide (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61, NNTB 6). Function or health-related quality of life were not measured. In both groups, 0.7% of participants withdrew from treatment (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2 to 7.2); there was one death and one alteration of laboratory results in each of the treatment groups. Adverse events were more frequent in participants receiving canakinumab (61%) compared with triamcinolone acetonide (51%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4, number needed to treat for an addition harmful outcome (NNTH) 10). Low-quality evidence from one study (152 participants with an acute gout flare of no more than 48 hours' duration and affecting fewer than four joints) comparing rilonacept 320 mg with indomethacin (50 mg three times a day for three days followed by 25 mg three times a day for up to nine days) indicated that indomethacin may improve pain more than rilonacept at 24 to 72 hours, and there may be no evidence of a difference in withdrawal rates or adverse events. The mean change (improvement) in pain from baseline with indomethacin was 4.3 points (measured on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, where 0 was no pain); pain was improved by a mean of only 2.5 points with rilonacept (MD 2.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.75, 25% less improvement in absolute pain with rilonacept). Inflammation, function health-related quality of life and participant global assessment of treatment success were not measured. Rates of study withdrawals due to adverse events were low in both groups: 1/75 (1%) participants in the rilonacept group compared with 2/76 (3%) participants in the indomethacin group (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.5). Adverse events were reported in 27/75 (36%) participants in the rilonacept group and 23/76 (30%) in the indomethacin group (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence indicated that compared with a single suboptimal 40-mg dose of intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide, a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg of canakinumab probably results in better pain relief, joint swelling and participant-assessed global assessment of treatment response in people with an acute gout flare but is probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. The cost of canakinumab is over 5000 times higher than triamcinolone acetonide; however, there are no data on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. We found no studies comparing canakinumab with more commonly used first-line therapies for acute gout flares such as NSAIDs or colchicine. Low-quality evidence indicated that compared with maximum doses of indomethacin (50 mg three times a day), 320 mg of rilonacept may provide less pain relief with a similar rate of adverse events.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^d95935e3]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the USA between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Spontaneous resolution of acute gout: mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^589bebfa]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

At present, the number of patients with refractory gout is continuing to increase, and the question of how to control acute attacks in patients with refractory gout is a clinical problem that requires urgent resolution. Treatment of acute gout inflammation mainly relies on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and glucocorticoids; however, refractory gout is a persistence of clinical manifestations characterised by the inability to reduce the serum urate acid concentration below the target 6.0 mg/dL, increased MSU deposition and tophi formation, and chronic inflammatory arthritis, ongoing symptoms of recurrent flares. Patients with refractory gout often do not respond well to these drugs or have contraindications. Targeted therapy, including biologics and targeted synthetic small molecule drugs, has been widely used in other inflammatory arthritis diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, with promising results. We hope that patients with refractory gout can receive similar targeted therapies to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We have discovered many potential therapeutic targets by elucidating the pathogenesis and self-remission mechanisms of gout (figure 1). Fortunately, some drugs have either received approval or are currently in clinical trials. We believe that targeted therapy for gout is coming soon, providing welcome relief for patients with refractory gout.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of gout [^a14aeae8]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by painful joint inflammation, most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, resulting from precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in a joint space. Gout is typically diagnosed using clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology. Diagnosis may be confirmed by identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid of the affected joint. Acute gout may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, or colchicine. To reduce the likelihood of recurrent flares, patients should limit their consumption of certain purine-rich foods (e.g., organ meats, shellfish) and avoid alcoholic drinks (especially beer) and beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. Consumption of vegetables and low-fat or nonfat dairy products should be encouraged. The use of loop and thiazide diuretics can increase uric acid levels, whereas the use of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan increases urinary excretion of uric acid. Reduction of uric acid levels is key to avoiding gout flares. Allopurinol and febuxostat are first-line medications for the prevention of recurrent gout, and colchicine and/or probenecid are reserved for patients who cannot tolerate first-line agents or in whom first-line agents are ineffective. Patients receiving urate-lowering medications should be treated concurrently with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, or low-dose corticosteroids to prevent flares. Treatment should continue for at least three months after uric acid levels fall below the target goal in those without tophi, and for six months in those with a history of tophi.

### Recommendations in clinical practice guidelines on gout: systematic review and consistency analysis [^e2c99f4c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare and analyse the recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on gout worldwide, examine the consistency across CPGs, and provide suggestions to develop and update gout guidelines.

Methods

We conducted systematic searches in MEDLINE, CBM, GIN, NICE, NGC, WHO, SIGN, DynaMed, UpToDate, and Best Practice databases, from their inception to August 2019 to identify and select CPGs related to gout. We used the search terms "gout", "hyperuricaemia" and "guideline". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.

Results

A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥ 50%) in all six domains. There was substantial discrepancy between the guidelines in recommendations covering the value of computed tomography (CT) and x-rays for diagnosis, the use of corticosteroids as a first-line treatment for flare, the use of colchicine, indications for ULT, the use of febuxostat as first-line ULT, the administration of allopurinol, and the timing of ULT initiation.

Conlusions

A number of countries are devoting themselves to the development of gout guidelines, but the process of updating guidelines is slower than that suggested by the WHO. Methodological quality is not satisfactory in most guidelines, and recommendations between guidelines are not consistent.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^bea6ab4b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — strong recommendations included initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage ≥ 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended, and for management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^ec5628dd]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — acute gout management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. For colchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration–approved dosing is 1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy until the flare has resolved; dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously, and short courses of oral glucocorticoids such as 30 mg prednisone orally for 3–5 days could be used as an alternative.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^25f55c58]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### A randomized, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of anakinra in the treatment of gout flares [^4a896b05]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anakinra compared to triamcinolone in the treatment of gout flares.

Methods

Patients for whom nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and colchicine were not suitable treatments were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study with follow-up for up to 2 years. The study was designed to assess superiority of anakinra (100 or 200 mg/day for 5 days) over triamcinolone (40 mg in a single injection) for the primary end point of changed patient-assessed pain intensity in the most affected joint (scored on a visual analog scale of 0–100) from baseline to 24–72 hours. Secondary outcome measures included: safety, immunogenicity, and patient- and physician-assessed global response.

Results

One hundred sixty-five patients were randomized to receive anakinra (n = 110) or triamcinolone (n = 55). The median age was 55 years (range 25–83), 87% were men, the mean disease duration was 8.7 years, and the mean number of self-reported flares during the prior year was 4.5. A total of 301 flares were treated (214 with anakinra; 87 with triamcinolone). Anakinra in both doses and triamcinolone provided clinically meaningful reduction in patient-assessed pain intensity in the first and subsequent flares. For the first flare, the mean decline in pain intensity from baseline to 24–72 hours for total anakinra and triamcinolone was -41.2 and -39.4, respectively (P = 0.688). Anakinra performed better than triamcinolone for most secondary end points. There were no unexpected safety findings. The presence of antidrug antibodies was not associated with adverse events or altered pain reduction.

Conclusion

Anakinra was not superior to triamcinolone for the primary end point, but had comparable efficacy in pain reduction and was favored for most secondary end points. Anakinra is an effective option for gout flares when conventional therapy is unsuitable.

### A randomized, double-blind, active-and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^87ca7ca2]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Study outcome measures

The primary outcome measure of efficacy was the flare incidence from baseline to week 12. The flare incidence was calculated as the number of flares in a treatment arm divided by the total period of time with available electronic diary data. A flare was defined as an episode of patient‐reported acute articular or bursal pain that occurred at rest and was typical of past gout attacks. In addition, both of the following criteria had to be met: the intensity of pain at rest had to be ≥ 4 on an 11‐point numerical rating scale, and the pain had to be determined by the patient and/or the investigator to require antiinflammatory/analgesic treatment. Finally, at least 2 of 3 possible joint symptoms (swelling, warmth, or tenderness) had to be present, and at least 1 of the following had to be present: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of joint motion, or joint redness. All these were reported by the patient in response to simple questions appearing in the electronic diary (e.g. "was the pain of rapid onset?"). Patients had the opportunity to assess their understanding of each question during the training session.

Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the percent reduction in serum UA level and the proportion of patients with a serum UA level of < 6 mg/dl. Other efficacy outcome measures such as quality of life were considered exploratory.

Safety outcome measures were serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuation from the study for reasons of safety, treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and changes in laboratory parameter values. Arhalofenate acid trough levels were determined.

Symptoms and impact

The key symptom of the gout flare is severe joint pain. Qualitative studies of patients with gout show that pain is an important symptom. Other symptoms of a gout flare are joint swelling, redness and heat. Typically, the symptoms develop quickly, often starting at night, peak within 24 hours and resolve within 1–2 weeks.

Patients commonly experience difficulty mobilising during a gout flare. Sleep disorders and daytime sleepiness are also frequently seen. Work absences are higher in people with gout; a Swedish population-based cohort study reported an average work absentee rate over 3 years of 22% in people with gout compared with 14% of matched population controls. Gout also has an impact on family and wider community. Family members may be absent from work or education to care for those with gout. There is also a financial impact on the family and on businesses when individuals with gout are absent from work or unemployed, with annual loss of income for patients with severe gout estimated to be up to US$4341 per year.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^c1ebc32e]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

Recent Findings

Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade including those from the British Rheumatism Society; the European League Against Rheumatism; the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative; the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism; the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the extant guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow and initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate is infrequent. Greater education in proper management as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

Summary

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^dc5b2130]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Relationship between gout flare States and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^f4f64d47]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Low disease activity (LDA) has been defined as "a useful target of treatment by both physician and patient, given current treatment possibilities and limitations". Patient‐acceptable symptom state (PASS) has been defined as the "value beyond which the patient feels well", that is, a tolerable level of symptoms for the individual. In 2021, Taylor et alrecruited 512 participants who answered questions about their gout flares that would classify them into one of three gout flare states: (i) remission, defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think your gout has gone away?"; (ii) LDA, defined as a negative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think you need more or stronger treatment?"; or (iii) PASS, defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, would you say that your gout control is currently satisfactory?" Participants also reported the hypothetical maximum number of flares that they could experience over 6 and 12 months and still consider themselves to be in the associated disease activity state. Based on these data, participants in LDA reported a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (0–2) flares and those in PASS 0 (0–1) flares in a six‐month period. Similar results were observed over a 12‐month period, with participants in PASS reporting a median (IQR) 0 (0–2) flares and in LDA 1 (0–2) flares. Whether LDA and PASS are associated with patient‐reported outcomes is unknown. The aim of this analysis was to determine the relationship between gout flare states (PASS, LDA, and not in LDA or PASS [non‐LDA/PASS]) and patient‐reported outcomes.

### Development of a patient decision aid for the initiation of urate-lowering therapy in gout patients [^ff90e257]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature search

Three SLRs were identified, synthetising efficacy of allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosurics. As the last search of each review was older than 12 months, updates were conducted using each SLR's original search strategy. Overall, six RCTs were selected comparing effect of ULT to placebo or other ULTs on flares as outcome (the preferred outcome for patients). After tabulating the study characteristics, data turned out to be too heterogeneous (eg, exclusion criteria, definition of flares, sUA level at inclusion) and follow-up time was too short to provide meaningful data on efficacy on flares (as flares provoked by ULT initiation distorts long-term efficacy). Therefore, an available review of five longitudinal studies reporting data on the association of flares according to sUA category was used. The study best fitting our target population, concerned patients with rheumatologists diagnosed gout and clinically confirmed flares. Of note, the majority of patients were (not yet) treated with ULT during follow-up. As the relation between sUA and flare was steep, it was decided to distinguish two sUA categories, differing in future flares risk. In patients with an sUA of > 0.36– < 0.55 mmol/L, future flares risk was 48/100 and in patients with a sUA ≥ 0.55 mmol/L future flare risk was 90/100 within a follow-up period of at least 1 year. Patients who would reach the sUA target (≤ 0.36 mmol/L) would have a future flares risk of 12/100. To understand the relative efficacy of the different ULTs, one head-to-head RCT comparing allopurinol, febuxostat and placebo concluded a stronger impact of febuxostat compared with allopurinol on sUA but not on flares.

### An update on the management of gout [^98645b9a]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

Key Points for Practice
- During a second gout flare-up in one year, low-dose allopurinol can be started with anti-inflammatory therapy without worsening the flare-up.
- Allopurinol is the preferred urate-lowering agent, but HLA testing should be offered to patients of Southeast Asian or African American descent before starting to identify patients at risk for an allergic reaction.
- Titrating urate-lowering therapy to reach a serum urate level of 6 mg per dL decreases flare-ups and increases treatment adherence.
- During acute flare-ups, low-dose colchicine, NSAIDs, and glucocorticoids delivered orally, intramuscularly, or intra-articularly are similarly effective. When to Consider Urate-Lowering Therapy Urate-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with two or more gout flare-ups per year, tophaceous gout, or damage attributable to gout visible on radiography. Consider starting therapy for patients with a second flare-up even if not within one year.

With a first gout flare-up, shared decision-making is appropriate in patients at high risk because of a serum urate level of 9 mg per dL or higher, urolithiasis, or stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. Consider starting allopurinol at 100 mg or less daily and febuxostat at 40 mg or less daily. Dosing should be increased every two to five weeks to reduce serum urate levels to 6 mg per dL or less. Titrating medication slowly increases adherence while reducing flare-ups and tophi. Urate-lowering therapy may have to be continued for life. In a study of patients with low serum urate levels, 87% had flare-ups within five years of stopping urate-lowering therapy. Acute Flare-up Management Several medications are effective for acute flare-ups. The effectiveness of low-dose colchicine is similar to that of high-dose colchicine with fewer adverse effects. NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are as effective as colchicine.

Glucocorticoids can be given intramuscularly, intra-articularly, or orally. Interleukin-1 inhibitors and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less evidence and higher cost. Limited evidence suggests topical ice is helpful as an adjuvant treatment.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^f013602e]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. In addition, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. However, this recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares. Our objective of this study was to determine whether the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

Regarding patient education for gout, more specifically with respect to general counseling, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend to inform all patients with gout about the pathophysiology of the disease, the existence of effective treatments, associated comorbidities and the principles of managing acute attacks and eliminating urate crystals through lifelong lowering of serum urate level below a target level.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle-initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^048ace40]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Nevertheless, excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured); participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias; and, finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This Perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely (1) associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target; (2) the fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL; and (3) the use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome in gout randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the drug approval of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) by the regulatory authorities. Since there is no way to achieve the sUA target without monitoring or reassessing sUA, rheumatologists monitor sUA and aim for an sUA target level of less than 6 mg/dL. Therapeutic doses of allopurinol (100–800 mg/day) or febuxostat (40–80 mg/day) or a combination with uricosurics is often needed to achieve target sUA. Allopurinol maximum dose need not be reduced, even in the presence of renal failure, since adverse events are related to initial, and not final, allopurinol dose; pegloticase is another option. Appropriately titrated ULT doses can help achieve a near cure for gout by resolving all urate crystals.

### The clinical benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors in people with gout [^4ceaa228]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis worldwide and is characterized by painful recurrent flares of inflammatory arthritis that are associated with a transiently increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Furthermore, gout is associated with multiple cardiometabolic-renal comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. These comorbidities, potentially combined with gout flare-related inflammation, contribute to persistent premature mortality in gout, independently of serum urate concentrations and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Although better implementation of standard gout care could improve gout outcomes, deliberate efforts to address the cardiovascular risk in patients with gout are likely to be required to reduce mortality. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are approved for multiple indications owing to their ability to lower the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, hospitalizations for heart failure and chronic kidney disease progression, making them an attractive treatment option for gout. These medications have also been shown to lower serum urate concentrations, the causal culprit in gout risk, and are associated with a reduced risk of incident and recurrent gout, potentially owing to their purported anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, SGLT2 inhibition could simultaneously address both the symptoms of gout and its comorbidities.

Gout — starting dose and titration of ULT — starting treatment with low-dose allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥ 3]) and febuxostat (≤ 40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended; starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation, and lower initial allopurinol doses (e.g., ≤ 50 mg/day) are noted as examples.

### Casebook consults: improving outcomes in gout (multimedia activity) [^438cd63e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic, potentially debilitating condition characterized by an inflammatory process in the joints or periarticular tissues that results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment can lead to the development of tophi and chronic arthropathy. A presumptive diagnosis of gout can be made on the basis of the clinical presentation as well as risk factors such as metabolic syndrome. Key conditions to rule out in the differential diagnosis are septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (pseudogout), fracture, and rheumatoid arthritis. Acute flares of gout should be managed with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or corticosteroids. With a diagnosis of gout, if urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is required, prophylaxis should be considered with low-dose colchicine or an NSAID, followed by the addition of ULT. The goal of ULT is to reach a serum uric acid (SUA) level ≤ 6.0 mg/dL. Measurements of SUA should be obtained after resolution of an acute attack, then periodically to facilitate titration of the ULT dose to achieve the target SUA level. Studies have confirmed significant reductions in gout attacks among patients who have attained SUA levels ≤ 6.0 mg/dL with ULT. Patient education concerning the disease and its treatment is essential to ensure close adherence with recommended therapies. Patients should also understand that ULT is intended as long-term, and for most patients, lifelong therapy to maximize the prospects for control of the disease. Clinicians should feel confident in making a presumptive diagnosis and choosing a therapeutic regimen for gout while effectively communicating with and educating patients about their disease.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.
