## Question

is there an alternative to pregabalin that is safe in pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is an alternative to pregabalin that is safe in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "safe" means in pregnancy for a medication like pregabalin. Then, I should verify the current pregnancy safety profile of pregabalin itself. Next, I will identify potential pharmacologic alternatives and appraise their pregnancy safety data. After that, I need to consider non-pharmacologic options. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline monitoring and counseling steps, including registries and folic acid, to ensure the plan is clinically actionable and evidence-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and what "safe" should mean here. In pregnancy, "safe" generally implies no clear increase in major congenital malformations, no consistent signal for miscarriage or fetal growth restriction, and no established neonatal withdrawal or neurodevelopmental harm; importantly, it also means the benefit of treating the maternal condition outweighs potential fetal risks, which is a shared decision-making principle for chronic pain, epilepsy, or anxiety indications where pregabalin is used.

> I need to check pregabalin's current pregnancy safety profile to anchor the comparison. Observational human data suggest a possible small increase in overall major birth defects with first-trimester exposure, but there is no consistent pattern of malformations and estimates attenuate with adjustment; pooled analyses show crude risks around 5–6% that drop to roughly background levels after propensity score adjustment, and a large Medicaid-based cohort found an adjusted relative risk of 1.16 (95% CI 0.81–1.67) for major malformations, with a pooled monotherapy estimate of 1.02 (95% CI 0.69–1.51) [^113AaqEM] [^1112BTtJ]. Hold on, I should verify neonatal risks too: postmarketing and guideline notes flag potential neonatal withdrawal when gabapentinoids are combined with opioids near delivery, though data are insufficient to define a standalone pregabalin withdrawal risk, so caution is warranted late in gestation [^115i1NCb] [^112AR2d6].

> Next, I should review gabapentin as the most obvious alternative. Wait, let me verify the malformation signal. A prospective comparative cohort did not find an increased major malformation risk with first-trimester gabapentin, but it did observe higher rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal intensive care admissions, including possible poor neonatal adaptation in some infants exposed near delivery, so I should not overstate "safety" here [^111ZCvUZ]. I should double-check broader syntheses: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies found no significant association with major congenital malformations (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.45–1.53), which supports a reassuring teratogenicity profile, but neonatal adaptation concerns persist and warrant individualized risk–benefit review, especially with late-pregnancy exposure or co-medications [^1121CSBS] [^111ZCvUZ]. The FDA labeling continues to advise use only if benefits outweigh risks and encourages registry enrollment, reflecting residual uncertainty despite accumulating data [^117Rdbxh].

> Let me consider other pharmacologic options by indication, starting with chronic neuropathic or musculoskeletal pain. Acetaminophen remains first-line for mild to moderate pain given its strong safety record across trimesters when used at recommended doses, though it may be insufficient for neuropathic pain; tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are considered compatible in pregnancy and can be effective for neuropathic pain at low doses, with very low breast milk transfer and no clear teratogenic signal in available data; SNRIs like duloxetine or venlafaxine may be considered when appropriate, balancing small neonatal risks and limited but generally reassuring pregnancy data, and they are often used for chronic pain and comorbid mood symptoms [^115H8fQE]. Hold on, I should verify that these align with guidelines: rheumatology and pain-in-pregnancy guidance endorse these alternatives when gabapentinoids are not preferred, reinforcing their role as reasonable substitutes depending on pain phenotype and comorbidities [^1134CL7Q].

> For epilepsy, I need to ensure I am precise. Lamotrigine and levetiracetam have the most favorable pregnancy safety profiles among antiseizure medications, with low malformation risks and reassuring neurodevelopmental data in large registries and comparative studies; in contrast, valproate, topiramate, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital carry higher risks and are generally avoided in pregnancy when alternatives exist, so if pregabalin was being used for seizures, switching to lamotrigine or levetiracetam preconception or early in pregnancy is standard practice [^116zJxc9] [^113HZkuF] [^115Web1Y]. But wait, what if the indication is not epilepsy? I should confirm that these switches are framed within epilepsy care, since lamotrigine and levetiracetam are not analgesics and would not substitute for pregabalin in chronic pain management.

> For anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder, I should review non-gabapentinoid options. SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly used in pregnancy, with sertraline, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine having the most data; risks include neonatal adaptation symptoms and, for some agents, small increases in certain neonatal outcomes, but untreated maternal anxiety also carries perinatal risks, so continuation with the safest agent at the lowest effective dose is often reasonable after shared decision-making and prenatal coordination [^116qTAak] [^113e8qKY]. I need to ensure I note that this applies when anxiety is the target indication, not when pregabalin is used for pain, to avoid indication mismatch.

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic strategies that reduce medication exposure. For chronic pain, multimodal approaches such as physical therapy, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and TENS can meaningfully reduce pain burden in pregnancy; for migraine, noninvasive neuromodulation devices and occipital nerve blocks are evidence-informed options; for anxiety, psychotherapy remains foundational and can reduce or obviate the need for medication in some patients, though access and severity must be considered [^116zbcvp]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: these modalities may not fully replace pharmacotherapy in moderate to severe cases, so they should be integrated rather than used exclusively when symptoms are function-limiting [^116zbcvp].

> I should confirm practical safety steps if any gabapentinoid must be used. If pregabalin or gabapentin is continued, use the lowest effective dose, prefer monotherapy, avoid late-pregnancy initiation when possible, and coordinate obstetric and pediatric teams for neonatal observation if exposure occurs near delivery; enroll the patient in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry (1–888–233–4) to contribute to safety data and consider high-dose folic acid (5 mg/day) preconception through the first trimester, as recommended for women on antiseizure medications even when the indication is pain rather than epilepsy, given mechanistic plausibility and guideline precedent [^115i1NCb] [^112AR2d6]. I should double-check that this aligns with labeling and guidance, which it does, albeit with the caveat that folic acid evidence is stronger for epilepsy populations than for pain-only indications [^115i1NCb] [^112AR2d6].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. There is no medication with an unequivocal "safe" designation that perfectly substitutes for pregabalin across all indications, but several alternatives have reassuring pregnancy data and can be prioritized based on the clinical target: gabapentin has a generally reassuring malformation profile but requires caution due to neonatal adaptation concerns and should be used at the lowest effective dose with late-pregnancy planning; acetaminophen is first-line for mild to moderate pain; amitriptyline or SNRIs are reasonable for neuropathic pain when appropriate; lamotrigine or levetiracetam are preferred if the indication is epilepsy; SSRIs/SNRIs are appropriate for anxiety; and non-pharmacologic therapies should be maximized whenever feasible to reduce medication exposure, with all decisions made through shared decision-making and coordinated prenatal care [^113AaqEM] [^111ZCvUZ] [^115H8fQE] [^116qTAak] [^116zJxc9] [^116zbcvp].

Pregabalin is not considered safe in pregnancy due to possible increased risk of major congenital malformations and neonatal withdrawal, especially with first-trimester exposure [^115GnQ2Y] [^115i1NCb]. The safest alternatives are **non-pharmacologic therapies** (physical therapy, acupuncture, CBT, mindfulness) and **acetaminophen** as first-line for mild pain [^116zbcvp] [^115H8fQE]. If pharmacologic therapy is needed, **gabapentin** is the preferred alternative with the most reassuring human data, though it still requires caution and shared decision-making [^1121CSBS] [^111ZCvUZ]. TCAs (e.g. nortriptyline) or SNRIs (e.g. duloxetine) may be considered for neuropathic pain when gabapentin is unsuitable, and opioids are reserved for severe refractory pain with close monitoring [^116qTAak] [^116zbcvp]. Avoid **NSAIDs after 20 weeks** and coordinate care with maternal-fetal medicine [^116zbcvp].

---

## Non-pharmacological alternatives

Non-pharmacological interventions are **first-line** for pain management in pregnancy because of their favorable safety profiles:

- **Physical therapy**: Effective for musculoskeletal pain, including low back and pelvic pain [^116zbcvp].

- **Acupuncture**: Considered safe and effective for certain pain conditions during pregnancy [^notfound].

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Useful for chronic pain and anxiety-related symptoms [^notfound].

- **Mindfulness and relaxation techniques**: Helpful for stress-related pain and anxiety [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological alternatives

When non-pharmacological measures are insufficient, **pharmacological alternatives** may be considered:

| **Medication** | **Safety profile in pregnancy** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen (paracetamol) | - First-line for mild pain <br/> - No known teratogenicity | Use at lowest effective dose; avoid exceeding 3,000–4,000 mg/day [^115H8fQE] |
| Gabapentin | - Preferred alternative to pregabalin <br/> - No clear increase in major malformations <br/> - Neonatal withdrawal reported with late exposure | Use with caution; monitor neonate if used late in pregnancy [^1121CSBS] [^111ZCvUZ] |
| Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, e.g. nortriptyline) | - Compatible with pregnancy <br/> - Low risk of major malformations | Consider for neuropathic pain; monitor for anticholinergic effects [^116qTAak] |
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g. duloxetine) | - May be considered <br/> - Limited data but generally reassuring | Monitor for neonatal adaptation symptoms [^116qTAak] |
| Opioids (e.g. codeine, oxycodone) | - Reserved for severe refractory pain <br/> - Short-term use only <br/> - Risk of neonatal withdrawal | Use with caution; monitor neonate closely [^116zbcvp] |

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

Certain medications should be **avoided or used with extreme caution** during pregnancy:

- **NSAIDs**: Avoid after 20 weeks due to risk of ductus arteriosus closure and renal impairment [^116zbcvp].

- **Benzodiazepines**: Associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal withdrawal; use only if absolutely necessary [^112vqN6w].

- **Valproate and topiramate**: Contraindicated due to high teratogenic risk [^115xVptj].

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss risks and benefits with the patient, considering the severity of pain and available alternatives [^1134CL7Q].

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimum effective dose and avoid polypharmacy when possible [^117Rdbxh].

- **Monitoring**: Close maternal and fetal monitoring throughout pregnancy, especially if medications are continued into the third trimester [^notfound].

- **Folic acid supplementation**: Recommended for all pregnant patients, particularly those on antiepileptic or psychiatric medications [^112AR2d6].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Pregabalin is not considered safe in pregnancy due to potential fetal risks. The safest alternatives include **non-pharmacological therapies** and **acetaminophen** for mild pain. Gabapentin is the preferred pharmacological alternative when needed, with TCAs and SNRIs as additional options. Opioids are reserved for severe refractory pain with close monitoring. Shared decision-making and individualized care are essential, and patients should be counseled on the risks and benefits of each option.

### Safety of pregabalin in pregnancy [^112kyzSr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In different parts of the world, pregabalin is an approved treatment for neuropathic pain syndromes, fibromyalgia, partial-onset seizures, and generalized anxiety disorder. Few studies have examined the safety of pregabalin exposure during pregnancy. Among 4 studies identified through a PubMed search conducted in September 2018, one small study (exposed n = 30) recorded a major malformation rate of 3.3%, which was similar to that in unexposed controls. Another small study (exposed n = 30) recorded increased rates of spontaneous abortion (23.3%), preterm birth (25.0%), and major malformations (7.7%), none of which reached statistical significance even in unadjusted analyses. A third study (exposed n = 116) identified a significantly increased rate of major malformations (6.0%) but no increase in the rates of other adverse birth outcomes. The fourth and largest study (exposed n = 477 and n = 174; 2 datasets), which also presented the best statistical analysis, found no increase in the major malformation risk associated with pregabalin exposure. A subjective conclusion is that there is no clear signal that pregabalin exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse gestational outcomes; however, this conclusion is limited by the consideration that all analyses were underpowered. Pregabalin use in pregnancy is therefore best restricted to circumstances in which the risk-benefit ratio is clearly favorable, and then, only after shared decision-making.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin capsules during pregnancy. To provide information regarding the effects of in utero exposure to pregabalin capsules, physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking pregabalin capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website

Risk Summary

Observational studies on the use of pregabalin during pregnancy suggest a possible small increase in the rate of overall major birth defects, but there was no consistent or specific pattern of major birth defects identified (see Data). Available postmarketing data on miscarriage and other maternal, fetal, and long term developmental adverse effects were insufficient to identify risk associated with pregabalin.

Postmarketing data suggest that extended gabapentinoid use with opioids close to delivery may increase the risk of neonatal withdrawal versus opioids alone (see Clinical Considerations). There are no comparative epidemiologic studies evaluating this association. Therefore, it is not known whether exposure to pregabalin alone late in pregnancy may cause withdrawal signs and symptoms.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^112AR2d6]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Following completion of our guidelines, the MHRA issued a safety warning on the use of pregabalin in pregnancy based on new data available online. This new data has been considered in the latest UKTIS update in April 2022 that states that the available data do not provide conclusive evidence that maternal pregabalin use in the first trimester, or at any stage of pregnancy, is associated with increased risks of either overall malformation or any specific malformations. Therefore, our recommendations have not changed.

UKTIS found no controlled studies of the risk of neonatal complication following prenatal gabapentin or pregabalin exposure, although one study has described a small number of affected infants, including one case of neonatal withdrawal following in-utero pregabalin exposure. Use of any centrally acting drug throughout pregnancy or near delivery may be associated with withdrawal symptoms in the neonate and/or NAS.

Although evidence is lacking and it is uncertain if pregabalin or gabapentin impact upon maternal folate status, UK guidelines state that women who take any anti-epileptic medication should be prescribed high-dose folic acid (5 mg/day) preconceptually and in the first trimester.

There remains limited data on use of these drugs in breastfeeding. According to LactMed, low levels of gabapentin and pregabalin have been found in breastmilk with no adverse effects on infants reported in limited case reports/series (n < 10) for gabapentin. Therefore, both drugs may be considered if required by the breastfeeding mother. The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for gabapentin and pregabalin in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Gabapentin at lowest effective dose may be considered in pregnancy with folic acid supplementation if no alternative analgesic is suitable (GRADE 1B, SOA 95).
Gabapentin may be considered in breastfeeding if no alternative analgesic is suitable (GRADE 2C, SOA 96).
Pregabalin may be considered in pregnancy (with folic acid supplementation) and during breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.3).

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with pregabalin in pregnant women.

However, in animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification, and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 16 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 600 mg/day [see Data]. In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation, and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.

### Caution: benzodiazepines in pregnancy and risk of adverse perinatal outcomes [^112vqN6w]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Work by Meng et al also raises further questions about risk of medication exposure during different timeframes within pregnancy, raising concern that risk of stillbirth and preterm birth may be higher with late second trimester and third trimester exposure than early pregnancy. In the North American Pregnancy Registry, adverse perinatal outcomes also appeared more likely with third trimester exposure, as risk of SGA with topiramate exposure through the third trimester was more than double the risk if topiramate was stopped before the third trimester. Later in pregnancy, there is increased placental transfer and thus potential greater fetal accumulation of medications, which may be particularly risky for medications with risk of adverse perinatal outcomes including stillbirth and SGA. This, together with the risks elucidated under limited prescribing duration of the benzodiazepines studied, may be reason for caution among epileptologists regarding use of benzodiazepines for cluster management during pregnancy. This poses questions for consideration about whether alternative cluster management approaches such as added doses of lower-risk continuous anti-seizure medications such as levetiracetam may be appropriate in pregnancy instead of benzodiazepines, especially for patients with seizure types that are not tonic–clonic.

Clearly, further work in this area would be ideal in epilepsy given that the overall cohort of greater than 2.5 million pregnancies included well below 1% women with epilepsy, even in the exposed group. However, it is worth noting that no future epilepsy cohort study will ever be able to include > 10 000 exposures to these or other less-commonly prescribed but relevant medications in epilepsy. This study is an opportunity for the epilepsy field to consider potential risk implications and management approaches to reduce risk well before epilepsy specific–literature would provide this information. Similar opportunities for earlier information about potential risk with medications used in epilepsy and other conditions may exist, for example via larger scale, methodologically rigorous studies on risks associated with pregabalinand gabapentinto complement existing data on very small numbers of exposures currently available in the epilepsy literature. Future attention to non-epilepsy literature on this topic may be warranted, along with collaborations among different specialties to analyze perinatal outcome risk data for medications used across different indications. With regard to specific future study of adverse perinatal outcomes of benzodiazepines, more detailed dosing and duration of treatment data is needed to bring further clarity to potential risks and define implications for clinical management. In the meanwhile, epileptologists may want to consider increased caution with benzodiazepine use in pregnancy.

### Pregnancy outcome following maternal exposure to pregabalin may call for concern [^115GnQ2Y]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate pregnancy outcomes following maternal use of pregabalin.

Methods

This multicenter, observational prospective cohort study compared pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to pregabalin with those of matched controls (not exposed to any medications known to be teratogenic or to any antiepileptic drugs). Teratology Information Services systematically collected data between 2004 and 2013.

Results

Data were collected from 164 exposed pregnancies and 656 controls. A significantly higher major birth defect rate in the pregabalin group was observed after exclusion of chromosomal aberration syndromes, and when cases with exposure during first trimester of pregnancy were analyzed separately (7/116 [6.0%] vs 12/580 [2.1%]; odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2–7.9, p = 0.03). The rate of live births was lower in the pregabalin group (71.9% vs 85.2%, p < 0.001), primarily due to a higher rate of both elective (9.8% vs 5.0%, p = 0.02) and medically indicated (5.5% vs 1.8%, p = 0.008) pregnancy terminations. In the Cox proportional cause specific hazards model, pregabalin exposure was not associated with a significantly higher risk of spontaneous abortion.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated a signal for increased risk of major birth defects after first trimester exposure to pregabalin. However, several limitations such as the small sample size, differences across groups in maternal conditions, and concomitant medication exposure exclude definitive conclusions, so these results call for confirmation through independent studies.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^113HZkuF]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are a broad class of drugs commonly prescribed in the management of epilepsy, mood disorders, chronic pain, or migraine. These conditions, which frequently occur at young ages, are prevalent among women of childbearing age, with epilepsy affecting approximately 0.3%–0.9% of them, mood disorders around one-fifth, chronic pain about 14%–24%, and migraine about 17%–24%. Consequently, a substantial proportion of pregnant women are also affected by these conditions. The decision to maintain treatment during pregnancy requires weighing ASM effectiveness and safety alongside the severity of the condition being treated, especially in the case of epilepsy, which in itself entails risks for pregnant women and fetuses.

Since the 2010s, studies have highlighted increased risks of major congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders following in utero exposure to several ASMs, including valproate, topiramate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone. Latest evidence suggests that lamotrigine and levetiracetam are safer options to use during pregnancy, while firm conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the safety profile of other ASMs such as pregabalin, gabapentin, or newer ASMs (e.g. oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, or zonisamide) due to insufficient data. Since 2015, risk reduction measures aimed at avoiding valproate exposure among women of childbearing age and during pregnancy have been strongly reinforced following updated recommendations of the European Medicines Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the World Health Organization.

### First-trimester use of antiseizure medications and the risk of miscarriage: a population-based cohort study [^115dfCYF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The population-based Danish registry study looked at 898 exposure-discordant pregnancies within the same women with epilepsy, and found a slightly reduced risk of miscarriage (0.83, 0.69 to 1.00) for exposed compared with unexposed pregnancies. By contrast, in our exposure-discordant pregnancies analysis among 5278 pregnancies, we showed an increased risk of miscarriage among our exposed group, compared with the unexposed. This may reflect different patterns of exposure in consecutive pregnancies. A miscarriage in the first pregnancy may increase the chance of a woman stopping ASM medication in the second pregnancy; we observed a substantially elevated HR for miscarriage when the first pregnancy was exposed to ASMs, but not when the first pregnancy was unexposed.

A network meta-analysis suggested that valproate, primidone and topiramate are associated with an increased risk of fetal loss (a combined variable of any pregnancy loss), compared with no ASM exposure. In our study, we chose an active-comparator control, to provide information to clinicians about the risks of outcomes relative to lamotrigine which is generally considered the safest alternative. While this design may be subject to confounding by indication, as certain medications may be given to patients with greater disease severity. We found women exposed to any ASM had similar risks of miscarriage, compared with lamotrigine. An earlier study by Mostacci et al, found that of 30 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin, 23.3% ended in spontaneous abortion versus 11.3% in unexposed, resulting in an unadjusted OR of 2.39, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.75. The present study found evidence of an adjusted association of pregabalin with miscarriage, but only for women with epilepsy (n = 37). Because the association was present only in a small subgroup, and there was no association of pregabalin in other indication subgroups nor in the overall group of all women who used pregabalin (n = 882), we would caution against over-interpretation of this potential signal. Nevertheless, additional data regarding pregabalin and miscarriage would be useful. Our results were broadly in line with data from the European and International Registry of Antiepileptic Drugs in Pregnancy, a prospective observational study of 7055 pregnancies among women with epilepsy on ASMs, which found intrauterine death was not associated with ASM type.

### Gabapentin use during pregnancy and lactation with and without concurrent opioid exposure: considerations and future directions [^112scgsQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin is a γ-aminobutyric acid analog formally indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain that is gaining increased popularity. Gabapentin has been historically considered a safe medication, including during pregnancy and lactation, with low reported concerns for misuse and use disorders. However, new empirical efforts are revealing concerns regarding the safety of widespread gabapentin use, particularly in pregnancy and for individuals with a propensity toward substance misuse. The Food and Drug Administration's full prescribing information report on gabapentin provides concerning preclinical data and then states that gabapentin is potentially "developmentally toxic" and has an unknown risk of birth impacts. Concerns have also been raised surrounding in utero exposure to gabapentin due to the onset and presentation of atypical and/or difficult to control withdrawal signs and symptoms in neonates, including those dually exposed to opioids, as well as neonatal exposure to gabapentin via breastmilk. Moreover, nonprescribed gabapentin use has become an increasing problem, with opioid use disorder being the greatest risk factor for such misuse. This article summarizes the current literature regarding gabapentin use during pregnancy and related prenatal and neonatal exposure outcomes with special consideration for interactions between gabapentin and opioid use. Taken together, the current literature suggests that gabapentin use should be considered with caution during pregnancy and during the post-partum period. Well-controlled, prospective research studies are needed to determine the extent of the risks and benefits of prescribed and nonprescribed gabapentin exposure to pregnant people and their neonates.

### Evaluation of pregabalin as an adjuvant to patient-controlled epidural analgesia during late termination of pregnancy [^112LNViT]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Late termination of pregnancy combines psychological distress with severe physical pain. The present study evaluated the benefit of adding oral pregabalin to epidural analgesia during this procedure.

Methods

Healthy women were randomly allocated to receive either oral pregabalin 150 mg/12 h or prazepam 10 mg/12 h at the induction of the late termination of pregnancy procedure. When they felt abdominal pain (numerical rating scale ranging from 0 [no pain] to 100 [worst pain possible]), patient-controlled epidural analgesia was activated and set to deliver ropivacaine 0.1% with sufentanil 0.25 μg/ml, 5 ml/h with a bolus dose of 5 ml/30 min. Rescue analgesia was available as needed by administration of 10 mL ropivacaine 0.1% (pain score less than 60/100) or 0.2% (at least 60/100). The primary outcome was the consumption of epidural analgesics.

Results

Forty-eight patients participated in the study. Demographic and obstetric data were similar. Pregabalin reduced total ropivacaine consumption 11.3 ± 3.2 mg/h (mean ± SD) versus 15.1 ± 4.9 mg/h in the prazepam group (P = 0.005), an effect related to a decrease in the need for rescue analgesia. In the pregabalin group, fewer women asked for rescue dose (75 vs. 96%; P = 0.048), and the number of rescue doses per patient was reduced (1 [0–2] vs. 2 [1–3]); median [interquartile range], P = 0.005), particularly the need for ropivacaine 0.2%.

Discussion

This is the first study considering the use of pregabalin for labor pain associated with late termination of pregnancy, showing that pregabalin 150 mg/12 h is a helpful adjuvant to epidural analgesia. Modulation of both visceral sensitization and affective component of pain may contribute to the benefits observed.

Gabapentin and pregabalin

Data on gabapentin use in pregnancy comes mostly from studies of the treatment of maternal epilepsy at doses generally higher that those used to treat chronic pain, while information on pregabalin use in pregnancy comes from studies of its use to treat neuropathic pain. A systematic review of gabapentin use in pregnancy to treat epilepsy did not find any evidence of an increased rate of major malformations or other adverse outcomes attributable to gabapentin exposure. No long-term outcomes were reported. Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in abstract form only, of eight cohort studies (four prospective and four retrospective), reporting 5 072 286 unexposed and 949 exposed pregnancies found that first trimester exposure to gabapentin was not statistically significantly associated with major congenital malformations (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.45, 1.53).

A prospective cohort study using Teratology Information Services data from seven European countries found that first trimester use of pregabalin was associated with significantly higher rates of major congenital malformations when compared with unexposed pregnancies (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.2, 7.9). This study, however, was limited by a small sample size (164 exposed pregnancies) and lack of adjustment for potential confounding by use of concomitant medications. A systematic review of pregabalin use, mostly to treat neuropathic pain in pregnancy, including data from this study and two others identified 651 pregnancy exposures and concluded that pregabalin exposure during pregnancy is not devoid of structural teratogenicity potential. UKTIS reviewed data from six controlled studies, with outcomes of > 3000 exposed pregnancies of patients with chronic pain or other non-epilepsy indications. They conclude that this data does not indicate that maternal pregabalin use in pregnancy is associated with increased risks of malformation, miscarriage or adversely affects foetal growth. Interestingly, a systematic review and meta-analysis published in abstract form only, of six studies reporting 2319 exposed pregnancies and 4 982 778 unexposed pregnancies found that first trimester exposure to pregabalin was not significantly associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92, 1.57).

Other treatments for chronic pain

Amitriptyline

Recommendations were based on NICE guidance, a systematic review, UKTIS and LactMed, as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for amitriptyline in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Amitriptyline is compatible with pregnancy. There is no evidence of adverse effect on IQ or developmental outcomes (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).
Because very little amitriptyline is found in breastmilk with antidepressant doses and it is used at lower doses for chronic pain, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).

Gabapentin and pregabalin

Recommendations were based on and, as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for gabapentin and pregabalin in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Gabapentin at lowest effective dose may be considered in pregnancy with folic acid supplementation if no alternative analgesic suitable (GRADE 1B, SOA 95).
Gabapentin may be considered in breastfeeding if no alternative analgesic is suitable (GRADE 2C, SOA 96).
Pregabalin may be considered in pregnancy (with folic acid supplementation) and during breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.3).

Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Recommendations were based on NICE guidance, two systematic reviews, UKTIS and LactMed, as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for SNRIs in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Venlafaxine is compatible at conception and throughout pregnancy. There may be an increased risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome/short-term behavioural effects, but larger studies are needed to evaluate this finding (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.8).
Duloxetine may be considered in pregnancy and breastfeeding but there are fewer data than for venlafaxine (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.3).
Venlafaxine and duloxetine may be considered in breastfeeding if there is no alternative chronic pain medication (GRADE 2C, SOA 95.8).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

Recommendations were based on and, as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for SSRIs in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline are compatible with pregnancy (GRADE 1B, SOA 98.8).
Based on limited evidence, SSRIs are compatible with breastfeeding (GRADE 2C, SOA 98.3).

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1111wf4y]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Non‑opioid pharmacologic therapy in chronic pain — scope, harms, and safety alerts — includes nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants including serotonin‑norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and tricyclics (TCAs), anticonvulsants, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxants, and these therapies are associated with risks in older adults, pregnant patients, and those with cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic comorbidities. NSAIDs have been associated with serious gastrointestinal and major coronary events and with about 30% of hospital admissions for preventable adverse drug reactions; CDC guidelines show moderate quality evidence (with small improvement) for NSAIDs in chronic low back pain, and for other pain conditions the guidelines strongly recommend the use of NSAIDs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are frequently prescribed with hopes that they can provide opioid‑sparing effects, but on December 19, 2019, the FDA required new warnings for gabapentinoids about risk of respiratory depression, noting reports of abuse alone and with opioids with serious consequences including respiratory depression and increased risk of opioid overdose death, and increases in non‑serious adverse events have been found with pregabalin and gabapentin (e.g., blurred vision, cognitive effects, sedation, weight gain; dizziness and peripheral edema with pregabalin).

Data

Human Data

One database study, which included over 2,700 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 3,063,251 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics demonstrated prevalence ratios for major malformations overall of 1.14 (CI 95% 0.96–1.35) for pregabalin, 1.29 (CI 95% 1.01–1.65) for lamotrigine, 1.39 (CI 95% 1.07–1.82) for duloxetine, and 1.24 (CI 95% 1.00–1.54) for exposure to either lamotrigine or duloxetine. Important study limitations include uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription took the medication and inability to adequately control for the underlying disease and other potential confounders.

A published study included results from two separate databases. One database, which included 353 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 368,489 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics, showed no increase in risk of major birth defects; adjusted relative risk 0.87 (CI 95% 0.53–1.42). The second database, which included 118 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 380,347 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics, suggested a small increase in risk of major birth defects; adjusted relative risk 1.26 (CI 95% 0.64–2.49). The risk estimates crossed the null, and the study had limitations similar to the prior study.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^116wfrya]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

By showing that in the past 2 years of the study (2020–2021) alone, ASMs with uncertain risks concerned 4,778 pregnancies, that is, 39.1% of the total pregnancies exposed to ASMs, our findings highlight the critical need to increase knowledge on these ASMs whose safety profile remains uncertain. Furthermore, the results suggest that some of these ASMs raise particular concerns. First, in line with reports from other countries, this study provides evidence that pregabalin and gabapentin, 2 ASMs mainly used for pain management, have become widely used during pregnancy in France. Overall, almost 16,000 pregnancies have been exposed to these ASMs between 2013 and 2021 most of which (68%) ended in childbirths. During this period, more and more newborns have been prenatally exposed to these 2 ASMs over time (3,928 in 2019–2021 vs 3,069 in 2013–2015, i.e. +28%), and among those prenatally exposed to pregabalin, more and more were born from pregnancies with multiple dispensations (+65%) and sustained exposure throughout pregnancy (+171%), meaning that their level of prenatal exposure became higher and higher. In addition, as reported in other settings, we found that although less frequently used, newer ASMs used for epilepsy management, especially lacosamide and zonisamide, have concerned more and more pregnancies over time (+140%). Despite an increasing rate of pregnancy termination among these pregnancies, the number of newborns prenatally exposed to these ASMs dramatically increased (from 301 in 2013–2015 to 481 in 2019–2021, i.e. +60%). These figures are all the more concerning as to date, available data have remained largely insufficient to establish the safety of prenatal exposure to these treatments regarding the risks of adverse outcomes, particularly the risks of major congenital malformations and of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offsprings.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^117Voqvh]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent studies conducted in Europe and the United States reported a marked decrease in the use of valproate among women of childbearing age and pregnant women after risk minimization measures implementation, alongside an increase in the use of lamotrigine and levetiracetam. However, despite these favorable trends, potentially avoidable cases of prenatal exposure to valproate, for example, unplanned pregnancies, still occur. In addition, the persisting or increasing use by pregnant women of other ASMs with acknowledged or uncertain safety profiles during pregnancy, such as topiramate (especially in countries approving topiramate for the treatment of migraine), pregabalin and gabapentin for pain management, or new-generation ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy, is concerning.

Large-scale, real-life data are essential to guide further efforts to mitigate the risks associated with prenatal exposure to ASMs. The objective of this nationwide study was to assess trends in prenatal exposure to ASMs over the past decade according to medication safety profiles, using comprehensive data of the French National Health Data System (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS).

### Pain medication use during pregnancy [^1134CL7Q]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain management during pregnancy is a frequently encountered issue in clinical practice. It is important to balance treatment of maternal pain with the potential risks of medication exposure on fetal development. This review examines the safety and risks associated with various pain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, steroids, opioids, gabapentinoids, and muscle relaxants. While many analgesic medications have demonstrated benefits for treatment of acute or chronic pain in pregnancy, others carry risks such as congenital anomalies, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data on long-term neurodevelopmental effects remain inconclusive for many medications. Given the limitations of available research, healthcare providers must weigh the benefits and risks of pain management strategies through informed, shared decision-making with patients. This review provides an evidence-based resource to guide clinicians in optimizing pain treatment during pregnancy while minimizing fetal and neonatal risks.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^114Wozwk]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Between 2013 and 2021, the annual number of ASM-exposed pregnancies remained consistent overall (6,200 in median, ranging from 5,864 to 6,563) (eFigure 2). However, trends differed across ASMs safety categories (eFigure 3). Pregnancies exposed to ASMs considered the safest and to ASMs with uncertain risk increased by +30% and +33%, respectively, reflecting upward trends in the use of both ASMs considered the safest (lamotrigine +22% and levetiracetam +64%) and of pregabalin (+49%), gabapentin (+27%), and newer ASMs with uncertain risk (+140%). By contrast, pregnancies exposed to ASMs with acknowledged risk markedly decreased (−66%), reflecting downward trends in the use of valproic acid (−84%), valpromide (−89%), and to a lesser extent of carbamazepine (−40%) and topiramate (−34%) (Figure 1).

### Neonatal gabapentin withdrawal syndrome [^117Uq4Lm]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant, neuroleptic, and pain medication, is widely used in both adults and children for management of epilepsy, bipolar illness, and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin use has also been recommended for hyperemesis gravidarum and restless leg syndrome in pregnant mothers.

Objective

Although gabapentin use is deemed safe during pregnancy, no clinical reports of gabapentin withdrawal syndrome in a neonate have been described.

Results

We present a newborn who showed signs of withdrawal after prolonged in utero exposure to gabapentin.

Clinical Implications

Clinicians should be aware of possible withdrawal symptoms from drugs such as gabapentin, administered to mothers during pregnancy. We also encourage the gradual tapering of gabapentin in neonates over weeks to months similar to the adult population.

### Gabapentin [^117Rdbxh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of gabapentin PO (also known as Neurontin, Gralise) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. The risk of having a child with a congenital defect as a result of antiepileptic medication is far outweighed by the dangers to the mother and fetus of uncontrolled epilepsy; folic acid supplementation (5 mg) should be started 4 weeks prior to and continued for 12 weeks after conception. Women of childbearing potential should receive counseling on the risk of fetal abnormalities with the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy; AEDs should generally be continued during pregnancy utilizing monotherapy at the lowest effective dose as this has been shown to minimize risks of fetal abnormalities compared to combination AED therapy. The drug gabapentin PO (also known as Neurontin, Gralise) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^112sskBg]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Prenatal exposure to certain antiseizure medications (ASMs) is associated with established or suspected risks of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders. Large-scale, real-life data are essential to guide efforts to mitigate these risks. Our objective was to assess trends in prenatal exposure to ASMs over the past decade according to medication safety profiles.

Methods

This nationwide, population-based study is based on comprehensive data of the French National Mother-Child Register EPI-MERES. All ASM-exposed pregnancies ended between 2013 and 2021 were included. ASM-exposed pregnancies' frequency and characteristics (maternal sociodemographics and morbidities, pregnancy outcome, and ASM treatment modalities) were assessed considering 3 safety categories: (1) ASMs considered the safest (lamotrigine and levetiracetam); (2) ASMs with uncertain risk, including pregabalin, gabapentin, and newer ASMs (e.g. lacosamide and zonisamide); and (3) ASMs with acknowledged risk, including valproic acid, valpromide, carbamazepine, and topiramate.

Results

Between 2013 and 2021, 55,801 pregnancies were exposed to ≥ 1 ASM. Pregnancies exposed to the safest ASMs increased by +30%. Meanwhile, prenatal exposure to valproic acid and valpromide dramatically decreased due to decreasing numbers of exposed pregnancies (−84% and −89%, respectively), increasing termination rate of exposed pregnancies (+23% and +28%, respectively), and among those ended in childbirth, decreasing numbers with multiple valproate dispensations (−86% and −93%, respectively) or sustained exposure throughout pregnancy (−91% and −96%, respectively). Prenatal exposure to carbamazepine and topiramate barely decreased, with almost 600 newborns still exposed to each of these ASMs in 2019–2021. Pregabalin and gabapentin became widely used during pregnancy, resulting in more and more newborns prenatally exposed (+28%), and for pregabalin increasingly with multiple dispensations (+65%) and sustained exposure throughout pregnancy (+171%). The numbers of pregnancies and newborns exposed to newer ASMs also sharply increased (+140% and +60%, respectively). Overall, prenatal exposure to ASMs with acknowledged or uncertain risk disproportionately concerned pregnant women with a low level of resources (18.5% and 17.9%, respectively, vs 13%–14% among pregnancies exposed to the safest ASMs or ASM-unexposed).

Discussion

Despite a sharp shift from valproate to safer ASMs, prenatal exposure to other ASMs with acknowledged or uncertain risks has persisted or even increased, particularly among the most socially disadvantaged populations, requiring additional risk minimization measures.

### Prescribing for pregnancy: managing chronic headache and migraine [^111EQtzS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Globally, headache disorders are an important cause of disability in adults. As many types of headache (eg, migraine, tension-type and medication-overuse) are more common in women and have peak incidence in reproductive years, chronic headache disorders are highly prevalent in pregnant women. Some women with a history of migraine may find that it improves during pregnancy while others may find that their migraines become more unpredictable. Ideally, women with migraine and problematic headache disorder should be offered preconception counselling to address pregnancy-related concerns and advice on the use of medicines, which should be supported by high-quality information. For women with history of headache, the use of effective non-pharmacological options should be maximised, and the smallest number of the safest medicines at the lowest effective doses should be used while preparing for pregnancy and during pregnancy. This article forms part of the series of prescribing for pregnancy and discusses the impact of headache and migraine on pregnancy, the impact of pregnancy on headache and migraine and options for prophylaxis and treatment.

### Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs: comparison of two recent guidelines [^115J36bC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2004). Medium credibility.

Background

Until the early 1990s six major compounds (carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and valproic acid) were available for the treatment of epilepsy. However, these drugs have pharmacokinetic limitations, teratogenic potential, and a negative effect on cognitive functions that impairs the quality of patients' lives and limits the use of these drugs in some patients. In addition, 20–30% of patients are refractory to these drugs.

Recent Developments

The development of ten new antiepileptic drugs (vigabatrin, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, and pregabalin) has expanded treatment options. The newer drugs may be better tolerated, have fewer drug interactions, and seem to affect cognitive functions to a lesser extent than old drugs. Guidelines on the use of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed in the USA and in the UK. Both guidelines offer a clear picture of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs and agree on their use as add-on treatment in patients who do not respond to conventional drugs. The guidelines differ in the type and strength of recommendations. Whereas the US guidelines recommend treatment in newly diagnosed epilepsy with a standard drug or a new drug depending on the individual patient's characteristics, the UK guidelines recommend that a new antiepileptic drug should be considered only if there is no benefit from an old antiepileptic drug, an old drug is contraindicated, there is a previous negative experience with the same drug, or the patient is a woman of childbearing potential.

Where Next

The limited amount of information on the new antiepileptic drugs may explain the discrepancies among the two guidelines and between these and other recommendations. Comparative, pragmatic, long-term and open trials should be done to show long-term efficacy and comparative features of the new antiepileptic drugs, and to better assess the effect on quality-of-life, cost-effectiveness, tolerability, and teratogenic potential. In addition, the conflicts should be resolved between the needs of the regulatory bodies and those of the treating physicians. Finally, there is a need for trial designs to be standardised.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^112vpeQE]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results also show that in France, prenatal exposure to ASMs with acknowledged or uncertain risk disproportionately concerns pregnant women with a low level of resources. Similarly, in the Nordic countries, the UK and Scotland, greater use of fetotoxic ASMs has been reported in disadvantaged pregnant women with epilepsy, compared with more affluent ones. These disparities could be due to various factors, including more frequent unplanned pregnancies and suboptimal preconception and/or prenatal care in socioeconomically disadvantaged women.

This study has several strengths. First, it is based on comprehensive, nationwide data of the EPI-MERES Register, which contains information on 8.7 million pregnancies, that is, almost all pregnancies occurred in France between 2013 and 2021, regardless of their outcome. The general trends reported in this national study are likely generalizable to other countries, although country-specific patterns may arise from heterogeneous ASM indications (e.g. topiramate is indicated for migraine in several countries but not in France) and prescribing practices (e.g. gabapentin is much more used in the United States than in France). In addition, information on medication use and on mothers and pregnancies characteristics available from the National Health Data System has shown to be accurate and comprehensive. Some limitations related to the nature of these data need to be acknowledged, including the assessment of ASM exposure based on claims rather than consumption data, and the absence of information on treatment indication. Nevertheless, previous studies based on these data provide reassurance on their validity to adequately assess ASM exposure during pregnancy.

In conclusion, consistently with risk minimization measures, prenatal exposure to lamotrigine and levetiracetam markedly increased over the past decade, mainly at the expense of valproate-containing ASMs. However, prenatal exposure to topiramate and carbamazepine barely decreased, and prenatal exposure to pregabalin and gabapentin — mainly used for pain management — and to newer ASMs used for epilepsy, whose safety profile remains uncertain, dramatically increased. Additional measures are needed to further reduce perinatal exposure to ASMs with acknowledged or uncertain risks, especially among the most socially deprived populations.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^111TG6Rf]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Gabapentin — summary of perioperative evidence in pregnant people with OUD: The use of perioperative gabapentinoids is controversial regarding their effectiveness in postoperative analgesia, postoperative respiratory complication risk, as well as abuse potential. A meta-analysis suggested 24-hour pain reduction with gabapentin but excluded patients with OUD. Other nonobstetric studies suggest reductions in acute and persistent postoperative pain and opioid consumption, yet contradicting data indicate only moderate or no evidence and highlight increased adverse effects. In a retrospective cohort of pregnant people with OUD after cesarean delivery (n = 214), inclusion of gabapentin in a multimodal regimen was not associated with lower opioid consumption or pain scores during the first 72 hours postcesarean delivery.

### Trends in prenatal exposure to antiseizure medications over the past decade: a nationwide study [^115Web1Y]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ASM Exposure During Pregnancy

Based on the most available evidence, ASMs were categorized according to their safety profiles regarding the risks of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders in 3 categories: (1) ASMs considered the safest, including lamotrigine and levetiracetam; (2) ASMs with uncertain risk, including pregabalin, gabapentin, clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, and newer ASMs (including brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, lacosamide, perampanel, retigabine, rufinamide, stiripentol, tiagabine, vigabatrin, and zonisamide); (3) ASMs with acknowledged risk, including valproic acid, valpromide, carbamazepine, topiramate, and others (including phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone).

Maternal and Pregnancy Characteristics

Maternal sociodemographic characteristics included age at pregnancy start and level of resources, assessed based on affiliation to the solidarity-based complementary health insurance (C2S, free health care insurance granted to individuals with low income), and for pregnancies ended in childbirth, amount of the salary (if any), and categorized as low (C2S beneficiaries), intermediate (no C2S and salary < 2,000€), or high (no C2S and salary ≥ 2,000€). Pregnancy outcome was categorized as live birth, stillbirth, pregnancy termination (including elective and therapeutic abortions), or other.

ASM Treatment Characteristics

Maternal health conditions related to ASM use were identified using information on hospital discharge and long-term diseases diagnoses in the 5 years before pregnancy start, coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10). ICD-10 codes used to identify epilepsy, mood disorders, neuropathic pain, and migraine are listed in eTable 1.

For each ASM, information was available on the timing of treatment initiation relative to pregnancy start (more than 1 year before, within the previous year, or after pregnancy start) and, for pregnancies ended in childbirth, on the number of dispensations and the timing of exposure during pregnancy (first trimester exposure if ≥ 1 dispensation within 30 days prior conception or during the initial 90 days of pregnancy; second trimester exposure if ≥ 1 dispensation between day 91 and day 181 of pregnancy; and third trimester exposure if ≥ 1 dispensation between day 182 of pregnancy and the day before delivery).

### Pregabalin use early in pregnancy and the risk of major congenital malformations [^113AaqEM]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether first-trimester exposure to pregabalin is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, as recently suggested in a pregnancy registry study.

Methods

We performed a cohort study nested in the US Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX). The study population included 1,323,432 pregnancies resulting in a live-born infant between 2000 and 2010. We examined the risk of major congenital malformations among infants born to women exposed to pregabalin during the first trimester compared with women unexposed to anticonvulsants. We used propensity score fine stratification to control for > 50 potential confounders, and we estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in generalized linear models. The analyses were replicated in the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database (MarketScan). Pooled estimates based on the adjusted RR produced in MAX, MarketScan, and the previous registry study were calculated.

Results

Of 477 infants exposed to pregabalin during the first trimester in MAX, 28 (5.9%) had malformations compared to 3.3% in nonexposed infants. The crude RR of major congenital malformations for pregabalin was 1.80 (95% CI 1.26–2.58). After propensity score adjustment, the RR moved to 1.16 (95% CI 0.81–1.67). Restriction to pregabalin monotherapy and sensitivity analyses produced similar results. The adjusted RR for major congenital malformations for the 174 infants exposed in MarketScan was 1.03 (95% CI 0.56–1.90). The pooled RR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.83–2.15) for pregabalin any use and 1.02 (95% CI 0.69–1.51) for pregabalin monotherapy.

Conclusions

Findings did not confirm the suggested teratogenic effects of pregabalin, although they cannot rule out the possibility of a small effect.

### Navigating pregnancy testing in chronic pain management for women of reproductive age [^116zbcvp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of Chronic Pain in Women of Childbearing Age

Non-Pharmacological Strategies

For women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, non-pharmacological pain treatments are often the safest starting point. These treatments provide relief with minimal side effects and are considered safe in pregnancy.

For pregnancy-related low back pain, interventions like progressive muscle relaxation, Kinesio Taping, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have been shown to reduce discomfort and improve mobility. Likewise, some patients with chronic pain have favorable responses to multimodal therapies such as pelvic floor physical therapy, acupuncture, psychotherapy, and neuromodulation.

Exercise-based interventions also show strong evidence for improving pregnancy-related musculoskeletal pain. Complementary therapies — such as chiropractic care, craniosacral therapy, and osteomanipulative techniques — may offer additional benefit when used under the guidance of experienced providers.

Because these non-pharmacological approaches are considered safe in pregnancy, pregnancy testing is usually not necessary. Though, while these interventions reduce reliance on medications, they may not eliminate the need for them altogether, in which case pregnancy testing is likely warranted.

Pharmacological Strategies

Acetaminophen remains the first-line option due to its strong safety profile across all trimesters. However, like any medication, it should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration necessary.

NSAIDs are generally safe during early pregnancy but are typically avoided in the third trimester due to the risk of fetal complications, including premature ductus arteriosus closure and renal impairment.

Opioids, while sometimes required for severe pain, present complex risks. A 2024 systematic review and a 2022 meta-analysis present mixed findings on the teratogenic risks of opioids. While some studies suggest elevated risks for specific birth defects — such as cleft palate or gastrointestinal malformations — others report no significant associations with first-trimester exposure or short-term use. To err on the side of caution, guidelines recommend limiting opioids to short-term use when absolutely necessary — and only after non-opioid alternatives have been exhausted.

Other medications like gabapentinoids and tricyclic antidepressants may be cautiously considered for chronic pain during pregnancy, but safety data remain limited. These agents are typically reserved for short-term use when safer options have failed. The uncertainty of teratogenic effects of both opioids and other medications underscores the importance of pregnancy screening before initiating opioid therapy in women of reproductive age.

### Antiseizure medication use during pregnancy and children's neurodevelopmental outcomes [^112rRuoq]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Sibling comparisons and active comparison with lamotrigine by ASM exposure during pregnancy.

The pooled estimates for (A) sibling comparisons (within-family hazard ratio) and (B) active comparison with lamotrigine (hazard ratio) by ASM prescription during pregnancy. All estimates are adjusted for maternal age, region, diagnosis of neurodevelopmental conditions before pregnancy, evidence of hazardous drinking and illicit drug use during pregnancy, gravidity, health care utilization, seizure events, use of antipsychotics and antidepressants in the year prior to pregnancy, vomiting or antiemetic prescriptions during pregnancy, and socioeconomic position. Error bars show 95% confidence limits. The presented measures were estimated using fixed-effects meta-analysis on the log-hazard ratio scale. Sample size for figure: Total cohort = 3,182,771, No ASM = 3,165,276, Carbamazepine = 3030, Gabapentin = 1428, Lamotrigine = 5974, Levetiracetam = 806, Phenytoin = 240, Pregabalin = 1715, Topiramate = 418, Valproate = 1601, Other ASM = 543, Polytherapy = 1740. * Sibling comparison results for phenytoin are presented in the text. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ASM antiseizure medication, HR hazard ratio.

We present our active comparison analysis, using lamotrigine as the reference group, in Fig. 3B. This analysis makes a comparison with children exposed to an ASM considered to be safe, thereby reducing the possibility of confounding by indication. Our analyzes showed that, relative to lamotrigine, children exposed to carbamazepine, valproate, other ASMs, and polytherapy had greater hazard for a diagnosis of autism. Children exposed to topiramate, valproate and polytherapy had greater hazard of an intellectual disability diagnosis than those exposed to lamotrigine. Children exposed to valproate and polytherapy had greater hazard of an ADHD diagnosis, while children exposed to pregabalin were less likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis. Country-specific and combined values are presented in Supplementary Results Table S9 and Fig. S9.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112oRcoo]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Study design and participants

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GaPP2) took place in 39 UK hospital centres. Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the UK Coventry and Warwick Research Ethics Committee (REC 15/WM/0036) and clinical trial authorisation was obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. A trial steering committee provided independent oversight of the trial. Confidential interim analysis of all available data alongside anonymised reports of adverse events by participants were reviewed by a data monitoring committee on four occasions. No reason to recommend halting or modifying the trial was identified. The trial protocol has been published elsewhere.

The recruitment criteria for this study were defined before the International Classification of Diseases-11 classification for chronic secondary visceral pain was drawn up, and were based on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists definition for chronic pelvic pain and the 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain taxonomy. Moreover, we believe that they reflect the group of women commonly seen in gynaecological practice within the UK and that any heterogeneity is a strength, ensuring that our results are generalisable. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. We limited the study to women because of the growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that suggest sex differences in pain thresholds, sensitivity, and underlying neuroimmune modulation. Pelvic pain was defined as pain located within the true pelvis (between and below the anterior iliac crests). Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy (eg, macroscopic endometriosis lesions, complex ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts of > 5 cm, fibroids of > 3 cm, and dense adhesions), which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Women were excluded if they only had dysmenorrhoea; had a malignancy; were currently using or had previously used gabapentin or pregabalin; had surgery planned in next 6 months; had contraindications to taking gabapentin; had a previous reaction to gabapentin; were taking gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists and were unable or unwilling to stop; were breastfeeding, pregnant, or planned a pregnancy in next 6 months; or had pain suspected to be of gastrointestinal origin (according to positive Rome III Diagnostic Criteria); or had previously participated in the GaPP1 pilot study. All women provided written informed consent. After confirmation of clinical eligibility, women entered a pre-randomisation screening phase where they were required to return their worst and average pain scores on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), weekly for 4 weeks via a centralised text messaging system. To be considered eligible for randomisation, women were required to have returned at least three of four pre-randomisation NRS scores on both the worst and average NRS scales to show adherence to data collection. At least two of the worst NRS pain scores needed to be a score of 4 or higher, for the pain to be considered sufficient for entry into the trial. No study drugs were taken during this pre-randomisation screening phase, but participants were able to remain on any analgesics they were taking. We did not specify a target recruitment per centre; all centres recruited as many women as they could during the recruitment period.

### Pregabalin [^117BJy9Y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Data

A pharmacokinetic study in ten lactating women, who were at least 12 weeks postpartum, evaluated the concentrations of pregabalin in plasma and breast milk. Pregabalin 150 mg oral capsule was given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) for a total of four doses. Pregabalin was detected in breast milk at average steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on a mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production. Infants did not receive breast milk obtained during the dosing period, therefore, the effects of pregabalin on the breast fed infant were not evaluated.

Effects on Spermatogenesis

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority study to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm characteristics, healthy male subjects received pregabalin at a daily dose up to 600 mg (n = 111) or placebo (n = 109) for 13 weeks (one complete sperm cycle) followed by a 13-week washout period (off-drug). A total of 65 subjects in the pregabalin group (59%) and 62 subjects in the placebo group (57%) were included in the per protocol (PP) population. These subjects took study drug for at least 8 weeks, had appropriate timing of semen collections and did not have any significant protocol violations. Among these subjects, approximately 9% of the pregabalin group (6/65) vs. 3% in the placebo group (2/62) had greater than or equal to 50% reduction in mean sperm concentrations from baseline at Week 26 (the primary endpoint). The difference between pregabalin and placebo was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 20%. There were no adverse effects of pregabalin on sperm morphology, sperm motility, serum FSH or serum testosterone levels as compared to placebo. In subjects in the PP population with greater than or equal to 50% reduction in sperm concentration from baseline, sperm concentrations were no longer reduced by greater than or equal to 50% in any affected subject after an additional 3 months off-drug. In one subject, however, subsequent semen analyses demonstrated reductions from baseline of greater than or equal to 50% at 9 and 12 months off-drug. The clinical relevance of these data is unknown.

Information sources

An experienced librarian developed the search strategies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials. The MEDLINE search strategy was peer-reviewed by another librarian using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies checklist, and the final version is provided in our protocol. The literature search was initially conducted from inception until March 18, 2014, and a rapid update was conducted on December 15, 2015. Reference lists of all included studies and relevant reviews were scanned. Unpublished studies were sought by locating relevant conference abstracts and contacting authors of included studies and AED manufacturers.

Study selection and data collection

After the team conducted two pilot-tests of the eligibility criteria among 10 reviewers (12% disagreements), pairs of reviewers screened each title/abstract independently and conflicts (6%) were resolved through discussion. Subsequently, three level 2 screening pilots (26% disagreements) occurred, as well as three data abstraction pilots. The same process was followed for potentially relevant full-text articles (16% conflicts) and data abstraction. Authors were contacted for studies published in the last 10 years to clarify unclear or missing data.

The 'no AED use' arms were only included if the control group had the same indication as the active arm in the study (e.g. both had epilepsy). The malformation rates were expressed on a basis of livebirths plus stillbirths, based on the number of pregnant women enrolled in the study.

Appraisal of methodological quality and risk-of-bias

Two reviewers independently appraised quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The comparison-adjusted funnel plot was used to assess publication bias and small-study effects for outcomes including at least 10 studies.

In the comparison-adjusted funnel plot, the overall treatment effect for each comparison was estimated under the fixed-effect meta-analysis model and its difference from the study-specific treatment effect versus the study-specific standard error was plotted. All AEDs were ordered from oldest to newest according to their international market approval date. The comparison-adjusted funnel plot does not account for correlations induced by multi-arm trials, which may possibly cause overestimation and mask funnel plot asymmetry. To surmount most correlations in multi-arm trials, only data points corresponding to the study-specific basic parameters (treatment comparisons with common comparator) were plotted. For this, the control group was considered the common comparator or, if this was missing, the oldest treatment comparator was used against the remaining AEDs of the corresponding study.

Participants

Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for diabetes according to WHO(in the presence of diabetes symptoms, a random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, or a 2 h plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L with an oral glucose tolerance test; with no symptoms, another of these tests is required), had distal symmetrical polyneuropathyconfirmed by the modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (score ≥ 5), and had daily neuropathic pain confirmed by the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire(score ≥ 4) for at least 3 months. All participants provided written informed consent.

Inclusion criteria were the following: average daily pain intensity of at least 4 over 7 days on the numerical rating scale (NRS; 0 indicating "no pain" and 10 indicating "worst pain imaginable") while off pain medication, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase concentrations lower than twice the upper limit of normal, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m² or higher, and stable glucose control over the preceding 3 months with glycated haemoglobin concentrations of 12% (108 mmol/mol) or lower. Included patients had sufficient cognitive and language skills to be able to comply with all the study requirements and be available for the duration of this year-long study.

Exclusion criteria included the following: a history of epilepsy, depression requiring antidepressant medications, pregnancy and breastfeeding, severe systemic disease, postural hypotension (systolic blood pressure drop > 20 mm Hg on standing for 3 min), cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram at baseline (as per usual clinical practice, electrocardiogram was not done during or after each treatment pathway), prostatic hypertrophy based on clinical history (eg, urinary frequency and urgency, trouble starting a urine stream, weak stream and dribbling at the end of urination, or urinary retention) and review of medical records, other painful peripheral neuropathies (B12, folate, and thyroid stimulating hormone checked if not documented in medical records over the preceding 12 months), the concomitant presence of other painful medical conditions that were as severe as their DPNP, major amputations of the lower limbs, active diabetic foot ulcers, and substantial suicide risk. All participants did not use analgesic medications and antidepressants, other than trial drugs and rescue medication paracetamol up to 1 g every 6 h if required, for the duration of the study.

Post-abortion pain management — persons who use substances: This approach includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen primarily, and we recommend patients who use substances be offered NSAIDs as first line; additionally, short course or single-dose opioids may be used with caution only when non-opioid options are inadequate and, if required, should be used for the shortest duration possible. Patients should be adequately counseled about what to expect, clinicians should be particularly judicious about routine opioid prescriptions, most people do not require opioids for either medical or surgical abortion, and gabapentin has not been found to be effective for persons undergoing medication abortion.

### Gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain in women (GaPP2): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1177tcB4]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Chronic pelvic pain affects 2–24% of women worldwide and evidence for medical treatments is scarce. Gabapentin is effective in treating some chronic pain conditions. We aimed to measure the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 39 UK hospital centres. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy, which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin (titrated to a maximum dose of 2700 mg daily) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. The online randomisation system minimised allocations by presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred. The dual primary outcome measures were worst and average pain scores assessed separately on a numerical rating scale in weeks 13–16 after randomisation, in the intention-to-treat population. Self-reported adverse events were assessed according to intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.

Findings

Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019, and 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7.1 (standard deviation [SD] 2.6) in the gabapentin group and 7.4 (SD 2.2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1.4 (SD 2.3) in the gabapentin group and −1.2 (SD 2.1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0.20 [97.5% CI −0.81 to 0.42]; p = 0.47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4.3 (SD 2.3) in the gabapentin group and 4.5 (SD 2.2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1.1 (SD 2.0) in the gabapentin group and −0.9 (SD 1.8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0.18 [97.5% CI −0.71 to 0.35]; p = 0.45). More women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (10 [7%] of 153 in the gabapentin group compared with 3 [2%] of 153 in the placebo group; p = 0.04). Dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group.

Interpretation

This study was adequately powered, but treatment with gabapentin did not result in significantly lower pain scores in women with chronic pelvic pain, and was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo. Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as EQUETRO, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant patients taking EQUETRO enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.

Risk Summary

EQUETRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnantfemale [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Pregnancy registry and epidemiological data suggest a potential association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and major congenital malformations, including neural tube defects and malformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects and cardiovascular malformations). The available data are insufficient to identify an association with carbamazepine use and miscarriage (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated bipolar I disorder or epilepsy and with exposure to carbamazepine during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal studies, administration of carbamazepine at clinically relevant doses during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformation. Advise pregnant females of the potential risk of major congenital malformations with use of EQUETRO during pregnancy. Assess the risk and benefits of EQUETRO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered during pregnancy.

MHT after breast cancer

Management of menopause symptoms should be individually tailored and carried out in close liaison with the oncologist. Lifestyle alterations and non-hormonal treatment options, such as clonidine, SSRIs, venlafaxine, gabapentin, and pregabalin are recommended first line in these women. Although these are effective for mild-to-moderate vasomotor symptoms, their use is often limited by side effects.SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine should be avoided in women on tamoxifen due to inhibition of the CYP2D6 enzyme pathway which may reduce its efficacy. Complementary therapies such as isoflavones, soy, red clover, and black cohosh are not recommended as they may have oestrogenic effects and there is a lack of data regarding safety and efficacy, although some may have SERM-type effects (NICE, NG101).

Data regarding the safety of MHT in breast cancer survivors are limited, as several studies were terminated early due to an increased risk of recurrence in the interim analysis. Current UK guidance suggests to reserve MHT for those with refractory symptoms after other non-hormonal treatments have been unsuccessful (NICE NG 101). Other guidelines advise against MHT in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

ASMs With Uncertain Risk

Drug use patterns differed across the various ASMs with uncertain risk. Among pregnancies exposed to pregabalin and gabapentin, although the majority (80.5% and 72.1%, respectively) concerned women without any identified diagnosis of epilepsy, mood disorders, neuropathic pain or migraine, those with a diagnosis of neuropathic pain accounted for an increasing part over time (+21% and +67%, respectively) (eTables 11 and 12). Treatment initiation mostly occurred during pregnancy (45.0% and 47.0% of exposed pregnancies, respectively) or in the preceding year (23.0% and 22.2%, respectively). Among exposed pregnancies ended in childbirth, exposure to pregabalin and gabapentin during pregnancy was mainly limited to a single dispensation (69.5% and 62.0, respectively) and to the first trimester (78.3% and 65.2%, respectively) overall. However, the numbers of pregnancies exposed to pregabalin with multiple dispensations and with exposure beyond the first trimester increased over time (from 660 to 1,087, i.e. +65% and from 329 to 893, i.e. +171%, respectively) (Figure 3).

Pregnancies exposed to the other ASMs with uncertain risk (i.e. clonazepam, oxcarbazepine, and newer ASMs) mainly concerned women diagnosed with epilepsy, treated for more than 1 year before pregnancy start. ASM exposure was generally sustained throughout pregnancy.

ASMs With Acknowledged Risk

Drug use patterns differed across the various ASMs with acknowledged risk. Among pregnancies exposed to valproic acid, the majority concerned women diagnosed with epilepsy (39.7%) or mood disorders (27.9%); those with a diagnosis of epilepsy accounted for an increasing part over time (from 38.3% to 46.5%, i.e. +21%) (eTables 13 and 14). Valproic acid had generally been initiated more than 1 year before pregnancy start (71.4%). Among exposed pregnancies ended in childbirth, the numbers with multiple dispensations and with sustained exposure from the first trimester markedly decreased over time (from 1,211 to 166, i.e. −86%, and from 733 to 69, i.e. −91%, respectively) (Figure 3).

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^115S9yx1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy, the most common chronic neurological condition, affects 0.6–1% of the population. Epilepsy in pregnant women causes frequent seizures, increasing the risk of pregnancy-related complications. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are prescribed to reduce the severity of epilepsy or help manage other conditions such as pain, psychiatric disorders, and migraine. Women taking AEDs have a greater risk of miscarriage and teratogenicity, including a 4–8% chance of giving birth to a child with a major congenital malformation (CM), because these agents can be transferred to the fetus via the placenta. Since the first documentation of teratogenicity of AEDs in the 1960s, the use of many first-generation AEDs (e.g. valproate) in pregnant women with epilepsy has been studied extensively. Several large-scale pregnancy registries were established to evaluate the safety of first- and newer-generation (e.g. gabapentin) AEDs. However, little is known about the "comparative" safety of AED exposure in utero, and previous studies comparing multiple AEDs are often small and underpowered. As such, we compared the safety of AEDs in infants and children exposed in utero through a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

### Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of congenital malformations and prenatal outcomes [^111dDfUE]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Synthesis of included studies

A random-effects meta-analysis model was applied because the studies differed methodologically and clinically. Outcome data were pooled using the odds ratio (OR) and, for two or more studies, the OR was estimated using Bayesian hierarchical models and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. When treatment comparisons formed a connected network of evidence, a random-effects NMA was conducted using treatment nodes pre-specified by the team. Multiple doses were combined in nodes, because this information was not reported consistently across the studies. In both pairwise meta-analyses and NMAs, we assumed common within-network between-study variance (τ²) across treatment comparisons, since there were many treatment comparisons, including a single study where the (τ²) was not estimable.

Prior to applying a NMA, the transitivity assumption was assessed using age, baseline risk, treatment indication, timing of exposure, and risk-of-bias as potential treatment effect modifiers. The mean of each continuous potential effect modifier and the mode (i.e. most frequent value) of each categorical potential effect modifier for each pairwise comparison and outcome were presented in tables. For each outcome, the entire network was evaluated for inconsistency using the design-by-treatment interaction model. The random-effects model was used when multiple studies were available in each design in the network; alternatively, we applied the fixed-effect model. If the global test suggested inconsistency, local inconsistency in specific network paths was assessed using the loop-specific method assuming common within-loop τ². This was a clinically reasonable assumption, since the treatments were of the same nature. When statistically significant inconsistency or important heterogeneity were detected, the data was checked for errors. If no errors were identified, network meta-regression, subgroup, or sensitivity analyses were conducted. For the overall major CM, combined fetal losses, and prenatal growth outcomes, network meta-regression were performed for age and baseline risk (i.e. using the control group), assuming a common fixed coefficient across comparisons. For these outcomes, a subgroup analysis was conducted for AED generation (i.e. older AEDs versus newer generation AEDs), and study designs (i.e. observational versus RCTs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the same outcomes restricting to studies with treatment indication (i.e. including only women with epilepsy), timing of at least first trimester exposure, large study size (i.e. > 300 patients), maternal alcohol intake, and higher methodological quality using two items of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies (adequacy of follow-up of cohorts, comparability of cohorts) and low overall risk-of-bias for RCTs (component approach using randomization and allocation concealment items). For the overall major CM outcome, sensitivity analyses were conducted for cohort studies, folic acid used by more than 50% of women and family history of major CMs, including a large international registry study (EURAP) that was not included in the primary analysis due to potential partial overlap of participants with other studies and removing three potentially overlapping studies from Australia, Spain, and Argentina. For combined fetal losses and prenatal growth outcomes, sensitivity analysis was conducted for maternal tobacco use. Finally, for the overall major CM, combined fetal losses, and prenatal growth outcomes, the model suggested by Schmitz et al. for different study designs was applied.

### Use of antiseizure medications early in pregnancy and the risk of major malformations in the newborn [^116zJxc9]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Maternal use of first-generation antiseizure medications (ASMs), such as valproate and phenobarbital, increases the risk of congenital malformations in offspring. Second-generation ASMs, such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam, pose less risk to fetal development, although topiramate seems to increase the risk of oral clefts. Less is known about the safety of newer second-generation ASMs during pregnancy including oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, and lacosamide. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative risk of major malformations in offspring after maternal use of specific ASMs early in pregnancy, with special interest in second-generation ASMs.

Methods

The study population included pregnant women who enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2023. Data on ASM use and maternal characteristics were collected through phone interviews at enrollment, at 7 months of gestation, and within 3 months after delivery. Malformations were confirmed by medical records and adjudicated by a dysmorphologist. The risk of major malformations was estimated among infants exposed to specific ASMs in monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated with logistic regression models.

Results

A total of 7,311 participants taking an ASM as monotherapy during the first trimester were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 30 years. The risk of major malformations was 2.1% (52/2,461) for lamotrigine, 2.0% (26/1,283) for levetiracetam, 2.8% (32/1,132) for carbamazepine, 5.1% (26/510) for topiramate, 2.8% (12/423) for phenytoin, 9.2% (31/337) for valproate, 1.5% (5/327) for oxcarbazepine, 1.5% (4/270) for gabapentin, 1.3% (3/228) for zonisamide, 6.0% (12/200) for phenobarbital, 3.2% (2/62) for pregabalin, and 0% (0/88) for lacosamide. Compared with lamotrigine, the RR was 5.1 (95% CI 3.0–8.5) for valproate, 2.9 (1.4–5.8) for phenobarbital, and 2.2 (1.2–4.0) for topiramate. Topiramate was specifically associated with a higher risk of cleft lip.

Discussion

Results confirm the association between maternal use of valproate, phenobarbital, and topiramate early in pregnancy and a higher risk of major malformations in the infant compared with lamotrigine. However, they do not support meaningful risk elevation for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, or zonisamide. Relative risk estimates for lacosamide and pregabalin are still imprecise.

### Gabapentin (gaba 300-EZS) [^111wFDoY]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

In studies in which rats received oral doses of gabapentin (500 to 2,000 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy, adverse effect on offspring development (increased incidences of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis) were observed at all doses. The lowest dose tested is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m² basis.

When pregnant rabbits were treated with gabapentin during the period of organogenesis, an increase in embryofetal mortality was observed at all doses tested (60, 300, or 1,500 mg/kg). The lowest dose tested is less than the MRHD on a mg/m² basis.

In a published study, gabapentin (400 mg/kg/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to neonatal mice during the first postnatal week, a period of synaptogenesis in rodents (corresponding to the last trimester of pregnancy in humans). Gabapentin caused a marked decrease in neuronal synapse formation in brains of intact mice and abnormal neuronal synapse formation in a mouse model of synaptic repair. Gabapentin has been shown in vitro to interfere with activity of the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels, a receptor involved in neuronal synaptogenesis. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of gabapentin in the management of postherpetic neuralgia in pediatric patients have not been established.

Safety and effectiveness as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Sodium valproate in pregnancy: what are the risks and should we use a shared decision-making approach? [^116LiSfS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In July 2017, almost 60 years after the thalidomide tragedy, the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) imposed a nationwide ban on the use of sodium valproate in pregnancy, on the grounds of teratogenicity. Guidelines produced by the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 2016 recommended avoiding this drug in any woman of child-bearing potential (reflecting a previous NICE guideline published in 2014). More recently, regulatory bodies have tightened their stance significantly. In February 2018, for example, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency recommended that valproate should not be used in pregnancy unless the woman has a form of epilepsy that is unresponsive to other anti-epileptic drugs, and also that the drug should not be prescribed for women of childbearing age who are not enrolled in a pregnancy prevention programme. In April 2018, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Devices Regulatory Agency endorsed this recommendation.

Sodium valproate is a medication licensed for both epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and is also used off label for a range of indications including migraine prophylaxis. Whilst its use in epilepsy is falling in the UK as the use of third-generation anticonvulsants increases, its use for bipolar disorder has been increasing, especially among women of childbearing age. In Ireland, recent data corroborate these findings, which necessitate increased surveillance and an improved understanding of alternatives.

Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition characterised by alternating periods of elated mood and depression. The condition is a significant public health problem worldwide, and remains a challenge for patients and clinicians. Systematic reviews examining the epidemiology of bipolar disorder show that it is associated with markedly increased suicide and self-harm rates, substance abuse and other psychiatric morbidities. Given the female preponderance and young age of onset of bipolar disorder (17.5 years), women of childbearing age make up a significant proportion of patients. Management of bipolar disorder is difficult in this group, as many mood stabilisers have either been shown to be teratogenic or have unknown effects in pregnancy (see below).

### Emilia-romagna study on pregnancy and exposure to antiepileptic drugs (ESPEA): a population-based study on prescription patterns, pregnancy outcomes and fetal health [^116Xynzx]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

In agreement with some studies, we did not find a higher risk of SGA in infants exposed to AEDs, but different substances might have a different impact on fetal growth. In our population, gabapentin seems to carry a higher risk than other anticonvulsants.

However, due to the rarity of MBDs and SGA infants, our study was underpowered to provide information on the risks associated with single AEDs. This is a crucial point given that the continuation of antiepileptic therapy during pregnancy is the safest solution in most cases, as seizure relapse during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality.

The need for similar systems to monitor the safety of AEDs in pregnancy in a population-based context is evident, also considering that new anticonvulsants will be marketed in the coming years. For this reason, we suggest that reliable administrative data in existing European registries be pooled to obtain a sufficient statistical power to investigate each single antiepileptic agent.

Headaches in pregnancy — antiepileptic drugs for prevention carry distinct risks and recommendations. For topiramate, risks include "stillbirth or spontaneous abortion (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.12–5.49), major congenital anomalies (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.17–2.97), and fetal growth restriction (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.41–4.63)", so "its use in pregnancy or the prepregnancy period for headache prevention is not recommended". For valproic acid, risks include "stillbirth or spontaneous abortion (combined) (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.04–3.45)" and "neural tube defects (RR 5.30; 95% CI 1.05–26.70)", and "The use of valproic acid in pregnancy or the prepregnancy period for headache prevention is not recommended". Although carbamazepine also has risk signals, "its overall risk is considered more acceptable than valproic acid and topiramate if an antiepileptic is to be considered for headache prevention".

### Is acetaminophen safe in pregnancy? [^115H8fQE]. Scandinavian Journal of Pain (2017). Medium credibility.

American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) — acetaminophen use in pregnancy — is affirmed as safe, stating that acetaminophen is safe and effective when taken as intended and, because of its safety profile and absence of teratogenic effects, it has been considered the medication of choice for fever and pain relief during pregnancy. ACMT affirms the safety of acetaminophen in pregnancy and calls for an evidence-based approach to the search for causes and treatment of autism. Regarding autism risk, multiple studies have investigated the association between acetaminophen and autism but have failed to find a causal effect, and larger, more sophisticated studies, including a study of siblings in the same family, demonstrated no increased risk in children exposed to acetaminophen. The statement cautions that raising concerns about acetaminophen use in pregnancy without strong supporting evidence may discourage care for maternal fever, which is known to pose significant fetal risk on its own, and notes that untreated maternal pain can also lead to morbidity. It further warns that patients may turn to alternatives such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and opioids, both of which can clearly cause harm to the developing fetus and newborn.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^111sf4q1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Practice Guideline No. 3 — headaches in pregnancy and postpartum — provides updated evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of primary and secondary headaches in pregnancy and postpartum, and targets pregnant and postpartum patients with a history of or experiencing primary or new secondary headaches. Development used an a priori protocol with comprehensive literature searches in Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE, and a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence-to-decision framework to translate evidence into recommendation statements. The guideline includes recommendations on interventions to prevent primary headache in individuals who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding; evaluation for symptomatic patients presenting with primary and secondary headaches during pregnancy; and treatment options for primary and secondary headaches during pregnancy and lactation, with recommendations classified by strength and evidence quality and inclusion of Ungraded Good Practice Points when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

Neonatal withdrawal can be difficult to treat in infants with co-exposure to opiates and gabapentin. Because maternal self-report can underestimate exposures, we evaluated the effect of universal toxicology screening for gabapentin. Identification of co-exposure to opiates and gabapentin increased after implementation of toxicology screening, with implications for improved neonatal care.

### Gabapentin [^112RhLFi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal Data

When pregnant mice received oral doses of gabapentin (500, 1000, or 3000 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis, embryofetal toxicity (increased incidences of skeletal variations) was observed at the two highest doses. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in mice (500 mg/kg/day) is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3600 mg on a body surface area (mg/m²) basis.

In studies in which rats received oral doses of gabapentin (500 to 2000 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy, adverse effect on offspring development (increased incidences of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis) were observed at all doses. The lowest dose tested is similar to the MRHD on a mg/m2basis.

When pregnant rabbits were treated with gabapentin during the period of organogenesis, an increase in embryofetal mortality was observed at all doses tested (60, 300, or 1500 mg/kg). The lowest dose tested is less than the MRHD on a mg/m2basis.

In a published study, gabapentin (400 mg/kg/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to neonatal mice during the first postnatal week, a period of synaptogenesis in rodents (corresponding to the last trimester of pregnancy in humans). Gabapentin caused a marked decrease in neuronal synapse formation in brains of intact mice and abnormal neuronal synapse formation in a mouse model of synaptic repair. Gabapentin has been shown in vitro to interfere with activity of the α2δ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels, a receptor involved in neuronal synaptogenesis. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Gabapentin is secreted in human milk following oral administration. The effects on the breastfed infant and on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gabapentin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from gabapentin or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of gabapentin in the management of postherpetic neuralgia in pediatric patients have not been established.

Safety and effectiveness as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years has not been established [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child [^116c3jxb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The decision to continue ASM treatment during pregnancy requires taking a risk‐benefit decision. On the one hand, there is the potential risk posed to the foetus when the medication is a teratogen yet on the other hand, there is the health and well‐being of the mother, who requires treatment throughout her pregnancy to minimise the risk of seizures (Tomson 2015); the choice of ASM depends on the type of epilepsy and the seizures (Marson 2007). A lack of knowledge regarding foetal safety limits treatment options for women with epilepsy in their childbearing years, as women and their doctors may avoid ASMs with limited data. Conversely, a lack of evidence may lead to an ASM with a higher foetal risk profile being used extensively, prior to a full understanding of its risks.

While a number of studies indicate a teratogenic risk from certain ASMs, there are conflicting results regarding the degree of risk and the types of malformations associated with specific ASMs. Data are slow to accumulate and an earlier version of this review (Weston 2016) found extremely limited data on ASMs with a decade or more of clinical use. Such a lack of evidence makes it difficult to counsel women about treatment choices before or during pregnancy. There is, therefore, a clear need for a systematic review and meta‐analysis of existing data to inform these decisions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would provide the most reliable evidence about the effects of ASMs in pregnancy, but are essentially precluded by ethical considerations and logistical challenges pertaining to study design, recruitment and interpretation.

In view of this, we performed a systematic review of all available evidence including registry‐based, prospective cohort studies, RCTs and epidemiological studies using routine health record databases. At the protocol stage, we decided not to include malformation case‐control studies (e.g. Jentink 2010a; Jentink 2010b) due to the substantial differences in the approach in these studies and how these methods compare to prospective observational cohort studies. This decision is discussed further in Overall completeness and applicability of evidence. This review is an update of two previous reviews (Adab 2004; Weston 2016). Evidence from this review, along with the related review by the same Cochrane team (Bromley 2014), will aid the decisions that clinicians and women with epilepsy have to make about the treatment of epilepsy during the potential childbearing years.

### Optimizing treatment of epilepsy during pregnancy [^1137w9Yc]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Freedom from seizures is the ultimate goal in treatment of patients with epilepsy. At the same time, the side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should not outweigh the benefits of treatment. This is particularly important in women with epilepsy who wish to become pregnant. These women and their partners should be made aware of the risks associated with uncontrolled seizures as well as the teratogenicity of some AEDs. Recent studies have indicated a higher risk for birth defects and possibly also adverse cognitive effects associated with exposure to valproate compared with carbamazepine. Although further studies are needed, it appears reasonable to use valproate with caution in women with epilepsy who are planning to become pregnant and to consider whether other equally effective and safer AEDs are available. However, women who need valproate to control their seizures should continue the drug and not be discouraged from pregnancy, provided that they receive counseling with the best available knowledge. With proper management before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth, the vast majority of pregnancies in women with active epilepsy will have a favorable outcome.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 201: pregestational diabetes mellitus [^114y4qoj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Pregestational diabetes mellitus represents one of the most challenging medical complications of pregnancy because of the need for frequent monitoring and adjustment of medications as well as the potential for maternal and fetal complications. This document provides an overview of the current understanding of pregestational diabetes mellitus and suggests management guidelines during pregnancy. Because few well-designed studies have been performed, many of the guidelines are based on expert and consensus opinion. This document has been updated to reflect current data on pregestational diabetes. This Practice Bulletin is updated with summary information to counsel and manage women with pregestational diabetes before and during pregnancy, more recent literature reflecting experience with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion during pregnancy, an expanded section on the role of oral hypoglycemic agents in pregnancy, and the option of long-acting reversible contraception during the postpartum period.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^112pWmRT]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin for migraine

If three or more migraine preventatives have been trialled at effective dosages, the NICE guideline recommends doctors to consider botulinum toxin type A in chronic migraineurs (more than 15 headache days per month of which at last 8 are migrainous, for more than 3 months), provided there has been adequate management of medication overuse.

Botulinum toxin therapy should be stopped if it fails to provide the required response (a less than 30% reduction in headache days per month after two cycles), or if the headache has returned to an episodic phenotype. Earlier this year, longitudinal data from one of the largest botulinum toxin-treated migraine cohorts (refractory to preventative medications) demonstrated significantly more pain-free days and improved quality of life.

Pregnancy and migraine

Around 70% of migraineurs improve during pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters). If migraines are troublesome during the pregnancy, the choice of abortives should be discussed (see The triptans section). NSAIDs can be used in early pregnancy, but are absolutely contraindicated in the third trimester. Aspirin is a particular concern due to the possibility of developing Reye's syndrome in the neonate. Of the abortives, paracetamol is probably the safest.

During pregnancy, we tend to review patients with severe migraine more frequently to monitor progress and to discuss treatment options. There are understandably few data on which agents are safe in pregnancy and most drugs are unlicensed for use in pregnancy. Preventatives should be prescribed only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Low-dose (10–50 mg) amitriptyline is sometimes prescribed; however, there are reports of limb deformities following prenatal exposure to higher doses. Beta blockers may increase the risk of intrauterine growth retardation (25% risk with atenolol). Sodium valproate should be avoided. There is an excellent review of this topic available. Greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks may provide short to medium term analgesia. External neuromodulation using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device was recently shown to be both safe and effective.

### Use of 5-HT1 agonists in pregnancy [^116CN6ps]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To report and evaluate available data on the use of serotonin 5-HT(1) agonists (triptans) during pregnancy.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, limited to English-language articles on human subjects, was conducted (1990-December 2007) using the search terms pregnancy, migraine, and the individual triptan drug names. In addition, the manufacturers of all 7 available triptans were contacted regarding the existence of a pregnancy registry for their drug(s) and the availability of registry reports.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All retrospective and prospective studies reporting on pregnancy outcomes after the use of a triptan were included and critically evaluated. Data from all available manufacturer-sponsored pregnancy registries were also included.

Data Synthesis

Safe and effective treatment of migraine during pregnancy is imperative. Data involving sumatriptan and, to a lesser extent, naratriptan and rizatriptan, exist primarily regarding exposure in the first trimester. These data show no significant differences in congenital malformations or poor pregnancy outcomes when compared with expected rates in the general population or with the observed rates in control subjects. There is very little information regarding exposure in middle and late pregnancy.

Conclusions

Sumatriptan appears to be a safe treatment alternative for pregnant women who experience new-onset or worsened migraines in the first trimester. Further observation is needed prior to recommending its use in later trimesters. Based upon available data, the other agents in this class cannot be recommended for use during pregnancy at this time.

### Gabapentin as an adjunct for pain management during dilation and evacuation: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115PpxGj]. Contraception (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of preoperative gabapentin among patients undergoing dilation and evacuation (D&E) with moderate sedation.

Study Design

We conducted a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial among patients undergoing same-day D&E at 14 to 19 weeks gestation under moderate sedation. We randomized participants 1:1 to gabapentin 600 mg or placebo after cervical preparation at least 1 hour prior to D&E. We assessed pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale before, during, and after the procedure. The primary outcome was postoperative recall of maximum procedural pain with a 13-mm a priori threshold for clinical significance. We standardized initial fentanyl and midazolam dosing. We assessed satisfaction with pain control, nausea, and vomiting via Likert scales and anxiety using a validated instrument.

Results

We enrolled 126 participants and randomized 61 to gabapentin and 65 to placebo, with study medication administered a mean of 211 (SD 64) minutes preoperatively. Recall of maximum pain was 41 mm for gabapentin and 49 mm for placebo (p = 0.24). Gabapentin resulted in reduced pain during uterine aspiration (56 vs 71 mm, p = 0.003) compared to placebo, but not for any other time points. The gabapentin group had higher satisfaction (78% vs 65% very or somewhat satisfied, p = 0.01). Median fentanyl dose was lower in the gabapentin group (75 vs 100 mcg, p = 0.005). Midazolam dose, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety did not differ between groups. No serious adverse events occurred in the gabapentin group. Sedation reversal was not required.

Conclusions

The addition of gabapentin to moderate sedation during D&E did not result in lower maximum recalled procedural pain. Gabapentin resulted in reduced intra-operative pain during uterine aspiration and increased satisfaction with pain control.

Implications

Gabapentin reduces intraoperative pain and improves satisfaction with pain management when administered prior to second-trimester surgical abortion and may be considered as an adjunct to intravenous sedation. Moderate sedation may impair assessment and recall of pain. Additional research is needed to identify the most effective pain management regimens for D&E.

### Management of reproductive risks in people with epilepsy [^113sRwPt]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Epilepsy is a common neurological condition worldwide, presenting unique management challenges for those affected during reproductive age. The effectiveness of contraceptives can be modified by antiseizure medication treatments and pregnancy can alter the pharmacokinetics of antiseizure medications. Furthermore, although treatment with some antiseizure medications convey lifelong risks to offspring, inadequately controlled epilepsy can lead to injury or, in rare cases, death of the mother. In this complex set of circumstances, safe and effective antiseizure medication treatment, evidence-based decision making regarding contraceptive selections, and clear counselling and risk minimisation are imperative. Although risk-benefit decision making has become standard clinical practice for the management of women with epilepsy of childbearing age, reproductive treatment considerations could also be relevant for men. Most young adults with epilepsy live in low-income and middle-income countries, where access to contraceptives, antiseizure medications with adequate safety profiles, and reproductive care and counselling can be scarce. Strategies to optimise care for people with epilepsy in all stages of their reproductive journey must be tailored for resource-limited settings to improve parent-child health worldwide.

### Gabapentin for pain management after osmotic dilator insertion and prior to dilation and evacuation: a randomized controlled trial [^115gALJe]. Contraception (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate if gabapentin 600 mg reduces pain after osmotic dilator placement the day before a dilation and evacuation (D&E) procedure.

Study Design

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (stratified by vaginal parity) trial among women undergoing osmotic dilator placement before D&E at 15–23 5/7 weeks gestation. Subjects received gabapentin 600 mg or placebo 30 min before dilator placement, with re-dosing 8 h later. We assessed pain after dilator placement using a numeric rating scale (NRS; scale 0–10) at 5 min, 2, 4, and 8 h, and at presentation for D&E. The primary outcome was median NRS pain score change from baseline to 8 h after dilator placement. Secondary outcomes included gabapentin-related side effects and analgesic use.

Results

Of 121 randomized women, we excluded three subjects (allergic reaction [placebo], randomization error, no NRS data), leaving 60 gabapentin and 58 placebo subjects. Of 110 (93%) women who provided 8-hour data, median pain score changes from baseline did not differ between gabapentin and placebo groups overall (2 vs. 2.5, p = 0.52), in vaginally nulliparous women (2 vs. 4, p = 0.10) or in parous women (2 vs. 1.5, p = 0.37). We found no statistically significant differences in median pain score change from baseline to any timepoint overall or when stratified by parity. Beginning at 2 h after dilator placement, more gabapentin than placebo users experienced dizziness (29/53[55%] vs. 11/53[21%], p = 0.001) and tiredness (34/54[63%] vs. 17/54[31%], p = 0.002). The proportion of women using narcotics did not differ between gabapentin (35/60[58%]) or placebo (40/58[69%]) users (p = 0.26).

Conclusions

Gabapentin does not reduce pain with overnight osmotic dilator placement prior to D&E and causes drug-related side effects.

Implications Statement

Women experience pain, mostly mild to moderate, with overnight cervical dilator placement at 15–23 5/7 weeks gestation. About 2/3 of women will use a limited quantity of narcotics if provided. Gabapentin does not decrease the pain with or following dilator placement and does not decrease narcotic use.

### Gabapentin as an adjunct to paracervical block for perioperative pain management for first-trimester uterine aspiration: a randomized controlled trial [^115C4Cex]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain management approaches during uterine aspiration vary, which include local anesthetic, oral analgesics, moderate sedation, deep sedation, or a combination of approaches. For local anesthetic approaches specifically, we continue to have suboptimal pain control. Gabapentin as an adjunct to pain management has proven to be beneficial in gynecologic surgery. We sought to evaluate the impact of gabapentin on perioperative pain during surgical management of first-trimester abortion or early pregnancy loss with uterine aspiration under local anesthesia.

Objective

We hypothesized that adding gabapentin to local anesthesia will reduce perioperative and postoperative pain associated with uterine aspiration. Secondary outcomes included tolerability of gabapentin and postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and anxiety.

Study Design

We conducted a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of gabapentin 600 mg given 1 to 2 hours preoperatively among subjects receiving a first-trimester uterine aspiration under paracervical block in an outpatient ambulatory surgery center. There were 111 subjects randomized. The primary outcome was pain at time of uterine aspiration as measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale. Secondary outcomes included pain at other perioperative time points. To assess changes in pain measures, an intention to treat mixed effects model was fit with treatment groups (gabapentin vs control) as a between-subjects factor and time point as a within-subjects factor plus their interaction term. Because of a non-normal distribution of pain scores, the area under the curve was calculated for secondary outcomes with comparison of groups utilizing Mann-Whitney U tests.

Results

Among the 111 randomized, most subjects were Black or African American (69.4%), mean age was 26 years (± 5.5), and mean gestational age was 61.3 days (standard deviation, 14.10). Mean pain scores at time of uterine aspiration were 66.77 (gabapentin) vs 71.06 (placebo), with a mean difference of -3.38 (P = 0.51). There were no significant changes in pain score preoperatively or intraoperatively. Subjects who received gabapentin had significantly lower levels of pain at 10 minutes after surgery (mean difference [standard error (SE)] = -13.0 [-5.0]; P = 0.01) and 30 minutes after surgery (mean difference [SE] = -10.8 [-5.1]; P = 0.03) compared with subjects who received placebo. Median nausea scores and incidence of emesis pre- and postoperatively did not differ between groups. Similarly, anxiety scores did not differ between groups, before or after the procedure. At 10 and 30 minutes after the procedure, most participants reported no side effects or mild side effects, and this did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

Preoperative gabapentin did not reduce pain during uterine aspiration. However, it did reduce postoperative pain, which may prove to be a desired attribute of its use, particularly in cases where postoperative pain may be a greater challenge.

### Pregnancy outcomes following gabapentin use: results of a prospective comparative cohort study [^111ZCvUZ]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our objectives were to 1) determine whether first-trimester use of gabapentin is associated with an increased risk for major malformations; 2) examine rates of spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions, stillbirths, mean birth weight and gestational age at delivery; and 3) examine rates of poor neonatal adaptation syndrome following late pregnancy exposure.

Methods

The study design was prospective. Women were included who initially contacted the services between 5 and 8 weeks with a comparison group of women exposed to nonteratogens, collected in a similar manner.

Results

We have data on 223 pregnancy outcomes exposed to gabapentin and 223 unexposed pregnancies. The rates of major malformations were similar in both groups (p = 0.845). There was a higher rate of preterm births (p = 0.019) and low birth weight < 2,500 g (p = 0.033) in the gabapentin group. Among infants who were exposed to gabapentin up until delivery, 23 of 61 (38%) were admitted to either the neonatal intensive care unit or special care nursery for observation and/or treatment, vs 6 of 201 (2.9%) live births in the comparison group (p < 0.001). There were 2 cases of possible poor neonatal adaptation syndrome in neonates exposed to gabapentin close to delivery, compared with none in the comparison group, although it must be noted that these infants were concomitantly exposed to other psychotropic drugs. Among the women who took gabapentin, the major indications were pain (n = 90; 43%) and epilepsy (n = 71; 34%); the remainder were for other indications, mostly psychiatric.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that although this sample size is not large enough to make any definitive conclusions, and there was no comparator group treated with other antiepileptic drugs, gabapentin use in pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk for major malformations. This finding and the increased risk for low birth weight and preterm birth require further investigation.
