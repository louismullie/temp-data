## Question

What are the provoking factors for a clot?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the provoking factors for blood clot formation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching pathophysiological framework, namely Virchow's triad. Then, I should verify the distinction between venous and arterial thrombosis and their shared versus unique risk factors. Next, I will categorize provoking factors into inherited, acquired, and lifestyle domains, and I should double-check which are transient versus persistent. After that, I will examine special contexts like cancer, pregnancy, COVID-19, and atrial fibrillation. Finally, I will integrate these into a practical, risk-stratified summary and note guideline nuances that influence testing and prophylaxis decisions.

> Let me first confirm the foundational framework. Virchow's triad remains the most robust way to organize thrombotic risk: abnormalities in blood composition (hypercoagulability), vessel wall injury or dysfunction, and abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence) converge to provoke clot formation, and these components interact dynamically rather than acting in isolation [^2ddc1f91] [^396f8789] [^f8f088df].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about venous versus arterial disease being entirely separate. I should verify where they overlap. Historically, venous thrombosis was linked to stasis and hypercoagulability, while arterial thrombosis was tied to platelet activation and endothelial injury from atherosclerosis; however, large-scale epidemiology shows shared population risk factors such as older age, smoking, and adiposity, indicating meaningful overlap in determinants of venous and arterial thrombosis [^56754c1d] [^588ad30b] [^4cd37e1f].

> Next, I should review inherited or genetic provoking factors. Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A are common, moderate-risk thrombophilias that increase venous thrombosis risk, while deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S confer higher risk; these primarily tilt blood composition toward hypercoagulability, though their impact on arterial events is weaker and context-dependent [^878a1b8b] [^52622740] [^575f6acd]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: routine thrombophilia testing rarely changes acute management, and guidelines advise selective testing rather than broad screening, especially outside of research or specific family contexts [^8ef25251] [^2320c307].

> I will now examine acquired provoking factors, starting with transient triggers. Surgery, trauma, hospitalization, and immobilization promote stasis and endothelial injury and are classic precipitants of venous thrombosis; pregnancy and the postpartum period create a procoagulant state with stasis, and exogenous estrogen from combined oral contraceptives or hormone therapy increases VTE risk; cancer and its treatments drive both venous and arterial events via tissue factor, endothelial activation, and stasis from compression or catheters [^79fccd4f] [^5ec128fc] [^5c712281] [^231402a5] [^d4b57351]. I should confirm that these are the dominant drivers of "provoked" VTE, which they are, and that their presence materially elevates recurrence risk compared with unprovoked events.

> Let me consider persistent acquired conditions. Active malignancy, inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and myeloproliferative neoplasms sustain hypercoagulability and often require extended or indefinite anticoagulation when thrombosis occurs; diabetes and obesity both increase VTE risk through inflammatory and rheologic mechanisms, and chronic kidney disease contributes via endothelial dysfunction and altered coagulation [^231402a5] [^a0ca27bf] [^1ae851b7]. Hold on, I should verify that these are the anchors of "persistent" risk that guide duration decisions; yes, guidelines and reviews consistently weight these heavily in recurrence risk stratification [^aec0eb67].

> Now, I need to check lifestyle and demographic modifiers. Older age, smoking, and adiposity are consistently associated with higher VTE risk and are also classic arterial risk factors, underscoring shared pathophysiology; prolonged travel with immobility, sedentary behavior, and even circadian disruption may modestly increase risk, though effect sizes vary and are often context-dependent [^56754c1d] [^588ad30b] [^79fccd4f] [^17de99e4]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought obesity was a minor contributor; let me reconsider — large cohort data show adiposity is a major, modifiable VTE risk factor, so I should correct that and emphasize weight management in prevention strategies [^56754c1d] [^588ad30b].

> I will now examine special contexts that integrate multiple mechanisms. In cancer, tumor-derived tissue factor, endothelial activation, chemotherapy, surgery, and indwelling devices converge to create a prothrombotic milieu; VTE is common and prognostically adverse, prompting guideline-endorsed risk assessment and prophylaxis in many patients with active malignancy [^231402a5] [^a0ca27bf] [^68028fdb]. In COVID-19, systemic inflammation, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability with elevated D-dimer and factor VIII drive high rates of VTE and arterial thrombosis, supporting pharmacologic prophylaxis in hospitalized patients [^de93d904] [^561cf501] [^69d6f1f8]. In atrial fibrillation, stasis in the left atrial appendage, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability combine to generate cardioembolic risk, which is captured clinically by CHA2DS2-VASc and increasingly linked to atrial myopathy even beyond AF [^839d3476] [^ad182b35] [^c2980546].

> But wait, what if the clot is arterial rather than venous — do the same provoking factors apply? Arterial thrombosis is typically triggered by plaque rupture or erosion with platelet-rich "white clots", where traditional cardiovascular risk factors dominate; however, hypercoagulability can amplify thrombus burden and phenotype, and emerging data suggest some hemostatic factors modulate arterial outcomes, albeit less consistently than in venous disease [^fb380977] [^4bbe37a0] [^575f6acd]. I should double-check that this nuance is reflected in prevention: yes, while antiplatelet therapy is foundational for arterial events, attention to shared risks like smoking, obesity, and diabetes benefits both arterial and venous thrombosis prevention [^56754c1d] [^588ad30b].

> Next, I should review how these factors translate into clinical risk stratification. Events are often labeled "provoked" when a transient trigger is present and "unprovoked" when none is identified; importantly, provoked VTE carries lower recurrence risk than unprovoked VTE, and the presence of persistent acquired risks or inherited thrombophilia can shift recurrence risk upward and influence anticoagulation duration decisions, though guidelines increasingly emphasize the primacy of acquired provoking factors over thrombophilia testing in routine care [^5666845a] [^aec0eb67] [^8ef25251]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, ASH 2023 recommends selective thrombophilia testing and cautions against routine testing that won't change management, reinforcing a focus on identifiable, modifiable, or persistent drivers of risk [^8ef25251] [^2320c307].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is actionable. Provoking factors for clots arise from the intersection of hypercoagulability, endothelial injury or dysfunction, and stasis or turbulent flow; transient triggers like surgery, trauma, immobilization, pregnancy, and estrogen exposure commonly precipitate VTE, while persistent conditions such as cancer, inflammatory disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes, and obesity sustain risk; inherited thrombophilias add risk but are less often decisive in acute management; and shared lifestyle risks like smoking and adiposity bridge venous and arterial disease, supporting comprehensive risk modification and context-specific prophylaxis strategies [^2ddc1f91] [^79fccd4f] [^56754c1d] [^588ad30b] [^231402a5] [^878a1b8b].

Blood clots form when the balance of hemostasis shifts toward thrombosis, driven by **Virchow's triad**: endothelial injury, blood flow stasis, and hypercoagulability [^2ddc1f91]. Key triggers include **surgery, trauma, and immobilization** [^79fccd4f]; cancer and its therapies [^231402a5]; pregnancy and estrogen therapy [^5ec128fc] [^5c712281]; inherited thrombophilias (e.g. factor V Leiden) [^878a1b8b]; and acquired states like antiphospholipid syndrome, obesity, and smoking [^56754c1d]. Additional risks include age, central venous catheters, and inflammatory or infectious states [^79fccd4f] [^314a0b2e]. These factors often coexist, **amplifying risk** [^79fccd4f]; identifying and modifying them is central to prevention and management [^8f320f8a].

---

## Virchow's triad: the foundational framework

Virchow's triad explains thrombosis through three interacting components: **endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability** [^2ddc1f91] [^396f8789].

| **Component** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Endothelial injury | Disrupts the antithrombotic endothelium, exposing procoagulant subendothelium and activating platelets and coagulation | - Surgery <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Catheters <br/> - Atherosclerosis <br/> - Inflammation [^79fccd4f] [^4bbe37a0] [^314a0b2e] |
| Stasis | Reduces blood flow, allowing clot formation | - Immobilization <br/> - Bed rest <br/> - Prolonged travel <br/> - Atrial fibrillation <br/> - Venous insufficiency [^79fccd4f] [^839d3476] |
| Hypercoagulability | Increases clotting propensity | - Inherited thrombophilias <br/> - Cancer <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Estrogen therapy <br/> - Obesity <br/> - Smoking [^878a1b8b] [^231402a5] [^5ec128fc] [^5c712281] [^56754c1d] |

## Specific provoking factors

### Inherited thrombophilias

Inherited thrombophilias confer lifelong hypercoagulability; **factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A are common**, while antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiencies carry higher risk [^878a1b8b] [^52622740].

---

### Acquired conditions

- **Cancer**: Tumor-derived tissue factor and other procoagulants, plus surgery/chemotherapy, drive VTE [^231402a5] [^a0ca27bf].
- **Pregnancy and estrogen therapy**: Physiologic hypercoagulability and venous compression increase VTE risk [^5ec128fc] [^5c712281].
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Autoantibodies cause hypercoagulability and recurrent thrombosis [^26f922aa].
- **Obesity and metabolic syndrome**: Promote inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability [^1ae851b7] [^d0272f58].
- **Smoking**: Damages endothelium and increases coagulation [^56754c1d].

---

### Lifestyle and environmental factors

- **Immobilization**: Bed rest, prolonged travel, or sitting cause stasis [^79fccd4f].
- **Surgery and trauma**: Direct endothelial injury and stasis are major triggers [^79fccd4f].
- **Central venous catheters**: Cause endothelial injury and stasis [^79fccd4f].
- **Age**: Risk rises steadily with age due to cumulative exposures and vascular changes [^56754c1d].

---

### Inflammatory and infectious states

Inflammation and infection activate coagulation; **COVID-19** is a notable example with markedly elevated thrombotic risk [^de93d904] [^69d6f1f8].

---

## Interaction of factors

Risk is **multifactorial**; combinations of inherited and acquired factors synergistically increase thrombotic risk [^ff09925a] [^49056637]. For example, factor V Leiden plus oral contraceptives multiplies VTE risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Recognizing provoking factors guides **prevention, duration of anticoagulation, and recurrence risk assessment**. Transient triggers (e.g. surgery) carry lower recurrence risk than persistent factors (e.g. cancer, unprovoked VTE) [^5666845a] [^aec0eb67].

---

Blood clots arise from the interplay of endothelial injury, stasis, and hypercoagulability; **identifying and modifying provoking factors** — such as surgery, cancer, pregnancy, inherited thrombophilia, obesity, and smoking — are essential to prevention and management [^2ddc1f91] [^79fccd4f].

Epidemiological research throughout the last 50 years has provided the long list of risk factors for venous thrombosis that are known today. Although this has advanced our current understanding about the aetiology of thrombosis, it does not give us all the answers: many people have several of these risk factors but never develop thrombosis; others suffer from thrombosis but have none. In this review, we discuss how risk factors for venous thrombosis can be interpreted with use of several epidemiological models. We comment on how to explain why risk factors for first venous thrombosis differ from recurrent venous thrombosis, and use a causal model to better understand risk of first and recurrent venous thrombosis.

Venous thrombosis is a common and complex disease in which genetic risk factors play a major role. At present 6 strong and about 20 weak genetic risk factors are known. Family and twin studies indicate that additional genetic risk factors remain to be identified in order to explain the full extent of the known heritability. This short narrative review discusses several of the approaches which can be taken to identify new risk factors that predispose to venous thrombosis.

Arterial thrombosis is a central pathologic mechanism contributing to myocardial infarction and stroke, together the leading causes of death in developed countries. This article reviews the current state of knowledge concerning the role of inherited variation in hemostatic and inflammatory factor genes in determining the risk of arterial thrombosis/ischemic heart disease. Despite considerable progress in identifying important genetic risk factors underlying predisposition to venous thrombosis, the genetic factors contributing to the risk for arterial thrombosis remain largely unknown. However, the rapid development of powerful new genomic resources should facilitate considerably more sophisticated analyses, leading to novel insight into the molecular pathophysiology of this important set of human diseases.

### Inherited risk factors for venous thrombosis [^52622740]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis occurs as a consequence of genetic and environmental risk factors. Since the discovery of factor V Leiden, the most common genetic risk factor, there has been intense interest in clarifying the roles of genes and the environment with thrombosis risk. The translation of this risk information to clinical practice is a challenging one in the setting of a rapidly expanding knowledge base that includes application of genetic medicine. There are benefits, but also potential harms, of testing for inherited disorders associated with thrombosis. This paper reviews inherited risk factors for thrombosis and discuss clinical applications of testing.

### Mechanistic view of risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^2ddc1f91]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is an episodic disease with an annual incidence of 2 to 3/1000 per year that is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism come in many guises. They fit into an extended version of Virchow's triad and they tilt the hemostatic balance toward clot formation. This can be achieved by decreasing blood flow and lowering oxygen tension, by activating the endothelium, by activating innate or acquired immune responses, by activating blood platelets, or by increasing the number of platelets and red blood cells or modifying the concentrations of pro- and anticoagulant proteins in the blood. In this narrative review we will discuss the known common risk factors within this pathophysiological framework.

### Thrombosis formation on atherosclerotic lesions and plaque rupture [^4bbe37a0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is a silent chronic vascular pathology that is the cause of the majority of cardiovascular ischaemic events. The evolution of vascular disease involves a combination of endothelial dysfunction, extensive lipid deposition in the intima, exacerbated innate and adaptive immune responses, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and remodelling of the extracellular matrix, resulting in the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque. High-risk plaques have a large acellular lipid-rich necrotic core with an overlying thin fibrous cap infiltrated by inflammatory cells and diffuse calcification. The formation of new fragile and leaky vessels that invade the expanding intima contributes to enlarge the necrotic core increasing the vulnerability of the plaque. In addition, biomechanical, haemodynamic and physical factors contribute to plaque destabilization. Upon erosion or rupture, these high-risk lipid-rich vulnerable plaques expose vascular structures or necrotic core components to the circulation, which causes the activation of tissue factor and the subsequent formation of a fibrin monolayer (coagulation cascade) and, concomitantly, the recruitment of circulating platelets and inflammatory cells. The interaction between exposed atherosclerotic plaque components, platelet receptors and coagulation factors eventually leads to platelet activation, aggregation and the subsequent formation of a superimposed thrombus (i.e. atherothrombosis) which may compromise the arterial lumen leading to the presentation of acute ischaemic syndromes. In this review, we will describe the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion along with the main morphological characteristics that predispose to plaque rupture, and discuss the multifaceted mechanisms that drive platelet activation and subsequent thrombus formation. Finally, we will consider the current scientific challenges and future research directions.

### Thrombotic risk factors: basic pathophysiology [^595c7171]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although venous thrombosis has been traditionally associated with stasis and hypercoagulability, arterial thrombosis is mainly associated with heightened platelet reactivity and damage to the vessel wall. Accordingly, classic risk factors for venous and arterial thrombosis are usually considered distinct. Those for the former include cancer, surgery, pregnancy, and estrogens use, whereas risk factors of arterial thrombosis include smoking, hypertension, diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and hyperlipidemia. However, a number of studies have recently challenged this dichotomy, and it is now recognized that venous and arterial thromboses share several risk factors, suggesting a closer link between the two clinical conditions. Typical examples of shared risk factors are age and the metabolic syndrome. This review addresses the mechanism whereby established risk factors increase the risk of venous or arterial thrombosis, or both.

### Common risk factors for both arterial and venous thrombosis [^4cd37e1f]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Arterial and venous thromboses have traditionally been viewed as distinct conditions, with differences in risk factors, pathology and treatment. However, recent epidemiological studies have suggested associations between venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism (myocardial infarction and stroke) and atherosclerosis. While several biological mechanisms might contribute to these associations, common risk factors for both arterial and venous thrombosis probably play the major role. This article summarizes the evidence for shared risk factors (clinical, biochemical and haematological) that supports this conclusion. At a practical level, it is suggested that following routine treatment of venous thromboembolism with a course of anticoagulant drugs, patients should be routinely assessed not only for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism but also for risk of arterial thromboembolism. Appropriate lifestyle advice and medication (including aspirin) should then be considered.

### When to suspect hypercoagulability and how to investigate it [^80304d0e]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the current knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. Because the list of genetic defects that predispose carriers to develop thrombosis has increased significantly in recent years, along with the available assays to test for them, hypercoagulability has been a subject of much discussion. This review highlights the issues on hypercoagulability that pathologists who are not specialists in coagulation should be familiar with, in order to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to the diagnosis of this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care to patients at risk.

### Elevated hemostatic factor levels as potential risk factors for thrombosis [^2280e097]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the state of the art relating to elevated hemostatic factor levels as a potential risk factor for thrombosis, as reflected by the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, and to make recommendations for the use of specific measurements of hemostatic factor levels in the assessment of thrombotic risk in individual patients.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature, primarily from the last 10 years.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

After an initial assessment of the literature, key points were identified. Experts were assigned to do an in-depth review of the literature and to prepare a summary of their findings and recommendations. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference XXXVI: Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia prior to the conference. Each of the key points and associated recommendations was then presented for discussion at the conference. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of the 27 experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on 8 recommendations concerning the use of hemostatic factor levels in the assessment of thrombotic risk in individual patients. Detailed discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is presented in the article. This is an evolving area of research. While routine use of factor level measurements is not recommended, improvements in assay methodology and further clinical studies may change these recommendations in the future.

### Arterial thrombosis – insidious, unpredictable and deadly [^49bb2918]. Nature Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The formation of blood clots — thrombosis — at sites of atherosclerotic plaque rupture is a major clinical problem despite ongoing improvements in antithrombotic therapy. Progress in identifying the pathogenic mechanisms regulating arterial thrombosis has led to the development of newer therapeutics, and there is general anticipation that these treatments will have greater efficacy and improved safety. However, major advances in this field require the identification of specific risk factors for arterial thrombosis in affected individuals and a rethink of the 'one size fits all' approach to antithrombotic therapy.

### Arterial thrombus formation in cardiovascular disease [^fb380977]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis is complex and dynamic. Unlike venous thrombi, arterial thrombi typically form under conditions of high blood flow and are mainly composed of platelet aggregates, giving them the appearance of 'white clots'. Strong evidence suggests that arterial thrombi originate as a consequence of an injured atherosclerotic plaque, and that their formation involves the release of prothrombotic material (such as tissue factor), platelet aggregation, and platelet adhesion to the vascular wall. The initially labile platelet plaque is then stabilized by insoluble fibrin produced upon activation of the coagulation cascade. Inherited genetic factors (gene polymorphisms) and acquired predisposing conditions (such as the concentration and activity of clotting factors) can influence both the composition and the size of an arterial thrombus. Further research is needed to elucidate the functions of blood coagulation proteins and cellular elements that are critical to the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis. This Review explains mechanisms of pathological arterial thrombus formation and discusses genetic and acquired risk factors of atherothrombosis.

### Novel risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^704868ba]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

VTE can be considered as a multicausal disease involving various inherited and acquired prothrombotic conditions. Although greater emphasis has classically been given to traditional thrombophilic risk factors, there is increasing recognition of less typical precipitating conditions and events. In this article, the authors focus on the most promising, persistent, and potentially treatable novel risk factors.

### Acquired thrombotic risk factors in the critical care setting [^02a5b50a]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired thrombotic risk factors include a variety of noninherited clinical conditions that can predispose an individual to an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. For patients in a critical care setting, certain acquired risk factors represent chronic conditions that the patients may have had before the current acute illness (e.g., malignancy, various cardiovascular risk factors, certain medications), whereas others may be directly related to the reason the patient is in an intensive care unit or the patient's management there (e.g., postoperative state, trauma, indwelling vascular access, certain medications). Optimal thromboprophylactic strategies depend on individual patient risk profiles including an assessment of the specific clinical setting. Treatment for patients with acquired thrombotic risk factors includes anticoagulant therapy and, if possible, resolution of the acquired risk factor(s). Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia represents a unique clinical situation in which all sources of heparin must be discontinued and the patient started on an alternative anticoagulant (e.g., a direct thrombin inhibitor) in the acute setting. The duration of anticoagulant therapy would vary depending on the specific clinical setting.

### Coagulation and atherothrombotic disease [^50fa8378]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Atherothrombotic disease arises secondary to a complex gene-environment interaction. In the initial stages, the condition is clinically silent but with more advanced disease, an occlusive thrombus is formed resulting in the classical clinical manifestations. Both environmental factors and genetic variations in elements of the clotting cascade influence thrombosis risk by inducing quantitative and qualitative changes in the mature protein, which may affect the final structure of the clot and determine its resistance to lysis. Understanding the fine details of gene-environment interactions in relation to thrombus formation will help to shed more light on disease pathogenesis. Consequently, this will allow the development of more efficacious treatment strategies and will also help to identify subjects at risk, thereby enabling the introduction of early preventative measures.

### Mechanisms of thrombosis in cancer [^dba83487]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer are at high risk of developing thrombosis. The pathogenesis of blood coagulation activation in cancer patients is complex involves both clinical and biological factors. The thrombotic risk varies according to the type of malignancy and its disease stage, and is increased by concomitant patient-related thrombotic risk factors (i.e. advanced age, infection, heart disease). In addition, the tumor cell-specific prothrombotic properties and the host cell inflammatory response dramatically contribute to the risk of thrombosis in these patients. The current development of risk assessment models to predict thrombosis in cancer is important for identifying high-risk patients and predispose the adequate preventive measures. In this review we provide an overview of the principal mechanisms of thrombosis in cancer, including clinical and biological risk factors, and a summary of risk assessment tools to predict thrombosis in the single patient.

### Cardiovascular risk factors associated with venous thromboembolism [^3a66a97e]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), consisting of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major clinical burden. Globally, there are about 10 million cases every year, and it is the third leading vascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke. Pulmonary embolism is a manifestation of VTE and is responsible for most VTE deaths. In recent years, efforts to prevent VTE have broadened from focusing mainly on hospital-based risk factors (eg, recent prior surgery, cancer, and congestive heart failure) toward adoption of heart-healthy lifestyles. This perspective has challenged traditional views of venous and arterial thrombosis as distinct pathologies, encouraging prevention strategies that concomitantly address VTE and arterial thrombosis. However, there is uncertainty about the extent to which venous and arterial thrombosis share cardiovascular risk factors, as studies have reported conflicting findings. Interpretation has been complicated by the use of retrospective case-control designs, limited statistical power, and/or inability to compare VTE and arterial disease outcomes within the same cohorts.,

Analyzing data from more than 1.1 million participants in 76 prospective studies, we investigated associations of several established cardiovascular risk factors with the incidence of VTE outcomes. We aimed to address 2 principal questions: What are the associations of major cardiovascular risk factors with VTE outcomes (including subtypes)? How do these associations compare with those for coronary heart disease (CHD), a manifestation of arterial thrombotic disease?

### Pathophysiology of venous thrombosis [^f8f088df]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Using Virchow's triad as framework, it is clear that alterations in any of its components (blood composition, the vessel wall, and blood flow) can influence the propensity for the development of venous thromboembolism. Each can also influence the others in ways that enhance or reduce thrombotic propensity. While past work has concentrated on blood components that influence thrombogenicity, their influences generally are manifest only after the thrombotic process has begun, and it is initiation of thrombosis on the vessel wall that is the least well understood. This brief review attempts to link risk factors such as stasis and cancer to the mechanisms that initiate thrombosis.

### Chasing clot: thrombophilic States and the interventionalist [^49056637]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Thrombophilia is a critical factor in a majority of cases of idiopathic venous thromboembolism and may play a role in arterial thrombotic disease. The more frequently occurring genetic disorders impose a modest increased risk for thromboembolic events. Some of the less common ones are associated with much greater frequency of pathologic clot formation. Most thrombotic episodes occur with additive predisposing risks, namely multiple inherited disorders or concurrent acquired prothrombotic factors. Understanding these disorders is important for interventional radiologists, who frequently treat affected patients. This article reviews the disorders and prevalence of thrombophilia and provides guidelines for handling such cases.

7 CONCLUSION

The predictive ability of the currently available models is limited and the current guidelines advise to estimate a patient's recurrence risk based only on whether or not the first event was provoked; however, the definition of provoked/unprovoked determines the prediction of the respective associated risks but varies strongly. Furthermore, risks of recurrence vary according to presence of well‐described risk factors and a much more refined risk estimation is possible than the current binary stratification. Properly conducted controlled studies into development of new models are needed that take the following into account: (a) reporting of absolute risks next to C‐statistic, (b) applicable to all patients, and (c) no discontinuation of anticoagulation necessary. This way, by determining individual risk profiles for both recurrent thrombosis and bleeding risk, personalized treatment is possible, by which occurrence of both conditions will be minimized.

### Assessment of hemostatic risk factors in predicting arterial thrombotic events [^26f922aa]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Arterial thrombosis results from endovascular injury and, to a lesser extent, alterations in hemostatic equilibrium. Although multiple hereditary and acquired hemostatic risk factors have been described in the pathophysiology of venous thrombosis, the degree and type of abnormalities that contribute to arterial thrombosis are less well understood. Endothelial cell injury with the elaboration of proinflammatory mediators stimulates the process of arterial thrombosis. Although this is most often the result of endovascular injury attributable to atherosclerotic disease, other disease states can elicit a similar response as well. Similarly, once thrombosis has been initiated, variations in the activity of coagulation proteins and endogenous anticoagulants, as well as the kinetics of platelet aggregation, may alter the effectiveness of thrombus formation. Epidemiological studies have identified several acquired or inherited states that may result in endothelial damage or altered hemostatic equilibrium, thereby predisposing patients to arterial thrombosis. These include hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated C-reactive protein, antiphospholipid antibodies, elevated fibrinogen, Factor VII, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), hereditary thrombophilias, and platelet hyper-reactivity. This review explores our present understanding of these risk factors in the development of arterial thrombotic events. At present, the literature supports a role for hyperhomocysteinemia, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated fibrinogen as risk factors for arterial thrombosis. Similarly, the literature suggests that lupus anticoagulants and, to a lesser extent, elevated titers of cardiolipin IgG antibodies predispose to arterial vascular events. In certain subsets of patients, including those with concomitant cardiac risk factors, < 55 years of age, and women, hereditary thrombophilias such as carriership of the factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutations may confer a higher risk of arterial thrombosis. However, the data on Factor VII, PAI-1, and platelet receptor polymorphisms are contradictory or lacking.

### Pregnancy and thrombotic risk [^5ec128fc]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pregnancy increases the risk of thrombosis three-fold to four-fold. The main reason for the increased risk is hypercoagulability, which has likely evolved to protect women against the bleeding challenges associated with miscarriage and childbirth. The hypercoagulability of pregnancy is present as early as the first trimester and so is the increased risk of thrombosis. Factors that further increase the risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy include a history of thrombosis, inherited and acquired thrombophilia, certain medical conditions, and complications of pregnancy and childbirth. Candidates for anticoagulation are women with a current thrombosis, a history of thrombosis, thrombophilia, and a history of poor pregnancy outcome, or risk factors for postpartum thrombosis. For fetal reasons, the preferred agents for anticoagulation in pregnancy are heparins. There are no large trials of anticoagulation in pregnancy and recommendations are based on case series and the opinion of experts. Nonetheless, anticoagulation is believed to improve the outcome of pregnancy for women at risk.

### The thrombophilias: well-defined risk factors with uncertain therapeutic implications [^94e31365]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. The first step in the diagnostic approach to all patients with venous thrombosis consists of a careful history and physical examination combined with routine laboratory testing to characterize the severity of the thrombotic condition and determine the presence of any of the acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The second step is to consider screening for the causes of hereditary and acquired thrombophilia in selected subsets of patients. The selection of patients for testing, the choice of tests to perform, and the timing of the testing are important and challenging issues to consider. Routine testing would be warranted if the identification of abnormalities led to an alteration in the type or duration of initial anticoagulant therapy or the use of long-term prophylactic anticoagulation. The available data, however, do not yet indicate that most patients with defined thrombophilic states should be managed any differently than patients without identifiable abnormalities. On the basis of relative prevalences of the various thrombophilias, patients can be classified as "strongly" or "weakly" thrombophilic depending on their thrombotic histories. Management considerations and guidelines are offered for patients who are found to have one or more defined abnormalities, hereditary or otherwise. The future identification of additional laboratory abnormalities predisposing patients to thrombosis, coupled with prospective clinical trials, should enable us to better identify patients at high risk for recurrence who will benefit from prolonged anticoagulant prophylaxis.

### Clotting problems: diagnosis and management of underlying coagulopathies [^5af5c15a]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Vessel wall injury, stasis, and blood hypercoagulable state are major predisposing factors of thrombosis. Although, a procoagulable factor is found in half of patients with venous thromboembolism, relatively little is known about coagulopathies that predispose to arterial thromboembolism or unexplained arterial revascularization thrombosis. Those hypercoagulable states can be inherited or acquired and related to either an increase of a procoagulable factor or a decrease of an anticoagulation agent. However, most thrombotic episodes seem to occur with additive combination of acquired and inherited predisposing factors. Therefore, controversy exists as to which patients and family members to test for thrombophilia and which patients to treat with life-long anticoagulation. The aim of this review is to provide a practical overview with guidelines for detecting, and treatment of, the principal underlying coagulopathies that a vascular surgeon should be aware of in his/her practice and for the care of patients with vascular disease.

### Interplay between platelets and coagulation: from protective haemostasis to pathological arterial thrombosis [^d902d57f]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Haemostasis refers to the physiological process aimed at repairing vessel injury and preventing bleeding. It involves four interlinked stages culminating in the formation of a platelet-fibrin haemostatic plug that is eventually dissolved once the vessel heals. In contrast, arterial thrombosis is a pathological condition resulting from atheroma exposure, triggering the formation of a platelet-rich thrombus that may obstruct blood flow, leading to the clinical manifestations of ischaemic cardiovascular disease. The following review will provide a comprehensive overview of the finely regulated endogenous antithrombotic mechanisms responsible for maintaining the haemostatic balance and preventing intravascular thrombosis. Thereafter, it will further detail the different stages and mechanisms governing the intricate interplay between the vessel, platelets, and the coagulation cascade in haemostasis, highlighting the most recent advances in platelet biology and function, to further elucidate the differential traits and players contributing to pathological arterial thrombus growth. The review will also delve into the impact of emerging cardiovascular risk factors on tilting the haemostatic balance towards a pro-thrombotic state, thereby increasing the patient's vulnerability to thrombotic events. Finally, it will underscore the importance of early screening for subclinical atherosclerosis through advanced imaging technologies capable of quantifying plaque burden and metabolic activity since they may set the stage for an increased thrombotic risk. Implementing proactive interventions to halt atherosclerosis progression or inducing its regression at early stages is crucial for preserving haemostasis and reducing the likelihood of ischaemic atherothrombotic disease.

### Hypercoagulability: too many tests, too much conflicting data [^134c2d66]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify hereditary and acquired risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. The clinician is faced with an ever-growing number of laboratory tests that can be ordered in such patients, and there is considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be utilized in patient management. Some have argued that widespread testing of thrombosis patients for prothrombotic abnormalities such as the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has been prematurely adopted into clinical practice as there are few data that their identification leads to improved clinical outcomes. Dr. Rosendaal provides an overview of the epidemiology of venous thrombosis with an emphasis on hereditary and acquired risk factors. The presentation will include information obtained from properly designed case-control studies as well as family studies. While some have suggested treatment strategies for managing patients with hereditary thrombophilia with prior thrombotic events or for managing patients undergoing procedures associated with increased thrombotic risk, clinical decision making is complicated by the need to assess the risk of recurrence and the likely benefit of prolonged anticoagulation versus the associated bleeding risk. Drs. Bauer, Heit, and Rosendaal discuss their approaches to patient management. Case presentations are used to illustrate the impact of laboratory test results on decisions.

### Inflammation and infections as risk factors for ischemic stroke [^314a0b2e]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory processes have fundamental roles in stroke in both the etiology of ischemic cerebrovascular disease and the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. We summarize clinical data on infection and inflammation as risk or trigger factors for human stroke and investigate current evidence for the hypothesis of a functional interrelation between traditional risk factors, genetic predisposition, and infection/inflammation in stroke pathogenesis.

Summary Of Review

Several traditional vascular risk factors are associated with proinflammatory alterations, including leukocyte activation, and predispose cerebral vasculature to thrombogenesis on inflammatory stimulation. Furthermore, accumulation of inflammatory cells, mainly monocytes/macrophages, within the vascular wall starts early during atherogenesis. During later disease stages, their activation can lead to plaque rupture and thrombus formation, increasing stroke risk. Inflammatory markers (eg, leukocytes, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) are independent predictors of ischemic stroke. Chronic infections (eg, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori) were found to increase the risk of stroke; however, study results are at variance, residual confounding is not excluded, and causality is not established at present. In case-control studies, acute infection within the preceding week was a trigger factor for ischemic stroke. Acute and exacerbating chronic infection may act by activating coagulation and chronic infections and may contribute to atherogenesis. Genetic predisposition of the inflammatory host response may be an important codeterminant for atherogenesis and stroke risk.

Conclusions

Inflammation contributes to stroke risk via various interrelated mechanisms. Infectious diseases, traditional risk factors, and genetic susceptibility may cooperate in stimulating inflammatory pathways. Final proof of a causal role of infectious/inflammatory mechanisms in stroke pathogenesis is still lacking and will require interventional studies.

### Advances in understanding pathogenic mechanisms of thrombophilic disorders [^9990c969]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a major medical problem, annually affecting 1 in 1000 individuals. It is a typical multifactorial disease, involving both genetic and circumstantial risk factors that affect a delicate balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant forces. In the last 50 years, the molecular basis of blood coagulation and the anticoagulant systems that control it have been elucidated. This has laid the foundation for discoveries of both common and rare genetic traits that tip the natural balance in favor of coagulation, with a resulting lifelong increased risk of venous thrombosis. Multiple mutations in the genes for anticoagulant proteins such as antithrombin, protein C, and protein S have been identified and constitute important risk factors. Two single mutations in the genes for coagulation factor V (FV Leiden) and prothrombin (20210G > A), resulting from approximately 20,000-year-old mutations with subsequent founder effects, are common in the general population and constitute major genetic risk factors for thrombosis. In celebration of the 50-year anniversary of the American Society of Hematology, this invited review highlights discoveries that have contributed to our present understanding of the systems that control blood coagulation and the genetic factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis.

### Understanding your risk for blood clots with cancer… [^1c66d73e]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- While everyone is at risk for developing a blood clot, having cancer and some of its treatments increase the risk
- Certain types of cancer and treatments that include hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and catheters are associated with increased risk for blood clots
- Know the signs and symptoms of blood clots and discuss your risk with your cancer doctor. Overview If you currently have cancer or are being treated for cancer, it is important to know that you are at increased risk for developing a blood clot. The good news, though, is blood clots are often preventable and treatable. While everyone is at risk for developing a blood clot, having cancer and some of its treatments increase the risk for a blood clot. Learn other facts about blood clots below.

Cancers and treatments that can increase risk Some cancers pose a greater risk for blood clots, including cancers involving the pancreas, stomach, brain, lungs, uterus, ovaries, and kidneys. Certain blood cancers, such as lymphoma and myeloma, also increase risk. Treatments for these cancers involving hospitalization, surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and catheters may also increase your risk for blood clots. Several other factors may also increase the risk for a blood clot in a person with cancer or being treated for cancer, such as.
- A previous blood clot
- An inherited blood clotting disorder
- Family history of blood clots or inherited clotting disorder
- Hospitalization for illness or major surgery, particularly those involving the pelvis, abdomen, hip, or knee
- Broken bone or severe muscle injury
- Severe physical trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident
- Certain long-term medical conditions, such as heart and lung diseases or diabetes
- Sitting too long, such as traveling for more than 4 hours, especially with legs crossed
- Other causes of immobility, such as extended bedrest
- Overweight or obesity
- Smoking. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the signs or symptoms of a possible PE. Talk with your cancer doctor and other healthcare providers about factors that might increase your risk for a blood clot. Let them know if you or anyone else in your family has ever had a blood clot.

### Inherited risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^878a1b8b]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has important heritable components. In the past 20 years, knowledge in this field has greatly increased with the identification of a number of gene variants causing hypercoagulability. The two main mechanisms are loss-of-function of anticoagulant proteins and gain-of-function of procoagulants, the latter owing to increased synthesis or impaired downregulation of a normal protein or, more rarely, to synthesis of a functionally hyperactive molecule. Diagnosis of thrombophilia is useful to determine the causes of VTE, recognizing that this multifactorial disease can also be influenced by various acquired factors including cancer, surgery, trauma, prolonged immobilization, or reproduction-associated risk factors. Diagnosis of inherited thrombophilia rarely affects the acute or long-term management of VTE. However, the risk of recurrent VTE is increased in anticoagulant-deficient patients and in homozygotes for gain-of-function mutations. Screening for inherited thrombophilia in thrombosis-free individuals is indicated only for relatives of a proband who is anticoagulant-deficient or has a family history of VTE. In families with thrombophilia and VTE, primary antithrombotic prophylaxis during risk situations lowers the rate of incident VTE. In this Review, we discuss the main causes of inherited thrombophilia, the associated clinical manifestations, and the implications for antithrombotic prophylaxis in the affected individuals.

### Understanding haemorrhagic risk following thrombolytic therapy in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk pulmonary embolism: a hypothesis paper [^870aa0b8]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Explaining the higher risk of bleeding for patients with thrombolysis in PE Compared with MI?

With identical risk factors, why are patients with PE more prone to adverse bleeding events? And if patients with PE are at higher risk of bleeding, is it reasonable to treat two very different diseases in the same way?

We cannot overemphasise the major difference in the pathophysiology of clot formation, and clot burden between PE and MI. The thrombus composition in PE and deep venous thrombosis consists mainly of fibrin and a varying degree of platelets (red clot). These venous thrombi are often a consequence of either intrinsic factors (surgery, cancer, inherited hypercoagulable states) or mechanisms that predispose the patient to the formation of venous thrombosis as described by Virchow's triad. The arterial thrombus in MI has a different pathogenesis. It is triggered by an underlying atherosclerotic plaque rupture in the context of turbulent flow that induces a shear stress on arterial wall. This stimulates arterial inflammation, which enhances platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall, and impairs activation of coagulation factors that cannot aggregate around the formed clot (white clot). The difference in D-dimer levels (a fibrin degradation product), which are much higher in patients with PE compared with patients with MI, supports this mechanistic difference, but also emphasises the greater activation of the fibrinolytic cascade in patients with PE.

### Risk and risk factors associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism following surgery in patients with history of venous thromboembolism [^81706c1b]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) following surgery in patients with a history of VTE?

Findings

In this longitudinal follow-up cohort study, 3741 patients with a history of VTE were evaluated for the development of recurrence and 15.5% underwent surgery. Cumulative incidences of VTE recurrence were 2.1% at 1 month, 3.3% at 3 months, and 4.6% at 6 months; in addition to surgery type (eg, cancer-related surgery), male sex and factor V Leiden mutation were associated with a higher risk of recurrence.

Meaning

Patients with a history of VTE who undergo surgery may have a high recurrence risk, a finding that challenges the current thromboprophylactic strategy for these patients.

### Management of hereditary hypercoagulable disorders [^7b626443]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical management of individuals with hereditary hypercoaguable disorders has evolved from initial broad recommendations of lifelong anticoagulation after first event of venous thromboembolism to a more intricate individualized risk-benefit analysis as studies have begun to delineate the complexity of interactions of acquired and hereditary factors which determine the predilection to thrombosis. The contribution of thrombophilic disorders to risk of thrombotic complications of pregnancy, organ transplantation, central venous catheter and dialysis access placement have been increasingly recognized. The risk of thrombosis must be weighed against risk of long-term anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism. Thrombophilia screening in select populations may enhance outcome.

### Exploring opportunities for primary prevention of unprovoked venous thromboembolism: ready for prime time? [^7344e1b0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major health burden. Annually in the United States there are an estimated 857 000 deaths from deep vein thrombosis, 370 000 from pulmonary embolisms, and 52 000 with VTE among the listed causes of death. 1 The lifetime VTE risk is 1 in 12 US adults. 2 Care of each VTE costs $18 000 to $23 000, 3 for $7 to $10 billion in US total annual cost.

Depending on the population and definition, 4 approximately one half to two thirds of VTEs have strong triggering or persistent risk factors and are classified as "provoked". 1 The remaining one third to one half are classified as "unprovoked", as they occur without warning or identifiable causes, typically outside of a medical setting. Major identified causes of VTE include inherited traits (eg, thrombophilias, such as factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutation), acquired long‐term risk factors (eg, relative immobility, cancer, inflammatory conditions, obesity), and acute triggers (eg, hospitalization, surgery, immobilization, pregnancy/puerperium, long distance travel). 5, 6 Lifestyle factors have generally been considered minor contributors to VTE.

### Managing thromboembolic risk in patients with hereditary and acquired thrombophilias [^aec0eb67]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

While we are now able to diagnose inherited thrombophilias in a substantial number of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the initial hope that their presence would inform recurrence risk and thus decisions on anticoagulation duration has largely been disappointing. Indeed, the presence or absence of transient provoking risk factors has proven to be the most important determinant of VTE recurrence risk. Thus, particular attention to transient acquired risk factors for VTE remains paramount, as they have generally been shown to carry more prognostic weight than inherited thrombophilias. The presence of other acquired risk factors may require additional management considerations, whether pertaining to anticoagulant choice, as in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or to addressing a new predisposing medical condition, as in malignancy. Antithrombin deficiency or the presence of ≥ 1 thrombophilic defect may be exceptions that can have a role in prognostication; however, as illustrated in this review through several case vignettes, interpretation and clinical application of the results of inherited thrombophilia testing is nuanced. We have chosen to focus on cases in which patients have been identified as having thrombophilic defects rather than the indications for undertaking testing in the first place or the extent of investigation. Management decisions in such cases ultimately hinge on individualized consideration of the benefits and risks of anticoagulation along with patient preference rather than on an algorithmic pathway based on thrombophilia status.

### Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy: how strong a risk factor for venous thromboembolism? [^5c712281]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Exogenous hormone therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), cause blood hypercoagulability and are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). There is controversy on how strong this "provoking" risk factor is, and how other risk factors may synergise VTE risk. We aim to review the latest literature on the risk of initial and recurrent VTE with COC and HRT use to provide guidance for decision-making about duration of anticoagulation, and guide future research efforts.

### Hereditary thrombophilia and venous thromboembolism: critical evaluation of the clinical implications of screening [^ef3d175d]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a complex disease resulting from the interactions of several risk factors from diverse origins: genetic, environmental and behavioral. Numerous studies have evidenced an association between genetic thrombophilia defects and venous thromboembolism. However, the clinical relevance of genetic thrombophilia to recurrent venous thromboembolism is not clear and the risks of long-term anticoagulant treatment usually outweigh any benefits of hereditary thrombophilia screening. Therefore, in everyday clinical practice (outside of research protocols) hereditary thrombophilia screening should be performed only in cases where such testing is likely to influence patient management.

### Venous thrombosis unchained: pandora's box of noninflammatory mechanisms [^17de99e4]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represents a complex pathological process extending far beyond inflammatory mechanisms. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted noninflammatory mechanisms underlying thrombosis development, integrating insights from molecular, physiological, and systemic levels. Blood flow dynamics and endothelial function are known to be critical regulators of thrombus development. Platelets and microparticles play important roles beyond conventional inflammatory responses, actively contributing to thrombus formation through intricate molecular interactions. Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with thrombotic risk, demonstrating the complex interplay between metabolic disorders and DVT. Certain genetic mutations also predispose individuals to venous thrombosis. Emerging research has discovered the essential role of previously underappreciated factors such as products of gut microbiota or endothelial glycocalyx modifications. Molecular regulators such as microRNAs and hormonal disbalance further illustrate the complex mechanisms of venous thrombosis. Interestingly, circadian rhythms exhibit certain influence on thrombotic potential, introducing chronobiology as an emerging variable affecting the risk of thrombosis. On the basis of these insights, future therapeutic strategies may include various interventions targeting or at least considering metabolic, molecular, and systemic noninflammatory factors. Potential approaches include personalized risk stratification, microbiome modulation, endothelial protection approaches, and chronotherapy-based therapeutic modalities, which would ensure more efficient and safe thrombosis management.

Cardiomyopathy and LV thrombus/thromboembolism risk — incidence and risk factors: Patients with significant LV dilation and dysfunction, whether ischemic or nonischemic, are at increased risk for developing LV thrombus, whereas LV thrombus is unusual with normal wall motion except in endomyocardial fibrosis. In dilated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic events are reported to be in the range of 1.7% to 18%. Predisposing factors include extensive regional wall motion abnormalities, very dilated left ventricles, low cardiac output with stagnation, significant slow swirling streaks within the left ventricle (spontaneous echo contrast), atrial fibrillation, and advanced apical hypertrophy cardiomyopathy with apical outpouching.

### Fibrosis, atrial fibrillation and stroke: clinical updates and emerging mechanistic models [^ad182b35]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

The current paradigm of stroke risk assessment and mitigation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is centred around clinical risk factors which, in the presence of AF, lead to thrombus formation. The mechanisms by which these clinical risk factors lead to thromboembolism, including any role played by atrial fibrosis, are not understood. In patients who had embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), the problem is compounded by the absence of AF in a majority of patients despite long-term monitoring. Atrial fibrosis has emerged as a unifying mechanism that independently provides a substrate for arrhythmia and thrombus formation. Fibrosis-based computational models of AF initiation and maintenance promise to identify therapeutic targets in catheter ablation. In ESUS, fibrosis is also increasingly recognised as a major risk factor, but the underlying mechanism of this correlation is unclear. Simulations have uncovered potential vulnerability to arrhythmia induction in patients who had ESUS. Likewise, computational models of fluid dynamics representing blood flow in the left atrium and left atrium appendage have improved our understanding of thrombus formation, in particular left atrium appendage shapes and blood flow changes influenced by atrial remodelling. Multiscale modelling of blood flow dynamics based on structural fibrotic and morphological changes with associated cellular and tissue electrical remodelling leading to electromechanical abnormalities holds tremendous promise in providing a mechanistic understanding of the clinical problem of thromboembolisation. We present a review of clinical knowledge alongside computational modelling frameworks and conclude with a vision of a future paradigm integrating simulations in formulating personalised treatment plans for each patient.

### Proteomic insights into modifiable risk of venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular comorbidities [^8f320f8a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects 1 to 2 individuals per 1000 in Europe and the United States and has been ranked at the top among vascular diseases with regard to incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Although multifactorial in etiology, the risk of VTE has been fortunately found to be modifiable. Mainly for unprovoked VTE, reducing obesity and adopting a healthy lifestyle appear to be associated with a lower risk of VTE. Even though the classic Virchow triad theory may help clarify underlying mechanisms behind these associations, data are scarce to illuminate the molecular pathways linking these modifiable factors to VTE. Given that blood proteins have been revealed in thrombosis and coagulation and may be altered by obesity and lifestyle factors, we hypothesize that the modifiable risk of VTE may be partly attributed to changes in proteomic features. A clear and comprehensive appraisal of these pathways not only benefits the understanding of the pathogenesis of VTE but also provides evidence support for better disease prevention and management in a precision manner.

### Cancer associated thrombosis: risk factors and outcomes [^d4b57351]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis of the leg and pulmonary embolism are frequent diseases and cancer is one of their most important risk factors. Patients with cancer also have a higher prevalence of venous thrombosis located in other parts than in the legs and/or in unusual sites including upper extremity, splanchnic or cerebral veins. Cancer also affects the risk of arterial thrombotic events particularly in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor recipients. Several risk factors need to interact to trigger thrombosis. In addition to common risk factors such as surgery, hospitalisation, infection and genetic coagulation disorders, the thrombotic risk is also driven and modified by cancer-specific factors including type, histology, and stage of the malignancy, cancer treatment and certain biomarkers. A venous thrombotic event in a cancer patient has serious consequences as the risk of recurrent thrombosis, the risk of bleeding during anticoagulation and hospitalisation rates are all increased. Survival of cancer patients with thrombosis is worse compared to that of cancer patients without thrombosis, and thrombosis is a leading direct cause of death in cancer patients.

6 CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

This systematic review summarizes current knowledge on risk factors and predictors for VTE in people with ischemic stroke. Most of the identified factors, including the biomarkers, can easily be obtained in clinical practice, which is beneficial in the context of risk prediction model development and implementation. However, because there were few high‐quality studies on each factor, future research should also focus on further identification and confirmation of clinical risk factors and biomarkers that can improve patient stratification and guide the development of successful risk prediction models.

### Interaction of hemostatic genetics with hormone therapy: new insights to explain arterial thrombosis in postmenopausal women [^8da681bb]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Genetic variants of key hemostatic mediators increasingly have been proposed as risk factors for atherothrombosis. The Hormone and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study group recently reported that the initiation of estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women with known coronary heart disease is associated with an early increase in cardiovascular events. A putative genetic susceptibility factor has been proposed a potential mediator of this increased event risk. This review outlines the recent literature to support the premise for this important proposal. Genetic profiling has great potential to improve the safety and efficacy of individualized pharmacotherapy in postmenopausal women and other at-risk populations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Thrombophilia testing for individuals with a family history of VTE and/or family history of thrombophilia to prevent VTE associated with exposure to minor risk factors

For individuals with a family history of VTE and thrombophilia, should selective thrombophilia testing be performed to guide the use of thromboprophylaxis for a minor provoking risk factor?

Recommendation 11

For individuals with a family history of VTE and known FVL or PGM (low-risk thrombophilia) who have a minor provoking risk factor for VTE (eg, immobility or minor injury, illness, or infection), the ASH guideline panel suggests not testing for the known familial thrombophilia to guide thromboprophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Background and Objectives

Altered levels of coagulation factors have been included among the abnormalities that may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in otherwise healthy subjects.

Information Sources

According to the studies that have been carried to test this hypothesis only elevated levels of factor VIII and fibrinogen emerged as independent risk factors for VTE.

State Of The Art and Perspectives

Although some data indicate that elevated levels of factor XI or IX are also determinants for VTE, this awaits confirmation.

### Risk stratification strategies for cancer-associated thrombosis: an update [^749e2602]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) vary substantially between cancer patients. Multiple clinical risk factors including primary site of cancer and systemic therapy, and biomarkers including leukocyte and platelet counts and tissue factor are associated with increased risk of VTE. However, risk cannot be reliably predicted based on single risk factors or biomarkers. New American Society of Clinical Guidelines recommend that patients with cancer be assessed for VTE risk at the time of chemotherapy initiation and periodically thereafter. This narrative review provides an update on risk stratification approaches including a validated Risk Score. Potential applications of risk assessment including targeted thromboprophylaxis are outlined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

### Factor V Leiden does not modify the phenotype of acute coronary syndrome or the extent of myocardial necrosis [^575f6acd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. ACS is generally subdivided in non–ST‐segment–elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE‐ACS) and ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Nearly all cases of ACS are caused by the slowly progressive process of atherosclerosis, followed by an acute rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent thrombus formation. It is, however, unknown why in some cases plaque rupture leads to high thrombotic burden with total artery occlusion leading to STEMI, whereas in the setting of NSTE‐ACS, plaque rupture is usually associated with limited and nonobstructive thrombus.

Whereas hereditary thrombophilic defects such as factor V Leiden predisposes to ≈4‐fold higher risk of venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis is considered less likely to be influenced by hereditary thrombophilic defects. Platelet aggregation seems to be more important in the pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis. In several meta‐analyses, factor V Leiden showed only weak, if any, association with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. This may be because the plaque rupture itself is generally caused by atherosclerosis, which is mainly driven by traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Moreover, these and other acquired risk factors for arterial thrombosis may overrule the impact of hereditary thrombophilic defects. Nevertheless, coagulation activation is a pivotal component of thrombus formation and stabilization at the site of vascular injury following platelet aggregation. Hence, thrombophilic conditions such as factor V Leiden may play a more important role in determining the phenotype rather than the incidence of ACS, that is, STEMI versus NSTE‐ACS, because patients with a factor V Leiden may have higher thrombus formation at the site of plaque rupture and therefore more often STEMI. Moreover, patients with STEMI with factor V Leiden may have higher levels of myocardial necrosis biomarkers attributable to higher thrombus burden. On the other hand, a few studies reported the opposite, that is, higher prevalence of factor V Leiden in patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive (< 50% stenosis) epicardial coronary arteries (MINOCA) compared with patients with one or more flow‐limiting epicardial coronary stenosis.

In the current study we assess whether factor V Leiden mutation modifies the risk of STEMI compared with NSTE‐ACS, and whether patients with STEMI carrying this thrombophilic defect have more myocardial necrosis based on the levels of peak creatine kinase‐myocardial band (CK‐MB) and high‐sensitivity troponin (hs‐troponin).

### Thrombosis and cancer [^231402a5]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can be associated with significant morbidity. Thrombosis and cancer are linked by numerous pathophysiological mechanisms; the frequency of VTE and the recurrence rate are increased in the cancer population in comparison with other patient groups. VTE is the second most common cause of death in patients with cancer, but can also be the initial presenting complaint in patients with an occult malignancy. Risk factors for cancer-related VTE include tumour type, surgery, chemotherapy and the use of central venous catheters; predictors of VTE for individuals are only now beginning to emerge. Patients with cancer who develop symptomatic VTE during chemotherapy are at a greater risk of early mortality than those without VTE. The apparent impact of VTE on early mortality in patients with cancer raises the question of whether anticoagulation might improve long-term survival in this population, by direct tumour biology-modifying mechanisms. There are widely published guidelines that highlight the benefits of effective VTE strategies in patients with cancer. In partnership with the patient and their carers, the clinical team can improve patient outcomes with optimal risk assessment and concordance with national and international guidelines in the prophylaxis and treatment of VTE.

### Risk of future arterial cardiovascular events in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism [^ffc6cdbd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Venous and arterial thromboses have traditionally been considered distinct pathophysiologic entities. However, the two disorders have many features in common, and there is evidence that persons with venous thrombosis may be at greater risk for arterial events. The pathogenesis of both disorders includes endothelial injury, platelet activation, elevated levels of intrinsic clotting factors and inflammatory markers, increased fibrinogen, and impaired fibrinolysis. In addition, older age, obesity, dyslipidemia, and smoking predispose to both venous and arterial thrombosis. While the evidence that arterial disease is a risk factor for venous thrombosis is inconclusive, arterial disease does appear to occur with a modestly increased frequency in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism. Reported odds ratios in such patients were 1.2 for myocardial infarction, 1.3 for stroke, 2.3 for carotid plaque, and 4.3 for coronary calcification. Of note, in persons under age 40 with unprovoked venous thrombosis, the odds ratio for acute myocardial infarction was as high as 3.9. In general, however, venous disease is considered to be a weak risk factor for arterial thrombosis, and the use of agents specifically targeted to the prevention of heart attack or stroke in the majority of persons with VTE cannot be recommended at present.

### Digital twin integrating clinical, morphological and hemodynamic data to identify stroke risk factors [^13c1a60b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, comprising 11.6% of all deaths in 2019. Ischemic stroke is the most frequent subtype and occurs when a blood vessel supplying the brain is blocked by a blood clot or thrombus, resulting in neurological death. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and one of the major risk factors of ischemic stroke; in AF patients, thrombus are formed inside the left atrium (LA), which may embolize to the brain. The main site of thrombus formation is the left atrial appendage (LAA), a sack-like structure protruding from the LA cavity. The pathophysiology of thrombus formation in AF is multi-faceted and complex. The Virchow's triad indicates that the main factors of thrombus formation are multi-domain, including blood stasis, hyper-coagulability states, and endothelial dysfunction. Classical models relate the ineffective contraction of the atrium during AF to blood stasis, favoring thrombus formation inside the LA, whilst more recent models advocate for an interplay between AF-caused abnormal atrial contractility, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in LA structure, as well as blood coagulability properties.

The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score is the standard clinical tool for thrombus risk assessment. It focuses on comorbidities and demographic factors such as age and sex. However, it does not consider specific LA morphological and hemodynamic characteristics, which may improve stroke risk classification –. For instance, several studies have reported associations between LA/LAA morphological factors with LA stasis and thrombosis –.

Digital twins (DTs) are defined as the dynamic integration and augmentation of patient data using mechanistic models and statistical models. In stroke, DTs can support clinical decisions in different medical fields (e.g. neurology, cardiology) such as a more effective identification of risk factors in relation to thrombus formation. A comprehensive stroke DT should cover multiple organs and systems along the heart-brain axis, including blood flow and thrombosis models in the left heart, carotid arteries, and cerebral circulation with brain perfusion, metabolism, and cerebrospinal fluid models.

### Atrial fibrillation and the prothrombotic state: revisiting virchow's triad in 2020 [^839d3476]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterised by an increased risk of pathological thrombus formation due to a disruption of physiological haemostatic mechanisms that are better understood by reference to Virchow's triad of 'abnormal blood constituents', 'vessel wall abnormalities' and 'abnormal blood flow'. First, there is increased activation of the coagulation cascade, platelet reactivity and impaired fibrinolysis as a result of AF per se, and these processes are amplified with pre-existing comorbidities. Several prothrombotic biomarkers including platelet factor 4, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, β-thromboglobulin and D-dimer have been implicated in this process. Second, structural changes such as atrial fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction are linked to the development of AF which promote further atrial remodelling, thereby providing a suitable platform for clot formation and subsequent embolisation. Third, these factors are compounded by the presence of reduced blood flow secondary to dilatation of cardiac chambers and loss of atrial systole which have been confirmed using various imaging techniques. Overall, an improved understanding of the various factors involved in thrombus formation will allow better clinical risk stratification and targeted therapies in AF.

### The link between cancer and venous thromboembolism: a review [^55fe6d35]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer is the most important acquired but often overlooked risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Tumors can express procoagulant proteins, for example, and tumor masses may compromise venous blood flow by extrinsic compression of adjacent vessels. Cancers can also induce the production of inflammatory cytokines that indirectly contribute to the development of hypercoagulability and the risk of thromboembolism. Additional risk factors for VTE experienced by patients with cancer include immobilization, because of cancer or its treatment, and the potential presence of thrombophilic genetic factors. Many common therapeutic modalities also increase VTE risk, including surgery, chemotherapy agents, adjuvant hormonal manipulation, the use of angiogenesis inhibitors, and the presence of central venous access devices. The risk of VTE seems to be greater with certain tumor types, such as cancers of the pancreas, kidney, or brain. The value of extensive screening of patients with the first episode of idiopathic thromboembolism for the presence of an occult malignancy remains debatable at this time. VTE continues to pose a substantial risk to patients with cancer because of a variety of tumor-, host-, and therapy-related factors.

### Von Willebrand factor, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease [^5c1fdece]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein involved in arterial thrombus formation, is released into the circulation by secretion from endothelial cells. Plasma VWF levels are determined by genetic factors including ABO blood groups and VWF mutations, and by non-genetic factors including aging, impaired nitric oxide production, inflammation, free radical production and diabetes. Plasma VWF levels have been proposed as a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Although they are only weakly associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population, they are a more promising CHD risk factor in high-risk populations with previous cardiovascular events, diabetes or old age. However, is it still unclear whether VWF levels directly determine the rate and severity of arterial thrombus formation or whether they merely reflect alteration in other endothelial functions. The future status of VWF levels as a cardiovascular risk factor depends on additional studies on the genetic determinants of both VWF levels and cardiovascular outcomes. Further studies on VWF levels as a predictor of the risk of stroke (rather than CHD) in elderly or other high-risk population are also promising. Such studies could lead to the clinical use of plasma VWF levels to refine the estimation of the cardiovascular risk and of the expected benefit of antithrombotic agents.

### Clonal hematopoiesis and thrombosis [^4b296419]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases, particularly thromboembolic events, have a high incidence and rank among the leading health issues and are increasingly problematic in developing countries. Not only are classic arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), such as myocardial infarction or stroke a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, but also venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), has a relevant burden of disease and impact on the healthcare system. Approximately 40% of VTE events are considered unprovoked due to an unknown underlying cause, highlighting the need to identify new risk factors to better understand the etiology and develop further preventive strategies.

This review aims to give an overview and summarize data on the association of CH with thrombosis on a clinical, preclinical, as well as translational level. Furthermore, the different mechanisms proposed to causally link CH and thrombosis will be discussed.

### Diabetes induces remodeling of the left atrial appendage independently of atrial fibrillation in a rodent model of type-2 diabetes [^0a339fed]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic patients have a high prevalence of heart disease and a predisposition to thromboembolic events originating from the heart, leading to stroke and transient ischemic events. Diabetes is also a powerful and independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation, the most common predisposing factor to arterial emboli of cardiac origin. The arterial emboli during atrial fibrillation originate in the majority of cases from the LAA.

The LAA, an anatomical structure pouching out of the LA of the heart, is distinct embryonically and anatomically from the atrium. It acts as a "decompression" chamber during left ventricular systole, when atrial pressure is high. The anatomical location and shape of the LAA favor stasis of blood and thrombus formation, predisposing to thromboembolic events during atrial fibrillation.

In the diabetic patients, what is the contribution of the LAA to the predisposition to thromboembolic events? The high incidence of atrial fibrillation in diabetics appears to be a major inciting factor, and yet additional factors may be involved. Yosefy et al. recently studied a cohort of patients in atrial fibrillation and reported in diabetics, but not in non-diabetics, the occurrence of remodeling of the LAA, which increases the risk for clot formation and thromboembolism. Remodeling of the LAA has previously been attributed to atrial fibrillation. Does diabetes by itself predispose to LAA remodeling, unrelated to atrial fibrillation? This question could not be answered in Yosefy's study, as both diabetic and non-diabetic groups were in atrial fibrillation. Other studies focusing on the LAA have also been carried out primarily in patients with atrial fibrillation. Little in fact is known on the effects of diabetes on the structure and function of the LAA.

To determine the contribution of diabetes to LAA remodeling, an important predisposing factor to clot formation and thromboembolism, we studied the heart structure and function in an animal model in sinus rhythm during the evolution of diabetes. We reasoned that if we were to detect LAA remodeling in the animal model during the course of the development of diabetes, such finding would support a causal relationship between remodeling of the appendage and diabetes, dissociate remodeling from atrial fibrillation and establish an experimental platform for investigating the mechanisms involved as well as for testing novel preventive and/or therapeutic measures for the diabetic heart in humans.

Our study hypothesis was that in the diabetic animal with a normal sinus rhythm, structural changes in the LAA occur during the development of diabetes, and that they are causally associated with diabetes and not necessarily related to atrial fibrillation.

### The risk factors for deep venous thrombosis in critically ill older adult patients: a subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, observational study [^d68ff51c]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. Patients who develop DVT commonly have risk factors, such as active cancer, trauma, major surgery, hospitalization, immobilization, pregnancy, or oral contraceptive use. An unprovoked DVT can be idiopathic or result from inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states, such as cancer and pregnancy. The number of adults with venous thromboembolic events (such as DVT) in the United States is projected to more than double by 2050, and it was reported that the annual prevalence of venous thromboembolic events increased with age. Patients hospitalized at intensive care units (ICUs) are at an even higher risk of DVT, mainly due to their clinical presentation and factors associated with an ICU admission, such as prolonged immobility, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade to facilitate ventilation. To date, few studies focused on DVT in older adult patients, especially in critically ill older adult patients. Engbers et al. found the annual incidence of venous thromboembolic events (such as DVT) in older adult patients to be about eight times higher than that in patients under 50 years old. Huang et al. reported the incidence of DVT sharply increased among those older than 75 years old. Some studies demonstrated that the prevalence of DVT during ICU stay was about 7.3%.

Reduced blood flow caused by prolonged periods of inactivity, especially in older adult subjects, long hospitalizations due to illness, pregnancy, and long-distance travel with limited movements, such as air travel, are associated with increased risk of DVT. Similarly, individuals with increased levels of clotting factors in the circulation resulting from diseases, medications, or inherited traits, have an increased risk of DVT. The risk of DVT is associated with an elevation in the blood fibrinogen level (hyperfibrinogenemia), as well as abnormal fibrin clot structure and function. Compared with individuals with normal circulating fibrinogen levels, individuals with higher fibrinogen levels (> 4 g/L) were 2-fold more disposed to experience DVT, and this was significant in older patients. According to the above-mentioned risk factors, it can be inferred that the majority of patients in the ICU are particularly vulnerable to DVT because of immobility, critical conditions (e.g. trauma or surgery), multiple invasive procedures, and inflammation. It is noteworthy that a DVT event in vulnerable patients with a history of trauma or surgery can lead to poor outcomes.

### COVID-19, thromboembolic risk, and virchow's triad: lesson from the past [^69d6f1f8]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

On balance, COVID‐19, the pandemic disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, is increasingly being recognized as a systemic thrombotic illness with systemic activation of the coagulation cascade and secondary DIC as well. It causes multi‐organ involvement, which dramatically worsen patients' outcome.

Hypercoagulability is probably the reason why many investigators worldwide are suggesting prophylactic use of pharmacological agents against thrombosis — at a very high‐dose — in COVID‐19 patients especially those who are very sick, even in the absence of evidence from randomized clinical trials. 34

We suggest that the three components of the classic Virchow's triad are the basis of thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients.

### Simulated hypergravity activates hemostasis in healthy volunteers [^46cc0be5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In healthy people, hypergravity augments blood coagulability within physiological limits through increased red blood cell adherence, endothelial cell activation, increased viscoelasticity, and augmented platelet reactivity. For example, thrombin‐antithrombin complex concentrations increased only from 2.2 to 2.5 ng/mL. The response may be partly compensated by elevated levels of coagulation inhibitors. Furthermore, venous pooling in the dependent part of the body may produce venous stasis and increased intravascular pressure. Thus, hypergravity affects all components of Virchow's triad, which could predispose to thrombus formation (Figure 4). Yet, whether the modest response may increase thromboembolic risk in people exposed to hypergravity stays highly speculative. Previous studies of the economy class syndrome suggested that modest alterations in classical coagulation factors may promote thromboembolic risk. 44, 45 The relevance of this issue for governmental and touristic spaceflight should be pursued in further adequately powered studies. To uncover whether subsets of indivduals with extreme hemostatic responses to hypergravity exist should be a priority. Initiatives to fly tourists to the International Space Station and the development of commercial spaceflight programs will lead to an increasing number of individuals exposed to hypergravity. Only recently, the first 2 cases of venous thromboembolism during a space mission have been reported. 46 To date, only ≈600 highly selected and trained individuals at a considerably young age have flown into space with no fatal thromboembolic event but this may lack generalizability. 47 Space tourists, in contrast, will be less well selected, older, and less fit compared with professional astronauts, and a medical history of minor to moderate thromboembolic or cardiovascular disease will most likely not disqualify them from flight.

### Risk and risk factors associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism following surgery in patients with history of venous thromboembolism [^9f699eb6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Clinical Implications and Future Research Perspective

To our knowledge, this is the first study that gives detailed information on absolute recurrence risks of VTE following various types of surgery in combination with patient characteristics. Our results indicate that there is much heterogeneity in risk dependent on these factors. Given that VTE is the most preventable death in hospitals, and 60% of VTE cases occur during or following hospitalization, it is important to acknowledge the high recurrence risks associated with surgery when a patient has a history of VTE.

Contemporary guidelines for surgical patients advise clinicians to provide thromboprophylaxis therapy after most procedures, although the treatment duration is debated. Frequently, a distinction is made between high- and low-risk surgical patients, based on the procedure itself and a patient's comorbidities. A history of VTE will almost always warrant thromboprophylactic therapy after any surgical intervention. For instance, according to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline on thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients, virtually all patients with a history of VTE who undergo surgery are to be treated with thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated (eg, high bleeding risk). Only young patients with a history of VTE who undergo minor surgery can be withheld from prophylactic therapy. Similarly, in the UK guidelines on prevention of VTE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), it is advised to offer VTE prophylaxis for 5 to 7 days for all patients undergoing gastrointestinal, gynecological, thoracic, or urologic surgery who are at increased risk (which includes patients with a history of VTE).

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^8d4abdbb]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Thrombophilias

Thrombophilic factors predisposing to thromboembolic events are associated with both sporadic miscarriages and RM and can be hereditary or acquired. It is suggested that the association is caused by an increased risk of thrombus formation in the nascent placental vessels resulting in placenta infarctions. Hereditary factors include deficiency of antithrombin, protein C and protein S or carriage of the factor V Leiden or factor II (G20210A) gene mutations. Acquired factors include the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant or anti-cardiolipin antibodies, which are deemed to be present when identified in repeated samples taken 3 months apart and outwith pregnancy. Hyperhomocysteinemia can be both hereditary and acquired. There is some evidence from two non-blinded randomized controlled trials that treatment with low-dose heparin and aspirin during pregnancy increases the chance of live birth in RM patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies. There is no evidence that anticoagulation therapy will improve the prognosis for RM patients with hereditary thrombophilias or no thrombophilia factors at all, and results from relevant ongoing randomized controlled trials are awaited (for example, the ALIFE2 study). Therapy with high-dose folate will lower plasma homocysteine levels but there is no evidence from clinical trials whether this decreases the risk of a new miscarriage.

### Potential role of atrial myopathy in the pathogenesis of stroke in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis: a conceptual framework and implications for prophylaxis [^f8e5df8f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Is Atrial Fibrillation the Cause of Increased Risk of Stroke in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis?

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important risk factor for the occurrence of stroke in the general community. Is it possible that both RA and psoriasis increase the risk of stroke because the 2 disorders promote the development of AF?

Increased Risk of AF in RA and Psoriasis

Systemic inflammation predicts the occurrence of AF in the community. 22 Not surprisingly, RA increases the incidence of AF by 25% to 50%, 23, 24, 25 and this risk is evident even after adjustment for risk factors for AF (eg, hypertension). 24 There is a strong parallelism between the incidence of AF and that of stroke in patients with RA in epidemiological studies. 26 Analogously, psoriasis increases the incidence of AF by 25% to 50% 21, 27, 28; the risk is particularly apparent in those who are younger and have clinically severe disease and is accompanied by an increased risk of systemic thromboembolism. 16, 29, 30 The development of AF may represent an extension of the systemic inflammatory process to the atria. 4

Is There a Causal Relation Between AF and the Occurrence of Stroke?

Is the increase in stroke in patients with RA and psoriasis related to the increased incidence of AF? Physicians have long believed that the chaotic contraction that is characteristic of AF drives thrombus formation; however, it is the decreased flow velocity in the LA attributable to an underlying atrial myopathy that predisposes to thromboembolization, 31 explaining why mitral regurgitation protects against the stasis of blood in the LA even though it increases the risk of AF by promoting LA dilatation. 32 The inflammatory and fibrotic process in the LA is a primary determinant of the impairment of the chamber's conduit functions, even in the absence of AF 33; in addition, inflammation and fibrosis may directly enhance the thrombogenicity of the atrial endocardium. 34 Accordingly, atrial fibrosis predisposes to the occurrence of LA thrombus formation and stroke, independently of LA chamber size. 35

For example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis have 50% to 100% increase in the risk of ischemic stroke, but the magnitude of the increased risk rises to 3‐fold if afflicted individuals are aged < 65 years. 76 Importantly, the increase in stroke risk greatly exceeds that predicted by the presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but instead, parallels the clinical severity and duration of the arthritic disease and the intensity of systemic inflammation. 8, 77 Similarly, the risk of stroke in AF‐linked metabolic disorders (eg, metabolic syndrome or non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease) is greater than can be accounted for by changes in blood pressure, serum cholesterol, or body weight, but appears to be closely linked to biomarkers of systemic inflammation (ie, C‐reactive protein). 78, 79

So, is the increased risk of stroke in systemic inflammatory disorders related to the AF or to the underlying inflammation‐related atrial myopathy? Physicians have long believed that the chaotic contraction of AF drives thrombus formation; however, it is the decreased flow velocity in the left atrium attributable to an underlying atrial myopathy that predisposes to thromboembolization, explaining why mitral regurgitation protects against the stasis of blood in the left atrium even though it increases the risk of AF by promoting LA dilatation. 80 The inflammatory and fibrotic process in the left atrium is a primary determinant of the impairment of the chamber's conduit functions, even in the absence of AF; in addition, inflammation and fibrosis may directly enhance the thrombogenicity of the atrial endocardium. Accordingly, atrial fibrosis predisposes to the occurrence of LA thrombus formation and stroke, independently of LA chamber size. 81

### Inferior vena cava agenesis: a rare cause of deep vein thrombosis [^87e01021]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

The assessment and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is seen in a variety of primary and secondary care settings. With an annual incidence of 1–2 per 1000 in the general population of the UK, virtually all clinicians can expect to see this condition in their practice. A variety of risk factors contribute to the formation of a venous thrombus which adhere to the Virchow's triad principle of clot formation. Since the presence of a DVT can lead to the sequelae of pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially life-threatening migration of thrombus from the clot formation site to the pulmonary arteries via the right heart, prompt identification and treatment is paramount to improve outcomes for patients. The initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy represents the cornerstone of DVT management, with follow-up arrangements to investigate for the presence of important underlying conditions, including malignancy, thrombophilia and genetic risk factors.

### Procoagulant activity in hemostasis and thrombosis: virchow's triad revisited [^396f8789]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Virchow's triad is traditionally invoked to explain pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to thrombosis, alleging concerted roles for abnormalities in blood composition, vessel wall components, and blood flow in the development of arterial and venous thrombosis. Given the tissue-specific bleeding observed in hemophilia patients, it may be instructive to consider the principles of Virchow's triad when investigating mechanisms operant in hemostatic disorders as well. Blood composition (the function of circulating blood cells and plasma proteins) is the most well studied component of the triad. For example, increased levels of plasma procoagulant proteins such as prothrombin and fibrinogen are established risk factors for thrombosis, whereas deficiencies in plasma factors VIII and IX result in bleeding (hemophilia A and B, respectively). Vessel wall (cellular) components contribute adhesion molecules that recruit circulating leukocytes and platelets to sites of vascular damage, tissue factor, which provides a procoagulant signal of vascular breach, and a surface upon which coagulation complexes are assembled. Blood flow is often characterized by 2 key variables: shear rate and shear stress. Shear rate affects several aspects of coagulation, including transport rates of platelets and plasma proteins to and from the injury site, platelet activation, and the kinetics of fibrin monomer formation and polymerization. Shear stress modulates adhesion rates of platelets and expression of adhesion molecules and procoagulant activity on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. That no one abnormality in any component of Virchow's triad fully predicts coagulopathy a priori suggests coagulopathies are complex, multifactorial, and interactive. In this review, we focus on contributions of blood composition, vascular cells, and blood flow to hemostasis and thrombosis, and suggest that cross-talk among the 3 components of Virchow's triad is necessary for hemostasis and determines propensity for thrombosis or bleeding. Investigative models that permit interplay among these components are necessary to understand the operant pathophysiology, and effectively treat and prevent thrombotic and bleeding disorders.

### Dysfibrinogenemia and thrombosis [^71ed34b7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the state of the art relating to congenital dysfibrinogenemia as a potential risk factor for thrombosis, as reflected by the medical literature and the consensus opinion of recognized experts in the field, and to make recommendations for the use of laboratory assays for assessing this thrombotic risk in individual patients.

Data Sources

Review of the medical literature, primarily from the last 10 years.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

After an initial assessment of the literature, key points were identified. Experts were assigned to do an in-depth review of the literature and to prepare a summary of their findings and recommendations. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated to every participant in the College of American Pathologists Conference on Diagnostic Issues in Thrombophilia. Each of the key points and associated recommendations were then presented for discussion at the conference. Recommendations were accepted if a consensus of experts attending the conference was reached. The results of the discussion were used to revise the manuscript into its final form.

Conclusions

Consensus was reached on 5 conclusions and 2 recommendations concerning the use of testing for dysfibrinogens in the assessment of thrombotic risk in individual patients. Detailed discussion of the rationale for each of these recommendations is found in the text of this article. Compared with the other, more common hereditary thrombophilias, dysfibrinogenemia encompasses a diverse group of defects with varied clinical expressions. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is a relatively rare cause of thrombophilia. Therefore, routine testing for this disorder is not recommended as part of the laboratory evaluation of a thrombophilic patient. This is an evolving area of research, and further clinical studies may change these recommendations in the future.

### Digital twin integrating clinical, morphological and hemodynamic data to identify stroke risk factors [^cd9818ca]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The development of left atrial digital twins is vital for improving stroke treatment and prevention in patients with AF. In this paper, we integrate multi-modal data (i.e. demographics, blood biomarkers and LA morphology) with indices from mechanistic models based on CFD simulations of LA blood flow, to develop digital twins of the left atrium in a cohort of severely diseased AF patients with a large proportion of history of thrombus. We explored patient phenogroups across different combinations of clinical, morphological, and circulatory domains to uncover their interrelations. A clinical interpretation of the resulting phenogroups was conducted, focusing on the proportion of patients in each group with a history of thrombus formation.

Our findings demonstrate that integrating all three domains enhances patient stratification based on past thrombus formation, highlighting factors that may contribute to an increased risk of thrombus formation in severely diseased patients. Not using the clinical label of past thrombus formation to guide patient stratification, allowed the model to explore the underlying data structure and consider subclinical thrombus formation within the obtained phenogroups. Although strong relationships were found between morphological factors and simulated hemodynamic parameters (Supplementary Table 9), incorporating in-silico hemodynamic indices was essential for stratifying patients by thrombus history, and underscores the importance of physics-based models to understand blood stasis in AF patients. While prior studies have endeavoured to identify risk factors of thrombus formation, we propose that the analysis of thrombus formation must be approached from a multi-domain perspective, considering clinical patient characteristics, LA shape and anatomical information, and blood flow information.

Regarding preventative measures for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to thrombophilia testing for minor provoking factors, ASH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining testing for the known thrombophilia in patients with a first-degree family history of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency but no family history of VTE and having a minor provoking risk factor for VTE. Consider administering thromboprophylaxis in patients with thrombophilia.

Obesity and hypoxia — The three major risk factors for thrombus formation are described by Virchow's triad (venous stasis, endothelial injury, and increased coagulability); hypoxia is both a cause and an effect of thrombosis, occurring when reduced blood flow or compression from body fat mass leads to hypercoagulability and thrombosis, while impaired oxygenation triggers inflammatory and prothrombotic pathways and alters blood rheology by increasing hemoglobin/hematocrit, viscosity, and impairing flow, thus increasing thrombosis risk, and in short may be both a consequence of vascular occlusion and a stimulus for thrombogenesis.

Some of these recommendations introduce the potential for change in clinical practice and therefore deserve some additional consideration. First, the recommendations are all conditional, based mostly on patient preferences and values attached to relevant outcomes. We do acknowledge that conditional recommendations might be less appealing than strong ones to be applied to most patients and that applying conditional recommendations will require the education of patients and physicians to effectively elicit those preferences and appropriately use them for shared decision making. However, risk stratification is necessary to accomplish individualized optimal treatment, which makes our panel stand behind the present deliberations. Second, some of the recommendations may appear counterintuitive: for example, one may feel that it is inappropriate to test young people with COC-related VTE or patients with VTE provoked by transient nonsurgical risk factors, as their risk is generally considered too low for them to be candidates for lifelong treatment if they have thrombophilia. Against this uneasiness, we invite the reader to consider how reluctant one can be to treat a young patient with unprovoked VTE for life. These patients are not the majority of people enrolled in clinical trials, so we have little direct evidence about the need to treat them for life, yet that is the recommended approach. Furthermore, one would realize that cases of VTE related to COCs or nonsurgical risk factors are relatively few compared with the many more exposed to the same risk factors, and it is likely that a fraction of them might have a relevant provoking cofactor represented by thrombophilia. Others might be worried by the cost associated with testing for thrombophilia; for them, we note that irrespective of whether thrombophilia testing results will be used to start or withhold treatment, the cost of testing is negligible compared with the cost of lifelong anticoagulation (which we considered in our process), likely even after including indirect costs stemming from the treatment of additional events in untreated patients (which we did not consider). Finally, someone might be confused by having "divergent" recommendations for the same condition (thrombosis at unusual sites) depending on the standard of care adopted in a specific setting, whereby testing for thrombophilia is recommended to prolong treatment where the standard of care is short-term treatment duration and not recommended when the standard of care is long-term treatment for everyone. Under the perspective of choosing the best management option for patients with thrombophilia, patients with thrombophilia will indeed receive indefinite treatment because of both recommendations (because of testing in 1 case and regardless of testing in the other). Again, this is the result of a robust, pragmatic, and logical process that assessed the value of testing within the context in which the results of testing will be used.

COVID-19 thrombosis risk and prophylaxis background — These guidelines consistently recommend that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (excluding pregnant women) should receive at least prophylactic-dose anticoagulation to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). The increased risk of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic or thrombophilic state resulting from multiple mechanisms, and in a recent large cohort study, COVID-19 was associated with substantially increased incidence of both VTE and arterial thromboses.

### Digital twin integrating clinical, morphological and hemodynamic data to identify stroke risk factors [^4d77707b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This descriptive study underscores the importance of integrating clinical, morphological and hemodynamic data to gain deeper insights into the combination of factors linked to thrombus formation in severely diseased patients. It also highlights the potential of unsupervised machine learning techniques in the analysis of thrombus formation, by facilitating multi-domain data integration and phenogroup exploration. Identifying individuals at higher risk of thrombus formation (i.e. high risk phenotypes) before the LAAO intervention can support clinical decision-making, by implementing closer patient monitoring and guiding the personalization of anticoagulation therapy, particularly given the contraindications to oral anticoagulants in this population. Morphological and hemodynamic information is crucial in the study of thrombus formation. Our initial results show that certain morphological factors (low ostium dimensions, atrial remodelling and LAA tortuosity), including PV configuration (low alignment of LAA to LSPV) influence LA hemodynamics by reducing LAA stasis, and could potentially be protective in patients with pro-thrombotic clinical phenogroups. Further work should be performed on exploiting the presented multi-domain data integration pipeline to develop novel thrombus risk scores or predictive models.

### Inherited thrombophilias [^fcd2b1e0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Many inherited thrombophilias have been detected and the pathophysiologic insight has increased tremendously during the last decades. Despite, however, the overwhelming observational evidence on the association between inherited thrombophilia and several women's health issues, including VTE, thus far the implications for clinical practice are uncertain. Although there is firm epidemiologic evidence that is helpful in counseling women who have inherited thrombophilia to prevent a first or recurrent VTE, the uncertainty is particularly present for women who have other pregnancy complications, such as recurrent pregnancy loss and pre-eclampsia. For this group, well-designed placebo-controlled trials to assess the harm-benefit ratio are urgently needed.

### Cancer-associated thrombosis [^4ba13b35]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events are common in patients with malignancy, producing both morbidity and mortality. Although the underlying mechanisms by which cancer might promote a procoagulant state are multifaceted and incompletely understood, recent translational research has significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between cancer and thrombosis. The occurrence of a thromboembolic event in a patient with an active malignancy should be regarded as a life-threatening complication, and decisions regarding prevention and treatment are usually complex. Outcomes may be improved by an evidence-based approach to management with consideration of practice guidelines.

### Cancer and the prothrombotic state [^a0ca27bf]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Thrombosis is a frequent complication of cancer, so it follows that the presence of a tumour confers a prothrombotic state. Indeed, in patients with cancer, each of the three components of Virchow's triad that predispose for thrombus formation have abnormalities, thus fulfilling the requirement for a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state. The many signs and symptoms of the prothrombotic state in cancer range from asymptomatic basic abnormal coagulation tests to massive clinical thromboembolism, when the patient may be gravely ill. Many procoagulant factors, such as tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, are secreted by or are expressed at the cell surface of many tumours. Platelet turnover and activity are also increased. Damaged endothelium and abnormalities of blood flow in cancer also seem to play a part, as does abnormal tumour angiogenesis. Some studies have even suggested that these abnormalities may be related to long-term prognosis and treatment. We briefly describe the various clinical manifestations of thrombosis in cancer and discuss the evidence for the existence of a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state associated with this disease. Further work is needed to examine the mechanisms leading to the prothrombotic state in cancer, the potential prognostic and treatment implications, and the possible value of quantifying indices of hypercoagulability in clinical practice.

### Inherited thrombophilia in children [^0a8aa2c8]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2013). Low credibility.

Thrombosis in children has multiple etiologies, including inherited disorders such as factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin 20210A mutation, and deficiencies in protein C, S, or antithrombin. Epidemiology of the disorders varies, as does the risk of thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism is the typical presentation. However, more severe anticoagulant protein deficiencies may present with purpura fulminans. Treatment of thrombosis is relatively uniform, regardless of the underlying genetic risk factor. In this article, we discuss the most well-studied inherited thrombophilias and the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and relative thrombotic risk of each. Treatment of thrombosis is also briefly reviewed.

Thrombotic and Bleeding Risk in Patients With Cancer

Patients with cancer are at an increased risk for thrombotic events, both arterial and venous. Tumor-, patient-, and treatment-related factors all play a role in the thrombophilic state of malignancy. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a well-known and common complication of cancer and cancer therapy, occurring in 20% to 25% of all patients with cancer. The occurrence of VTE in patients with cancer also portends a worse prognosis, with patients who have had VTE having a 4-fold increase in risk for death compared with patients without VTE. Several patient-, treatment-, and tumor-related factors affect the risk for VTE in cancer. Additionally, interruption of anticoagulation for procedures or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia has been described to increase thrombotic complications in patients with cancer. New risk factors for VTE, including tumor genetics and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, are being described and may improve the risk/benefit ratio of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis.

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology of cancer-associated thrombosis [^e75dfa83]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Consensus statement

Venous thromboembolism is a common occurrence within the cancer population, and the thrombotic risk due to the tumour itself is further increased by cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and surgery. However, the cancer population is markedly heterogeneous, with a broad array of histologies, stages, and therapeutic interventions. Consequently, the risk for VTE varies among patients with cancer. Thus, priority should be placed on the development of a cancer-specific risk assessment tool to identify those who would benefit most from thromboprophylaxis. There is very little evidence to inform the use of thromboprophylaxis in the ambulant, non-hospitalised cancer patients, particularly those receiving chemotherapy. This area is in need of additional investigation.

As imaging techniques improve, asymptomatic small-volume VTE is being diagnosed more frequently in staging scans. There is little evidence to guide best management in this situation; for example, whether these events should be treated – or if left untreated, there is little evidence to suggest that it affects outcome. This clearly warrants further investigation, although it may pose practical and ethical challenges in terms of study design.

### Guidelines for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism among patients with cancer [^68028fdb]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The association between cancer and thrombosis has been recognized for more than 150 years. Not only are patients with cancer at a substantially increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), the link between several coagulation factors and tumor growth, invasion, and the development of metastases has been established. Reported rates of VTE in patients with cancer have increased in recent years likely reflecting, in part, improved diagnosis with sophisticated imaging techniques as well as the impact of more aggressive cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Various therapeutic interventions, such as surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapeutic strategies as well as the frequent use of indwelling catheters and other invasive procedures also place cancer patients at increased risk of VTE. The increasing risk of VTE, the multitude of risk factors, and the greater risk of VTE recurrence and death among patients with cancer represent considerable challenges in modern clinical oncology. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) originally developed guidelines for VTE in patients with cancer in 2007. ASCO recently updated clinical practice guidelines on the treatment and prevention of VTE in patients with cancer following an extensive systematic review of the literature. Revised 2013 guidelines have now been presented and will be discussed in this review. Although several new studies were identified and considered, many important questions remain regarding the relationship between thrombosis and cancer and the optimal care of patients at risk for VTE.

### Immune factors in deep vein thrombosis initiation [^40d2ee4e]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

DVT: A Global Health Problem

DVT and its major complication, pulmonary embolism (PE), designated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are one of the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. VTE is the third most common cardiovascular pathology by its prevalence after myocardial infarction and stroke, with about 900 000 cases and 300 000 deaths in the US annually. Surprisingly, the prevalence and mortality of VTE has not substantially decreased over 30 years despite progress in diagnostic and prophylactic modalities. DVT develops in deep veins, usually, but not exclusively, in legs, causing pain, redness, swelling, and impaired gait. If the thrombus is unstable, it can become detached and travel to the lungs, where it occludes pulmonary circulation causing PE. In contrast to arterial thrombosis, whose mechanisms have been intensively investigated, DVT remains largely terra incognita, which inspired the American Surgeon General to issue a Call to Action to stimulate research of venous thrombosis.

### Post-transplant biliary complications: advances in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^55fbd810]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Biliary stones, sludge, and casts

Bile duct filling defects (BDFDs) like biliary sludge, casts, and stones are another important biliary complication post-LT, occurring in about 3%–6% of patients.BDFDs can occur with any physiological process that slows the flow of bile leading to an increase in viscosity. The slow flow of bile can lead to formation of a cast or stone composed of bilirubin, collagen, bile acids, cellular debris, and cholesterol. Thus, any aetiology that slows bile flow (eg, biliary strictures, ischaemia, infection, cellular rejection, and medications) can predispose to sludge, casts, and stones. Biliary strictures are a particularly important risk factor for BDFDs; up to 45% of patients with BDFD have a concurrent stricture. Strictures often arise as a result of ischaemic injury to bile duct mucosa (eg, hepatic artery thrombus, 'cold' time during the transplant, or surgical technique). Similarly, infections and acute cellular rejection predispose to BDFDs because they disrupt bile duct epithelial cells. Any medication that causes cholestasis can predispose to BDFDs. For example, ciclosporin inhibits bile salt secretion, which induces cholestasis and thereby increases risk of BDFDs. In terms of BDFD risk based on type of anastomosis, one older study suggested that there was a slightly increased risk with choledochojejunostomy. Subsequent studies failed to show any difference in risk of BDFDs based on type of anastomosis.

Bile casts are dark and hard in appearance and formed by lithogenic material confined to the bile duct dimensions. Casts occur most frequently in the common hepatic and right and left main intrahepatic ducts. They were first described after LT in the late 1970s when patients presented with multiple intrahepatic biliary strictures leading to large casts. As with bile duct stones, the major risk factor is ischaemia, in particular the amount of 'warm' time compared with 'cold' time. Additionally, if T-tubes and internal stents do not pass into the small bowel after the biliary anastomosis sutures dissolve, they can serve as a nidus for cast formation.

The diagnosis of BDFD relies on clinical factors such as abdominal pain and more objective data such as rise in liver enzymes, usually in a cholestatic pattern. These findings should prompt liver imaging to rule out a hepatic artery thrombus and to evaluate the biliary ducts. MRI is highly sensitive at identifying BDFDs. The characteristic finding is a high signal intensity.

### HFpEF is the substrate for stroke in obesity and diabetes independent of Atrial fibrillation [^c2980546]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are important risk factors for the development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and both disorders increase the risk of systemic thromboembolic events. Traditionally, the risk of stroke has been explained by the strong association of these disorders with atrial fibrillation (AF). However, adiposity and diabetes are risk factors for systemic thromboembolism, even in the absence of AF, because both can lead to the development of an inflammatory and fibrotic atrial and ventricular myopathy, the 2 major elements of HFpEF. Atrial myopathy: 1) exacerbates pulmonary venous hypertension and exertional dyspnea; 2) leads to decreased flow, thrombogenesis, and systemic thromboembolization; and 3) often clinically manifests as AF; however, the relationship between AF and thromboembolism is unclear. Atrial fibrosis predisposes to thrombus formation, even in the absence of AF, and most thromboembolic events bear a poor temporal relationship to the occurrence of AF, whereas HFpEF (and the accompanying atrial disease) predicts stroke in patients with or without AF. Furthermore, rhythm control does not reduce the risk of stroke, although it reduces the burden of AF. These observations support the primacy of atrial myopathy as a critical component of HFpEF, rather than AF, as the mediator of systemic thromboembolism in obesity or diabetes. The well-established association between AF and stroke is likely explained by the fact that AF is a biomarker of more advanced inflammatory atrial disease but not necessarily a direct causal mechanism.

### Effect of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on the risk of venous thromboembolism [^d0272f58]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes carries an increased risk of complications from arterial atherothrombosis. 1 Important mediators for this are hypertension, smoking and dyslipidaemia. Diabetes is also considered a proinflammatory condition that itself may directly predispose to atherothrombosis. 1 The inflammatory cascade is also integral to venous thromboembolism (VTE) but whether diabetes carries a greater risk of VTE is less clear.

Animal studies and pre‐clinical work in humans have highlighted several pathways, centred on coagulation and platelet reactivity, by which diabetes would plausibly predispose to VTE. 2 Diabetes is associated with increased tissue factor (TF) expression which activates thrombin, 3 converting fibrinogen into fibrin. Increased cellular synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) and fibrinogen, and reduced production of tissue plasminogen activator (t‐PA), will augment the developing fibrin structure. Up‐regulation of glycoproteins Ib and IIb/IIIa in people with diabetes triggers thrombus formation via interaction with von Willebrand Factor (vWF) and fibrin molecules. 1 Endothelial dysfunction will precipitate the rupture of the endothelium leading to the release of microparticles, which accelerate thrombus development through expression of procoagulant phospholipids. 4 Changes in plasma protein concentrations as well as plasma glucose levels lead to an increase in plasma viscosity in type 1 diabetes 5 and in type 2 diabetes. 6 The result is that thrombin generation (followed by measuring levels of the thrombin–antithrombin complex) is increased in individuals with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. 7, 8
